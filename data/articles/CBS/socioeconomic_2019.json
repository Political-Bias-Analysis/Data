            "article_content": "Former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, the latest candidate to join the historically large Democratic primary field, is already facing major headwinds in his last-minute quest for the presidency.\u00a0 But the number of undecided voters in early states could present a glimmer of hope for Patrick. Calling his bid a \"Hail Mary from two stadiums over,\" Patrick entered the 2020 contest last week.\u00a0 In less than three months, New Hampshire voters will cast their ballots in the nation's first Democratic presidential primary contest. According to a\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker released this week, only 23% of likely Democratic voters in the state said that they've \"definitely\" decided which candidate to support. In South Carolina, where the second primary contest will take place in 99 days, just a third of likely Democratic voters have definitively decided on their first choice for the nomination. \u00a0 The Massachusetts lawmaker \u2014 one of just two African Americans elected governor since Reconstruction \u2014 is expected to make a play for moderate voters in New Hampshire and South Carolina. On the first day of his campaign, Patrick argued that the current field of Democratic candidates had broken into \"sort of camps of nostalgia on the one hand, and big ideas \u2014 my way or no way \u2014 on the other.\" \"We're going to compete everywhere,\" Abe Rakov, Patrick's campaign manager, told CBS News. \"We're going to respect the calendar, respect the process, and respect the voters, even though we are coming in late.\" The Democratic primary currently has no clear frontrunner as the candidates struggle to effectively build coalitions across racial, ideological and socioeconomic divides. Still, 81% of Granite Staters surveyed by CBS News said they were \"generally satisfied\" with the candidates running before Patrick entered the race. In South Carolina, 79% of likely Democratic voters expressed satisfaction with the current field. New Hampshire has a history of rewarding candidates from neighboring states. Mitt Romney, John Kerry, Michael Dukakis and Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, Ed Muskie of Maine, and most recently, Bernie Sanders of Vermont have all won the state's primary in previous years.\u00a0 Rakov also argued that Patrick is not an unfamiliar face in New Hampshire.\u00a0 \"I think a lot of voters there know about the governor's record when he was governor here,\" he said. \"So that, obviously, is helpful from the start. Our volunteer base is in Massachusetts, so it's pretty easy to get to New Hampshire from there.\"\u00a0 Still, top Granite State Democrats question whether Patrick can capitalize on any geographical advantage in a race that already includes Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Laurie McCray, chairwoman of the Portsmouth Democrats, says Patrick will get a \"fair shake\" from voters. But she also expressed skepticism that Patrick \"has the same relationship with Democrats on the ground here as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders do.\"\u00a0 Sanders won the 2016 New Hampshire primary by over 20 points and currently boasts a 90 full-time staffers in the state, according to his campaign. Warren made her first campaign stop back in January, and has since returned two dozen times to court voters.\u00a0 \"I don't see what lane is empty,\" former New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Kathy Sullivan told CBS News. \"Every four years it seems somebody has to say they're unhappy with the Democratic field, but there's no new lane opened up by Deval Patrick or Michael Bloomberg.\" \"There's a challenge now in recruiting talent. Back in January, you would probably have gotten dozens of former Obama allies coming out for him because he's still beloved,\" Democratic Strategist Michael Ceraso argued.\u00a0 Ceraso, a former New Hampshire organizer for President Obama who has since worked for Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, said Patrick may sense an opening in the party for a candidate presenting an \"optimistic worldview\" reminiscent of Mr. Obama's.\u00a0 \"But is there an appetite for that in 2019?\" he said. \"That's the question. It's a long shot.\" It was a long shot in October of 2007, when Patrick stood before nearly 10,000 supporters in Boston Common to endorse Mr. Obama, then an underdog presidential candidate who trailed Hillary Clinton by 20 points in New Hampshire.\u00a0 \"You see, this election is not just about what we want but about who we are,\" Patrick said over a sea of blue \"Change we can believe in\" placards. \"I want a president who understands that. I want Barack Obama.\" The two men had both Chicago roots and Harvard Law degrees. They spoke with each other frequently, sharing both a worldview and Democratic consultant, political ad maker David Axelrod. Their words were so similar, in fact, that political opponents\u00a0claimed Mr. Obama plagiarized the Massachusetts governor\u00a0on more than one occasion.\u00a0 Mr. Obama was not in the room as Patrick launched his campaign in New Hampshire, but his name surfaced several times during a recent press conference. \"The president and I were friends for 15 years before he was president,\" Patrick remarked. \"And we remain friends.\" Democratic strategist Michael Cuzzi, who was then New Hampshire Political Director for Barack Obama, took Deval Patrick canvassing door to door for the Illinois Senator in 2007. Audiences found Patrick \"progressive\" and \"engaging,\" Cuzzi told CBS News, noting that Boston TV markets spanning the southern tier of New Hampshire made Patrick a familiar figure in the state when he was governor.\u00a0 \"Having said that, I struggle to find a rationale for why he breaks out of the current field,\" Cuzzi said. In over a dozen discussions with CBS News, New Hampshire voters recognized Patrick's name, but failed to see how his candidacy might add to an already crowded field.\u00a0 Stanley Horton of Henniker has already seen ten presidential candidates in person this year. \"It's a little frustrating, to be honest. I think we're at the point where we're trying to winnow the field, and they keep adding.\"\u00a0 \"I do like Deval Patrick a lot,\" Horton added. \"I think he has a shot.\" \"You know, if they want to give it a try, why not?\" New Hampshire State Representative Rod Pimintel shrugged. \"I know of Deval because he was in the state next door. He's got a lot of good ideas. He thinks he can break through? More power to him.\" Conversations with South Carolina lawmakers and community leaders reveal a split on whether it's too late for Patrick to throw his hat in the ring. The top cited concerns include doubts that Patrick will have enough time to organize and build name recognition in a state where some campaigns have already been on the ground for five months. \"Deval Patrick is known but I don't see how that would change the scope of things,\" said Charleston NAACP chapter first vice president Joe Darby. \"I don't see how he would get much traction at this point in time.\" \"Since he's a governor who has executive experience that may play well for some voters but again, I think the challenge for Governor Patrick will be name recognition and hitting the ground running with such little time left\u2026to really introduce himself to South Carolina voters,\" said state Representative Gilda Cobb-Hunter. According to Rakov, Patrick already has some traction in South Carolina due to his \"longstanding ties\" to the state.\u00a0 \"In South Carolina, the governor has longstanding ties there,\" said Rakov. \"It's one of the reasons why we see a path here is because there are early states where we definitely have opportunities that maybe some other candidates don't.\"\u00a0 And South Carolina Democratic Party Black Caucus Chair Johnnie Cordero said that there's still time for Patrick to win over voters in the state. \"I remember an organizer out of Chicago some years ago, who nobody supported, nobody thought he'd ever get a chance,\" recalled Cordero. \"I think that was Barack Obama. Wasn't it Obama who did that? So yeah, please don't count Deval Patrick out.\" Mr. Obama went on to win the state's Democratic primary with more than half the vote in 2008. Anton Gunn was the South Carolina political director for Obama in 2007. He told CBS News that in addition to the Obama comparisons that may come, Patrick might also enjoy the same underestimation. \u00a0 \"When you get into the race as an African American male, the comparison to Obama is almost immediate because he is who we have as a Democratic president in our most recent memory...I see it as a positive particularly if you're a candidate that has a good backstory, a good narrative, a good message and is right on the policy,\" said Gunn.\u00a0 \"What made Barack Obama successful is that everybody counted him out and didn't think he was going to have a chance, and I think Deval Patrick might enjoy the same kind of environment that nobody's going to be checking for him. When Patrick showed interest in running, Gunn added, there was a cohort of what he calls \"Obama OGs\"\u2014former staffers, super volunteers, and surrogates who supported Obama before his 2008 win in Iowa\u2014that Gunn said \"started buzzing in a way that they hadn't been buzzing\" about any other candidate. However, he still maintains that Patrick has his work cut out for him. \"Most of these other candidates have been grassroots\u2026going to little chicken strips, and meet and greets and doing all those things that they should do and Deval Patrick is going to have to do all of that too,\" said Gunn. \"But he might need to raise a boatload of money and get his name ID much quicker than everybody else.\" Patrick wrapped his first visit to South Carolina since launching his campaign with stops in Orangeburg and Charleston on Wednesday. And while Patrick wasn't on stage for the fifth Democratic presidential debate, he did schedule an event 12 minutes away at Atlanta's Morehouse College.\u00a0 That planned meet-and-greet was\u00a0reportedly\u00a0canceled after only two people showed. Patrick's campaign told CBS News that although there was \"miscommunication\" about the event, they're looking forward to returning to Morehouse soon and are already in talks about the visit.",

            "article_content": "A new book is hitting the shelves this July that's expected to have both Republicans and Democrats talking. \"American Carnage:\u00a0 On the Front Lines of the Republican Civil War and the Rise of President Trump\" features more than 300 interviews with top Republican leaders of the past 20 years -- including Mr. Trump himself -- and explores how a revolution in the GOP propelled him to the nation's highest office. Author Tim Alberta, who's also Politico magazine's chief political correspondent, said that while there's a collective instinct to blame President Trump for the state of the GOP and the country at large, that would be a \"mistake.\"  \"What you've had swirling now for over a decade are these forces of cultural displacement and socioeconomic dislocation, and an enormous amount of insecurity and anxiety felt by a lot of Americans of all political persuasions,\" Alberta said Thursday on \"CBS This Morning.\"  And while his campaign may have alienated elite Republican voters, it didn't end up significantly harming him. \"In politics, for every action there's an opposite, equal reaction \u2013 and so while bleeding some of the more college educated, traditional, suburbanite Republicans, he was able to still win an election by appealing to a lot of traditional, downscale, rural\u2026 Democrats who had never voted for Republicans, in many cases,\" Alberta said. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And while Mr. Trump's populism swept the election, many Democrats are now wondering if GOP lawmakers will challenge him on what many have called nativist and racist ideas.  Alberta said they shouldn't expect much. \"To be a member of the modern Republican party, today's Republican party circa 2019, is to pledge undying allegiance to Donald Trump or else, \" Alberta said. \"So you are very hard-pressed to find any Republican on Capitol Hill who is going to openly disavow the president or challenge him in any significant way.\"  \"That said, you get these folks behind closed doors \u2013 and especially if you get a couple of Bud Lights into them, they'll tell you chapter and verse about how much they dislike the president and how much they loathe the president,\" Alberta added. \u00a0\u00a0 \"Isn't that the very definition of cowardice?\" asked \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Tony Dokoupil. \"To talk behind closed doors but not take a stand?\"  \"Oh it's duplicitous,\" Alberta responded. \"But that is what the book tries to convey\u2026 what you are seeing on Fox News or what you're hearing on local talk radio or what you're hearing from some of these members at a town hall back in their districts is not what they actually feel. But they are sort of locked in this cage of fear as it relates to the president, and they understand full well that if political self-preservation is the name of the game, they cannot afford to cross Donald Trump.\"  Many of these lawmakers feel similarly towards Vice President Mike Pence, Alberta said. \"The vice president has been unflinchingly loyal to Donald Trump, and that is what the president has expected from his vice president,\" Alberta said. \"But in so doing, Mike Pence has alienated some of his staunchest allies in the Republican Party \u2013 and I see it very difficult for him to have the seat at the table in the Oval Office that he once hoped to have by virtue of his service under Donald Trump.\"  \"He is just, obviously, one example. There are any number of Republicans \u2013 prominent, high ranking Republicans, from Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, on down -- who were once very critical of Donald Trump\u2026\" Alberta said, \"but when the time came to either pledge allegiance or leave the party, everyone made the same decision.\"  That decision has everything to do with votes, Alberta said. \"You have an entire Republican governing class, who when they saw Donald Trump's ascent, they realized that they'd had it all wrong,\" he said. \"A lot of Republican voters, and a lot of voters writ large across the country, were in the middle of sort of this populist reckoning, this revolt, that was coming.\"  \"When all of these other Republicans began to realize just how forceful it was,\" he added, \"they realized that they either needed to get with him or get out of his way.\" \u00a0 Victoria Albert is a Sr. News Editor at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has a message for America: Capitalism isn't working for most people and is in dire need of reform.\u00a0 Dalio, in a lengthy LinkedIn post, criticizes the growing wealth and income disparities between the richest Americans and the bottom 60 percent, which he says is weakening the U.S. economically and leading to internal conflicts as well as a loss of status on the global stage. \"I have also seen capitalism evolve in a way that it is not working well for the majority of Americans because it's producing self-reinforcing spirals up for the haves and down for the have-nots,\" Dalio wrote. \"This is creating widening income/wealth/opportunity gaps that pose existential threats to the United States because these gaps are bringing about damaging domestic and international conflicts and weakening America's condition.\" Dalio, the founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, is worth $16.9 billion, placing him 66th on Bloomberg's Billionaire Index. While it might be a bit rich that a multi-billionaire is lecturing about income inequality, the 69-year-old writes that he grew up in a middle-class family and went to public schools.\u00a0 He joins a chorus of Wall Street types who are signaling a warning bell about the consequences of widening economic disparities, including JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who on Thursday warned in his annual shareholder letter that the American dream is \"fraying for many.\" And famed investor Warren Buffett recently warned capitalists not to forget the social and economic needs of the human \"roadkill\" that free markets can leave behind -- \"people who've become roadkill because of something beyond their control,\" he told CNBC. \"I think that's the obligation of a rich country Dalio, for his part, wrote on Friday: \"I was raised with the belief that having equal opportunity to have basic care, good education, and employment is what is fair and best for our collective well-being. To have these things and use them to build a great life is what was meant by living the American Dream.\" But, he says, that dream has curdled for many Americans, especially those in the bottom of the income distribution.\u00a0 In his piece, Dalio singles out trends that economists such as Thomas Piketty and Harvard University's Raj Chetty have highlighted, with some calling today's economy an echo of the \"gilded age\" of the early 20th century, when robber barons and industrial titans controlled much of the country's wealth.\u00a0 \"Prime-age workers in the bottom 60 percent have had no real (i.e., inflation-adjusted) income growth since 1980,\" Dalio wrote. \"That was at a time when incomes for the top 10 percent have doubled and those of the top 1 percent have tripled.\" Only half of children grow up to earn more than their parents did, compared with 90 percent in 1970, he added. As that suggests, climbing the socioeconomic ladder is no longer a possibility for many Americans, with poor citizens now among the least economically mobile in the developed world, he added. As a result, almost 1 in 5 American children are \"poor, malnourished (physically and mentally), and poorly educated,\" Dalio said. \"Leaving so many children in poverty and not educating them well is the equivalent of child abuse, and it is economically stupid.\" The growing gap between rich and poor is leading to increasing conflicts between liberals and conservatives, Dalio noted.\u00a0 \"The ideological polarity is greater than it has ever been and the willingness to compromise is less than it's ever been,\" he wrote. He predicted the 2020 presidential election will be \"a hell of a battle.\" His conclusion: Capitalism needs to be reformed, although Dalio didn't include specific recommendations for how to accomplish that goal -- he said he'll outline his ideas in forthcoming piece.\u00a0 It seems clear Dalio won't be recommending socialism as a cure-all, however: \"The problem,\" he wrote, \"is that capitalists typically don't know how to divide the pie well and socialists typically don't know how to grow it well.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump's reelection campaign is pouring cash into digital and television ads in the wake of the impeachment inquiry, but\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ben Mitchell\u00a0says data collected by left-leaning digital strategy firm Bully Pulpit Interactive (BPI) shows the campaign is largely targeting its base, not persuadable voters. According to BPI, only 35% of Mr. Trump's Facebook ads that mention impeachment \u2014 less than $200,000 of the roughly $2 million spent \u2014 target voters in swing states. The buy suggests that accusations of a Democratic \"overreach\" on impeachment might not be a winning message with people who aren't already Trump supporters, but the president's massive fundraising haul in the third quarter shows that playing to the base can have a massive strategic upside.\u00a0 MICHAEL BENNET Senator Michael Bennet released his third television ad in Iowa today, in which he attacks President Trump on health care. In the 30-second ad titled \"2010\" Bennet says, \"I didn't win two swing state elections by apologizing for Obamacare or making empty promises.\"\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says the ad is part of a seven-figure TV, digital, and radio buy the Bennet campaign campaign pushed starting last month. Earlier this week, the campaign announced it had raised over $2 million in the third quarter and has $1.8 million cash on hand. Bennet's campaign says 98% of the contributions it has received have been $100 or less.\u00a0 Bennet has about 10 paid full time staffers in Iowa and spent nine days in Iowa holding 19 campaign events in September.\u00a0 CORY BOOKER New Jersey Senator Cory Booker released a plan to reduce child poverty in the United States, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Booker would create a \"child allowance\" for families with children and would expand the Child Tax Credit. The \"child allowance\" would come from an authorization of a monthly payment program under which families with younger children would receive a monthly allowance of $300 and a monthly allowance of $250 for families with older children up to 18 years of age. \u00a0 \"When it comes to child poverty, we cannot be silent,\" Booker said in a statement. \"In the richest country in the world, we have a moral responsibility to look after each other and make sure that every child living in America has the opportunity to grow and thrive.\" Booker also plans to reform the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program by increasing funding by 40 percent and requiring that states use the funds to help provide educational and skill based opportunities for parents receiving TANF benefits.\u00a0 He also aims to eliminate child hunger by increasing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefit by 30 percent, while advocating for universal free school lunch. In a prepared press release, the campaign referenced an analysis of the plan by Columbia University's Center on Poverty & Social Policy that said Booker's plan would lift 7.3 million children out of poverty. TULSI GABBARD Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard reached out to Senator Bernie Sanders' wife, Jane, yesterday by phone, following news of her fellow 2020 candidate's health.\u00a0 \"I've been in touch with his wife, Jane, and just sent my well wishes for a quick recovery. I know that they're focused on taking care of him and making sure he's okay. And they know that I and so many of us are here for him,\" she told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. She recalled the 2016 campaign trail today and her relationship with Sanders to reporters.\u00a0 \"Yeah, a lot of memories from 2016,\" Gabbard said. \"But, you know, I'm grateful that he's become a friend over the years. And no matter what else is going on, when we bump into each other on the campaign trail now, there's always a warm hug and a laugh and a check-in from both of us about how each other's doing.\" Gabbard doubled down on her opposition to Senator Kamala Harris' call for Twitter to suspend President Donald Trump's account. \"I will stand up for every Americans right and freedom of speech, no matter how strongly I may disagree with that speech,\" Gabbard remarked. \"This freedom is the first amendment of the Constitution for a reason. And I will do all that I can to stand up for it.\" UP NORTH Workers at New Hampshire's Rockingham County Nursing Home have seen three presidential candidates in the past week alone. Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang have all rallied alongside nursing home employees in support of their effort to unionize. \"Workers are sick and tired of being exploited,\" Sanders told workers Monday. \"What you're doing is right. And all over the country, people are doing what you're doing.\" Today, workers at the Rockingham County Rehabilitation and Nursing Center voted 75-42 to organize a union with SEA/SEIU Local 1984. The local union has yet to endorse a candidate.\u00a0 \"Most of the feedback that I've been getting from members is that they're still pretty much wide open,\" SEIU Local 1984 President Rich Gulla told Sganga.\u00a0 \"We're the last stand for the middle class in this country. And I think people have forgotten that,\" Gulla added, reflecting on the state of organized labor. \"They take for granted what has been fought for since labor laws were enacted in this country.\" IN THE MIDDLE Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst, who is up for reelection in 2020, told constituents at a town hall in Templeton, Iowa this afternoon, \"I can't speak for him,\" when asked about President Trump's efforts to urge foreign countries to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, report\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster and CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson. \u00a0 \"Where is the line? When are you guys going to say enough and stand up and saying, 'I'm not backing any of this,'\" Amy Haskins of Manning, who identified herself as an independent, asked Ernst, berating Ernst and her Senate colleagues. \"You still stand there silent, and your silence is supporting him and not standing up. You swore an oath. You didn't pledge an oath to the president. You pledged it to our country. You pledged it to our Constitution,\" she said to applause. \"The president is going to say what the president is going to do,\" Ernst said. \"It's up to us as members of Congress to continue working with our allies.\"\u00a0 Over the past few days, the president has repeatedly attacked a whistleblower who filed a complaint that includes Mr. Trump's phone conversation with the Ukrainian president, a call which has in part spawned the House impeachement inquiry against him. Ernst also answered Haskins' question on whistleblowers. \"Whistleblowers should be protected,\" Ernst said. \"I stand with Chuck Grassley on this.\" Speaking to reporters after the town hall, Ernst said, \"I think corruption should be ferreted out no matter where it is,\" when asked whether any president should be soliciting help from foreign governments to investigate political opponents.\u00a0 Ernst also told reporters that the Senate Intelligence Committee will figure out how to proceed, based on any new information that emerges.\u00a0 \"I have read through whether it's the whistleblower complaint, I've read through the transcript, and just on its face value, I don't think there is anything there, per se,\" Ernst said. \"The whistleblower acknowledges this is second-, third-hand information. So The Senate Intelligence Committee, they will sort through all of that. And if there are additional witnesses that need to come forward, or they need to visit with they should do that.\" The Democratic Senate campaign arm has endorsed a candidate in Iowa to challenge Ernst, but has not focused as much attention on the Iowa race, compared with other battleground contests. Mr. Trump won Iowa by 10 points in 2016, but a recent\u00a0Morning Consult\u00a0poll found 55% of voters in Iowa disapprove of Mr. Trump, while 42% approve of the job he has done. CAROLINA CASH We're likely to see a very expensive Senate campaign season. Democratic Senate candidates seeking to unseat Republicans in North and South Carolina both announced they've raised north of a million dollars each in the third quarter, report\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producers Sarah Ewall-Wice & Ellee Watson. \u00a0 According to Cal Cunningham's campaign, the lawyer and former state senator raised $1 million in his challenge against North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, including contributions from more than 4,000 North Carolinians. The campaign also says it has $1.1 million cash on hand ending the month of September. In South Carolina, Democratic Senate challenger Jaime Harrison's campaign announced a $2.1 million fundraising haul in Q3, a feat that Harrison's team has called \"record-breaking,\" in its effort to unseat incumbent Senator Lindsey Graham. Harrison\u00a0raised\u00a0$1.5 million in the second quarter, and Graham\u00a0doubled\u00a0that total, bringing in more than $3 million in the second fundraising quarter.\u00a0 SCGOP Chairman Drew McKissick says \"no former lobbyist who supports policies like impeaching President Trump, the Green New Deal, and socialized healthcare is going to beat Senator Graham.\" However during a campaign kick-off event earlier this week,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0says Harrison had a message for dubious voters. \"When I travel around the state people say that they're pulling for us, but they don't know if we can win in a red state,\" said Harrison. \"We represent a new South that is bold, that's inclusive, \u00a0that's diverse, and powerful [and] my friends, that new South is rising and it's time to let them hear our voices.\" HEALTHCARE PRIMARY On Thursday, President Donald Trump visited The Villages in Florida to sign an executive order \"protecting Medicare from socialist destruction.\" The executive order calls for reducing Medicare fraud and supporting privatized Medicare plans, but the president spent a large chunk of his remarks criticizing the \"Medicare for All\" plan supported by some Democratic presidential candidates, according to\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson. Health care was the\u00a0number one issue\u00a0in the 2018 midterms, and the persistent messaging on the issue helped flip the House to Democratic control. Democrats targeted Republicans who voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no plan to replace it, and those who supported the ongoing lawsuit in Texas claimed the ACA is unconstitutional. In March, following the midterm elections, President Trump told\u00a0reporters on the Hill\u00a0and tweeted that \"The Republican Party would be the Party of Health Care!\"\u00a0 The Republican Party has yet to come up with a comprehensive health care plan, but the president has addressed some individual health issues. He has approved Congress'\u00a0opioid legislation\u00a0and banned flavored cigarettes. He has also made lowering drug prices part of his agenda. He\u00a0indicated support\u00a0for Speaker Nancy Pelosi's bill to lower drug prices, but Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0reportedly said\u00a0the measure is dead on arrival, according to\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall Wice.",

            "article_content": "La Paz, Bolivia \u2014 Bolivia faced its worst unrest in decades amid a political vacuum Tuesday, while Evo Morales, who transformed the Andean nation as its first indigenous president, fled the country following weeks of violent protests. Morales flew out on a Mexican government plane late Monday, hours after being granted asylum as his supporters and foes fought on the streets of the capital. An opposition leader has tearfully laid out a possible path toward new elections in the wake of the president's resignation, but early on Tuesday morning the country's political fate appeared to hang in the balance. Morales stepped down Sunday following weeks of widespread protests fed by allegations of electoral fraud in the Oct. 20 presidential election that he claimed to have won. Resignations by every other constitutionally designated successor left unclear who would take his place and how. His flight from the country was a dramatic fall for the llama shepherd from the Bolivian highlands and former coca growers' union leader who as president helped lift millions out poverty, increased social rights and presided over nearly 14 years of stability and high economic growth in South America's poorest country. In the end, though, his downfall was marked by his insistence on holding onto power. \"It pains me to leave the country for political reasons, but I'll always be concerned,\" Morales said on Twitter. \"l'll return soon, with more strength and energy.\" Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard published a photo of Morales holding the flag of Mexico, saying that the plane had left Bolivia and that Morales was safe. In an earlier tweet, Morales posted a photo of his first night after he resigned showing him lying on a floor with an improvised blanket as a bed. He said had been forced into these conditions after what he has called a coup by the opposition. Angry supporters of the socialist leader set barricades ablaze to close some roads leading to the country's main airport Monday, while his foes blocked most of the streets leading to the capital's main square in front of Congress and the presidential palace. Police urged residents of La Paz to stay in their homes and authorities said the army would join in policing efforts to avoid an escalation of violence. The Senate's second vice president, opposition politician Jeanine A\u00f1ez, said in an emotional address that she would take temporary control of the Senate, though it was unclear if she would be able to get approval from Congress, which is controlled by Morales supporters. She would become next in line for the presidency if chosen to head the Senate. \"Please excuse me if my voice breaks,\" A\u00f1ez said between tears after arriving in Congress under heavy guard. \"It's so hard to see Bolivians clashing, no matter which side they're on. They are being mistreated, and I'm asking you to cease the violence.\" A\u00f1ez said she would convene a legislative session Tuesday to consider accepting the formal resignation of Morales. It was unclear, however, if lawmakers could meet that soon because of insecurity in the capital. As tensions grew, local media reported that Morales supporters were marching on La Paz from the nearby city of El Alto, a Morales stronghold, to try to break the street blockades thrown up by his opponents and reach the capital's main square. Gen. Williams Kaliman, the chief of the armed forces, announced the joint police-military operation in a television address. He said the hope was to \"avoid bloodshed and mourning of the Bolivian family,\" and he urged Bolivians to help restore peace. Anti-Morales demonstrators in downtown La Paz set tires and other barricades on fire as other people went onto their rooftops to yell, \"Evo, murderer!\" Rock-throwing demonstrators also clashed in Cochabamba and other cities. His presidency, the longest among serving leaders in the region and the longest ever in Bolivia, ended abruptly Sunday, hours after Morales had accepted calls for a new election by an Organization of American States team. The team reported a \"heap of observed irregularities\" in the Oct. 20 election whose official results showed Morales getting just enough votes to avoid a runoff that analysts said he could lose against a united opposition. Morales stepped aside only after the military chief called on him to quit, saying that was needed to restore peace and stability. His vice president also resigned as did the Senate president. The only other official listed by the constitution as a presidential successor, the head of the lower house, had resigned earlier. Morales has lashed out at his political opponents, calling his removal a return to the bleak era of coups overseen by brutal Latin American militaries that ruled over the region. Former President Carlos Mesa, who finished second in the election, said Morales was brought down by a popular uprising, not the military. He noted that troops did not take to the streets during the unrest. \"Academics and the press have been very critical of the Bolivian military. But this might be the only time in Bolivian military history that the military is on the right side for once,\" said Eduardo Gamarra, a Bolivian political scientist at Florida International University. \"There's nothing here that remotely mirrors a traditional military coup,\" Gamarra added. \"Perhaps this is a time that the military is playing a role that it should play. It's not intervening in what are essentially civilian affairs.\" Michael Shifter, head of the Washington-based think tank Inter-American Dialogue, warned that Bolivia's polarization needs to healed by new leadership. \"The temptation for any vengeance against Morales supporters needs to be resisted,\" Shifter said. \"That would be a recipe for continued conflict and chaos that could well put at risk some of the country's undeniable socio-economic gains over the past decade.\" People waiting for flights Monday morning at the airport in the eastern Bolivian city of Santa Cruz listened to the national anthem played on television and then watched replays of Morales resigning in his televised address and news of the street clashes. \"At first people believed in him as an Indian. He was much more humble and accessible, but during these 14 years, he changed,\" Espa\u00f1a Villegas, a linguist, said while she waited for a flight to La Paz. Morales, who was from the poor Andean highlands, had promised to remain austere when he became president in 2006. But shortly after, he bought a new airplane and built a 26-story presidential palace with a heliport. \"He fought poverty, he lifted our economy, but perhaps he wasn't well advised,\" Villegas said. Morales ran for a fourth term after refusing to accept the results of a referendum that upheld term limits for the president - restrictions thrown out by a top court that critics contend was stacked in his favor. \"The whole population was tired of him because it's been nearly 14 years of government,\" said a businessman from the city of Cochabamba, who asked to be identified only by the name Walter, fearing reprisals by Morales supporters. \"There was no respect anymore. We're hurt. He believed himself to be a god.\"",

            "article_content": "Here's what you need to know in politics this week... BIDEN LEADS FIELD, WITH WARREN, HARRIS AND SANDERS CLOSE BEHIND, SAYS CBS NEWS BATTLEGROUND TRACKER POLL In CBS News' first Battleground Tracker poll of the 2020 presidential cycle, Joe Biden is leading the field. The belief that he could\u00a0fare best against President Trump\u00a0is currently propelling Joe Biden in the early Democratic nomination race by two measures \u2014 vote preference, and the delegates that would come with them. But others \u2014 including Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders \u2014 are in the mix, at least in terms of the candidates voters are considering. JOE BIDEN FUNDRAISES IN NYC Via Sarah Ewall-Wice and Bo Erickson:\u00a0After speaking at the Poor People's Campaign \"moral revival\" presidential forum in Washington, D.C. on Monday, Biden will head to New York City for at least two high-dollar fundraisers, according to the invitation shared with CBS News. The first \"finance event\" on Monday evening will be hosted at the penthouse of James Chanos, the founder of Kynikos Associates, the \"largest exclusive short selling investment firm,\" according to Yale School of Management. The second fundraiser, on Tuesday, will be hosted by Brad Karp, chairman of mega law firm Paul, Weiss, where two former colleagues from the Obama administration are practicing -- former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson.\u00a0 VIRGINIA IS FOR...? Via Bo Erickson and Jack Turman:\u00a0At Virginia Democrats' \"Blue Commonwealth Gala\" Saturday night in Richmond, former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, one of the few 2020 Democratic prospects to decide not to jump into the race, told reporters former Vice President Joe Biden would make a \"great president,\" but he will not be endorsing anyone until the end of the year, after Virginia's state elections.\u00a0 \"I wish some of the candidates had made the decision I made,\" McAuliffe said about the large Democratic field. \"Some should be running for the Senate, but you can't tell someone not to run for President.\" The former DNC chair, who reminded CBS News he \"started\" the DNC debate process, added that the large number of candidates will be \"taking up valuable debate time\" but the field \"will get weeded out pretty quickly\" because they'll start running out of campaign cash. Both Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg spoke at the Richmond gathering of around 1,800 Democrats. Klobuchar announced her goal to cut child poverty by half in the next decade by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Child Care Tax Credit, and SNAP benefits.\u00a0 Buttigieg, whom the crowd seemed excited to see, said that today is both the first Father's Day since his own father passed away earlier this year and his one-year anniversary to his husband, Chasten. Buttigieg remarked that, in addition to his faith community, having his husband by his father's hospital bedside was something he appreciated \"because in the eyes of the law as well as in our hearts, he was my lawfully married husband.\" Buttigieg said this personal moment is \"what politics is really about.\"\u00a0 \"Government isn't about what happens on TV,\" Buttigieg added. \"It is about what happens in our lives.\" JONI ERNST AND NIKKI HALEY GO ON OFFENSE AGAINST \"SOCIALISM\" Via Adam Brewster:\u00a0On Saturday, Republican Sen. Joni Ernst kicked off her re-election campaign at her annual Roast and Ride. Her featured guest this year was Nikki Haley. Ernst, in her speech, issued a call to \"stamp out socialism\" and repeatedly used the word to attack Democratic presidential candidates and Democrats in Congress. She told the crowd: \"Our freedoms are quite literally under attack because the radical left will stop at nothing until socialism has spread from coast to coast.\"\u00a0 The lines about socialism often received loud cheers. Haley also latched on this line of attack, saying this about the 2020 presidential candidates: \"It's a really odd collection of liberals, radicals and socialists. And I know a lot about liberals, radicals and socialists. In case you forgot, I used to work at the United Nations.\" Haley went on to say this about the UN: \"The UN is such an unusual place. Nowhere else in the country can you hear America being denounced in 10 different languages at the same time, unless of course you're at any of our college campuses.\" HARRIS, BUTTIGIEG TRADE JABS Via Stephanie Ramirez:\u00a0In a weekend interview with CNN'S Jake Tapper, Mayor Pete Buttigieg took a subtle swipe at Sen. Kamala Harris. When asked about Harris' remark that as president she would use the Justice Department to prosecute President Trump for obstruction, Buttigieg responded that his Justice Department would \"be empowered to reach its own conclusions.\" Harris spokesman Ian Sams then tweeted earlier remarks from Buttigieg to The Atlantic, in which the mayor said that\u00a0\"to the extent that there's an obstruction case, then yes, DOJ's got to deal with it. I would want any credible allegation of criminal behavior to be investigated to the fullest.\" ON THE TRAIL THIS WEEK 6/17 \u2013 Michael Bennet in DC; Biden in DC/NYC; Pete Buttigieg in NYC; Julain Castro in DC; Kirsten Gillibrand in NYC; Kamala Harris in DC; Amy Klobuchar in NYC; Wayne Messam in DC; Seth Moulton in NH; Bernie Sanders in DC; Eric Swalwell in VA/DC; Elizabeth Warren in DC; Marianne Williamson in DC; Andrew Yang in DC 6/18 \u2013 Biden in NYC; Mr. Trump in FL 6/19 \u2013 Biden in NH 6/21 \u2013 Bennet in SC; Beto O'Rourke in FL/SC; Biden in SC; Cory Booker in SC; Buttigieg in FL/SC; Bill de Blasio in SC; Castro in FL/SC; John Delaney in SC; Tulsi Gabbard in SC; Gillibrand in SC; Harris in SC; John Hickenlooper in FL/SC; Jay Inslee in SC; Klobuchar in FL/SC; Messam in SC; Moulton in SC; Tim Ryan in SC; Sanders in FL/SC; Swalwell in FL/SC; Warren in FL/SC; Williamson in SC;\u00a0 6/22 \u2013 Bennet in SC; O'Rourke in SC; Biden in SC; Booker in SC; Buttigieg in SC; Castro in SC; de Blasio in SC; Delaney in SC; Gillibrand in SC; Harris in SC; Hickenlooper in SC; Inslee in SC; Klobuchar in SC; Moulton in SC; Ryan in SC; Sanders in SC; Swalwell in SC; Warren in SC; Weld in NH; Williamson in SC; Yang in SC 6/23 \u2013 Bill Weld in NH",

            "article_content": "SEN. CORY BOOKER:\u00a0Booker released a policy proposal Monday morning aimed at expanding access to long-term health care, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. Booker plans to expand access for low-income and middle-income seniors and people with disabilities by increasing the asset limit for long-term services to $200,000. The plan also includes an increase to the income limit to 300% of the federal poverty line.\u00a0 \"Health care is a human right, and long-term services and supports are an important part of that,\" Booker said in a statement. \"In one of the richest nations in the world, no person should ever go broke or have to quit their job to afford long-term care or to take care of a loved one.\"\u00a0 Booker also proposes that employees in long-term services be paid at least $15 dollars per hour and have access to health care and retirement benefits. To ensure the economic security of these employees, the plan indicates Booker would increase Medicaid funding, while also directing the Department of Health and Human Services to improve planning to ensure fair wages and health care benefits. Booker previously proposed expanding the earned income tax credit and under his expansion, some family caregivers would be eligible up to a $4,000 credit. MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG:\u00a0After a massive cash haul in the second quarter of 2019, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor is not slowing down on fundraising, and he's getting help from some Hollywood heavyweights, says\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. According to the invitation, Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Chelsea Handler, Sean Hayes and Jason Bateman are among the co-hosts listed for a fundraiser on July 25. Fellow co-host and West Hollywood Mayor John D'Amico told CBS News he expects there could easily be between 150 to 200 people in attendance, saying, \"Pete is really well liked in the community, and people want very much for his profile to continue to rise.\" Tickets for the event range in price from $250 to $2,800, for which attendees can get a picture with Mayor Pete. Buttigieg outraised all of his fellow Democratic presidential candidates in the second quarter, raking in $24.8 million from April through June. GOV. JAY INSLEE:\u00a0In Iowa today, Inslee unveiled his plan for working families.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Zak Hudak and Tim Perry\u00a0say the plan calls for a national paid family and medical leave program with 12 weeks of leave coverage a year. Inslee's plan also calls for free child care for low and middle income families. It also addresses the needs of senior citizens, calling for publicly funded long-term care benefits so old citizens can stay in their home and receive long-term care while lowering costs on family members. At an event in Clive, Iowa, Inslee called on changing national priorities to favor working families. BETO O'ROURKE: The former congressman's campaign announced that by the end of the week it will have 11 field offices open across Iowa. This also comes as more than 20 local activists announced their endorsement for O'Rourke, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar, Adam Brewster and Perry. The campaign's Iowa state director Norm Sterzenbach said in a statement: \"We're growing our movement throughout the summer, so that every Iowan, regardless if they have caucused or not and regardless of whether they are Democrat, Republican, or wants to put country over party, knows they're in the right place with Team Beto.\"\u00a0 OUT WEST:\u00a0Fresh off a $12 million fundraising haul last quarter, Sen. Kamala Harris' campaign manager Juan Rodriguez will join some of the California Democrat's top brass\u00a0in Las Vegas this week\u00a0for a \"grand opening\" of their Nevada office.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says look to see other campaigns open up offices of their own across the Silver State, as candidates catch up to Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign's aggressive physical footprint in Nevada. The Vermont independent drew crowds\u00a0earlier this month\u00a0to inaugurate his East Las Vegas office. The campaign says it already has four total offices in the state, with more to come in \"the next couple weeks.\" ON THE $$$:\u00a0Presidential candidates have a midnight deadline to file their second quarter fundraising totals with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\u00a0Ewall-Wice\u00a0reports that several have already filed. According to Inslee's team, his campaign raised over $3 million between April 1 and June 30 from nearly 100,000 donations, with an average donation just below $32. His campaign says the five days following the first presidential debate in June were his best fundraising days in the quarter, including 12% of all donations and donors that quarter.\u00a0 Meanwhile, former HUD secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro announced Monday his campaign raised $2.8 million in the second quarter and finished the fundraising period with more than $1.1 million cash on hand. That's up from the $1.3 million his campaign raised during the first quarter of the year.\u00a0 Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's campaign also filed its second quarter numbers with the FEC. According to the report, his campaign raised more than $1.1 million in the second quarter of the year, down from the more than $2 million he raised in the first quarter of the year. His campaign currently has just over $830,000 cash on hand.\u00a0 And former Rep. John Delaney's campaign ended the quarter with more than $7.4 million cash on hand after raising $8 million in the second quarter of the year. That includes a $7.75 million loan guaranteed by Delaney.\u00a0 New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand raised nearly $2.3 million in the second quarter and ended the period with more than $8.2 million cash on hand. According to her campaign, 95% of contributions were under $50 and the average donation was $15. Of Gillibrand's online donors, her campaign has identified 65% as women. They also say they're on track to hit the 130,000 donor threshold to qualify for the September debates. SENATE CASH: Senate incumbents and candidates have until midnight to file their quarter two fundraising with the Federal Election Commission, but already, there are significant numbers in two battleground states, according to\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson.\u00a0In the Arizona Senate race, incumbent Republican Sen. Martha McSally raised $3.4 million, and her DSCC-endorsed opponent, former astronaut Mark Kelly, raised $4.2 million. And incumbent North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis raised $1.9 million, higher than his primary challenger who raised about raked in about $350,000 in contributions. Both Tillis and McSally have received \"complete and total endorsements\" from President Trump on Twitter. HOUSE DOLLARS:\u00a0Looking to hone in on recent internal conflicts amongst House Democrats, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) has launched its\u00a0\"Socialist Showdown\"\u00a0website to encourage socialist challengers to current Democratic incumbents. The home page showcases progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders alongside Fidel Castro and Vladimir Lenin, and has a list of 2020 Democratic primary challengers with links to their respective donation pages.\u00a0 The DCCC raised $29.2 million this quarter and its focus on \"Frontline\" freshmen members seems to be paying off, as a DCCC source told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that a majority of these members raised over $500,000 in Q2. The NRCC hasn't yet uploaded its whole Q2 filing, but its numbers for April and May show that it at least raised around $10 million in two months.",

ELIZABETH WARREN:\u00a0Warren announced Monday that she had raised $19.1 million over the past three months, more than triple what she brought in over the first quarter of the year,\u00a0according to CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak. Warren's campaign has already hired over 300 staffers across the country and spent nearly $16 million this year. She currently has just under $20 million cash on hand.\u00a0Read more\u00a0here. REP. ERIC SWALWELL:\u00a0\"Pass the torch,\" Swalwell told former Vice President Joe Biden two weeks ago. But if he does, Swalwell won't be around to take the handoff. The longshot 2020 candidate, who tried to make a name for himself on cable news shows as the voice of a younger political generation, dropped out of the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential race Monday, reports\u00a0Hudak. Swalwell ran with gun control at the center of his platform, and he was the first presidential candidate to call not only for a ban on assault-style rifles, but also for the government to buy the ones already in public hands.\u00a0Read more here. SEN. KAMALA HARRIS:\u00a0Harris gave perhaps the strongest defense yet of her record, telling an excited audience in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina on Monday, \"I am never going to apologize\" for having prosecuted child molesters, rapists and murderers. Speaking to a crowd of roughly 1,200 people,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0says Harris also proclaimed that she's proud of the work she did \"in saying we needed to be focused on elementary school truancy.\" This was in response to criticism Harris received for a California bill she championed in 2010 and 2011 that criminalized truancy. \u00a0 Multiple reports say that a few parents had been jailed as a result of the bill. Harris has said that that was an \"unintended consequence\" of the law.\u00a0Factcheck.org\u00a0says \"unintended consequences\" is misleading \u2014 jail time was a punishment that was written into the law's penal code.\u00a0 Harris began Monday by trying to woo South Carolina voters, making her first stop at a family-owned business in Marion. Harris supporter and former South Carolina lawmaker Bakari Sellers,\u00a0tweeted, \"Marion is one of those forgotten counties, where ppl endure generational back breaking poverty.\" CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0says Marion is in the Pee Dee region and that Harris is the only candidate to date who has visited the area, according to a state campaign spokesperson. GOV. JOHN HICKENLOOPER: Ramirez\u00a0says Hickenlooper doubled-down on his message Monday during the second day of an Iowa swing that he is not leaving the 2020 presidential race. Last week, his campaign\u00a0confirmed\u00a0at least six departures of key and senior-level staff.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0reports\u00a0that one of the first questions Hickenlooper faced from Iowa Caucus Democrats was why he was not leaving the presidential race to compete for a Senate seat. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0reports that Klobuchar has grown her New Hampshire team with three new hires. Klobuchar's New Hampshire office now has seven senior staff with a total of 18 full-time members. The campaign continues to hire, with more announcements planned for later this week. New additions to the team include organizing directors Nicholas Maines and Nick Paul, and digital director Megan Carter-Stone. This announcement comes on the tail of the Minnesota lawmaker's three-day swing in the Granite State with stops in Carroll and Coos County. UP NORTH:\u00a0The New Hampshire GOP released a new television\u00a0ad\u00a0on Sunday, according to\u00a0Sganga. \"We're running this ad both on the air and online to make sure that the people of New Hampshire know just how terrible the Democrats' budget proposal truly is,\" NHGOP chairman Stephen Stepanek said in a statement.\u00a0 Separately, Sen. Cory Booker rolled out six New Hampshire endorsements from the New Hampshire State House: Reps. Anita Burroughs (Bartlett), Linn Opderbecke (Dover), Lee Walker Oxenham (Plainfield), Katherine Rogers (Concord), Jeffrey Salloway (Lee) and Bruce Tatro (Keene). These lawmakers join state Sens. Jon Morgan and David Watters in their backing of the New Jersey senator. In other endorsement news, Granite State veteran and Democratic activist Ned Helms said on Monday he is backing Biden. Helms served as New Hampshire Democratic chair and New Hampshire co-chair for President Barack Obama. OUT WEST:\u00a0The Nevada Democratic Party unveiled their plan for hosting virtual caucuses ahead of the traditional in-person caucus on February 22, 2019. The party announced in a press call that it will be partnering with Stones' Phones, a Democratic consulting firm, to host the over-the-phone caucuses on Feb. 16 and 17.\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson\u00a0reports that Nevadans can participate over a mobile line, landline, Skype or Google Hangouts. The results of the virtual caucus will be tabulated in conjunction with the in-person caucuses, and the party will announce the raw totals that night. The party is working with vendors to develop an app that will calculate the results from the four days of early voting, the virtual caucuses and the in-person caucuses.\u00a0 IRAN:\u00a0In exclusive interviews with CBS News,\u00a0both Klobuchar\u00a0and\u00a0Rep. Tulsi Gabbard\u00a0weighed in on the \"existential threat\" Iran poses to the U.S., telling\u00a0Sganga\u00a0they would rejoin the United Nations Human Rights Council and renegotiate the U.S. back into the Iranian nuclear pact.\u00a0 \"Guess what?\" Klobuchar told CBS News on Sunday, \"As of today, we are less safe. Iran is blowing through the caps. They are going to start enriching uranium at a level that could lead to nuclear weapons, and it is much less safe than we were when [Mr. Trump] came in as president.\"\u00a0 Monday morning, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand weighed in on the issue speaking to reporters after a round table in Concord, New Hampshire: \"Now we have no ability to know what's happening inside Iran. And so we again might be left with only military action. And if your only response is military, then the likelihood of starting a World War unfortunately, is much higher. So It is a very precarious place for us to be in.\" LIFE AFTER A PRESIDENTIAL RUN:\u00a0Now out of the presidential race, Swalwell begins his 2020 House reelection effort for California's 15th Congressional District with one Democratic challenger, Aisha Wahab. Wahab, the first elected Afghan-American to U.S. office, is a 31-year-old Hayward City Council member who has drawn comparisons to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez due to her similar social media use and progressive ideas, such as free college and the elimination of student debt. Wahab announced her House campaign in April and while she has left the future of her campaign open, she indicated she will continue when she retweeted Mike Gravel (another 2020 Democratic presidential candidate)\u00a0who tweeted, \"Ah good to see Eric Swallwell (sic) has conceded after a month of polling below Mike and is scurrying back to continue doing nothing in the House ...wouldn't it be nice if he also lost his seat to @aishabbwahab along the way?\"\u00a0 When asked about Wahab and other possible challengers, Swalwell said he welcomes anyone to the race and that he has not spoken her. Swalwell himself challenged Democratic incumbent Rep. Pete Stark in 2012. \"I don't take anything for granted. You know, I beat a 40-year incumbent in 2012, who had taken a district for granted. And I hope the district sees that these issues that I was running on nationally were the district's issues,\" Swalwell said at his press conference Monday.\u00a0 CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0talked to a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) source who said they've been in contact with Swalwell's team as of this morning, and there's \"obvious space\" in the Democratic caucus for him and his leadership. They also pointed to Swalwell's involvement in helping recruit Democratic freshmen candidates in 2018. The DCCC source said they haven't heard from Wahab's team, but because her campaign started in early spring when it was still an open race, consultants affiliated with her can continue and won't be affected by the committee's policy barring contracts with those supporting primary challengers.",

            "article_content": "America's job market may be the strongest it's been in at least half a century, but not all workers are getting a lift. The proportion of men in their prime working years without a job is higher today than it was before the Great Recession, according to a new\u00a0study.\u00a0 Roughly 1 in 7 U.S. men between the ages of 25 and 54 aren't employed, federal labor data show. That's a higher rate of unemployment for the group than in 2007, the year before the housing crash slammed the economy. Many of these men don't show up in the U.S. Labor Department's monthly unemployment statistics because they've given up looking for work. Some are on disability, but researchers at the IZA Institute of Labor Economics say that doesn't fully account for the problem. They note that the disability rolls have declined by 7% since the late 1960s, when only about 6% of prime-age men were out of the workforce. Instead, the surge in unemployed males has come at a time when working-class men have less bargaining power and the work available to them increasingly consists of \"low-quality unstable jobs with few if any benefits,\" the researchers state.\u00a0 \"Despite its reputation for having flexible labor markets, the U.S. has one of the lowest prime-age male labor participation rates in the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development], and one that has been on a downward trend since 1999,\" the researchers noted.\u00a0 The OECD represents 36 countries with more developed economies, ranging from European nations such as the U.K. and Germany to Australia and New Zealand. These men are suffering from higher rates of stigma than other groups, the researchers said, noting the focus in American culture on self-sufficiency and hard work. Men outside the labor force are \"a worrisome group,\" they wrote, citing lower rates of satisfaction with their lives and overall markers of well-being.\u00a0 \"Less-than-college-educated white males, a group for whom the increases in labor force dropout have been stark, are also particularly vulnerable to premature mortality due to suicide, and opioid and other drug overdoses,\" the authors wrote.\u00a0 The risk of premature death may be one cause for the shrinking white working class, which now stands at its smallest-ever share of the U.S. population. White working-class Americans, which accounted for 70% of the adult population in 1975, now represent just 40% of adults \u2014 an all-time low, according to recent\u00a0research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The white working class is getting hit on a number of fronts, including more whites attending college, which pushes them into the professional class, as well as \"deaths of despair,\" or the sharp rise in fatalities due to drug overdoses and suicides among the group.\u00a0 Men who are outside the workforce are more likely to live in counties around the U.S. that voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, found IZA, a nonprofit economic research firm focused on labor issues. While the research didn't draw a link between the demographics of Trump voters and men outside the labor force, the past decade has witnessed a growing economic divide between high-growth coastal cities and slower-growing rural areas. Such areas are \"diverging fast\" in key metrics such as family income and economic growth, analysts at the Brookings Institution\u00a0wrote\u00a0earlier this month.\u00a0 Only a decade ago, voters in Republican and Democratic districts earned almost identical incomes. But today, a gulf has emerged: Median household income in Democratic districts now stands at $61,000, compared with $53,000 for Republicans, Brookings noted. \u00a0 Automation may add to the problems facing some working-class men. The solution, according to IZA, could lie in vocational training for younger working-class men, and programs for older men that could help them improve their well-being and reduce their isolation, such as volunteering.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Senator Bernie Sanders believes that the super-rich and large corporations are actively working against working class Americans and in an interview with CBS News compared some of the ultra-wealthy to drug addicts. Ending corporate greed was the theme of a five-stop, two-day swing through Iowa this week \u2014 marking his return to a first in the nation state since suffering a heart attack 25 days ago. \"There's always been greed in this country \u2014 no question about it. But I think 40, 50 years ago, the big money interest in this country made a decision that they were going to go to war against the working families of this country,\" Sanders told CBS News in an interview Friday. \"I think there has been a decision on the part of corporate America and the corporate elite that says, 'We want it all,'\" he said. According to a September\u00a0report\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau, the wealth gap between rich and poor Americans is the largest it's been in 50 years. On the trail with Bernie Sanders, that disparity is discussed on nearly constant refrain. To rebalance the gap, Sanders' campaign earlier this month introduced a plan for \"corporate accountability and democracy\" which would raise federal income tax on major Americans corporations, including Amazon, GM, and Delta, from their current rate of zero. The plan would also make it more difficult for large businesses to merge and widen the reach of anti-trust laws. Sanders also has a plan to implement a wealth tax, which would, according to the campaign's economists, in 15 years reduce the average billionaire's wealth by 50%. In addition to restructuring corporate tax law, Sanders has the \"Workplace Democracy Plan\" aimed at elevating workers voices by ensuring 45% of board members are employees. The senator would also have workers establish unions with just a majority vote, including federal employees. Sanders wants to change the way corporations do business, but he also believes a shift needs to occur in American values. \"We have to change, in a very fundamental way, the priorities of our nation,\" he said. Asked by CBS News how that notion squares with the concept that the United States is the \"land of opportunity\" where anyone has a chance to accrue great success and wealth, Sanders said that there is a difference in ambitions between the working class and the rich. \"In the same way that we look at some people who are alcoholics, some people who are drug addicts, I think [the ultra-wealthy] are addicted to money. And I think a billion for some of them is not enough, they need 5 billion. And 5 billion is not enough, they need 50 billion. 50 billion's not enough, they need 100 billion dollars. And in order to get that money, they are prepared and do terrible things to working people,\" Sanders said. \"Greed for some of these people has literally become a religion \u2014 'I need more, more, more.' Like a drug addict. And I think that that kind of greed has led to corruption. Where it's not just greed, you have industries like the pharmaceutical industry, who not only charge us by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, they engage in price fixing and collusion. Everybody knows that they are being sued for billions of dollars by state's Attorneys General for actually selling opioids that they knew were addictive just so that they can make more money. They're killing people to make more money.\" The senator considers President Trump to be an example of that wealth-driven corruption. \"Most people do not want to step on other people as they advance to the top. We have a president who, when he was in the private sector, lied and cheated and stole in order to make his money. I don't think that's where most people are,\" said Sanders. Corruption, says Sanders, runs through American politics as well. \"Candidates need money in order to run their campaigns. I think what you're talking about is how democracy in America has been fundamentally corrupted. Citizens United made a bad situation worse, but you now have multi billionaires who are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaigns to elect candidates who represent the rich and the powerful,\" said Sanders. The Vermont senator has run a campaign funded fully by individual contributions. He outraised all of his Democratic competitors this past fundraising quarter and has the most cash on hand of anyone in the field. Since his campaign launched in February, Sanders has raised $61.5 million from a total of 3.3 million individual donations. Sanders told CBS News that his grassroots funded campaign is what he is most proud of. \"We don't sit in rich people's living rooms to raise money,\" he said. \"I am a candidate of the working class. I come from the working class. That is my background, that's who I am. And that is the kind of president that I will be. I'm not there to represent the wealthy and the powerful \u2013 they're doing fine. I am there to represent the working class, the middle class, in this country. While Sanders isn't fundraising in \"rich people's living rooms\", he takes issue with former Vice President Joe Biden's approach. Sanders elevated critiques of Biden this week in Iowa after one of Biden's campaign managers embraced the idea of needing an independent super PAC in order to financially compete with President Trump's reelection campaign funding. \"I don't have a super PAC. I don't want a super PAC. I don't need a super PAC,\" Sanders told voters in Marshalltown, Iowa, on Friday. Biden ended the third quarter with $9 million cash on hand versus Sanders' field-leading $33.7 million. It is Sanders' belief that \"corporate elites\" not only take advantage of the working class, but also work to obtain political power through lobbying and campaign fundraising, \"to protect the wealthy and the powerful.\" His willingness to strip wealth away from the country's top earners has not made Sanders the most popular among the some of America's wealthiest entrepreneurs. Earlier this year the campaign published a list of \"anti-endorsements\", a group of \u00a0multi-million and billionaires with attributed quotes expressing concern or displeasure with Sanders' platforms. \"We welcome their hatred,\" Sanders wrote on the campaign's website, quoting President Franklin D. Roosevelt. When asked if the senator had any concerns his policies would stifle the American economy or even close wallets for charitable donations, Sanders said he had zero fear that cracking down on the ultra-wealthy would hurt the poor or working class. \"When you raise wages to a living wage, when you end homelessness in America, when your end hunger in America, as we must do, poor people are not going to need charity. They're going to have dignity, they're going to have jobs, they're gonna have education. That's the direction we have to go in,\" said Sanders. CBS News reporter covering climate change and energy.",

            "article_content": "The day before the midterm elections in 2010, Joe Biden traveled to Vermont to headline a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor. On the stage, he gave a shout out to the state's two senators. Bernie Sanders, he said, \"is the conscience of the United States Senate.\" \"I love this guy. You should be happy with this guy,\" Biden said to cheers. He recalled a conversation with Ted Kauffman, his former chief of staff who had taken his seat in the Senate when Biden became vice president. \"I said to him, 'OK, Ted, you've been there two years, of all the people you work with who do you like best?' And he said, 'Bernie Sanders. Bernie, that's a high quality.' This guy knows talent, man.\" \u00a0 Nearly a decade later, Biden and Sanders are top rivals leading the pack for their party's nomination for president \u2014 a contest in which the Vermont senator's once-fringe policy views are now considered \"the conscience\" of the field.  The two men are roughly the same age \u2014 Biden is 76, Sanders 77 \u2014 and have long careers in public service. They're both pitching themselves as advocates for the working class who can win back voters who migrated to President Trump in 2016. At the same time, they differ starkly on foreign and domestic policy, as well as style: Biden the gregarious institutionalist and Sanders the unabashed gadfly. Early polls showing them atop the most crowded and diverse Democratic field in modern campaign history have put a spotlight on their competing visions for victory. And this week, Sanders fired his first official shot across the bow. \"I think when people take a look at my record versus Vice President Biden's record, I helped lead the fight against NAFTA. He voted for NAFTA,\" Sanders said on CNN. \"I helped lead the fight against [permanent normal trade relations] with China. He voted for it. I strongly opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He supported it. I voted against the war in Iraq. He voted for it.\" Sanders and Biden have a cordial relationship and respect one another, but are not particularly close, according to aides. They overlapped for two years in the Senate, but served on different committees, and didn't work on much together. Biden focused on foreign policy in the upper chamber, while Sanders mostly worked on economic issues.\u00a0 \"They weren't close buddies in the Senate,\" says Michael Briggs, Sanders' former spokesman. \"But they got along well ... Biden was very nice to him during the campaign.\"  In 2015, while still mulling a run for president, Biden reportedly told donors at a Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraiser, \"I am not a populist. But Bernie Sanders, he's doing a helluva job.\" Then, shortly after he decided not to run, Biden invited Sanders to the Naval Observatory to talk about a variety of campaign issues.  \"I've known Joe for many years and I like Joe. Joe is a friend of mine,\" Sanders said in an interview with CBS News' Ed O'Keefe in April, before Biden entered the race. \"I look forward to having a good issue-oriented debate with him and with other candidates. And one thing I'm quite confident about is that among the Democratic candidates, there is an understanding we shouldn't be attacking each other on personal levels.\" Sanders allies say the senator isn't likely to escalate the rivalry beyond policy contrasts. But Biden could provide a nice foil for Sanders campaign. \"To the extent it allows him to talk about these issues that animated his campaign like none other that I've watched, it helps,\" says Briggs.  Aside from supporting a $15 minimum wage, Biden has so far stayed away from Sanders-inspired proposals. While campaigning in Pittsburgh earlier this week, Biden advocated for a public option to buy government insurance, not Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan that has been backed by many of the candidates.  In Pittsburgh, Biden invoked themes of economic inequality. \"The country wasn't built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs and hedge fund managers,\" he said. \"It was built by the great American middle class.\" But in a speech at the Brookings Institution in 2018, Biden drew a contrast with Sanders. \"I love Bernie, but I'm not Bernie Sanders. I don't think 500 billionaires are the reason why we're in trouble,\" he said. \"I get in trouble with my party when I say wealthy Americans are just as patriotic as poor folks.\" In many ways, Sanders' increasing influence among Democrats raises a set of challenges for Biden in navigating a party that has shifted to the left since he last ran for office. But in other ways, Bernie's candidacy could help Biden stand out amid a field that Mr. Trump broadly paints as socialists. Biden seems to have identified the latter dynamic, and is already running something of a general election-style campaign against the president.  Yet Biden and Sanders are competing for similar voters, particularly those in the Midwest and Rust Belt. And allies from both camps say the two have a valuable authenticity factor that will resonate. Early polls show some overlap. A Morning Consult poll found that Biden and Sanders supporters named the other as their second choice. And a Des Moines Register/CNN survey of Iowa voters found similar results. \"They are both appealing to Trump country where there was loss of work to trade and closing factories,\" says a former Sanders aide. \"I think people will like the statesman way of Biden. But in some ways they are looking for a fight, someone who is going to brawl with [Trump]. Bernie ... is more likely to call out businesses by name and take them to task.\"  Beyond their overlapping constituencies, Biden is likely to appeal more to older voters, while Sanders is likely to do well among younger voters.  Both, however, have made clear that even as their rivalry kicks into high gear, Mr. Trump remains the mutual target. On Thursday, Sanders tweeted one area of support on which the two agree: \"I thank my friend @JoeBiden for joining our effort to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi military campaign in Yemen, which, over four years of war, has experienced the world's worst humanitarian crisis. We must override @realDonaldTrump's veto.\" Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0has learned that Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is cutting her entire field team in New Hampshire and all three field offices in the Granite State, according to campaign aides. The number of staff cuts is in the \"double digits,\" with more than half of her New Hampshire staff being laid off. According to a campaign spokesperson, \"a handful of staffers will run a scaled-down campaign out of the Manchester headquarters.\" The field offices in Portsmouth, Manchester and Keene will be closed. \"Senator Harris and this team set out with one goal \u2013 to win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump in 2020,\" Nate Evans, communications director for Harris' New Hampshire campaign said in a statement. \"To do so, the campaign has made a strategic decision to realign resources and go all-in on Iowa, resulting in office closures and staff realignments and reductions in New Hampshire. The campaign will continue to have a staff presence in New Hampshire but the focus is and will continue to be on Iowa.\" Read the full story here. The former El Paso congressman announced on Medium that he's ending his presidential campaign, CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe report. \"Though it is difficult to accept, it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully,\" O'Rourke wrote. \"My service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee.\"\u00a0 He went on to say that even though he's suspending his campaign, he'll \"work to ensure that the Democratic nominee is successful in defeating Donald Trump in 2020.\" Outside the arena hosting tonight's major Democratic Party event in Des Moines, O'Rourke supporters were still gathered at a spot where the candidate planned to address them, CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe reports. Before his arrival, some volunteers began pulling lawn signs out of the ground. When a CBS News team converged to document the scene, a O'Rourke campaign staffer approached and asked that we stop and that we be \"respectful\" because the volunteers \"are very vulnerable right now.\" CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga reports that New Hampshire campaign officials told CBS News just last week that they felt the campaign would continue beyond the debates even if O'Rourke did not meet the thresholds. \u00a0 Elizabeth Warren said Friday that she said would fund her universal health care plan known as \"Medicare for All\" without raising taxes on middle class Americans \"by one penny,\" seeking to put to rest questions about how she'd pay for her signature domestic proposal, report CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak and CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Warren's plan runs 20 pages and is supported by a group of economists and health care experts consulted in advance of its release. The proposal not only would lower the medical costs for American families by $11 trillion over 10 years, but also slightly lower the total cost the country is projected to spend on health care over the same period by $7 trillion, according to those experts, some of whom led health care policy for the Obama administration. The Urban Institute, a liberal think tank, estimated last month that it would cost $34 trillion additional to fund Medicare for All for 10 years. Through a series of reforms, public funding reallocations and greater efficiency, the experts enlisted by Warren to examine her plan say she could bring the total additional cost down to just over $20 trillion.\u00a0Warren then says she would bring in just under $9 trillion over 10 years by diverting the funds employers pay to private health care plans to the government. To compensate for the remaining $11 trillion, Warren has a set of proposals, including a county-by-county tax on foreign earnings of 35 percent. Warren, who has already proposed a 3 percent wealth tax on fortunes over $1 billion, would increase it to 6 percent to bring in an additional $1 trillion for the health care plan. CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports that \u00a0former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign issued a statement calling the plan \"mathematical gymnastics,\" adding, \"it's impossible to pay for Medicare for All without middle class tax increases.\" Read more here. DONALD TRUMP The president is making his second trip to Tupelo, Mississippi, since assuming office, reports CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson. The president visited after the midterms to rally support for Republican Senator Cindy-Hyde Smith who was forced into a runoff for the state's U.S. Senate seat against Democrat Mike Espy after neither candidate took more than 50 percent in the four-way special election. Hyde-Smith ended up defeating Espy 54 to 46 percent. This year, the president is here to support Lieutenant Governor Tate Reeves who is competing in Tuesday's gubernatorial election against the state Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat. Virginia Mitchell, who stood in line Friday afternoon outside the BancorpSouth Arena where the president will hold his rally told CBS News that the race would be close if Reeves did not have the support of the president. Mr. Trump's presence \"made a difference in Hyde-Smith's election so it'll make a difference here too,\" she said.\u00a0According to CBS News broadcast associate Aaron Navarro, the rally will be in in a county where Reeves lost narrowly in his Republican runoff with former state Supreme Court Justice chief justice Bill Waller.\u00a0 UP NORTH Senator Bernie Sanders campaign announced Friday it has 90 staff members and 13 field offices in New Hampshire, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga notes. This puts Sanders' camp well beyond all other campaigns in New Hampshire, including that of Senator Elizabeth Warren. Sanders had a late start here in New Hampshire, building out his team over the past couple of months. In August, Bernie Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir doubled down on the campaign's plan to increase Granite State staffing over time.\u00a0\"We could afford, over a period of time, to allow a lesser investment and then increase that investment over time,\" Shakir told CBS News. \"So by the end of this, I promise you, if we aren't the candidate with the most staff in the most volunteers, I will be stunned.\"\u00a0OUT WEST Though far from the fanfare of candidates filing for the New Hampshire primary, Sanders today announced that his campaign has officially filed for the Nevada caucuses in February. The Nevada State Democratic Party confirmed to CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin that the Vermont senator joins Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, and Tom Steyer in providing the necessary documents to contend in the \"first in the West\" contest.\u00a0 Buttigieg was the first to finalize his candidacy for the Nevada caucuses, filing on stage at a state party event in September. \"We have grown to a team of more than 70 staffers since we started in April, each of us dedicated to bringing our movement to life and cultivating our massive army of volunteers to help us win the caucuses in February,\" Sarah Michelsen, the Nevada state director for the Sanders campaign, said in a statement. DOWN SOUTH While Andrew Yang hasn't spent nearly as much time in South Carolina as some of his Democratic competitors, the Yang operation in the Palmetto State has almost doubled in paid staff in the past few weeks. It's part of a broader expansion the Yang campaign has undertaken in recent months, due in large part to the success of its online fundraising and organizational efforts that predate its physical campaign presence. Campaign reporters Ben Mitchell and LaCrai Mitchell explore how the Yang campaign is using digital outreach to mobilize ground game and attract voters who have never been involved in politics until now.

PENCE EFFECTVice President Mike Pence hit the campaign trail in Southeast Kentucky with Governor Matt Bevin in hopes of energizing voters in a state President Trump won by 30 points in 2016. Trump is even more popular in Laurel County, where he received more than 82 percent of the vote and where Pence and Bevin held a Get Out the Vote rally with others on the GOP ticket. \"To those with the national press corps, this is Trump country \u2014 let there be no doubt about it,\" Bevin said at the rally. In his own primary in May, Bevin lost a lot of these southeastern Kentucky counties to Republican State Representative Robert Goforth, who got 61 percent of Laurel County.\u00a0\u00a0Krissie Reffner, who works in London, Kentucky, told CBS News broadcast associate Aaron Navarro that \"as a Republican, we should go out and support our Republican governor,\" but she thinks it's going to be a close race between him and Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear. At the rally, Bevin said he's not trying to win by a close margin: \"I want to win by 10 or 12 percent.\" Recent polls have either shown Beshear with a lead, or tied with Bevin.\u00a0ELECTION RULESNavarro reports that in the backdrop of Mr. Trump's appearance in Mississippi, an opinion by a state federal court expressed \"grave concern\" with the state's electoral vote rule. Currently, the state law is that if a gubernatorial candidate has not received more than 50 percent of the vote, then the Mississippi State House will pick the governor. It's a potentially significant opinion, with Republicans currently holding the State House and polls showing both Reeves and Democrat candidate Attorney General Jim Hood neck-and-neck.

            "article_content": "South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg often says in his stump speech that he will \"appoint a Secretary of Education who actually believes in public education.\" And ahead of a four day bus tour across New Hampshire, the Democratic presidential hopeful released details on how he says his administration would provide affordable college tuition for working and middle-class Americans. \"Our government can, and should, play a role in setting a level playing field that gives all Americans a chance to succeed,\" the plan reads. \"That doesn't mean government taking over the economy. But government does need to be a vigorous presence in ensuring that our economy actually works for all.\" Buttigieg's plan to improve college affordability includes a $500 billion investment and a breakdown of tuition costs according to a family's\u00a0income. The plan says that public college students would attend college for free if their families earn less than $100,000 per year. Meanwhile, families that make in between $100,000 to $150,000 will pay tuition on a reduced sliding scale, while families who make more than $150,000 are expected to pay full tuition. Buttigieg's approach to affordable college tuition contrasts with policies supported by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who both advocate for free tuition for all students who attend public colleges. Buttigieg has long advocated for free college tuition for low- and middle-income students during the presidential race and for upper class families to pay full college tuition costs.\u00a0 \"I just don't believe that all of us, especially low income people should be paying to cover the very last dollar, even for the child of a billionaire, going to a college,\" Buttigieg said at the Black Economic Alliance Presidential Forum in June. \"I think if you're a child of a billionaire you can take care of yourself, and you ought to be able to pay some tuition.\" A campaign spokesperson noted that under Buttigieg's plan, states will be able to make adequate investments in their public higher education systems and constrain increased tuition costs, allowing colleges to boost financial aid support with the federal funds they receive.  The plan also details a $700 billion investment for universal early childhood learning opportunities. Specifically, low-income families would have access to free early childhood education programs and child care for children up until five years of age. And a Buttigieg administration would create a cost assistance program for working- and middle-class families directed for after-school and summer programs.\u00a0  In his plan, Buttigieg cited the Working Families Tax Relief Act, which is legislation proposed by Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin and Oregon Senator Ron Wyden, to grow workers' incomes by an average of $1,000 per year via an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit.\u00a0 Buttigieg's plan also indicates his support for passing a $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave and 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave and increased protections for \"gig\" and farm workers.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the Senate.",

            "article_content": "Justin Parmenter, a language arts teacher at Waddell Language Academy in Charlotte, North Carolina, wants his 7th grade students to know why class was cancelled this week as he and other educators walked off the job. \"The legislators who are leading this state have done a lot of things to make people not want to be teachers in North Carolina,\" he said in a letter published on industry news site\u00a0Education Week. \"Since 2011, they have taken away due-process protections for new teachers, eliminated pay increases for educators with graduate degrees and revoked retirement health benefits for all state employees hired after Jan. 1, 2021.\" The state has also increased standardized tests, removed class-size caps for most grades and cut more than 7,000 teaching assistants over the past decade, wrote Parmenter, who linked the policies to a\u00a0shortage\u00a0of teachers in the state. Parmenter was one of thousands of educators, other school workers and supporters who rallied in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Wednesday to demand more funding for public education as well as an expansion of Medicaid. \"Terrible policies\" adopted by lawmakers in the state \"have caused many great teachers to have left the state,\" he added, \"and a lot of people who would have made excellent educators have decided not to become teachers at all.\" Marchers are also pushing to raise the state's hourly minimum wage to $15 for custodians, secretaries, cafeteria staff and bus drivers, many of whom work a second job to get by, Parmenter said. They're also calling on lawmakers to hire more nurses, librarians, social workers, psychologists, and school counselors. On a more personal note, he wanted to dispel any notion that his students were being abandoned, as at least one state senator, Phil Berger, suggested on social media. \"On May 1, thousands of children will be forced out of the classroom and hardworking parents will have to find childcare or miss work \u2014 all so the far-left teacher strike organizers can try to elect more Democrats,\" the Republican lawmaker wrote in a Facebook\u00a0post. Seeking to set the record straight, as he put it, Parmenter told his students the would rather be at work than marching. \"The 178 unused sick days in my Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools employee account are a testament to how important I think it is for me to be at school,\" he wrote. \"I would much rather be in class with you all on May 1, too, but our legislators spend weekends at home with their families, so we have to go to Raleigh on a work day to be able to speak with them.\" Organizers had hoped the May 1 \"Day of Action\" would exceed last year's crowd and build on the momentum they credit for helping mobilize voters in elections last fall. The protests were part of a wave of increased labor action in recent years by teachers, retail workers and others. Because so many school employees in North Carolina requested Wednesday off, more than 850,000 public school students across the state were given the day off, too, as there were not enough substitute teachers to safely hold classes. Parmenter drew media attention last fall for an entirely different sort of letter campaign in which he asked parents to write their children words of support that he could pass along when he noticed they were having a hard day. \"This is an activity that helps to bring down that barrier a little bit and bring parents into the classroom in a way and show the child that we understand you need support in a lot of different ways,\" he\u00a0told\u00a0\"CBS This Morning\" at the time.",

            "article_content": "Here's what you need to know in politics this week... Twelve Democratic presidential candidates take the stage Tuesday in Westerville, Ohio for the fourth presidential debate, which will be co-hosted by The New York Times and CNN. The ten who qualified for the third debate, plus billionaire Tom Steyer and Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, have also reached the threshold for the debate, which required reaching at least 2% in four qualifying polls and raising funds from 130,000 unique donors. Since the last debate, there have been two massive political developments: first, the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, based on a whistleblower's complaint involving Mr. Trump's call with the Ukrainian president, in which he called for an investigation of political rival Joe Biden. And second, in Syria, as CBS News Political Unit associate producer Eleanor Watson notes, Turkey is in week two of an incursion into Syria following President Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. forces from northern Syria. The Democratic candidates have all spoken out against the move. They criticized him for abandoning the Kurds who have been crucial partners to the U.S. in the fight against ISIS and are now facing an onslaught from Turkish forces who consider them terrorists. In the debate, the candidates could pivot to chastising the president for abandoning U.S. allies since that has been a theme on the campaign trail, but they are likely to face questions themselves, like these: Bernie Sanders\u00a0and\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0in particular are worth watching on this front, since they have both penned essays and pushed for the end of \"forever wars.\" ELIZABETH WARREN\u00a0 Warren will step on the debate stage Tuesday night for the first time a front-runner, which could make her the target of attacks by the other contenders, CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak notes. In a CBS News poll released this morning, Warren leads former Vice President Joe Biden across early-state contests through Super Tuesday, as well as in New Hampshire.\u00a0  Warren's previous debate appearances have been generally strong, although she hasn't faced any direct attacks from other candidates to this point. But as Warren has risen in recent weeks, rivals have shown a new willingness to attack the Massachusetts senator. Even her apparent pact with longtime ally Senator Bernie Sanders may be off.  \"Elizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I'm not,\" Sanders told Jonathan Karl in an ABC News interview. \"I am, I believe, the only candidate who's going to say to the ruling class of this country: the corporate elite, enough, enough with your greed and with your corruption.\"  That same CBS News poll showed health care to be the top issue for voters in early-contest states when deciding who they'll vote for. Rival campaigns say they expect Warren's positions\u2014and lack of clarity on whether taxes will go up on middle-class voters to pay for \"Medicare for All\" \u2014 to come under attack on the stage Tuesday. None would disclose their planned points of attack, but some candidates have begun to indicate how they are trying to distinguish themselves from Warren. For example, South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg has been running ads titled \"Affordability,\" \"Choice,\" and \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" in New Hampshire.  \"Where I part ways with Senator Warren and Senator Sanders is, I think the way to do it is \u2013 I call it Medicare for All Who Want It,\" Buttigieg said last month in Austin.  On \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" Friday, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar was more direct.  \"If someone is looking to kick 140 million Americans off their current health insurance in four years, then I'm not your candidate,\" she said in response to a question about whether Warren is too far left to win a general election.  Those are attacks that could be leveled as easily at Sanders as at Warren. But unlike Sanders, the greatest risk for Warren may be that she has to directly address Medicare for All. While Sanders has conceded he would raise middle class taxes to pay for the program, Warren has so far avoided directly acknowledging that implementing Medicare for All would result in a tax hike on the middle class. When asked, she usually says that costs overall would go down for American families. Longtime Warren ally Harry Reid questioned Warren's loyalty to Medicare for All in an interview with David Axelrod on CNN Saturday.  \"You give her some time. I think that she's not in love with that. You'll wait and see how that all turns out,\" Reid said.  Warren has been consistent in her general support of Sanders' Medicare for All bill, which doesn't include a full plan to fund the program. No candidate has released a full funding plan for Medicare for All, but the question about middle-class taxes is almost certain to come up in the debate. She will have to walk a tightrope on the issue in the debate. She came under fire from the far left after she called Medicare for All a \"framework\" in New Hampshire last month. And the competition to her right has already laid the groundwork for an attack accusing her of wanting to take away personal choice in health care. Watch: What will Warren say about on Medicare for All? Will she depart from Sanders on this, and will she address its costs for middle-class families? \u00a0  JOE BIDEN Since the last debate, Biden, to his dismay, landed a starring role in the political drama of the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson notes. While he'll likely continue to aim to pitch his more moderate plans as more realistic than those of his Democratic rivals, it is nearly certain he'll be asked about the central narrative of what Trump wanted the Ukraine government to investigate \u2014 Hunter Biden's position with Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, which he accepted while his father was running U.S. policy in Ukraine and trying to root out corruption.\u00a0 For the past 22 days, Biden has responded to Mr. Trump's unproven claims of Biden family corruption by declaring they have no merit because there is \"zero\" evidence of wrongdoing. But late on Sunday in Altoona, Iowa, Biden told reporters that if he wins the presidency, his family members will not work in foreign companies. This change comes after his son, Hunter, released a statement through his lawyer earlier Sunday morning stating that if his father wins the White House he would stop working for foreign companies.\u00a0 Biden told reporters that this was Hunter Biden's decision alone. Asked by CBS News why Hunter could not continue in the role if there was no conflict of interest, Biden stood by his son. \"He could,\"\u00a0he said in part. This answers a question many of his Democratic rivals have been asked regarding whether or not they would allow their vice president's family members to serve within foreign companies. Most of his rivals defended the Bidens (Sen. Kamala Harris declared: \"Leave Joe Biden alone!\"), while others drew a contrast with him on this point.\u00a0 Watch: Will the Bidens' statements today fend off potential criticism from other candidates on stage? \u00a0\u00a0 Or will Biden pivot to the retorts he has relied upon throughout this episode? He has focused lately on what he views as the offenses which seem like impeachable offenses by President Trump. Last week Biden became the 19th of 19 Democratic candidates to endorse the House impeachment inquiry, decrying the president for \"shooting holes in the Constitution\" and blocking congressional oversight. He also highlighted the president's\u00a0 actions as further evidence for what he labels the \"most corrupt\" administration in history. He has even begun using the episode as fodder to mock the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as \"a man of great integrity\" and his two now-arrested associates as Mr. Trump's top global ambassadors. He is also using the president's campaign against him as evidence that he has the best chance in the field to beat Mr. Trump in 2020, or at least as proof that the president considers Biden to be his toughest competition. The newest rallying cry from Biden is that he can beat Trump \"like a drum,\"\u00a0but on stage Tuesday night, will his rivals like Sen. Elizabeth Warren who is now neck and neck with him in the most recent polls allow him to continue to claim the high-ground of electability? BERNIE SANDERS Since Sanders suffered a heart attack almost two weeks ago, he has been absent from the campaign trail, making this debate his grand return. Perhaps some voters who were mulling Sanders over may see the health setback as a reason to support another candidate.\u00a0 Sanders has stalled in recent polls \u2014he's at 17% in Sunday's CBS News poll, behind Biden and Warren \u2014 but he has always relished the underdog role, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte. It also remains to be seen whether he'll continue not to attack Warren, now the front-runner whom he has so far declined to criticize on stage.\u00a0 Watch: Can Sanders, the oldest candidate running, convince Democratic voters that his heart attack won't slow him down? Will he go on the attack against ally Warren, who has been pulling ahead of the pack?\u00a0 AMY KLOBUCHAR The last debate for Klobuchar became the mise en sc\u00e8ne of her\u00a0newest campaign ad.\u00a0 \"If you feel stuck in the middle of the extremes of our politics and you are tired of the noise, you've got a home with me,\" Klobuchar says, highlighting her debate pitch in the ad. CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson points out that the Minnesota senator benefitted from the limited number of candidates on stage last month, since there were fewer moderates on stage pushing back on the progressive policies advocated by some of the top-polling candidates.\u00a0 Watch: At least one Iowa poll indicates Klobuchar's debate performance may have contributed to her small positive bump. But now with more candidates on stage, will Klobuchar find it too hard to make herself heard from the wings of the stage?\u00a0 CORY BOOKER Booker said in a gaggle last week that his preparation for Tuesday's debate is \"similar\" to his approach for the last debate, reports CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman.\u00a0The New Jersey senator told reporters, \"So, everything I'm going to do up there is to try to show people my heart, what my spirit's about, the ideas I have.\" He has made it onto the stage for the previous three debates and has turned in solid performances, but hasn't had a breakout moment so far. After reaching a fundraising goal at the end of the third quarter, Booker went on an RV tour in Iowa, where he drew enthusiastic crowds. Watch: With more candidates on the debate stage than the previous debates, will Booker be able to break out of the pack and build some momentum?\u00a0 KAMALA HARRIS \t  Harris heads into Tuesday's debate amid a downtick in recent polls, CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry notes. The California senator has struggled to gain the momentum that she once had after her strong performance in the first Democratic debate.\u00a0  Harris spent the weekend hosting a block party in Iowa and has been capitalizing on the impeachment news surrounding President Trump. However, she has so far not been successful in presenting her policy proposals in a clear and concise package, as her fellow Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have.\u00a0 \t  Watch: How will Harris attempt to stand out on a crowded stage while keeping her more moderate positions? BETO O'ROURKE \t  During the last debate, which was in his home state of Texas, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke had arguably his strongest debate performance yet. In a response on whether or not he would support a mandatory gun buyback program for assault weapons, O'Rourke replied, \"Hell yes,\" and has since been championing stricter gun control measures on the campaign trail.\u00a0  It's a stance that has put him at odds with another Democratic candidate, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, notes Perry. The two candidates have been trading jabs with each other in the weeks since the last debate. It's significant because since entering the race, O'Rourke had refused to fight with fellow Democrats and instead focused his line of attack on President Trump. In the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, O'Rourke has seen a slight improvement in the poll, coming in at 4% nationally.\u00a0  Watch: Will O'Rourke continue to attack Buttigieg on the national stage or play it safe and not engage in the intra-party fighting? \t  JULI\u00c1N CASTRO \t  The former housing and urban development secretary had one of the biggest moments of the last debate with his exchange with former Vice President Joe Biden on healthcare that seemed to many to be a slap at his age \u2014 \"are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago,\" he prodded Biden \u2014 but the moment did not translate into a bump in his poll numbers, Perry points out. Castro continues to release detailed policy proposals, but hasn't been gaining the same traction that Senator Elizabeth Warren has been receiving for her proposals.\u00a0 With time running out for Castro to make the November debate, Tuesday's debate could be a make-or-break moment for his campaign.\u00a0 Castro has spent the last few days in San Antonio preparing for the debate.\u00a0 \t  Watch: Will Castro target Biden again in a bid to stand out on the stage?  PETE BUTTIGIEG\u00a0 After the third Democratic debate in September, Buttigieg released his \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" plan, which includes a public option and does not eliminate private insurance plans. His approach contrasts with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who advocate for Medicare for All, a single-payer health care plan. Buttigieg has been making this distinction frequently in his stump speeches on the trail and in digital advertisement campaigns, notes Turman.  Asked in a gaggle in Nevada earlier this month about the health care debate in the Democratic party, Buttigieg said, \"I just have an honest respectful disagreement with folks like Senator Warren who believe that we should throw a switch and kick everybody off their private plans.\"  Watch: Will Buttigieg continue to pitch himself as the electable alternative, drawing distinctions with the progressive Medicare for All plans espoused by Warren and Sanders?  ANDREW YANG\u00a0 At the third debate, Andrew Yang managed to raise over a million dollars in just a few days after announcing a freedom dividend pilot program, reports\u00a0CBS News associate producer Ben Mitchell. Over the weekend, Yang teased another big debate announcement, which is likely to be an attempt to help generate more earned media coverage while impeachment continues to chew up the minutes on every news program. Yang had a big third quarter for fundraising, but his poll numbers in the early states have stagnated.\u00a0 Watch: The debate is a great opportunity to juice those numbers a bit (like Kamala Harris did over the Summer). TOM STEYER Steyer will make his debut on the debate stage Tuesday. The billionaire, who has tried to make a name for himself over the past few years with efforts to impeach President Donald Trump and support for progressive candidates, is largely untested in a debate environment. But with strong advertising efforts in early contest states, he's already qualified for the November stage. Asked Thursday how he's preparing for his first debate, he joked that he was taking questions from reporters, reports Hudak. WATCH: How will Tom Steyer present himself to the American people in his first-ever presidential debate appearance? TULSI GABBARD\u00a0 Gabbard announced on Twitter a couple days ago that she is \"seriously considering\" boycotting the Democratic debate this coming Tuesday. Gabbard, who qualified for the October debate but did not qualify for the Democratic debate in September, accused the Democratic National Committee and the corporate media of \"rigging\" the primary election, says Turman. If she declines to debate, she would be the only person to qualify for the debate who does not appear onstage Tuesday.  The Hawaii congresswoman has also criticized the DNC's transparency in regards to the polls used to qualify for the debates leading up to the third Democratic debate. When voters last saw Gabbard on the debate stage in July, she made a splash by attacking Harris' record as a prosecutor in California.  Watch: Will she participate in the debate? And if she does participate, will she criticize another one of her opponents?  Early-state Democratic voters say President Trump's allegations against Joe Biden have not affected their views of Biden and largely think they aren't true. Even so, it's Elizabeth Warren who continues to draw support from Democrats. She has extended the aggregate lead she had\u00a0in this poll last month\u00a0across the 18 early primary and caucus states.\u00a0 As for individual states, she has increased her lead over the pack in New Hampshire and pulled even with Biden in Iowa. And Warren leads in\u00a0our delegate model\u00a0over Biden, too, demonstrating that she's competitive in many regions. Read more about the latest CBS News poll\u00a0here. While a majority of Americans (63%) say the Trump administration should cooperate with the impeachment inquiry, most Republicans disagree and feel the administration should not, as the partisan divide has hardened on impeachment matters in the last two weeks. Some 37% of Americans say the administration should not cooperate, according to a\u00a0new CBS News poll. The next governor for Louisiana will have to be decided in November, with incumbent Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards falling shy of the 50% needed to win Saturday's \"jungle\" primary outright, according to\u00a0The Associated Press. After being neck-and-neck for the last push of the race, businessman Eddie Rispone beat out U.S. Representative Ralph Abraham for the Republican spot in the runoff and secured the second-most amount of votes with about 28%of the vote,\u00a0CBS News Political Unit broacast associate Aaron Navarro notes. Rispone was able to escape a close and brutal primary with Abraham, where the two consistently clashed with each other on the debate stage and through television ads. Prior to Saturday, he was either tied or leading Abraham by single digits in the polls.

            "article_content": "President Trump's campaign\u00a0appears unconcerned by recent news from Twitter that it will no longer allow political ads on the platform. According to a Trump campaign official, it won't significantly impact the campaign, though it's \"a mistake by Twitter,\" reports\u00a0CBS News White House producer Fin Gomez\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. The campaign will still get their message out to likely voters on the platform since \"POTUS does a pretty good job of communicating a message on Twitter as is.\" NEW HAMPSHIRE Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders filed for the New Hampshire primaries late this morning, officially adding his name to the \"first-in-the-nation\" primary ballot, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Nicole Sganga and\u00a0Cara Korte. He thanked New Hampshire for granting him his first primary win in 2016.\u00a0 \"New Hampshire went first in giving us a victory!\" Sanders exclaimed after signing his declaration of candidacy. Sanders won the 2016 New Hampshire primary by more than 20 points over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Sanders, a current front-runner in the Granite State, aimed to distinguish himself from the competition, in particular, former Vice President Joe Biden. \"If my memory is correct, Joe Biden once said, and I'm paraphrasing, 'You got to be careful about people who have super PACs, and who they will end up being responsible for,'\" Sanders told reporters. \"In this campaign, Joe, as I understand it, has not done particularly well at getting a lot of donations from working class people.\" The Vermont Senator doubled down on his opposition to Joe Biden's healthcare plan, saying, \"I want Joe to explain to the American people. How much will the premiums go up? How much will copayments go up? How many more people will go bankrupt because they cannot afford medical bills, because they were diagnosed with cancer, heart disease, was some other illness?\" Sanders said his health care plan has \"options\" for Congress, when it comes to funding \"Medicare for All,\" including income-based premiums paid for by employers or households, plus a more progressive income tax. \"No proposal coming from a presidential candidate is going to be adopted word for word, line by line, by Congress. But we have done I think the right thing. We have presented a number of options.\" Sanders later added, \"I'm sure Senator Warren will work on her proposal. We'll have more details and we'll go forward.\" He has mixed feelings about Twitter's elimination of political advertisements on its platform, announced yesterday by co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey. Sanders called Congress \"woefully negligent\" in dealing with social media platforms, adding, \"Here's a problem. One guy, the guy who runs twitter, wakes up in the morning and says that's what we're going to do. Wow. That's a lot of power for one person to have.\" VOTING ACCESS The Texas Democratic Party, DSCC and the DCCC are joining forces in a lawsuit to overturn what they're calling a ban on mobile early voting in Texas, reports\u00a0CBS News associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. According to Texas Democrats, mobile voting sites near college campuses helped spur an 18% surge in voter turnout in the 2018 midterms, and the youth early vote rose by 508% from the 2014 midterm.\u00a0 However, in the last Texas legislative session, Texas Republicans passed House bill 1888 which went into effect September 1, requiring early voting locations to operate a full day and stay open the same number of days as the main early voting location in each county.\u00a0 Democrats argue that counties don't have the financial resources to keep them all open permanently and as a result, there are fewer locations open in 2019. The Texas Democratic Party, DSCC and DCCC are now accusing Republicans of trying to make it harder for Texans to cast ballots especially around campuses and in rural areas and are now asking a federal judge for an injunction. Meanwhile, Priorities USA filed a lawsuit challenging Michigan's signature matching law this week. That law requires election officials to compare signatures on absentee ballots with voter files signatures and to reject ones that don't match. The progressive organization is pointing out there's no process to rectify an absentee ballot rejected and different standards for the procedure in different townships and cities. The group argues the law violates the constitutional right to vote and are challenging it. This comes after Michigan voters in 2018 passed a ballot proposal allowing for no excuse absentee voting in the 40 days leading up to the election, meaning there could be a spike in absentee voting in future elections. CYBERSECURITY:\u00a0Federal party committees and political campaigns will now be eligible to receive free or reduced-cost cybersecurity services from the nonpartisan non-profit group Defending Digital Campaigns,\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ben Mitchell\u00a0reports. The group officially launched today after receiving special permission to operate from the Federal Elections Commission in May. Defending Digital Campaigns is helmed by CEO Michael Kaiser, former Executive Director of the National Cyber Security Alliance, and the board includes a bipartisan pair of presidential campaign veterans: Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign manager, and Matt Rhoades, Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign manager. On its website, the group says it hopes to remove \"cost and expertise as barriers to security.\" SENATE ENDORSEMENTS On Thursday, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee rolled out two new endorsements for 2020 elections, notes\u00a0CBS News associate producer Eleanor Watson. In Kansas, the committee endorsed State Senator Barbara Bollier who is running in the Democratic primary to fill the seat left open by GOP Senator Pat Roberts' retirement. Emily's List also endorsed Bollier Thursday morning. In North Carolina, the committee endorsed Army veteran Cal Cunningham in the Democratic primary to take on GOP Senator Thom Tillis in the 2020 general election. In 2010, Cunningham lost the Democratic primary to Elaine Marshall in the Democrats' bid to unseat GOP Senator Richard Burr. This cycle, Cunningham has to compete against Erica Smith and Trevor Fuller\u00a0in the primary before advancing to face Tillis in the general election. IMPEACHMENT After a 232-196 vote, the rules are officially set for the House impeachment inquiry into President Trump. Most Democrats and Republicans voted along party lines, with two Democrats voting \"no\" and one independent, Justin Amash from Michigan, voting in favor of the inquiry. Each of these three have their own terrain to navigate for 2020 says\u00a0CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. Representatives Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, are both from Trump-won districts. Van Drew confirmed to CBS News before the vote that he would vote no and received a \"thank you\" from Mr. Trump on Twitter for telling Fox & Friends, \"Let the people impeach\u2026 we are going to have an election very shortly.\" He told CBS News yesterday \"obviously he's going to be impeached\" in the House and that he believes Trump will be \"vindicated\" in the Senate.\u00a0 \"I'm not sure that's what everybody wants as a result to be really honest with you. And I also think we've spent a lot of money and a lot of time and haven't been able to get a lot of things done,\" he said. A member of the 2018 freshmen class, Van Drew won by a 7-point margin over Republican Frank LoBiondo, who held the seat from 1995 to 2018. Peterson has held his western Minnesota seat since 1990 but is in a district Trump won by 30 points in 2016, the highest margin of any Democrat-held seat. Currently, five Republicans have filed to run for the seat, one of whom (former state senator and Lt. Gov Michelle Fischbach) recently received the endorsement of House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy.\u00a0 Peterson has more than\u00a0$900,000\u00a0cash on hand and has defeated Republicans for 15 straight terms, though he had a close 4-point win against Republican Dave Hughes in 2018. A Democrat strategist said their two votes Thursday will not impact their 2020 races \"in a measureable way.\" Amash, a converted independent from the Republican party, won his district by more than 11 points in 2018. Mr. Trump, who Amash\u00a0said back in May\u00a0met the \"threshold for impeachment\" after the Mueller report, won his district by 10 points in 2016. Since first speaking out, Amash has been called a\u00a0\"loser\"\u00a0 by Trump and has had more than six Democratic and Republican challengers jump in. He has brought in more than $444,000 for his campaign, but Republican challenger Peter Meijer is trailing close by with $410,149. Presidential campaigns also weighed in on the House impeachment inquiry resolution. In a statement from the Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale, \"Every American can see this for what it is: an attempt to remove a duly-elected president for strictly political reasons by a strictly partisan, illegitimate process. Today's vote merely proves that the entire impeachment process was a sham from the beginning and Nancy Pelosi can't legitimize it after the fact.\"\u00a0 Democrat candidate Pete Buttigieg\u00a0Tweeted, \"This president took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. So did every member of Congress. This president violated that oath, betraying our country and leaving our representatives with no choice but to uphold their own. Congress must move forward with impeachment.\"\u00a0 Senator Cory Booker, who would be part of the impeachment trials if articles are passed by the House,\u00a0tweeted\u00a0he was \"Proud of House Democrats for putting partisan politics aside and setting up a process that builds consensus by ensuring the American people see the damning evidence.\" BOO! AND HAPPY HALLOWEEN... Cory Booker joined in the Halloween festivities Thursday by changing his Twitter name to \"Gory BOOker\" with an accompanying ghost emoji, Representative Katie Porter also took part by showing up to Congress dressed as \"Batgirl.\"\u00a0CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron\u00a0Navarro\u00a0reports that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used All Hallow's Eve to launch\u00a0McConnellGraveyard.com, a website highlighting bills passed by the House but not taken up for a vote by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Tombstones on the website feature details on House resolutions like the \"Bipartisan Background Checks Act\" dealing with gun violence or the \"For the People Act\" dealing with election and campaign financing, as well as how many days since it has been passed by the House. \u00a0 House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries\u00a0also decorated his office\u00a0with a \"Senate Legislative Graveyard,\" featuring a grim reaper, in allusion to the nickname McConnell has bestowed upon himself.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden formally launched his presidential campaign with a rally in Pittsburgh on Monday, kicking off his third bid for the presidency. He returned to the campaign trail surrounded by members of an influential local labor union and buoyed by an earlier\u00a0endorsement from the International Association of Fire Fighters. Biden said he chose to launch his campaign in Pittsburgh because he said the city is one of those that \"represent the cities and towns that make up hard-working, middle class Americans who are the backbone of this nation.\" Besides, he added, \"If I'm going to be able to beat Donald Trump in 2020, it's going to happen here.\" The  local union group, Teamsters Local 429, hosted the rally but is not yet endorsing him due to the large field of candidates. It's labor and union voters like the ones who packed a tiny auditorium Monday who Biden is eager to win over. Their support could make a Pennsylvania win easier for him, given that they comprise around 12 percent of employees in Pittsburgh and about 665,000  workers across Pennsylvania, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2016, President Trump won every county in Western Pennsylvania besides Allegheny County, the home of Pittsburgh. Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for president, won more than  56 percent of the \"Steel City\" vote. \"Based  up on his values and his record he can demonstrate to voters in [western Pennsylvania] that he's not only going to fight for the middle class but that he's got a track record of delivering results for the middle class,\" Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania told CBS News in a phone interview before Monday's event. Many  Democrats here say they are excited to be the first desire of Biden's campaign but added it's too early to endorse a candidate. \"He  presents himself well and he is straight shooter and wants to do right for the working family,\" Rocco Difilippo, a leader of the Teamsters Local 429 union shop and former postal service driver, said, \"So I do like Joe but now it is too early to endorse anybody.\" \"He  stands behind us as a steelworker, and he's for the working class,\" Rose Faust told CBS News.\"He stands with those of us who are in exactly in the middle ... Joe is sincere. He says what he means and he will come through.\" Biden  launched his campaign last Thursday with a video that aimed squarely at Mr. Trump and his response to the 2017 white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va. In the days since, the president has revived his \"Sleepy Joe\" moniker for the former veep and  has questioned whether the 76-year old Biden is physically and mentally capable of taking on the 72-year old president.  In  the days since his launch, Biden has raised roughly $7 million, a sum that helped quickly quell criticism and concern that he would be unable to reap financial support in a field packed with other contenders far more proven to quickly be able to amass millions  of dollars.  While  Monday's rally was on familiar territory, Biden ventures next into Iowa, where he placed fifth in a six-way Iowa caucus in 2008 and sputtered during his short-lived 1988 campaign. He heads later in the week to South Carolina and Nevada, before making fundraising  stops in California and venturing on to New Hampshire.

            "article_content": "Entering the year-old workspace ModernWell feels like coming into a comfortable spa. Clean lines give way to cozy touches like footstools covered with faux fur and a roaring fire surrounded by comfortable armchairs. Women type away on laptops at tables scattered throughout. Not a man is in sight. ModernWell is one of a growing number of women-only and women-focused workspaces around the country. While many predate the #MeToo movement, their growth has been interlinked with it as it put combating workplace harassment on the national agenda. They're also tapping into a desire among many women to build a community and supportive environment at work that's different from a stereotypical corporate workplace culture. The spaces provide more than just desks and a coffee machine. They offer programs like high-profile speakers or yoga classes, and a chance to build a social and business network with like-minded women. It's like WeWork, minus the beer on tap and tech bro atmosphere. \"I think women, especially, are craving safe spaces where they can go and be inspired and do really important work without interruption, and without being reminded of all that, too. There's literally no risk that somebody's going to sexually harass me here,\" said Renee Powers, a ModernWell member who founded her business, Feminist Book Club, in the space. The biggest player is The Wing, which opened in 2016 in New York and has been expanding rapidly across the country. Its San Francisco location opened in October with a nod to the #MeToo movement, naming a conference room after Christine Blasey Ford, who testified before Congress that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in high school. Kavanaugh denied the allegation and was confirmed to the court. Membership to use one location costs $2,350 annually, and The Wing now has more than 6,000 members, spokeswoman Zara Rahim said. Most of the spaces allow men, but some do not. The Wing was sued by a Washington, D.C., man who alleged discrimination. Its board soon after approved a membership policy providing that an applicant's gender identity would not be considered, a development first reported by Insider. Rahim said the policy was being developed before the lawsuit and was unrelated to it.  The Wing is also under investigation by the New York City Commission on Human Rights for gender-based discrimination. The Wing said it is working with the commission. Another fast-growing space is The Riveter, with five locations in Seattle and Los Angeles and plans to open in Austin, Texas, in March. About 20 percent of its members are building venture-scale startups, but the majority are small businesses with just a few employees or people who work on their own such as lawyers or real estate agents, founder and CEO Amy Nelson said. Its costs range from $99 to hundreds of dollars monthly. About one-quarter of The Riveter's 2,000 members are men, Nelson said, but the difference is that \"out of the gate we're putting women first.\" \"I think that we're seeing a societal shift that isn't going to go away,\" she said. \"Women's voices are being heard.\" The space has brought in high-profile speakers such as Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg and offers activities such as office hours with a venture capital firm and seminars on digital mindfulness or wellness. That kind of programming sets the spaces apart from more general ones, said Steve King of Emergent Research, who studies the future of work and the rise of the independent workforce. ModernWell founder Julie Burton, an author and wellness instructor, teaches yoga at her space, which also offers events such as a class on women's memoir writing. Burton said her space grew out of a writing group she co-founded in 2015, which coincidentally was women-only. After the 2016 presidential election, she said many women she knew were upset and she felt galvanized to build a business to help women support each other and empower themselves. \"Whether you are out marching or not marching, I felt we had work to do, and I wanted to be part of the work,\" she said. The space has given women from different industries and professional backgrounds a chance to connect, she said. Those connections help women support each other, battling feelings such as \"imposter syndrome,\" where women question whether they have the qualifications to start a company or embark on a particular venture, Burton said. That community feeling is what draws some women to the spaces, said Jamie Russo, executive director of the Global Workspace Association. Co-working spaces in general are on the rise, and as the sector grows, different niches have developed to serve different groups, such as attorneys or people working in real estate, technology, big data or artificial intelligence. For the operators, niche spaces tend to be more profitable than more general workspaces, Russo said. An analysis by King's firm estimated more than 14,000 co-working spaces and 1.7 million members globally in 2017 and forecast around 30,000 spaces and 5.1 million members by 2022. Little data about women-centric spaces is available, and while the segment is growing, it's expected to remain a relatively small niche in the industry, King said. Some spaces offer child care, but until now it has been rare, likely due to complicated state and local laws concerning child care, King said. That may be changing. The Wing will offer child care starting this week in one of its New York City locations and soon in Los Angeles. Jasna Burza, a life and business coach, has a home office but prefers to do her work at ModernWell, where a community of women greets her. She compares coming to the space to the old TV show \"Cheers,\" where everyone knows her name. \"It can be really isolating to be on my own,\" Burza said. \"I come here, and it's my happy place.\"",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden spent eight years as vice president under Barack Obama and 36 years in the U.S. Senate. He has been leading the Democratic field for the 2020 presidential nomination, but the race is tightening. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have energized the young, progressive wing of the party and argue that Biden's policy proposals don't go far enough. But his most powerful and vocal opponent is the president of the United States, who is facing an impeachment inquiry over whether he pressured the Ukrainian government to dig up dirt on Biden and his son, Hunter. We talked with Joe Biden at his home in Delaware earlier this week where we covered a wide variety of topics, including why Democrats should be excited about voting for a candidate who is about to turn 77 years old. Norah O'Donnell: The Democratic party has had Jack Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama. This is your third run for president. Why Joe Biden? Joe Biden: Well, because I think, as I said we need somebody who, on day one, knows exactly what to do. Can command the world stage. No one wonders whether I know a great deal about these issues and foreign policy and domestic policy. They're things I've done. Norah O'Donnell: And that might be one of the criticisms too, that you're offering essentially four more years of a Obama-like administration. Joe Biden: Well, let me tell you something, I-- I love the fact that, all of a sudden, the Democratic party doesn't think Obama was that great a president. I-- I find that fascinating. Norah O'Donnell: Some have asked, why hasn't President Obama endorsed you? You guys served together for eight years. Joe Biden: Because I have to own-- I wanna earn this on my own. Norah O'Donnell: Did he offer to endorse you? Joe Biden: No, we didn't even get there. I asked him not to. He said, \"Okay.\" I think it's better-- I think he thinks it's better for me. I have no doubt when I'm the nominee he'll be out on the campaign trail for me. Today marks 99 days until the Iowa caucuses, the first Democratic contest. Despite his strength in the polls, Joe Biden tends not to draw a lot of young people to his campaign events, a problem some of his competitors don't have.\u00a0 Norah O'Donnell: Your opponents, because they're promising so much change, they seem to be igniting the Democratic base that turns out in the primary, younger voters.\u00a0 Joe Biden: The fact of the matter is that if you take a look at who votes in these primaries, overwhelmingly, people over the age of 50 who vote in these primaries. I want more young people engaged. I want them voting. But the idea that this is the way in which it's gonna change is-- by just making the most far-reaching assertions you can make. I mean, let's talk about Medicare For All. Do you think there's been any truth in advertising on that It's gonna raise taxes on middle class people, not just wealthy people. Norah O'Donnell: You're talking-- Joe Biden: So-- Norah O'Donnell: --about Elizabeth Warren? Joe Biden: Well, I'm not only talking about-- even Bernie acknowledges you gotta raise taxes. Norah O'Donnell: Elizabeth Warren says she's gonna propose a wealth tax. $0.02 on the dollar for every dollar over $50 million. She says that money can be used to improve teacher salaries, provide tuition free public college and wipe out student debt. Joe Biden: I don't oppose a wealth tax. I propose changing the whole tax system. The tax I would put on the wealthy will in fact cost more than 2% because they're not gonna be able to take a capital gain. They're gonna pay at 40% like everybody else, 39.8%. Norah O'Donnell: You've said you would repeal all of Trump's tax cuts. But do you mean just for the wealthy or for the middle class too because Trump did give the middle class a tax cut? Joe Biden: Well, Trump gave the middle class a tax cut that was negligible. The fact is that what we should be doing is making sure that the wealthy pay their fair share. Norah O'Donnell: So over-- making over how much per year? What's wealthy? Joe Biden: Making over $400,000 a year. And those tax cuts'll be repealed. And people making between $250,000 and $400,000 would in-- their tax rate would increase. But here's the deal. What the middle class people really care about is can they afford education. Can they afford their health care. I would take the money and I'd pay for the health care proposal I put forward, I'd pay for education. So there's a whole range of things that go directly to affect middle class people. The skirmishes within the Democratic Party have been overshadowed recently by questions of foreign interference in the upcoming election. This past Monday, Facebook announced it removed fake Russian accounts on social media that attacked Joe Biden. The news broke the day before we spoke with Biden and his wife Jill, who joined us for part of our interview. Norah O'Donnell: The Russians are targeting you. Joe Biden: The Russians don't want me to be president and Trump doesn't want me-- me-- Jill Biden: Yeah. Joe Biden: --to be the nominee. There's certain things that come across very, very clearly. Norah O'Donnell: I mean, how concerned are you about foreign interference in this election? Joe Biden: I'm very concerned about foreign interference, beyond me. Everybody knows what's going on. Trump not only doesn't wanna do anything about it he's going out and asking for help. Come help me. Come help me defeat-- keep Biden from bein' the nominee-- Jill Biden: He's perpetuating. Norah O'Donnell: How is he perpetuating it? Jill Biden: Well, by encouraging them to-- you know, to get involved in our elections. Norah O'Donnell: But President Trump says Russian interference is a hoax. Joe Biden: He's an idiot-- in terms of sayin' that. Everybody knows this. Everybody knows it. Nobody doubts it. While Facebook removed the fake Russian accounts, it refused a request by Biden's campaign to take down political ads paid for by the Trump campaign making claims that Biden says are not true. Joe Biden: Facebook is running, right now, paid advertising by Trump that everybody knows is a flat lie. You know, I'm glad they brought the Russians down. Why don't you bring down the lies that Trump is telling and everybody knows are lies? Norah O'Donnell: Are you concerned that the president saying this over and over again, his campaign ads saying over and over again, that people will start to believe it? He's attacking your integrity. Joe Biden: Sure he is. And-- but it's comin' from a man with no integrity so it helps. (LAUGH) No, I-- I sincerely mean it. I-- I never thought I'd talk about a president this way. In a statement to 60 Minutes, a White House spokesperson said President Trump \"takes election security seriously,\" and has \"delivered both offensive sanctions and defensive hardening of our election security.\" And the president continues to argue there should be an investigation into Hunter Biden's work for a Ukrainian gas company called Burisma during the time his father was vice president and overseeing U.S. policy in Ukraine. Hunter Biden was reportedly paid $50,000 to $80,000 a month for several years while serving on Burisma's board. Norah O'Donnell: Hunter said the only thing you said to him was, quote, \"I hope you know what you're doing.\" Joe Biden: That's exactly right. He's a grown-- Norah O'Donnell: What do you-- Joe Biden: --man. What I meant by that is I hope you've thought this through. I hope you know exactly what you're doin' here.\u00a0 Norah O'Donnell: Meaning what? Joe Biden: That's all I meant. Nothing more than that because I've never discussed my business or their business, my sons' or daughter's. And I've never discussed them because they know where I have to do my job and that's it and they have to make their own judgments. Norah O'Donnell: But you understand people say, \"Joe Biden, he's an experienced politician, statesman, knows the issues of Ukraine. Why didn't he just say to his son, 'this is one to take a pass on. It may not look good'\"? \u00a0Joe Biden: He was already on the board. And he's a grown man. And it turns out he did not do a single thing wrong, as everybody's investigated. Norah O'Donnell: President Trump has said publicly, \"Joe Biden and his son are stone cold corrupt.\" And chances are, he's watching this interview. Anything-- Joe Biden: I-- Mr. pre-- Norah O'Donnell: --you wanna say to him? Joe Biden: Yeah. Mr. President, release your tax returns. Let's see how straight you are, okay old buddy? I put out 21 years of mine. So show us your tax returns, bud-- wh-- what are you hiding? You wanna deal with corruption? Start to act like it. Release your tax returns or shut up. The general election is more than a year away, but on the campaign trail you wouldn't know it, listening to President Trump and his son Eric attack Hunter Biden at rallies, where crowds chant, \"lock him up.\" Norah O'Donnell: Are you sorry you dragged your family into this? Joe Biden: Oh, I d-- I-- I'm not sorry-- look, w-- we- Jill Biden: We didn't drag them into it. I mean, they- Joe Biden: And by the way- Jill Biden: --they came to us. You know, you have to run. They knew it was gonna be rough. Norah O'Donnell: Do you believe President Trump's children have acted properly and avoided conflicts of interest? Joe Biden: I wasn't raised to go after the children. Their actions speak for themselves. I can just tell you this, that if I'm president get elected president my children are not gonna have offices in the White House. My children are not gonna sit in on Cabinet meetings. Norah O'Donnell: What's improper about that? Joe Biden: It's just simply improper because you should make it clear to the American public that everything you're doing is for them. For them. And the idea that you're gonna have his children his-- son-in-law, et cetera, engaged in the day-to-day operation of things they know nothing about. Norah O'Donnell: You don't think that Jared Kushner should be negotiating a Middle East peace solution? Joe Biden: No, I don't. (LAUGH) I don't. What-- what credentials does he bring to that? Norah O'Donnell: Let's talk about the state of the race because it has tightened. Do you still consider yourself the frontrunner? Joe Biden: I know I'm the frontrunner. Find me a national poll with a notable-- a couple exceptions. But look, this is a marathon. Jill Biden: Yeah. Joe Biden: This is a marathon. Norah O'Donnell: You can look at the last campaign finance-- filing. We looked at that. You have less than $9 million in the bank. Bernie Sanders has 30-- nearly $34 million in the bank. Senator Warren has $26 million. How do you compete against that? Joe Biden: I just flat beat them. (LAUGH) We're on a course to do extremely well. I'm not--I'm not worried about being able to fund this campaign. I really am not, truly. Since our interview, Biden has dropped his opposition to the formation of a superpac, an independent political action committee that can raise unlimited sums from corporations, unions, and big donors. Something his two main rivals, Warren and Sanders, have pledged not to do. Norah O'Donnell: How would you rate your performance in the debates? Joe Biden: A learning curve. And by that, I mean, they're not debates. (LAUGH) They're one-minute assertions. When someone says, you know you've done something awful, that's not true, respond in 30 seconds, you know, it's-- it's-- it's awful hard to-- it's awful hard to do. Norah O'Donnell: But you've made a number of gaffes in the debates. In an October debate, you confused Syria with Iraq. In the September debate, you conflated Iraq and Afghanistan. Norah O'Donnell: When you're watching these debates, do you worry about the gaffes? Jill Biden: No. I don't worry about the gaffes. And, you know what, the American people know who Joe Biden is. I mean, if he misspeaks one word, they don't-- that doesn't affect the way they're gonna vote, one way or the other. Norah O'Donnell: Some Democrats worry and wonder whether you'll be fast enough on your feet, quick enough, to defend yourself against President Trump. Joe Biden: What they're r-- really tryin' to make the case is about age. And with age comes experience, with experience comes wisdom, and with wisdom comes judgment. Norah O'Donnell: You know he calls you sleepy Joe? Joe Biden: I know that. (LAUGH) Norah O'Donnell: You will be 77 in November. Is that too old to be president? Joe Biden: No. I just say watch me. Just-- just watch. Norah O'Donnell: Have you seen any change in his ability to communicate in recent years? Jill Biden: No. (LAUGH) Not at all. The unemployment rate in September was 3.5%, The lowest it's been in half a century. And if the economy remains strong next year, President Trump will not miss an opportunity to remind voters of that fact, nor a chance to bash those seeking to impeach him. \u00a0 Joe Biden: I think he thinks that if you say the big lie enough, you keep repeating it, repeating it,\u00a0 people will believe it. But this time, it's different. Norah O'Donnell: You were in the Senate for 36 years. You know a lot of these Republican senators well. What would it take for 20 or more Republican senators to vote to remove the president from office? Joe Biden: For the people in their district to say, in their state, to say, \"Enough. We're holding you responsible.\" Norah O'Donnell: About this election. If it doesn't work out, would you be okay with that? Could you walk away and say, \"I didn't win, but my legacy is intact\"? Joe Biden: I'm not worried about my legacy. What I am worried about is the country. Four years of Donald Trump will be very hard to overcome, but we can. Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally change the nature of who we are as a country. And it'll take a generation-- a generation or more for us to get back on track.

            "article_content": "Andrew Yang's reason for running for president isn't quite like any of his fellow Democrats in the crowded field. Ask why he's campaigning and he won't point to climate change, Wall Street, inadequate health care, or President Trump. In fact, he would like to talk a lot less about the current occupant of the Oval Office.\u00a0 He'll say the greatest threat to America \u2014 and the reason he's running for the highest office in the land \u2014 is how unprepared the country is for the automation of the American workforce. No other candidate is stressing that point. And now, after reaching the Democratic National Committee's threshold of 65,000 unique donors, he qualifies to take his case to the Democratic primary debate stage.\u00a0 \"I'm running to win,\" Yang told CBS News in a recent interview. \"But I'm also on the record as saying that if the winning candidate ends up adopting my policies and ideas then I would be thrilled with that. That I'm not someone who is lying awake in bed plotting my path to the White House, and that my goal is to try and help society manage the greatest economic and technological transformation in our history.\" Automation, Yang says and argues in his 2018 book \"The War on Normal People,\" may be revolutionizing our economy, but it's also eliminating jobs. The consulting firm McKinsey and Company estimated in a 2017 report that half of all work activities will be automated by 2055 or sooner. Last week, the Government Accountability Office released a report outlining how federal agencies are doing little to prepare for the looming automation of the trucking industry. Driving a truck was the most common job in 29 states in 2014, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\u00a0 The U.S., Yang said, is in the middle of a transition that will increasingly displace millions of retail workers, call center workers, fast food employees and truck drivers. But working class jobs aren't the only ones automation will eliminate, Yang argues. He believes even high-skill professions like doctors and accountants will be replaced by increasingly smart robots. Mr. Trump's 2016 winning campaign message of protecting the men and women who lost jobs in shuttered coal mines and factories was a \"red flag\" for Yang that automation was already undermining the American way of life.\u00a0 \"When Donald Trump won in 2016, it really was to me a giant red flag, where to me the reason why he won was that we'd automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa, most of which I had spent years working in at that point,\" Yang said. Unlike the president, Yang doesn't tell voters that most of those jobs are coming back. When Yang first came to Washington to find out what the federal government's plan for tackling the challenge was, he \"came up empty.\" So in 2017, he left his position as CEO of Venture for America, the nonprofit he founded, and officially filed his candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on Nov. 6, 2017. \"It was not like, 'Oh I'm thinking about running for president'\u2026it was more like, 'Oh my gosh, this country is reaching crisis-level problems.' And for whatever reason our political establishment seems out to lunch on the nature of the problems and meaningful solutions,\" Yang said.\u00a0 Since then, the 44-year-old Yang says has campaigned in Iowa, New Hampshire, California, Washington, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, the District of Columbia, Florida, Louisiana and Texas.\u00a0 A centerpiece of Yang's proposed solutions is universal basic income \u2013 in the ballpark of $1,000 per adult per month. That money would largely come from new value-added taxes (VAT) -- a tax placed on a product at every point of sale -- levied on technology companies driving automation advances. Yang claims a VAT tax at half the level of Europe will cover the $12,000 annual payment for adults. \u00a0 That universal basic income is intended to help supplement income that will be lost to automation while the U.S. braces for the impact and prepares for the future, Yang says. While many conservatives frown upon the idea, that hasn't always been the case. Yang points to Milton Friedman, the Nobel-winning economist who had a major influence on Republican policy making during the Reagan years, as a supporter of universal basic income.\u00a0 \"If you look at the history of this, Thomas Paine was for it at the founding of the country,\" Yang said. \"Martin Luther King was born in the 60s and then Milton Friedman and a thousand economists including many conservatives were for it in the 70s,\" Yang said. In energy-rich Alaska, Yang notes, a similar proposal was implemented by \"a Republican governor and is a deeply conservative state.\" Yang doesn't think his ideas are too liberal for conservatives. Some Trump supporters, he claims, have said they'd vote for him. \"There've been dozens, maybe hundreds, of Trump voters who have come up to me and said they voted for Donald Trump and they're gonna vote for me because I'm an outsider and a business guy. And I'm talking about solving the same problems that he was talking about.\" Yang believes the Democratic Party can win back Middle America, but to do so they're going to have to start listening to voices in the working class hardest hit by automation.\u00a0 \"l think the Democratic Party has lost sight of the solutions,\" Yang said. \"And when I was with a trucker in Iowa a couple weeks ago he said that he did not feel like the Democratic Party cared about someone like him. And I thought that was a disaster because he's a working class American. Being a trucker is the most common job in 29 states, and the Democratic Party used to stand for the working class.\"\u00a0 \"So why the heck does this trucker think the Democratic Party doesn't care about him? And that's what I think Democrats need to address if we're truly going to solve the problem that got Donald Trump elected.\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Brian Sweeney has a long list of complaints about Amazon, from the way it treats warehouse workers to the low taxes it pays and its effort to win concessions from cities to bring in jobs. So when he learned the online retail giant had poured $1 million into remaking the Seattle City Council with more business-friendly candidates, he pulled out his wallet. The New York resident sent $15 to socialist council member Kshama Sawant, a target of the online retail giant. While that doesn't compare to Amazon's unprecedented spending on October 14, about 1,900 others also have donated to Sawant since then, her campaign says. It's a dramatic rise in support and a reflection of the risk Amazon is taking as it splashes into the politics of its liberal hometown. Many in Seattle aren't happy with the council, but they also don't like a company headed by the world's richest man, Jeff Bezos, trying to influence their vote. As historic income inequality fuels homelessness and soaring housing prices, progressives elsewhere don't like it either. \"Amazon could do this in hundreds of places around the country with all the money they're not paying in taxes,\" said Sweeney, a 28-year-old software engineer turned carpenter in Valley Stream, New York. With seven of the nine Seattle council seats in play November 5, business interests see an opportunity to shift city leadership closer to the political center and away from a bent to potentially tax big companies to fund homeless services or improve public transit. The council is officially nonpartisan, but Republicans stand little chance of getting elected in Seattle, and many of the business-backed candidates are moderate to progressive Democrats. The race will decide whether the council is dominated by socialists and extremely liberal Democrats or more centrist ones. \"We are contributing to this election because we care deeply about the future of Seattle,\" Amazon spokesman Aaron Toso said in a statement. \"We believe it is critical that our hometown has a City Council that is focused on pragmatic solutions to our shared challenges in transportation, homelessness, climate change and public safety.\" Progressive Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are among those accusing Amazon of trying to buy the council. The elections come a year after a political debacle that damaged the council's popularity. The leaders unanimously passed the \"Amazon tax,\" designed to make lucrative companies contribute more to affordable housing for the homeless. It repealed the tax after a revolt from Amazon, which would have had to pay around $11 million a year and threatened to halt its growth in the city. The company said Seattle didn't need more money and that it was \"highly uncertain whether the City Council's anti-business positions or its spending inefficiency will change for the better.\" The debate helped cement Amazon's awakening to local politics as the council's popularity slipped, especially over its handling of homelessness. Four council members decided not to seek re-election. There's been little progress in the four years since the city declared a homelessness crisis. Many business interests support \"sweeps\" of homeless camps accompanied by teams to help people get services. Liberal council members, including Sawant, say the sweeps are inhumane and don't work. She wants money to create in-city \"villages\" of tiny houses for homeless people. Meanwhile, some in Sawant's district say she's more interested in building a national socialist movement than responding to their concerns. A large portion of her donations come from out of state. Sawant helped make Seattle the first big city to adopt a $15-an-hour minimum wage. She frequently says people must choose sides in \"class warfare\" and has warned that a win by Amazon would embolden corporate interests to fight efforts to make the rich pay more in taxes or spread progressive policies like tenants' rights and paid sick leave laws. The two liberal, vocally pro-union council members who are not up for re-election, Teresa Mosqueda and Lorena Gonz\u00e1les, didn't endorse Sawant in the primary. But after Amazon weighed in, both enthusiastically endorsed her last week. She's running against Egan Orion, director of an annual gay pride festival in Seattle. Gonz\u00e1les said Amazon's support might swing Orion's positions. \"When there's that much money being offered, there will be a quid-pro-quo expectation,\" she said. \"Amazon has plenty of access to the council already. What they want is elected officials who are going to bend to their will.\" At a recent debate, Orion pointed to his work in the LGBTQ community and with small businesses, saying, \"That narrative does not match the person that I am or the way I am running this campaign.\" He describes himself as a progressive but says more can be accomplished by negotiating with business leaders than by demonizing them. Amazon gave $1 million this month to the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce's political action committee, bringing its total contributions to the PAC this year to $1.5 million \u2014 a huge amount for a local election. Starbucks, Expedia and a development company started by the late Microsoft founder Paul Allen also have contributed. \"Generally, folks have seen a council that talks a lot about progress on homelessness, on reducing traffic, on helping with our increasingly unaffordable housing stock, and they really just haven't seen progress,\" PAC executive director Markham McIntyre said. \"With taxes going up year after year, they get frustrated when they're not seeing results.\" So far, independent spending in the council races has reached more than $3.5 million. Labor groups also are spending heavily, including Civic Alliance for a Progressive Economy, which is backed by progressive Amazon investor Nick Hanauer and has raised nearly $500,000. The PAC of the hotel workers union Unite Here has raised even more. State Sen. Reuven Carlyle, a Seattle Democrat, said he didn't know what effect Amazon's spending will have on the election but that he understood its desire to \"rebalance\" the council. \"They're showing that they care a lot about their hometown, just as labor cares a lot and social justice activists care a lot,\" Carlyle said.",

            "article_content": "The 2020 Democrat presidential candidates are praising U.S. Special Forces and the intelligence community after news that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a raid on Sunday morning. \u00a0  South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan, said at a campaign stop in South Carolina that everyone involved deserves credit for the success of the raid. When asked if President Trump deserves credit, he repeated that all deserve credit but those who were \"at the tip of the spear\" deserved the most credit. \u00a0  His fellow candidates were not so generous. While all of them praised the fact that a dangerous terrorist had been taken down, most criticized the president, pointing to his actions in Syria.\u00a0 Senator Amy Klobuchar, in an\u00a0appearance on \"Face the Nation,\" told host Margaret Brennan,\"That's what concerns me overall about this president's decision-making and about what he has done in terms of breaking down our alliances \u2014 leaving the Kurds who gave us intelligence for this operation, leaving them for slaughter.\"\u00a0\u00a0  After a rally in Durham, North Carolina, Biden said, \"I think the president should spend more time like President Obama did, giving credit to the incredible military and intelligence community planning.\" He added that if Mr. Trump had a part in planning the raid then he deserved some credit, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports.  Senator Bernie Sanders said the president had betrayed the Kurds and brought more instability to the region. \u00a0  \"That mission was accomplished with information supplied by the Kurds,\" he said on CNN. \"And as we know, Trump has turned his back and betrayed the Kurds, something that I think will have a negative impact, not only in that region of the world, but terms of our relationship with allies from one end of this planet to the other. But clearly any victory against a destructive group, like a terrible terrorist group like ISIS is topic is something that is positive.\"  Senator Kamala Harris said the intelligence community does extraordinary work and deserves credit for being dedicated and fearless. She went on to blast Mr. Trump for repeatedly casting aspersions on their integrity and professionalism.\u00a0  Congresswoman Katie Hill of California said she'll resign at the end of the week, after facing scrutiny and a House ethics investigation into an allegation involving an extramarital relationship with a member of her congressional staff.  \"This is the hardest thing I have ever had to do, but I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country,\" Hill said in a statement Sunday night. A conservative blog published details of a relationship she had with a campaign staffer, details of her ongoing divorce, and intimate photos of her and the campaign aide. Hill said the release of the photos were caused by her husband and \"the brutality of hateful political operatives who seem to happily provide a platform to a monster who is driving a smear campaign built around cyber exploitation.\" \u00a0  Hill flipped her Los Angeles County district blue in 2018 and served on the House Oversight Committee involved in the ongoing impeachment inquiry of President Trump. California Secretary of State spokesman Sam Mahood told\u00a0CBS News broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0its office would confer on special election details after it receives Hill's official resignation, and said California Governor Gavin Newsom will set the timeline. General special election rules call for an election to be held on a Tuesday at least 126 days, but not more than 140 days, following the Governor's proclamation of an election.\u00a0  Long-serving former Democratic Congressman\u00a0John Conyers Jr., who was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and first introduced Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday, but had to step down in 2017 amid allegations of\u00a0sexual misconduct, has died. He was 90.  A family spokeswoman confirmed Conyers's death to CBS News, while two other people in touch with his family Sunday said that Conyers died in his sleep at his Detroit home of natural causes.  Biden for the first time responded to criticism over his softening stance on super PACS, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. Biden, in response to a question from Erickson, explained that he doesn't personally have a super PAC (he can't) but \"I cannot stop [super PACs] if I wanted to stop them,\" Biden added. Asked about criticism by fellow Democrats like Bernie Sanders, who say Biden is selling out to billionaires, said \"I didn't change my opinion\" and then seemed to joke that he was \"surprised\" that Bernie Sanders would say such things.  \"I am endorsing Amo Bernie Sanders because he's not gonna sell us out. He understands that it's not just about policies and about words, but it's going to be also about completely transforming the structures in place,\" Tlaib tweeted Sunday. She appeared with him at a Detroit rally to announce her endorsement, notes\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte.  Sanders believes that the super-rich and large corporations are actively working against working class Americans and in an interview\u00a0Friday night with CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte compared some of the ultra-wealthy to drug addicts. Ending corporate greed was the theme of a five-stop, two-day swing through Iowa this week \u2013 marking his return to a first in the nation state since suffering a heart attack 25 days ago.  \"There's always been greed in this country \u2014 no question about it. But I think 40, 50 years ago, the big money interest in this country made a decision that they were going to go to war against the working families of this country,\" Sanders told CBS News in an interview Friday.  Korte spoke with Sanders before his Iowa City Rally on Friday night. He discussed his fight against corporate greed \u2013 the focus of this Iowa swing, his first time back on the trail since his heart attack 24 days ago. \u00a0  New Hampshire State Representative and Trump 2020 New Hampshire Co-Chair Al Baldasaro tweeted last night in response to a video of Senator Kamala Harris condemning President Trump's description of the impeachment inquiry as \"a lynching.\"\u00a0  Defending the president, Baldasaro tweeted, \"Kamala, stop using the race card and dividing our country. Horse thieves, bank robbers and murders were lynch many years ago. It was the Democrat KKK, that lynched African Americans. Rumor has it Kamala that you are not African American. Is that true?\"  Today, the New Hampshire Democratic Party\u00a0African-American Caucus\u00a0released the following statement: \"We in the first in the nation primary state find these tweets unacceptable. This is not who we are. We hope everyone joins us in the condemnation of this tweet.\"  New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley\u00a0tweeted, \"Al has a long history of vile attacks, he's proud he is sexist, racist and homophobic. He's a loud mouth embarrassment. Shameful the NHGOP rewards him with titles.\"  A spokesperson for Donald Trump's New Hampshire campaign did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.  Last week, New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu\u00a0sent out a fundraising email\u00a0criticizing the Democratic presidential candidate. \"Billionaire Tom Steyer, the very liberal Democrat with the very extreme agenda, is taking time out from his quixotic Presidential campaign to attack me,\" the email reads. \"He is spending over $200,000 on Facebook alone running negative, baseless ads targeting me for supporting election law integrity.\"  The email refers to New Hampshire's new voter residency law, House Bill 1264, requiring anyone who registers to vote to declare residency in the state of New Hampshire, effectively calling for\u00a0 voters to obtain a New Hampshire ID. The law could trigger laws for motor vehicle registration, mandating new residents obtain a New Hampshire license within a 60 day window or face a penalty.  In response to Sununu's email, Tom Steyer told reporters, \"I think that there is an attempt here to intimidate harass and, you know, deprived of their voting rights college students in the state of New Hampshire deliberately, and it is part of a national effort by the republican party to take away, disenfranchise from American citizens.\" He continued, \"I don't think it's any more complicated than that. And I think that his description is honestly dishonest, that he is trying to cover up something he did that was wrong. And that he should be held to account.\"  10/28 \u2013 Bennet in DC, Biden in FL, Booker in PA, Buttigieg in DC, Castro in DC, Gabbard in IA, Harris in PA, Sanders in DC, Steyer in NH, Williamson in SC  10/29 \u2013 Harris in IA, Warren in NH  10/30 \u2013 Bennet in NV, Biden in IA, Buttigieg in NH, Harris in IA, Sanders in NH, Warren in NH  10/31 \u2013 Biden in IA, Harris in IA, Sanders in NH  11/01 \u2013 Bennet in IA, Biden in IA, Booker in IA, Bullock in IA, Buttigieg in IA, Castro in IA, Delaney in IA, Harris in IA, Klobuchar in IA, O'Rourke in IA, Sanders in IA, Steyer in IA, Trump in MS, Warren in IA, Yang in IA  11/02 \u2013 Bennet in IA, Biden in IA, Booker in IA, Buttigieg in IA, Castro in IA, Delaney in IA, Harris in IA, Klobuchar in IA, O'Rourke in IA, Sanders in IA, Sestak in IA, Steyer in IA, Warren in IA, Yang in IA  11/03 \u2013 Biden in VA, Buttigieg in IA, Sanders in MN ",

You were the youngest person to be elected in the state legislature of Washington.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tThe technical stat was that when I was elected in 1990, at that time, I was the youngest state senator in the country.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tAge 25?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tYes.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tWas politics something that you always wanted to do? Where did that come from?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tI always had an interest in it. But the main place it came from was my father was a ramp serviceman at United Airlines. And he was the secretary treasury of his union. And he had an interest in politics. And he sort of pushed me into it at a young age.      \t \t \t \tI had some interest. On the other hand, I was painfully introverted at that particular point. So I was interested, but how's that going to work with my basic personality? But really what ultimately got me over that was my connection to the community I grew up in in SeaTac.      \t \t \t \tI got involved in a lot of local issues, local Democratic politics, but also just passing the school bond and working on a bunch of stuff locally. And that sort of got \u00a0      \t \t \t \tme exposed to it. And then an opportunity came up to run for the senate seat when I was young.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tDo you consider yourself still an introvert?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tThat's an interesting question.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tBecause I certainly am.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tYes, I would say yes. You don't change that basic personality. But I've figured out how to deal with some of those. It's more than we need to get into at this point, but I had issues as a child. I was adopted. I had family -- all kind of different things that I've worked my way through now. But that basic personality is still there. I've just learned to work around it.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tCongressman, you've been a member of the House Armed Services Committee for as long       \t \t \t \tas you've been in Congress, 23 years.      \t \t \t \t\tREP.

How does government work? And certainly the U.S. has plenty of those issues, but I've always been interested in international issues. Just the history of how countries came to be, conflicts came to be, how they've worked out those conflicts.      \t \t \t \tI've always been interested in foreign       \t \t \t \tpolicy since I was in high school. But ultimately, from a congressional career standpoint, when I was in the State Senate, I chaired the Judiciary Committee. So my orientation was not foreign policy. But Joint Base Lewis-McChord (or as it was known then Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base) were in the heart of my district when I got elected in '96. And that got me onto the Armed Services Committee and started me down the national security road.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tCongressman, perhaps we can talk a little bit about oversight. How do you see the job of overseeing the Pentagon? What do you see your role as? What are your objectives?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tCouple of objectives. One is to make sure that taxpayer dollars are spent as wisely and efficiently as possible, and that we are meeting the national security needs of the country, and that the DOD is doing that. And \u00a0      \t \t \t \tit's, I believe, a cooperative effort. Actually, you worked in another area of government. But there's tension there. DOD wants to do what it wants to do.      \t \t \t \tBut I also believe there is a basic respect at DOD for the idea of the oversight role the Congress must play. And there's certainly a respect on our side for DOD's role to protect the country and institute our national defense policy. And we are the people's representatives.      \t \t \t \tBasically, the Department of Defense exists at the will of the people. And so we try to keep DOD accountable, because we are responsible to the electorate. I guess I'd put it better, the electorate holds us accountable. And part of what they want us to do is hold the Pentagon accountable, because they're spending roughly $740 billion a year of taxpayer money. And there's a tension here. It's an incredibly important process. And I do think that there \u00a0      \t \t \t \thas been a concentration of executive power and an erosion of legislative power.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tIn general?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tYes, that I think is a problem, particularly when you're talking about something as important as national security and the use of the United States military and the spending of $740 billion. To the extent that Congress doesn't have an adequate say in that, you further divide the Pentagon from the people in a way that I think's problematic.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tWhy has that occurred? Why has that erosion taken place do you think?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tAs a general rule, there's I would say a tendency to have the power-- look, if you're at the Pentagon, as much as they have respect for the process, they would also       \t \t \t \tlike to be able to do what they do when they want to do it, and not have a bunch of members of Congress who may or may not know anything about it interfere.      \t \t \t \tAnd I think there's tension there. There's tension when elected officials try to politicize it. Bring the secretary of defense over and then try to make some politically embarrassing argument just for the sake of their political interests. And those tensions are always there.      \t \t \t \tI would say the reason it's become more concentrated is because democracy has become more difficult and more complicated. There was no internet. There was no cable television. Now you have to deal with a lot more constituents. It's harder to deal with all of that incoming from constituents and still do the oversight. It's become a more difficult and more complicated job because of the democratization of power and the free flow of information.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tAnd then from the perspective of what you do every day on the committee, in terms of the issues you look at, in terms of how far you look out, in terms of the strategic and tactical, how would you characterize what it is you focus on every day?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tI think a huge part of is efficiently spending the money. So trying to figure out how can we get the most out of the tax dollars we spend. Part of that, competition is a big deal to me. Making sure that as we're sending out contracts, there's adequate competition. Making sure that the Pentagon is aware of all of the options, the vendors that are out there that potentially could give them a better deal or a better product. I think that's a huge part of what we do.      \t \t \t \tAnd another huge part of what we do is to make sure that the troops are taken care of. \u00a0      \t \t \t \tAnd the way I always like to put this is whatever we decide the mission is, we have to make sure that the troops are adequately trained and equipped to carry out that mission.      \t \t \t \tAnd I think it's a huge mistake for us, whether it's DOD or Congress or the White House to say, \"We want to do all of this. This should be our national security mission.\" But then we don't have the money. And so we put our troops in the position of having to do more than they are trained and equipped to do. So matching the mission with the force and the basic money that we spend on it is a huge part of the challenge as well, and making sure the troops are taken care of.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tSo Congressman, you said today that you're making progress on the National Defense Authorization Act. And I was hoping you could tell our listeners what that is and       \t \t \t \twhy it's so important.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tSure. As a starting point, it is the policy for the Department of Defense and that important aspect of our national security. Every year, we authorize everything the DOD does. The equipment they buy, the missions they take on, the way the forces are distributed.      \t \t \t \tSo once a year, we pass a defense bill that says for, in this case, FY 2020, \"Here is what the Pentagon's going to spend. And here's their policy.\" And it impacts a whole lot of things. I know one big issue we're working on this year is housing for military members. There's been a lot of mold and problems with the privatized housing. So we're putting in a bill of rights to help protect them. At the same time, we're talking how many F-35's do we buy? How many F-15's do we buy? Do we buy any F-15's? Updating programs. So it is the national       \t \t \t \tsecurity DOD policy for the year.      \t \t \t \tThe other thing that has happened with the defense bill is, because the legislative process has become so cumbersome, it's one of the few bills that passes every year. So a lot of other committees try to hitch onto our bill a whole bunch of different issues, because it is some years, literally, the only policy bill.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tAnd we went years without an Intelligence Authorization Act.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tExactly. In fact, the Intelligence Authorizing Act this year is in the Defense Authorizing Bill. That's one of the things we picked up, because they couldn't get it through the Senate. So that's the other role that the National Defense Authorizing Act plays.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tSo we're taping this on a Thursday. And       \t \t \t \twe're going to run this next Wednesday. So there may or may not be an agreement on this year's NDAA by then. But can you talk a little bit about what some of the big issues -- you talked about housing already -- you're going to tackle?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tYes, I think some of the biggest -- there's a lot of stuff in space. The big controversy is over the desire of some to create a Space Force, basically to take space out from under the direct control of the Air Force and make it its own, and kind of equivalent to the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps is technically under the Navy, but it's also its own separate thing. Do we need to place that emphasis? And there are a lot of issues surrounding space that we have spent a lot of time on.      \t \t \t \tThere's also been a lot of issues surrounding the chemical PFAS, which is in firefighting foam, which the Department of       \t \t \t \tDefense uses and has now been found to pollute the groundwater in a lot of places. It's not just a DOD thing. PFAS is elsewhere. That's been a big huge issue that we've been wrestling with.      \t \t \t \tAnd there's a lot of policy on what do we do about Guantanamo. We're down to 40 inmates down there. I know this is something you're very familiar with. It's costing an enormous amount of money. Where do we go forward with that policy? There's been concern about congressional oversight of military kinetic action, going to war. How do we make sure that the president comes to Congress if he wants to go to war with Iran? That's been a major area.      \t \t \t \tThen there's a lot of programs. We're dealing with the cost overruns of the Ford-class carrier. How do we handle that? How do we make sure we keep building enough submarines? We are, as you know, recapitalizing the nuclear force. There's a       \t \t \t \tcontract to be awarded on that for the next-generation ICBM. We're working on the B-21, which is a replacement. So yes--      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tCan you say whether you're going to authorize a Space Force?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tThat's not 100% clear. It's kind of funny. As we speak-- and I can say this, because this isn't going to air until when?      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tNext Wednesday.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tWednesday, okay. It'll be done by then, but as we speak, literally, the president is being presented with a sort of, \"Here's the defense bill with the Space Force and with a couple other things that we want.\" And I'm hoping he'll say, \"Deal.\" And then that's what we'll do. And if that happens, I will know the parameters of the bill. And we'll see. It seems at this point like a 50-50 cal      \t \t \t \tl whether or not the Space Force is in the final bill. There's a lot of people for it. There's a lot of people against it. And it's bipartisan on both sides.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tCongressman, I'd love to run through some questions about military capabilities.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tSure.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tAnd maybe the place to start is with the most recent National Defense Strategy Commission, which I was a member of. And as you know, one of the co-chairs, Eric Edelman, he was on our podcast and laid out a pretty stark picture of what that report said. And it was pretty stark.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tYes.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tLet me read you three sentences from it. \"America's military superiority has eroded t      \t \t \t \to a dangerous degree. Many of the skills necessary to plan for and conduct military operations against capable adversaries have atrophied. The U.S. military might struggle to win or perhaps lose a war against China or Russia.\" Did you agree with those findings? Did they strike you as realistic and make sense?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tNo, I don't agree with those findings. And it's kind of hard. I don't so much necessarily disagree with the findings, as I find that they set an unrealistic expectation about what our U.S. military is supposed to do. You could have read those same findings at virtually any time in U.S. history, except perhaps in the '80s when we spent an enormous amount of money. But even then, you don't know what you don't know. And you don't know what's coming.      \t \t \t \tWe had this massive military. We weren't ready for 9/11. You never know what's coming \u00a0      \t \t \t \tup. So I think part of the problem within the Defense Committee and within DOD in general is you can paint a number of nightmare scenarios, all right, and say, \"We have to be ready for--\" we can't afford to be ready for all of them. There's not enough money in the world to be ready for all of them.      \t \t \t \tSo if you say, \"If I can show you a scenario that we're not ready for right now, then our defense policy is failing,\" we may as well pack it up, because we're always going to be failing. Also I think that way of looking at things leads us to try and spend our way into a problem, all right?      \t \t \t \tThere's no way in this era, at this time, given how complicated the world has become. Back in the '80s, we didn't have to worry about Al Qaeda and ISIS, okay? China was nowhere near where they are today. It was a much more manageable world. What I would like us to come to is a more realistic idea       \t \t \t \tof how we deter our adversaries beyond the notion that if we can't guarantee overwhelming dominance then we're done. Because I don't think we can guarantee overwhelming dominance. I don't think we have the money. And I think the world is entirely too complicated to get to that point.      \t \t \t \tSo what should we do? Number one, alliances have never been more important. We need partners. And we've been doing this. This is part of what was working against the caliphate. We partnered with Iraq. We partnered with the SDF and with the Kurds. And very low footprint.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tA coalition of nations.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tExactly. And we didn't lose a single American life in defeating the caliphate. ISIS is not defeated. The caliphate has been crushed. ISIS still there, but we defeated       \t \t \t \tthe caliphate without losing a single American life, because we were able to work with partners.      \t \t \t \tI think that needs to be an important part of our strategy as we go forward. And I also think that we need to find other ways to deter our adversaries. It doesn't just have to be military. International institutions can help us deter our adversaries. The State Department can help us deter our adversaries.      \t \t \t \tWe're always saying that if we did it-- everyone's supposed to be really freaked out about these war games that they hold, about imagine we went to war with China in the South China Sea. We wouldn't win. The idea that if China came over to the U.S. and tried to beat us, they wouldn't win either. It's hard to win a war on the road against a major adversary. Should that really be our goal?      \t \t \t \tOr should our goal be what policies can we put in place so that we don't go to war with China in the South China Sea? And I worry that we get these bloviated ideas of what the defense budget has to be. We don't achieve those objectives. And we wind up with a national security policy that our resources can't possibly meet. And then we're in that scenario, where we are asking the men and women in our armed forces to perform a task that we don't have the money or equipment for them to perform. So I worry about that sort of hyperbolic language.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tSo Congressman, what do you think the U.S. military should be capable of?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tI think the U.S. military should, first of all, it's important to have a surge capacity. And I think we underestimate that. We certainly weren't ready for World War II, but we surged. And we got ready. And ult      \t \t \t \timately we took advantage of it. So I think, number one, the industrial base matters a lot. Do we maintain the core capabilities of building the ships, the planes, and increasingly by the way the artificial intelligence, the command and control centers, the cyber strength?      \t \t \t \tDo we have that ability to rise to meet an adversary when they come at us? So making sure that we maintain a strong domestic economy, a strong domestic infrastructure, and a strong industrial base is as important as anything. And I think we need to consider that when we're looking at what programs to fund and move forward. Then I think our military should absolutely be capable of deterring terrorist groups like ISIS and Al Qaeda. And I think we've done a pretty decent job of that. As you know, you were there when we were sort of building up after 9/11.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tIt doesn't actually take a lot of capable at the end of the day. It really doesn't.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tNo, but it takes a ton of coordination. And it's really impressive what we've done. Now when it comes to, sort of, here's our national security threat environment, which is basically Russia, China, North Korea, Iran, transnational terrorists, okay?      \t \t \t \tSo how do we contain those threats? I talked about the last one. The other four, I think there's a bunch of different strategies. I think our military needs to be strong enough to deter North Korea. So that North Korea knows that if they engage militarily anywhere in the neighborhood that we will crush them.      \t \t \t \tI think we need Russia to know that if they mess in Eastern Europe, we are going to make the cost higher than they want to absorb. I think we need to have an adequate nuclear deterrent that tells every other country in       \t \t \t \tthe world, \"Don't you dare even think about using a nuclear weapon, because we will obliterate you.\"      \t \t \t \tAnd I think we need a strong enough military to help deter China from hostile acts in South Asia. But with China, I think frankly partners in the region are vastly more important than our military strength. It's going to matter more if South Korea and Japan and India and Thailand and Vietnam and all those countries are strong enough to have a united front in deterring China than the threat that we'll send our entire military over to go to war with China.      \t \t \t \tBut I think all of that can be achieved in a more manageable way. For instance, we've had this requirement since I've been in Congress for I think it's 350 ships in the Navy. There's no realistic scenario by which we're ever able to afford to build-- I think the 350 ship in the Navy led to the LCS, okay? Which former Secretary of the Navy, now,       \t \t \t \tSpencer and I used to joke about it.      \t \t \t \tI had this analogy that I picked up a long time ago for the problem, is when you try to make something that does everything, it's like a spork. It's not a very good spoon. And it's not a very good fork. It can't really do anything. But we wanted to get to 350 ships. The LCS was cheaper than a destroyer. We could build more of them. And then we can count more ships. So aren't we better off because we have more ships? No. You set those unrealistic objectives. So I think we need to be more realistic about how we project power. And I think we need to really aggressively build alliances.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tSo if you take your view of what we need to be able to do, where are we today versus that view?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tOne of my ways of looking at the world is I am nowhere near as hyperbolic and paranoid       \t \t \t \tas most people. And it's not that I'm unaware of the threats. It's just that I always go from the standpoint of this is the way the world is. There are no guarantees, near as I can tell. We're not going to be able to build a military that guarantees that we'll never be protected.      \t \t \t \tI think we did have a real readiness crisis, even on a more modest goal, because of Iraq and Afghanistan, because of all that we had to pull from all over the world to deal with those two issues. We undermined our readiness elsewhere. But we have really rebuilt that since we got out of Iraq and now we have a small presence there, and we've reduced our presence in Afghanistan. I think we're making real progress.      \t \t \t \tI think we've still got a little ways to go to get back to a decent readiness frame. But, again, the reason we got into that readiness crisis is because we were too ambitious in our military goals for both       \t \t \t \tIraq and Afghanistan. We didn't work with partners-- Afghanistan's a different conversation. But I think we're on stronger footing now than we've been in the last five or six years.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tOne other issue I wanted to ask you about is nuclear weapons. You have a particularly interesting view I think on nuclear weapons. And I'd love to have you share that.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tSure. And this comes back to how do we deter our adversaries, but be able to afford all the things we need to do? Going back to that rather stark portrait that was portrayed in the defense review, if you believe that. And don't misunderstand me. I don't think it's necessarily wrong to say that we are vulnerable. It's just that being alive makes you vulnerable. To imagine that you won't be, it's a matter of managing those vulnerabilities. Or as they always say at       \t \t \t \tthe Department of Defense, managing risk. That's what they do.      \t \t \t \tSo what is our nuclear arsenal supposed to do? It is supposed to deter any adversary from ever using a nuclear weapon. And that's number one. People who start talking about how we can use our nuclear weapons to deter nonnuclear threats I think are dead wrong. And I think that's a huge policy mistake to rely on nuclear weapons and think that we would ever be the country that would strike first with nuclear weapons.      \t \t \t \tAnd then my position is that we don't need as many nuclear weapons as we have in order to deter our adversaries. And I always use China as the example. China has less than 300 nuclear weapons. And basically  -- and forgive me, I don't always speak in the proper policy language -- China's basic policy is, \"We have enough nuclear weapons to seriously mess you up if you screw with us, so don't, okay?\"      \t \t \t \tAnd I think getting into this calculation of, \"If they launch these and we launch those, then we--\" no, make it clear. And I think that it is very clear with the U.S. currently having something like 4,000 nuclear warheads. And I want to maintain that power. Sorry, I don't think we need 4,000. I don't think it needs to go down to sub-300 either.      \t \t \t \tBut I think as we project out, where can we save money in the defense budget? When I look at the terrorist threat, I don't want to save money by reducing our special ops guys or reducing the outreach we're doing in the world to confront that threat.      \t \t \t \tI think having a robust Navy is important to be able to deter Iran and China. There's a lot of areas where I don't want to save money. But given our budget deficit, given all of the needs, if you don't have any area where you're willing to save money, then you \u00a0      \t \t \t \tdon't have a plan. And I think in nuclear weapons, we can meet our objectives of nuclear deterrence, which are incredibly important, for less money than the nuclear posture review ponders.      \t \t \t \tAnd I know that there's bipartisan opposition to me on this. The Obama administration was the one who put the nuclear posture review out. The Trump administration sort of ramped up a little bit further. But I just don't think we need that many nuclear weapons to serve the deterrent effect that they're supposed to serve.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tWhere do you think we should go in the INF Treaty?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tThe INF Treaty is gone now. I think we need to renegotiate. And this is a broader issue. We are in a very dangerous point right now in the world. This is sort of like when the       \t \t \t \tSoviet Union first developed nuclear weapons. And we developed them. And it was the wild, wild west with the power to destroy the entire globe.      \t \t \t \tBut then Nixon and other-- we started to negotiate to say, \"Okay, we don't want to terminate the planet here. So let's have an open dialogue about what our capabilities are so that we don't go down the Dr. Strangelove route and miscalculate.      \t \t \t \tNow that Soviet Union fell apart and we all thought, \"end of history,\" whatever. That turned out not to be correct. Now Russia is rising again. They're building more nuclear weapons. China is now a major player on missiles. They weren't part of the INF Treaty. They are rapidly developing missile technology.      \t \t \t \tAnd on top of that, quantum computing is out there, okay? Which potentially, as has been explained to me, can basically render any       \t \t \t \tencryption irrelevant, all right? AI is leading to all manner of capabilities, hypersonic weapons. We've got all these weapons that are gamechangers, in terms of how you're going to be able to defend yourself.      \t \t \t \tWe need a new arms control regime. China, Russia, and the U.S. need to get together and say, \"The risk of miscalculation as all of these new and incredibly powerful or -- what would be the word here? -- game-changing weapon systems are available, we need to better understand our capabilities so that we can be confident in our own deterrents and confident that you can't overcome our deterrents.\" I think we need to get back into the room and start negotiating.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tAnd that dialogue just isn't happening today?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tNo, it's not happening. And this is frustrating to me, because we have tried in the defense bill to insert a requirement for that dialogue. And we have been resisted. And I'm not saying what the outcome has to be. I just think it's incredibly important that we start talking.      \t \t \t \tIt's like our conflict with Iran now. We've got this maximum pressure campaign. I think there's a wisdom behind that. Iran is having an incredibly malign influence in Iraq, in Syria, in Lebanon, in Yemen. And I think putting pressure on them to stop that is well worth it, all right?      \t \t \t \tBut they view it as an existential threat. So they're going to start lashing out to survive. And how are they going to lash out? How are we going to respond? There's no communication that I'm aware of -- and I've looked -- between Iran and the U.S. I guess Japan is occasionally a go between. I just think it's really important to understand       \t \t \t \tyour adversaries.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tRight. And talk to them.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tYes.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tSo maybe, Chairman, in the last few minutes we have here, just run through some substantive issues and get your reaction.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tSure.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tChina? How do you think we should be positioning ourselves vis-\u00e0-vis a rising China both strategically and militarily?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tBe very present in the region so that the other countries in that region don't feel like they have to bend to the bully. That China can't bully them. That they've got another reliable partner in the region. I think by and large we're doing that. I think \u00a0      \t \t \t \tthat's incredibly important.      \t \t \t \tI also think that China is a competitor. I don't see them as an existential threat. They need us. To begin with, we owe them $3 trillion. I think they'd kind of like to be paid. They don't want to see us completely collapse. They're going to compete with us economically. I do think we need to be very aggressive about stopping all of the intellectual property theft that they're doing. And try to pull them closer into a rules-based society. And the last thing I'm concerned about is the degree to which China sort of links up with Russia in favor of pushing autocracy. China didn't used to be sort of an exporter of their philosophy. It's starting to look like--      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tThey are now.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \t--they are. And I still believe in freedom. I believe in political freedom and economic       \t \t \t \tfreedom. And if China is out there in Africa and Latin America and the Middle East and everywhere else trying to undermine political and economic freedom, I think that will inevitably lead to a less stable, less prosperous world. And we need to make sure that we contain their ability to do that.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tRussia and the deterrence of Russia in what we call the gray zone, including what they did to us in the 2016 election. We have not been successful at deterring them through the use of sanctions. How do we do that, do you think?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tI think we at least need to begin to counter their disinformation campaign. And it's a real hindrance that the president of the United States of America to this date refuses to acknowledge what Russia did in 2016. In many ways, the whole Ukraine issue, the president is pushing Russian propaganda       \t \t \t \tin Ukraine, helping them with their disinformation campaign.      \t \t \t \tNow just about every Republican I talk to says, \"We know Russia's a threat. We know Russia did it in 2016.\" Okay, what are we doing about it? Not enough. We haven't countered it. And I do worry that there are many different aspects to President Trump's foreign policy that are troubling in a whole series of levels, but taking a step back and just saying, \"Let's presume that he has a plan other than just looking after his own business interests. What is that plan?\"      \t \t \t \tThat plan seems to emphasize he doesn't like alliances. He wants the U.S. to be less involved in the world. And he's fond of autocrats. That's a problem. That enables Russia to continue to do what they've done, to undermine our democracy, undermine our influence in the world, and push kleptocracy and autocracy. I need to come up with better words for that, but anyway.      \t \t \t \tAnd the economic piece of this is crucial. Their economy is based on a few folks at the top gobbling up all the money in the most corrupt way possible and then hiding it all over the world \u2013 including, by the way, in high-end New York real estate, but that's another story.      \t \t \t \tThat's an economic system that is a recipe for disaster, all right? We need to counter that. Not let them push that message. And I've had an increasing number of people tell me that as they're trying to make democracy look weak, they're succeeding. And there's people who say a thousand years from now, historians will look back on democracy as a 300-year blip in human history. Will it survive? I think the stakes are that important. Working right now to try and pass the defense bill, I was quoted in a way that I wouldn't like to be requoted. So I won't say it. Democracy is difficult. Let me put it diff--      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tI heard what you said. It was actually very good.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tYes. Because I'm trying to pass the defense bill. And I've described it as it's like Space Invaders, okay? \"All right, these five people have this problem. Okay, I'll go talk to them. We're good, okay.\" And then somebody else has a problem. \"I've got to go talk to him now. And then I've got to go talk to her.\" In an autocracy it's like, \"He has a problem? Tell him to get over it.\"      \t \t \t \tSo it's hard, but it's better than having a system that is unaccountable, doesn't face competition, doesn't face criticisms, because inevitably systems like that atrophy. They get lazy. They don't get better. They stop looking after people. And eventually people get tired of it. And they revolt. And we see stuff like we had in the first half of the 20th century. And here I       \t \t \t \twas saying that I'm not the hyperbolic type.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tI know.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tBut I think we can prevent all of that, but it is a major impediment that we have a president who doesn't pay any attention to any of this. He's got his own agenda that is unrelated to 75 years of effort to build the international institutions, to build the respect for political and economic freedom, to stabilize and make the world prosperous.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tSo you mentioned Iran earlier. And I thought you painted it perfectly, all right? Misbehavior in the region, significant. We need to do something about that. And the things we're doing about it, in terms of putting pressure on them, they see as an existential threat. So they're lashing out. How should we deal with them?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tI think for the moment we need to stay the course. I don't think we should have pulled out of the JCPOA, because we're going to be better able to corner them if the world is with us. And the world was not with us in pulling out of the JCPOA. I also think it makes it more likely that Iran will go back down the road of building a nuclear weapon.      \t \t \t \tAnd I've heard a lot of very smart people say things that are completely wrong about the JCPOA. They're like, \"After ten years, they could go ahead and build a weapon.\" That's not what it says. That agreement was a lot stronger than the president and a whole lot of other people have said it is. And giving up on that is a problem.      \t \t \t \tBut what's done is done. I think at this point we need to continue the maximum pressure campaign, show restraint, don't blow the region up. But then the other critical part about this. And I met with King Abdullah in Jordan. And he articulated       \t \t \t \tthis very well.      \t \t \t \tLimiting Iran's money is one way to help make it more difficult for them to mess with Lebanon and Syria and all these other places. But they're still going to do it. They'll starve their people before they give up on this. The only way to stop Iran is to go to Yemen, go to Iraq, and give them a better deal, okay?      \t \t \t \tBecause Iran is basically mob boss politics, all right? \"We'll give you guns, we'll give you money in exchange for doing what we want you to do.\" If those people had a different offer, a better life, if the Iraq government was functioning, if Yemen wasn't a massive -- if you actually built a decent government, built economy opportunity, then Iran would not have the fertile field to go in and sow discord. When people are desperate, they turn to things like this.      \t \t \t \tSo we need to keep working. Syria is a more       \t \t \t \tcomplicated issue, but certainly in Iraq, we've got some partners there. We can work to try to help develop a better government. Same in Lebanon. Same in Yemen. Drain the swamp, if you will. Don't give them a place to go to take advantage of people who have been backed into a corner. And I think that part of policy has been lacking. We're not doing very well in diplomacy under the Trump administration.      \t \t \t \tAnd I know we're probably over time here, but one final point. Biggest thing I encountered overseas, our partners no longer trust us. And they don't want to work with us. And it's for a different reason than you might think. They know. They're sitting down. You're the ambassador to whatever country from the United States. And you sit down. And they talk to you. And you make a deal. The next morning, there's a tweet that undoes it.      \t \t \t \tNow our partners say, \"Why am I talking to       \t \t \t \tyou? You've got no power, okay? You obviously don't speak for the United States of America, because the president's going to undo it tomorrow.\" And even if he doesn't now, people don't trust our interlocutors, because they don't think they speak for the country. They think Trump just tweets and that's the policy. We are really gutting our diplomatic capability because of that.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tJust one more question, Congressman, the morale of our troops. How would you characterize it?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tIf you're talking about the troops in the State Department, really bad. At an all-time low.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tPentagon troops.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tI think within the military, it's been t      \t \t \t \tough, okay? And I never served in the military, but we've been at war in one place or another for 18 years now. And that's a big drain. But I think the morale's pretty good. And I think they're doing their job. Certainly there are problems. There's a strong feeling 1% of the population serves in the military. Does the other 99% care?      \t \t \t \tBut I think they do. Increasingly, you've seen programs to help veterans from private businesses, from charities, from others. I think the morale is okay. I think they're worried about all the stuff we've talked about today like everybody else is. What's the direction of the U.S. government? We are in a period of high political conflict.      \t \t \t \tAnd I'll tell you, if we can pass a defense bill and fund the government through an appropriations process, that'll help. Because I do hear from a lot of military people, \"If the government gets shut down, I'm not getting paid. That's a problem. If       \t \t \t \tyou guys could do your job, fund the government, pass a defense bill,\" I think they'd feel a lot better about the country that they're putting their lives on the line for.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tDid you get some reaction from the Pentagon on the president's intervention in the Gallagher case?      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tYes. They're concerned. And look, the secretary of defense -- and I've known Mark for a long time in different capabilities and we have a good relationship -- he's right. The chain of command is the president's at the top of that. And ultimately, he can do whatever he wants to do.      \t \t \t \tIf he wants to wake up tomorrow morning and say that the mess at Fort Hood should only serve bacon, he can do that, okay? He'd be an idiot if he did that, but he certainly       \t \t \t \tcould. But I think in the case of military discipline, by him doing what he's done, he has undermined the chain of command in the following sense. If you're out there in the field and you don't think you have to listen to your superior because you know that you can go on Fox News and get the president to side with you over the person who's commanding you --      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tThat's a problem.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tYes, it breaks down the entire principle of the military of chain of command. And I know he's at the top. It's like in my own office. I've got quite a few people who work for me. And if my staff director is given an instruction to go do this. And everyone's working on it. And then I happen to be wandering by and say, \"Oh no, I think that's wrong. I think you ought to do it this way,\" I'm undermining my own chain of command, b      \t \t \t \tecause I'm not empowering the people who I need to do the job.      \t \t \t \t\tMICHAEL MORELL:      \t \t \t \tRight. Congressman, thank you so much for taking the time to join us.      \t \t \t \t\tREP. ADAM SMITH:      \t \t \t \tThank you. It's great to see you again and appreciate the chance.      \t \t \t \t\t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *    ",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden, in the first television interview since he declared his presidential candidacy, said again that he's sorry for the way Anita Hill was treated when she testified before Congress about Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, and he also talked about his recent conversation with her. Biden told ABC's \"The View\" that he believed Hill from the beginning. \"I'm sorry that she was treated the way she was treated,\" Biden said of Hill, who has said she was not satisfied by her phone call with him and does not support his candidacy. \"She's one of the reasons why we have the Me-Too movement. She was one of the reasons why I was able to finish the Violence Against Women Act.\" He said he wouldn't judge whether Hill deemed his remorse sufficient, and he wishes lawmakers \"could have figured out a better way\" to conduct the hearing nearly decades ago. He also talked about why so much time had transpired before he spoke with her. \"Since I had publicly apologized for the way she was treated...I didn't want to 'invade her space,'\" Biden explained. He added that \"I didn't treat her badly,\" but he didn't know how he could have stopped the \"character assassination\" against her. \"No woman, or any victim of harassment, should ever be put through that circumstance,\" Biden said. \"We're all still looking for -- how do you change the process for having a hearing?\" Biden had called Anita Hill in the weeks leading up to his campaign launch\u00a0to apologize\u00a0for not doing more to support Hill during her 1991 testimony accusing Thomas of sexual harassment. Hill's dismissive treatment by the all-male committee inspired several women to run for office in 1992, which later became known as the \"Year of the Woman.\" However, Hill\u00a0told The New York Times in an interview Thursday\u00a0that she found Biden's apology to be insufficient. \"I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, 'I'm sorry for what happened to you,'\" Hill told the Times, adding that she could not support Biden until she felt that he had truly taken responsibility for his actions as the Judiciary Committee's chairman at the time. \"I will be satisfied when I know there is real change and real accountability and real purpose.\" \"The focus on apology, to me, is one thing,\" Hill continued. \"But he needs to give an apology to the other women and to the American public because we know now how deeply disappointed Americans around the country were about what they saw. And not just women. There are women and men now who have just really lost confidence in our government to respond to the problem of gender violence.\" On \"The View,\" Biden also addressed allegations that he had touched women inappropriately during his career. \"I have to be -- and everybody has to be -- much more aware of the private space of men and women,\" Biden said, vowing he would be \"more careful\" in his future interactions. He pointed out that no one had accused him of anything that was sexually inappropriate -- only of a lack of sensitivity about personal space. He said \"I'm sorry I invaded your space\" to the women who criticized him, but that he never intended to do anything inappropriate. He also said that he even had to give some thought to how he would greet the women hosts of \"The View,\" some of whom he considers friends. The former vice president sought to highlight the differences between him and President Trump during the interview and explained why he would be be able to win the white working class voters who defected to Mr. Trump in 2016. He said that \"we have to restore dignity to work, have to restore dignity to the way we treat people.\" This president, Biden said, has done \"nothing\" to help \"ordinary hard-working Americans\" in the working and middle classes. Mr. Trump tweeted Thursday that he welcomed \"Sleepy Joe\" to the race. On Friday morning, Mr. Trump questioned whether Biden is, at 76, was too old to run for president. He told\u00a0reporters\u00a0that he felt, at 72, like a \"vibrant young man,\" but \"I look at Joe and I don't know about him.\" In his interview with \"The View,\" Biden responded to that critique, saying it's the first time anyone has referred to him as \"sleepy.\" It's usually \"hyper Joe,\" he countered.\u00a0 \"If he looks young and vibrant compared to me, I should probably go home,\" Biden joked about Mr. Trump. \"The best way to judge me is to watch -- see if I have the energy and the capacity.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "In an apparent setback for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, exit polls showed the longtime Israeli leader falling short of securing a parliamentary majority with his hard-line allies in Tuesday's election. The results posted by Israel's three major TV stations indicated his political future could be in doubt. The three stations all showed challenger Benny Gantz's centrist Blue and White party slightly ahead of Netanyahu's Likud party. However, neither party controls a majority in the 120-seat parliament without the support of Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the midsize Yisrael Beitenu party. Israeli exit polls are often imprecise and the final results, expected Wednesday, could shift in Netanyahu's favor. But three stations all forecast similar scenarios. Netanyahu had sought to secure a majority with his allies to secure immunity from an expected indictment on corruption charges. The results raise the likelihood of a unity government among the three parties, but it's unclear what part Netanyahu could take in that. The longest-serving leader in Israeli history was seeking a fourth consecutive term in office and fifth overall. But he faced a stiff challenge from Gantz. Throughout an abbreviated, but alarmist campaign characterized by mudslinging and slogans condemned as racist, Netanyahu had tried to portray himself as a seasoned statesman who is uniquely qualified to lead the country through challenging times. Gantz tried to paint Netanyahu as divisive and scandal-plagued, offering himself as a calming influence and honest alternative. After casting his ballot in Jerusalem, Netanyahu predicted the vote would be \"very close.\" Throughout the day, he frantically begged supporters to vote. \"It's not in the bag. But if you go (vote), we will win,\" Netanyahu blared through a megaphone to shoppers at a Jerusalem market after stopping at other Likud strongholds in the city. Voting in his hometown of Rosh Haayin in central Israel, Gantz urged all Israelis to hope. \"We will bring hope, we will bring change, without corruption, without extremism,\" he said. The election marks their second showdown of the year after drawing even in the previous one in April. Attention will now focus on Israel's president, Reuven Rivlin, who is to choose the candidate he believes has the best chance of forming a stable coalition. Rivlin is to consult with all parties in the coming days before making his decision. Netanyahu is desperate to secure a narrow 61-seat majority in parliament with his hard-line religious and nationalist allies, who are expected to approve legislation that would grant him immunity from prosecution. Israel's attorney general has recommended pressing criminal charges against Netanyahu in three separate corruption cases, pending a long-delayed pre-trial hearing scheduled next month. Without immunity, Netanyahu would be under heavy pressure to step aside. With his career on the line, Netanyahu has campaigned furiously and taken a late hard turn to the right in hopes of rallying his nationalist base. Heavier turnout by Arab voters, many of whom stayed home in April, could hurt Netanyahu. After casting his ballot, the leader of the main Arab faction in parliament, Ayman Odeh, said Netanyahu was \"obsessive\" in his incitement toward Arabs. He said the answer was that his constituents \"must be first-class voters on the way to becoming first-class citizens.\" Facebook on Tuesday punished Netanyahu's page for the second time during the campaign, briefly suspending his automated chat function after it illegally published an opinion poll in the days before the election. By early evening, the chat page was working again. Last week, the account was suspended for 24 hours after a post claimed that Arabs want to \"annihilate all of us.\" The page and the chatbot were posting aggressively Tuesday, with numerous videos of Netanyahu pleading with voters to turn out. Turnout emerged as a key element for this election day, which is a national holiday aimed at encouraging participation. In April, turnout was about 69%, slightly below the 72% figure in a 2015 election. As of 4 p.m., Israel's central election committee said 44.3% of eligible voters had cast their ballots. It marked a slight increase over the figure at the same time in April.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden rebutted allegations Friday that his son Hunter Biden's presence on the board of a Ukrainian energy company when the older Biden was vice president represented a conflict of interest.\u00a0 \"It's not a conflict of interest. There has been no indication of any conflict of interest from Ukraine or anywhere else. Period. I'm not going to respond to that,\" Biden said when\u00a0asked\u00a0by\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson. When\u00a0Erickson\u00a0pressed Biden if he's worried about the appearance of a conflict of interest, Biden jabbed his finger and said, \"Focus on this man! What he is doing \u2013 what no president has ever done. No president.\" This full-throated defense of Hunter Biden's connection to Ukraine is the first time in two weeks Joe Biden has directly responded to the allegations from the White House on the issue. Mr. Trump is currently the subject of an impeachment inquiry stemming from a July phone call in which he asked the Ukrainian president to investigate Hunter Biden but has tried to turn attention back to former vice president and his family.\u00a0 In a brief statement ahead of taking questions, Biden said, \"All this talk by the president about corruption comes from the most corrupt president we've had in modern history. He's the definition of corruption.\" Biden also said Mr. Trump is worried he could beat him \"like a drum.\" When asked about the Ukraine issue over the past two weeks, Biden cited the lack of evidence behind the president's claims as reason to not believe them. In Nevada this week he also ripped into the president's character and said \"abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency.\"\u00a0 Yet as both interviews with his supporters and\u00a0a new Monmouth poll indicate, even some Democrats have questions about why the former vice president would allow his son to make considerable money in Ukraine while he was in charge of U.S. policy initiatives there. Biden had been reluctant to confront the corruption accusations coming from Mr. Trump and his allies, a decision former Obama administration officials chalk up to his protectiveness toward his family. His family-man credentials, in fact, are routinely cited by his supporters as reason enough to support him. The White House, meanwhile, continues to accuse the Bidens of corruption. The president's re-election campaign launched a $10 million dollar ad buy last week focused on their allegations relating to Biden. And in Arizona on Friday, Pence said, \"I think the American people have a right to know if the Vice President of the United States or his family profited from his position as Vice President during the last administration.\" But will Biden's push-back be enough to inspire confidence in Democratic voters as he looks to show he would be Mr. Trump's most formidable opponent?\u00a0 STEVE BULLOCK On Friday, Montana Governor Steve Bullock announced that he raised $2.3 million dollars during the third quarter fundraising time frame. This is slightly more than the little over $2 million the governor raised in the second quarter, despite entering the race halfway through that quarter, according\u00a0to CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry. The campaign says Bullock doubled his amount of individual donors, with 97% of donations coming in under $200. \"Our growing grassroots support helps build a robust campaign to compete in early states like Iowa and beyond,\" Bullock said.\u00a0\u00a0 TULSI GABBARD\u00a0 It's been 3 months\u2014104 days to be exact\u2014since Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard visited South Carolina. She may be one of the only presidential candidates with billboards lining highways here, but of all of her visits to early states, Gabbard has spent the least amount of time in South Carolina, notes\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell.\u00a0 According to CBS News Battleground Trackers, Gabbard has continued to\u00a0poll\u00a0at 1% or less as the first choice for South Carolina Democrats. In a press release from her team earlier this week, Gabbard's campaign said this weekend's swing will be about her sharing \"her bold vision for ending [the country's] engagement in costly regime change wars, the new Cold War and arms race, and investing our resources in serving the needs of the American people.\"\u00a0 On Saturday, she and six other presidential candidates will be attending the 10th annual\u00a0Blue Jamboree\u00a0hosted by the Charleston County Democratic Party. BERNIE SANDERS Bernie Sanders walked out the hospital Friday with his fist in the air, waving to cameras,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Cara Korte\u00a0says. The Vermont senator was accompanied by his wife Jane and campaign staffers as he shouted to cameras that he was, \"great, great. Thank you.\" He was wearing slacks, a blue blazer and button down shirt.\u00a0 Sanders underwent emergency heart surgery earlier this week and had a stent placed in an artery. In a statement, Dr. Arturo E. Marchand Jr. and Dr. Arjun Gururaj, who treated Sanders at Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center said, \"After presenting to an outside facility with chest pain, Sen. Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction. He was immediately transferred to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. The Senator was stable upon arrival and taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, at which time two stents were placed in a blocked coronary artery in a timely fashion. All other arteries were normal.\" \u00a0 Myocardial infarction is another term for a heart attack. Sanders is expected to appear in the next Democratic debate on October 15. Meanwhile, the senator's campaign is touting its strong fundraising in the third quarter even as hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden continue to lead in recent polls, according to\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. This week, the Sanders campaign announced it had raised $25.3 million from July through September, ahead of Warren's $24.6 million and Biden's $15.2 million.\u00a0 \"While the media and political pundits spent the last several months casting doubt on Sen. Sanders' chances at winning the White House, the working people of this country are ignoring conventional wisdom from Washington,\" said Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir in a statement Friday. \"They're demanding a political revolution which transforms our government and economy, and they are willing to contribute to make that happen.\"\u00a0 Shakir went on to claim that Sanders has received more contributions from individuals than any candidate in the history of American presidential politics and the overwhelming majority came from working Americans. The top occupation listed for donors was \"teacher.\" The average donation, according to the campaign, was $18.\u00a0 \"Our third quarter fundraising totals make clear that Bernie's campaign is part of a working class movement taking on the greed and corruption of the corporate elite. Let me thank all of our contributors and volunteers. We're going to win and create the political revolution,\" said Shakir.\u00a0 On Friday, the campaign also said it had received nearly 24,000 individual donations in South Carolina and more than 30,000 donations from nearly 10,000 people in Nevada. According to the campaign, 99.9% of Sanders' donors have not maxed out their contributions and can give again. With these high fundraising totals,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Cara Korte\u00a0asks, what do these numbers mean for Sanders? In donations, he's beating Warren. In polling, she's ahead. So what with the discrepancy? They're both attracting big crowds. Thousands gathered for Warren in South Carolina this week. But just two weeks ago, Sanders had nearly 5,000 people show up to see him in Warren's home state of Oklahoma.\u00a0\u00a0 TOM STEYER Tom Steyer was the keynote speaker during the 2nd annual Black Elected Officials Summit hosted by the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus in the state's capital city on Friday. SCLBC spokesperson Nick Sottile tells\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that 112 attendees gathered for the event and that all presidential campaigns were invited.\u00a0 In addition to Steyer, surrogates for Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg gave remarks and campaign representatives for Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders were also in attendance. Sottile says that it's important for presidential candidates to earn the support of black voters in South Carolina and to make inroads with the SCLBC.\u00a0 \"We appreciate that [Mr. Steyer] values building relationships in South Carolina,\" said Sottile. \"SCLBC members know their communities and they know what policies can help lift up their constituents\u2026our members play an important role in vetting presidential candidates.\" ELIZABETH WARREN If campaign event turnout is any measure, Elizabeth Warren is leading the Democratic presidential race, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak. In San Diego Thursday night, for example, some supporters waited in line until nearly midnight for a signature Warren \"selfie,\" and she drew an estimated crowd of 8,500 people. The former professor, who had seldom deviated from her stump speech on the trail, has recently shown new strength in interacting with large crowds as she has broken from talking points.\u00a0 Hudak\u00a0also says Warren's national organizing director, Rich McDaniel, was fired from the campaign after an investigation from outside counsel into complaints about inappropriate behavior, according to Communications Director Kristen Orthman. \"Based on the results of the investigation, the campaign determined that his reported conduct was inconsistent with its values and that he could not be a part of the campaign moving forward,\" she said in a statement. FROM THE GRASSROOTS UP Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign\u00a0raised $24.6 million\u00a0in the third quarter, putting her just shy of Senator Bernie Sanders' $25.3 million cash haul this period, but ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris in the top-tier of the presidential race.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Political Unit Associate Producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says the strong totals from Warren and Sanders show the staying power of grassroots-fueled fundraising in the Democratic primary.\u00a0 According to Warren's campaign, the funding came from more than 500,000 donors making more than 940,000 donations. Sanders raised funds from more than 1.4 million donations in the third quarter. Former Democratic campaign aides have praised the cash hauls of both Warren and Sanders but are raising concerns that Democrats can't afford to play by a different set of rules this campaign season. \u00a0 Earlier this week, the Trump campaign announced that combined with the RNC they had raised a total of $125 million in the third quarter. All together, the Democratic candidates in the race have just raised more than $100 million, not including a number of hopefuls who have yet to reveal their fundraising totals. Candidates are required to file with the FEC by October 15. TO YOUR HEALTH Nearly 54 million Americans have pre-existing conditions which would make them uninsurable in the individual market without the Affordable Care Act, according the Kaiser Family Foundation.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Political Unit Associate Producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says the updated analysis comes as health care remains a top issue on the 2020 campaign trail.\u00a0 According to the KFF analysis, the number of adults with declinable pre-existing conditions varied from state to state, from at least a third of the adult populations in West Virginia, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Mississippi to about one-in-five in Colorado. Older working-aged Americans ages 55 to 64 were the group most likely to have a declinable pre-existing condition if not for ACA protections.\u00a0 While most people with pre-existing conditions, according to the KFF, are covered by employers or programs such as Medicaid, people look to the individual market when dealing with transition periods such as job changes. In 2017, Republicans tried and failed to repeal the ACA without a plan in place to replace it.\u00a0 Now, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing a decision on whether to overturn the entire ACA in a case brought by the state of Texas and backed by several state attorneys general and the Trump administration. In April, a group of Republican Senators lead by Senator Thom Tillis\u00a0introduced\u00a0a bill to protect people with pre-existing conditions.\u00a0 VIRGINIA BEACH TOWN HALL During the first 20 minutes of her town hall, swing-district Democrat Rep. Elaine Luria (VI-2) took questions on just the impeachment inquiry.\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that her constituents were evenly split in their opinions on impeachment, with many congratulating her stance in support of the inquiry and others criticizing her, Chairman Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Rep. Luria was firm in her position, and talked about constitutional duty and how Trump's actions affect the 2020 election. \"This instance is a clear instance of the President of United States, enlisting the help of a foreign leader to influence and malign potential political opponents to affect the outcome of our next election,\" she said at the town hall.\u00a0 Navarro\u00a0talked to Vincent Smith, a town hall attendee, who said this latest impeachment inquiry is another distraction tactic and that Luria is \"just following the party line.\" Smith is a worker at Virginia Beach Municipal Building 2, the site of last year's mass shooting. He said the impeachment inquiry was a distraction from issues such as public worker safety. Another woman that attended, Carol Maxwell, supports the impeachment inquiry and Luria's support of it. She also said that Trump's phone call with China shows that he just \"being flippant again\u2026 it's hard to understand and watch.\" When asked about the political risk her stance on impeachment has, Rep. Luria said she has no hesitations. \"People might say, why would you do that? You might not get reelected? I don't care because I did the right thing.\" The only Republican filed to challenge her in 2020 is Scott W. Taylor, a rematch of her 2018 race. PELOSI IN THE PALMETTO STATE Speaker Nancy Pelosi will join the South Carolina Democratic Party for a fundraising dinner in one of the redder regions of South Carolina Friday evening, says\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell. The SCDP says the visit to Greenville is a way of showing Democrats in the region that the party is fighting for them. \"It is allowing us to take the fight directly to the Republicans and allow us to set the narrative in Greenville,\" said SCDP communications director Tim Sullivan. \"Republicans don't realize how much the Trump presidency has hurt them in this state.\"\u00a0 In an email statement sent by his team, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican a close Trump ally, said he welcomes Pelosi to the state but has serious concerns about the impeachment inquiry the House is leading. \"If Nancy Pelosi wants an impeachment inquiry so badly, why isn't she putting every member of the House of Representatives on the record?\" asks Graham in the email statement. \"I believe impeaching President Trump over his phone call with the President of Ukraine is insane.\" IN CASE YOU MISSED IT\u2026 Here is a roundup of the Political Unit's reporting for CBSN and CBSNews.com this week: CBSN PM \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wednesday CBSN PM \u2013 Sanders hospitalized for heart procedure\u00a0// By Cara Korte TRAIL MARKERS \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Monday Daily Trail Markers\u00a0// By Bo Erickson \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tuesday Daily Trail Markers\u00a0// By Sarah Ewall-Wice & Jack Turman \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Wednesday Daily Trail Markers\u00a0// By Ben Mitchell \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thursday Daily Trail Markers\u00a0// By Zak Hudak \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Friday Daily Trail Markers (9/30)\u00a0// By Ellee Watson\u00a0 CBSNews.com \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Andrew Yang raises $10 million in third quarter\u00a0// By Ben Mitchell \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another GOP congressman from Texas says he won't run for reelection\u00a0// By Aaron Navarro & Ellee Watson \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bernie Sanders' campaign announces it raised $25 million in third quarter\u00a0// By Sarah Ewall-Wice \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Cory Booker raises millions after threatening to drop out\u00a0// By Sarah Ewall-Wice \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Elizabeth Warren raises $24.6 million in third quarter\u00a0// By Sarah Ewall-Wice \u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Joe Biden raises $15.2 million, lagging behind his presidential rivals\u00a0// By Sarah Ewall-Wice",

            "article_content": "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Nearly 20 years after he left the White House, Bill Clinton is still sought after for advice by some Democrats running for president. But the names on his dance card in recent months underscore how much his standing in the party has changed.  So far, none of the party's early front-runners has had a formal meeting with Clinton. Nor have the women who are running in the historically diverse primary field.  Instead, Clinton has spoken mostly with male candidates who are considered longshots for the Democratic nomination, including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney.  Clinton remains one of Democrats' most successful politicians of the last half-century and one of its strongest messengers on the economy. Yet the party has shifted considerably to the left since his two terms in White House, and his personal baggage \u2014 as well as lingering hostilities from his wife Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 campaign \u2014 make him an awkward adviser for some in his party's next class of presidential hopefuls.  Tensions run particularly deep between the Clintons and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has launched another bid for the White House. The Clintons blame Sanders for damaging Hillary Clinton during the 2016 primary. And as they assess the 2020 field, the Clintons don't believe Sanders is capable of beating Trump, according to those who have spoken with them.  \"I think that at some point bygones can be bygones, but what you can't get around is the electability question,\" said David Brock, a longtime Clinton ally.  Neither side tried to mask the tensions in the days since Sanders launched his 2020 campaign. When asked Friday on ABC's \"The View\" whether he would seek campaign advice from Hillary Clinton, Sanders said: \"I think not.\"  There was not much warmth between Sanders and Hillary Clinton on Sunday when the two were in Selma, Alabama, to mark the 54th anniversary of the \"Bloody Sunday\" clash.  Bill Clinton has offered advice to a handful of candidates, sometimes meeting them at his New York office or speaking to them by phone. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper was meeting with Hillary Clinton at the couple's Chappaqua, New York, home when the former president stopped by and sat in on the rest of the meeting.  Castro, the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development, said he spoke with Clinton in January and \"got some good advice,\" though he wouldn't elaborate on what they discussed. Others discussed meetings with Clinton on the condition of anonymity in order to speak about the private conversations.  Clinton's friends say he still relishes the political debate and is closely monitoring early developments in the primary. While he doesn't have much of a relationship with some of the younger White House hopefuls, like Beto O'Rourke, some of his contemporaries are considering running, including former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former Vice President Joe Biden. Neither has had a formal meeting with Clinton about the campaign, but they've talked politics with him for years.  The 72-year-old former president rarely offers tactical advice about how to structure a campaign, according to people with knowledge of the conversations. He's said to be well-aware that technology and campaign tactics have significantly evolved since he was last on the ballot in 1996.  But the famously verbose Clinton does dive deep into policy and offers advice on how to appeal to the same economic anxiety that drove some white, working-class voters to side with Trump over his wife.  Clinton's focus on white, working-class voters became something of a joke within his wife's 2016 campaign, with aides privately mocking his insistence on plunging more energy and resources into states like Michigan and Wisconsin. Top campaign advisers believed they didn't need to invest heavily in those reliably Democratic states, then watched Mr. Trump narrowly edge Clinton out in the upper Midwest on his way to the presidency.  Some progressives say that while they agree Democrats can't turn their backs on white, working-class voters, they see Clinton's more centrist approach to winning back those voters as a throwback to an era \u2014 and a party \u2014 that no longer exists.  \"Times have changed,\" said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal group that has endorsed Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \"The center of gravity within the Democratic Party and the electorate overall has moved massively in a more populist direction.\"  Indeed, some of Clinton's signature policies \u2014 including the North America Free Trade Agreement and the 1994 crime bill \u2014 are out of step with the mainstream of the Democratic Party. Clinton himself has acknowledged that the crime bill worsened the problem of mass incarcerations, particularly among black men.  It's Clinton's personal baggage that has created another uncomfortable dynamic with Democrats running for the White House.  New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who had been backed by the couple throughout her political career, said Clinton should have resigned from office because of his affair with a White House intern. The former president has tried to publicly brush off the comment, saying Gillibrand \u2014 a leading Senate voice on sexual harassment and assault \u2014 is \"living in a different context.\" But Clinton allies say the couple's anger at Gillibrand runs deep and their relationship may be irreparable.  Other women seeking the Democratic nomination also haven't met with Clinton, including Warren and California Sen. Kamala Harris. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar spoke with Clinton briefly at last month's funeral for John Dingell, the retired Democratic congressman.  This cycle wouldn't be the first time Clinton has been sidelined in part because of his personal transgressions. His own vice president, Al Gore, distanced himself from Clinton during the 2000 campaign, a move some Democrats still see as a mistake. But views on Clinton shifted, and by 2012, he was considered one of the strongest surrogates for Barack Obama's re-election campaign.  In a shot at those who see Clinton as an albatross this time around, one ally of the former president referenced Gore and said the track record isn't good for candidates who distance themselves from Clinton.  Meanwhile, Democratic frontrunners are going to former President Barack Obama for advice, albeit quietly, according to a recent report in the New York Times.\u00a0  Eric Schultz, a top adviser to Obama, said Obama was \"happy to speak privately with candidates seeking his guidance on the best way to lead the country.\" While the meetings have stayed private, some, like former Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, have spoken about their conversations with Obama. O'Rourke, who hasn't yet announced whether he'll run in 2020, told Oprah Winfrey Obama was \"very generous in sharing what his thought process was leading up to that decision.\"  Schultz, the Obama adviser, told the New York Times that the former president \"counsels candidates to always show up and make their case even in areas or in front of audiences they may not necessarily win; express views and positions that reflect their genuine beliefs; and share a positive vision for the country true to their own personal story.\"  Obama began to reenter the national stage last year ahead of the midterms, delivering a speech in Illinois on the state of American democracy in a not-so-subtle hint at Mr. Trump.\u00a0  \"We have been through much darker times than these, and somehow each generation of Americans carried us through to the other side,\" he said. \"Not by sitting around and waiting for something to happen, not by leaving it to others to do something, but by leading that movement for change themselves. And if you do that, if you get involved, and you get engaged, and you knock on some doors, and you talk with your friends, and you argue with your family members, and you change some minds, and you vote, something powerful happens.\" ",

            "article_content": "Ending months of speculation, former Vice President Joe Biden announced Thursday he is launching his third presidential campaign.\u00a0 Instantly joining the race as an early frontrunner, the former vice president and\u00a0more than a dozen major Democratic candidates\u00a0seek to deny President Trump a second term. \"We are in the battle for the soul of this nation,\" he said in the nearly four-minute long video. \"If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation. And I cannot stand by and watch that happen.\" Unlike most of his competitors who only mentioned President Trump in passing when they announced their candidacies, Biden used his video to cast the race as a battle with Mr. Trump for the very soul and character of the country, calling him out by name. The video opens in Charlottesville, Virginia, the scene of violent clashes between white nationalists and protesters which opens in Charlottesville, Virginia, where in 2017 there were violent clashes between white nationalists and protesters that resulted in the death of one woman. Mr. Trump, at the time, faced a backlash for saying that blame for the violence fell \"on many sides.\" Biden announced his bid in a video released on social media. He is expected to hold a fundraiser Thursday evening in Philadelphia and hold his first formal campaign event in Pittsburgh on Monday. In his appeal to voters, Biden recounted the president's response to the violent white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia two years ago. Biden said he's running for president because everything about American democracy is \"at stake\" under a Trump presidency. \"We have to remember who we are, this is America,\" he added in a final appeal to supporters. Already differentiating himself from the other 17 candidates running, Biden also immediately released Spanish-language advertising to target Latino supporters, which no other candidate did on day one of his or her campaign. For about a year, many Democratic operatives, donors and voters have been\u00a0encouraging Biden, who served as vice president for eight years under President Obama, to enter the crowded race, capture the nomination and thwart Mr. Trump's reelection bid in 2020. Despite not having formally announced his bid until Thursday, Biden has been leading\u00a0several polls\u00a0among primary voters, with only Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders coming close to matching the former vice president's support. People familiar with the campaign's plans said Biden plans to place a particular emphasis on South Carolina, an early primary state where he enjoys strong support from longtime Democratic leaders and the state's large African American community. Read more: The 76-year-old former Delaware lawmaker, a totem of the Democratic Party's establishment, is likely to quickly attract substantial financial support from the party's more moderate wing, as well as the backing of many top Democrats across the country and in Washington, where he worked for decades. Unlike many of the other Democratic candidates in the race, Biden is already a household name across the country, and his allies argue he has the best chance to woo working-class voters in states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania who propelled Mr. Trump to victory during the 2016 presidential election. The former vice president, however, will also face scrutiny from progressives for some of the positions he held during his long tenure in Congress, where he represented Delaware in the Senate for more than 35 years. He has also come under scrutiny in recent weeks by several women who said that he touched them inappropriately at events over the years. In the 1970s, Biden opposed busing to desegregate public schools. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he oversaw the contentious Anita Hill hearings during the confirmation process for then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991. He also helped spearhead efforts to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which many believe fueled a period of mass incarceration that disproportionately affected African Americans and other minority groups. Biden has since embraced more progressive policy stances. He staged two campaigns for the Democratic nomination in 1988 and 2008, dropping out during the primary contests in both. The former vice president joins the largest \u2014 and the most diverse \u2014 Democratic primary field in U.S. history. To date, 20 other Democrats have declared their candidacy for president, including Sens. Sanders, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren; Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke; and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Ed O'Keefe, Emily Tillett and Caitlin Huey-Burns contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "History was made Monday when Sen. Kamala Harris, just the second African American woman to serve in the Senate, announced her\u00a0plans to seek the Democratic nomination for president. The California Democrat chose Martin Luther King Jr. Day to launch her candidacy, and did so by evoking parallels with the groundbreaking 1972 presidential campaign of\u00a0Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress. Chisholm announced her presidential campaign Jan. 25, 1972, nearly 47 years to the day before Harris jumped into the 2020 race. Both Harris and Chisholm were daughters of immigrants. Chisholm was both the first woman and the first African American to seek the nomination of a major party \u2014 Harris is already the fourth woman to launch a presidential campaign just this year. Harris paid homage to Chisholm's historic campaign by using a similar color scheme and typography in her logo and promotional materials. The red-and-yellow style was apparent in a video released by the Harris campaign announcing her run. I'm running for president. Let's do this together. Join us: https://t.co/9KwgFlgZHA pic.twitter.com/otf2ez7t1p Political history buffs on social media immediately noticed the similarities. Interesting Tidbit: Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman ever to run for president, launched her campaign 47 years ago.#KamalaHarris chose yellow and red for her campaign logo in a nod to Chisholm's bid for president with its red and yellow campaign buttons. pic.twitter.com/gf53gIl7DE Chisholm entered Congress in 1969, representing New York's 12th district. It wasn't long before she decided to disrupt the political landscape again by launching a bid for president in 1972. Chisholm's campaign made an impact on young people like Barbara Lee, now a congresswoman herself. At a 50-year celebration of Chisholm's election to Congress last November, Lee, a Democrat from California, told CBS News she was about to flunk out of a college government class at Mills College that required campaign work, since she was uninspired by the other Democrats in the 1972 race. Then Chisholm visited her class. \"[Chisholm] talked about all the issues that were resonating with me as a young African-American single mom on public assistance,\" Lee said. Chisholm ultimately lost the Democratic nomination to Sen. George McGovern, but she continued to make an an indelible impact on politics and culture over seven terms in Congress. Harris' tribute to the trailblazer was subtle, but the color scheme and timing of the historic campaign is a nod to the woman who came before her.

It was also, perhaps, the first time in congressional history that a representative referenced classic hip hop group Naughty by Nature on the House floor. New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the newly installed chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, was giving his speech nominating Pelosi for the position of speaker. At the end of a rousing address which received several standing ovations from the caucus, Jeffries announced Democrats' \u2013 and his own \u2013 unyielding support for Pelosi. \"House Democrats are down with NDP: Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi, the once and future speaker,\" Jeffries said, paraphrasing the 1991 Naughty by Nature hit \"O.P.P.\" Jeffries is telegenic and charismatic, a fixture on cable news whom some have compared to President Barack Obama. He replaced fellow New Yorker Joe Crowley as chairman of the Democratic caucus. And he could also replace Crowley for the role of New York Democrat most likely to be the next Speaker of the House. The current House leadership \u2013 Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn \u2013 are each approaching 80 years old. But right behind them, a new triumvirate of House Democrats is already making waves: Jeffries, Cheri Bustos and Ben Ray Lujan.\u00a0 Pelosi has agreed to a deal which would limit leadership tenure, meaning that she and her two deputies may be leaving their posts sooner rather than later. When they do, this cadre of young, ambitious representatives may be eager to take their place. For now, at least, Jeffries says he is laser-focused on enacting the \"For the People\" agenda, the Democratic policy priority list that the party has committed to enacting. The Democrats' first planned legislation \u2013 after dealing with ending the government shutdown \u2013 will cover health care costs, an infrastructure package and federal ethics and lobbying reform. \"In the Trump era, the only way to break through is to communicate with simplicity and repetition,\" Jeffries said. \"We must continue to message relentlessly.\" The implementation of the \"For the People\" agenda has a few obstacles: Republicans in control in the Senate and the president may not be willing to cooperate with Democratic priorities, and the government remains partially shut down.\u00a0 Jeffries in particular has been a vocal critic of the president, often tweeting about him tauntingly. Still, he believes that his mockery of the president will not preclude him from working with Mr. Trump. He cited his work with the administration, and especially Trump son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, on the bipartisan criminal justice bill \"First Step Act\" which passed both houses of Congress at the end of the year. \"At the same time that I worked closely with the administration on passage of the First Step Act and negotiations to get it over the finish line, I remained a fierce critic of Donald Trump whenever and wherever necessary,\" Jeffries said. Jeffries engaged in a close and somewhat bitter fight to become caucus chairman. Rep. Barbara Lee, a longtime progressive and major force within the Congressional Black Caucus, lost to Jeffries by only 10 votes. Jeffries, 48, represents the rise of a new generation of leaders in the House, leading Lee, 72, to pin her loss at least partially on ageism and sexism. In an interview with CBS News, Jeffries characterized the race as \"a friendly contest of ideas,\" but added that it was important now to unify as a conference. \"I have nothing but the greatest degree of respect for Barbara Lee and what she has represented during her tenure in Congress,\" Jeffries said. \"It's my responsibility to do everything I can to make sure that her important voice is heard loudly and clearly over the next two years.\" Cheri Bustos, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), is fighting to make sure that this year's \"blue wave\" election wasn't a blip on the radar, and that those new faces on the wall stay in office. \"For the next two years we can't rent these districts, we have to own them,\" Bustos said about the 40 members who flipped a seat from red to blue. As DCCC, Bustos will be in charge of preserving and perhaps expanding the Democratic House majority.\u00a0 The congresswoman is considered an up-and-coming leader in the Democratic Party. In 2016, Bustos' southern Illinois district supported President Trump by just under a percentage point. She won the district by 20 points that year, and by 24 points in 2018 \u2013 the largest margin by any Democrat in a Trump district. National Democrats believe that if anyone knows how to speak to the white working-class voters who have turned to Mr. Trump, it's Bustos, who most recently served as chair of \"heartland engagement\" for the DCCC, working to elect Democrats in the Midwest. She sees her term as DCCC chair leading troops into the battle not only for the votes, but for Democrats to \"literally fight our way back into the hearts of working families.\" \"We need to be rebranded and show people that we care desperately and ferociously for families,\" Bustos said. Is she the one to carry out the rebranding? \"That sounds so contrived, and I don't want it to be contrived. I want it to be real,\" she said. Bustos said that she is not thinking about potentially becoming speaker in the future, and is instead is focused on making the DCCC \"a world-class organization.\" Nonetheless, four new members of Congress voted for Bustos to be speaker of the House on Jan. 3, instead of Pelosi. Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, Bustos' predecessor as chairman of the DCCC, was elected to replace Clyburn as assistant Democratic leader, a post recently rebranded as assistant speaker. He says, perhaps optimistically, said that there is no reason why Democrats and Republicans could not work together on a number of priorities.\u00a0 The agenda is a play on Mr. Trump's campaign promises, namely to provide better health care, to implement a bipartisan infrastructure plan, and to \"drain the swamp\" in Washington. \"I think the beauty of the agenda that we're leading with is that there's no reason it shouldn't be done in a bipartisan way,\" Lujan said. As assistant speaker, Lujan must also attempt to hold his caucus together despite points of disagreement. The political priorities of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a self-described democratic socialist from New York City, may not be the same as Abigail Spanberger, a moderate Virginia Democrat who replaced Tea Party congressman Dave Brat. Lujan suggested that ideological differences in the conference would be an asset.\"We celebrate diversity, we celebrate different viewpoints but we come together with the same goals and vision,\" Lujan said, referring to the basic agenda of ethics reform and lowering prescription medication costs. The diversity-is-strength argument did not work so well for House Republicans, who frequently fought amongst themselves in the eight years they controlled the chamber. If Democrats were to become similarly factious, it could quickly undermine leaders' plans for unified messaging. Lujan has also expressed a lack of interest in the speaker position, preferring to focus on his current role. But even as prominent leaders in the party maintain their lack of interest in the highest position in the House, they have the chance to demonstrate their own abilities to communicate with other members and legislate effectively. And that may be the best campaign advertisement for speaker there is. Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - PREET BHARARACORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELLPRODUCERS: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON MICHAEL MORELL: Preet, welcome to Intelligence Matters. It is-- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 PREET BHARARA: Thanks. Good to be here. \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: --great to have you on the show. There is tons to talk about, so I want to jump right in. We are speaking the day after Special Counsel Bob Mueller testified before two Congressional committees. We don't normally do hot takes (LAUGH) here on Intelligence Matters-- PREET BHARARA: Good. Because I don't give them. MICHAEL MORELL: --but we are going to make an exception today, because I think there's a tremendous amount of interest in this. So I want to start by asking you or your single biggest takeaway from his testimony yesterday. \u00a0PREET BHARARA: So I watched all the testimony live before both committees. I and you are among, I guess, the 3% of the (LAUGH) American public who's read the whole report, although I think, as we've discussed offline, you're a Volume One guy. I'm a Volume Two guy. MICHAEL MORELL: What does the mean? \u00a0PREET BHARARA: So Volume One relates to mostly the investigation that had to do with Russian interference with the election and whether or not there was a conspiracy or some other kind of back and forth between the Trump campaign and the Russians with respect to the 2016 election. Volume Two is concerned mostly with efforts to obstruct. And there's a lot of evidence there. As everyone now knows, very famously, Robert Mueller would not make a determination as to whether or not the crime of obstruction was committed, but he wouldn't say it wasn't committed, either. With respect to the first volume, your favorite, he did make an absolute clear determination that there was insufficient evidence to say that there was a conspiracy between members of the Trump campaign and anyone else outside the country. To me, in essence, we're both in punditry and in journalism, there's always two things that people talk about with respect to some blockbuster event, like yesterday's was heralded. One is the sort of theatrics, optics, and all those other words that former, you know, people in the CIA and in law enforcement don't like and don't like to think about. And the other is the substance. And I'll leave it to others, as they have been doing, you know, to give sort of a movie critique of how Bob Mueller looked and acted and how quickly he answered questions. To me, the biggest takeaway is, notwithstanding any of that, and where lots and lots of people, in both the Intel Committee and on the Judiciary Committee, came loaded for bear for Robert Mueller, who some of them have accused of not being, you know, as quick on the uptake as he might have been. Didn't undermine, to my mind, a single fact, a single conclusion at all in the report. You know, there's a lot of bluster about who may or may not have been biased and what happened with this FBI agent named Peter Strzok and the text messages, all of which I think Bob Mueller defended very well. And so what you're left with when you put aside the TV images and some of the speechifying on the part of members of Congress who were trying to make their point, sometimes to the public, sometimes, as we like to say these days, to an audience of one. You had one member of Congress who I thought was, you know, particularly tough on Bob Mueller. And you discover that he's on the short list to replace Dan Coats as the DNI. And then you wonder, \"Well, was that for illumination or was that for a job interview?\" The overwhelming takeaway for me is that the Mueller Report itself, the thing that Bob Mueller did not want to amplify in any way or interpret in any way or gild in any way, that report stands, I think, as strong as it did before he testified. And if the goal of the hearings on the part of some people was to cast doubt on those conclusions and to cast doubt on really serious, sets of facts relating to obstruction, even in Volume One, although not sufficient evidence declared to state that there was a crime of conspiracy, lots of openness on the part of people on the Trump campaign to take dirt from a foreign power. And not just any foreign power, but a significant -- some say the most significant -- adversary. All of those facts stand. And I think in the aftermath of the hearing, we should get away a little bit from the optics and how, you know, someone sounded and who scored points, and look at what those conclusions are and have people act on them. MICHAEL MORELL: So nothing changed from a legal perspective yesterday? PREET BHARARA: You know, and I'm pretty open-minded about these things. I like to see where there may have been some flaw, you know, some fly in the ointment. There was one thing. You know, it's odd, right, this Volume Two. And we can spend time talking about Volume One also. This pronouncement that the president is not exonerated. And there's a reasonable point to be made that, and some members did, whether there's a legal dent made in the argument. And I get it. This idea that prosecutors like me, like I used to be, you either bring a case or you don't bring a case. And when you don't bring a case, you don't say, you know, with great fanfare, \"I'm not exoner--\" you know, if I investigate Michael Morell-- we never did that, by the way. MICHAEL MORELL: Good. Glad to know that. PREET BHARARA: I don't know what they're doing now. There could be all sorts of shenanigans at this podcast -- MICHAEL MORELL: But Jim Comey did this with Hillary Clinton. Right? PREET BHARARA: He did. You know, and you can get in trouble. And it's a weird thing. Now, people have accused Bob Mueller of inverting the burden of proof. The burden of proof in this country is it always lies on the side of the government. We used to say when we went to court, you know, we would tell prosecutors to say, \"The burden of proof always rests on the government's table.\" And we welcome that burden. And we have met that burden. And you never shift it. A, because it's not right, and B, because you'll lose on appeal. And so the argument is a little bit that Mueller has done that by taking great pains to say, \"Not exonerated.\" I think there's a good response to that. You know, the only thing I would say, not to be critical of Bob Mueller, but I don't think he gave as full an answer as he might have to that. Unlike Michael Morell or Preet Bharara or anyone else, the President of the United States, as we've now all learned, and maybe didn't all know before, stands literally in a unique position in the country. He's the only person in the country, by virtue of his position, based on an Office of Legal Counsel memorandum and interpretation, who cannot be charged. So it is against this backdrop of a president having basically immunity while he is in office, who is investigated by the former FBI director and Special Counsel Bob Mueller, who was otherwise bending over backwards to not only be in line with that opinion and not charge a sitting president, but not even be prepared to say, no matter how much evidence there was, that a crime was committed. Not even make that statement. And my sense is, given how much evidence there was on the obstruction side, that as a sort of a counterweight to that, and perhaps an indirect signal to future prosecutors after the president-elect leaves office, and possibly to Congress that has the impeachment power, he did not want it to look like a blessing of the conduct. To make sure clear that unlike in Volume One, with respect to conspiracy, it was not an exoneration. And I appreciate that that's peculiar, and I appreciate that that's not done in ordinary circumstances. But the particular position of the president, because of the OLC opinion and everything else, renders him in a unique position as well. MICHAEL MORELL: So Preet, assume for a moment that you could indict a sitting president. Based on the facts in Volume Two, what would you as a prosecutor have done? Would you have indicted based on those facts? PREET BHARARA: So I'm of two minds on how to answer that question. So there's this famous letter that a thousand former prosecutors signed. I am not a signatory to that document. And it's not because I don't agree. I just I don't like to sign things where there's voluminous language, and if I disagree with a sentence or two. I also have the good fortune, like you, of having my own voice and my own platform, my own podcast and other places where I can say what I think. So I don't know that I agree with every single line in that letter, where the prosecutors say that but for the fact that he's the president he would be indicted and they all would have indicted. And I would have to go through, and I haven't really done this chapter and verse, with respect to the ten or 11 instances of potential obstruction that Bob Mueller outlines in volume two. I think almost without a doubt, with respect to some of those things -- and I'd like to see the underlying documents if I were the person in charge -- with respect to some of those things there would be an indictment of some counts. Maybe not ten counts. Maybe not 11 counts. But some counts that I would bring, if it was not the president of the United States. If it was an ordinary person, without doubt. I suppose you make some other considerations, whether or not there's this OLC opinion, because maybe some of those constitutional considerations come into play but don't carry the day. And the problem with the OLC opinion is it basically says, as a blanket matter, the Constitution does not permit the indictment of a sitting president. It may be the case, I'm not saying this is true, that if there's a very low level crime committed by the president of the United States, one could make the-- I'm not making it, so don't send your letters to me -- one could make the argument that it would unnecessarily undermine the president's ability to carry out his duties, which is one of the points in the OLC opinion. I could see that argument. And maybe you take that into account. But with respect to obstruction of justice of the order and magnitude that's described in the report, yeah, I think I would. MICHAEL MORELL: So to this point about possibly indicting the president after he leaves office. PREET BHARARA: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: And the statute of limitations on obstruction, which is? PREET BHARARA: Five. Five years. \u00a0MICHAEL MORELL: Five years? PREET BHARARA: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: If the president has a second term, does that mean that he can't be indicted? PREET BHARARA: Yeah. So some people have said this is a great campaign slogan (LAUGH) for him in 2020. And may get out the base. MICHAEL MORELL: Surely the founders didn't think that somebody could get away with obstruction of justice. PREET BHARARA: Yeah. Well, the founders also didn't think that Congress would let someone get away with lots of things that they appear to be letting the president get away with also. And maybe I haven't found looked far and wide enough. Although common sense would tell you there should be, I found no persuasive legal analysis that says that you should toll the statute of limitations. In other words, stop it in time for a sitting president who's committing crimes, the statute of limitations for which would run if he gets reelected. It would seem to be, you know, the height of unfairness and injustice if you get this pass because you're in office. And then by virtue of getting elected a second time, the statute of limitations lapses and then you can never be prosecuted. I have not seen someone make an argument that I understand as to why that shouldn't happen. I think logic and common sense and fairness and justice tell you that you should be able to, even after eight years, because you've gotten this luck of the draw.  MICHAEL MORELL: So what's the impact of the attorney general and the deputy attorney general making a formal decision that the president did not obstruct justice on a future indictment? PREET BHARARA: Yes. So that's a very interesting question that I have thought about and discussed a little bit. And, you know, my answer in part is legal and also political, although I hate to use world political. I don't mean political in the way that people think of it. You have an administration that has an Attorney General, Bill Barr, and a particular president. The only way that Donald Trump will not be the president in the next term would be if he gets defeated. I think everyone believes this to be true, unless a third party candidate does what they have never done in the history of the country, or if there's a last minute primary challenge to Donald Trump and another Republican takes over. But in all likelihood if the issue is going to be presented with the Democratic president and a Democratic administration's Attorney General it'll be the other party. And as you know, decisions get made about what force to give to decisions made by the prior administration. And sometimes, and I know this is a complicated issue, subsequent administrations decide to undertake investigations of the conduct of sometimes even CIA officers. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. PREET BHARARA: And some people make the decision, \"You know what? That looks a little--\" and there's controversy no matter what you decide. And some people say, \"Well, that smacks a little bit of you know, sort of punishing your adversaries,\" and you want some continuity and you want to take the country forward. And sometimes doing that kind of thing is not good for the country, even if, you know, there's a reasonable basis to do an investigation and to hold people who did things that you don't like in the prior administration, hold them responsible. So on one hand, if the president has committed these crimes and the evidence is in the hands of a particular United States Attorney, and there's a new administration, they are not necessarily needed. I think a defense lawyer for the president would rightly say, \"What are you talking about?\" The attorney general, who ranks higher than everyone else, made a particular statement. Doesn't have the force of law, I don't think. And that U.S. Attorneys are bound by. So, for example, take away the hypothetical. Let's say we're not talking about the next administration. Let's say an enterprising United States Attorney today in the District of Columbia decides, \"I'm going to indict the president, because I don't care about the--\" you know, after he leaves office, and everyone else remains in office. I mean the reason the hypothetical, I was describing a new administration, is you assume it's not Bill Barr. It would be very odd if Bill Barr remained in office, which wouldn't happen, but suppose, for an enterprising United States Attorney to say, \"I'm bucking what Bill Barr said and I'm going to make the indictment.\" So then you change it and you say, \"Well, there's a new Attorney General.\" I think for it to be palatable, and it wouldn't be palatable to many, many, many people, even in that scenario, you'd have to have I think some kind of pronouncement or evaluation by the next attorney general. Now, there's at least one presidential candidate who has essentially said that, \"I would have an AG who would be directed to do such a thing.\" I think it's a very fraught question, which is not a popular answer. I know there are a lot of people who want the moment that the president leaves office to be charged because of this evidence. That has costs, too. MICHAEL MORELL: Preet, what did you hear Bob Mueller say yesterday about the president's written answers to the special counsel's questions? PREET BHARARA: So what I heard was kind of extraordinary, and he was having a back and forth with a member of Congress who asked about the written questions, and said they contained falsehoods. And I don't have the transcript in front of me, but I think Bob Mueller said something like, \"Generally yes.\" MICHAEL MORELL: Yes.  PREET BHARARA: Which is kind of extraordinary. Now, like, with something else that happened in the hearing that I thought was a huge issue, it appeared that Bob Mueller didn't mean to say what he said. What it sounded like he was saying. I remember at one point he was asked by Congressman Ted Lieu, and I remember my head turned around when I heard him say it. Congressman Lieu said something like, \"The reason you did not indict was because of the OLC opinion, is that not correct?\" And Bob Mueller says, \"That's correct.\" Which to me was an indication that he really did believe the president had committed a crime, although he didn't say it in the report. And is, you know, somewhat at odds with the report. And that, you know, for Congress not to take some action, it would really be conceding that the president is above the law. And that would, I think, have the big impact, both legally and politically. Then he got to the beginning of the intelligence committee hearing, and he walked it back. MICHAEL MORELL: And he corrected himself. Yeah. PREET BHARARA: He said, \"That's not what I meant to say.\" MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, yeah. PREET BHARARA: I don't know if this thing about the written answers was that way, because it's not so clear. He said, \"Generally yes.\" Generally yes what? MICHAEL MORELL: Yes. Yes. PREET BHARARA: If you look at the whole transcript, he appeared to be endorsing the notion that was put in the question by the Congresswoman that there were a lot of lies in those written answers. MICHAEL MORELL: And if that is the case, then would that possibly open the president up to perjury indictments? PREET BHARARA: I would think so. But then you come up against that same barrier. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. Right, right, right. PREET BHARARA: You know, the Office of Legal Counsel. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. Preet, is there anything that you have seen that raises questions about whether federal investigators acted inappropriately in starting the investigation into the Trump campaign or during the investigation into the Trump campaign's interactions with the Russians? PREET BHARARA: I mean I could say, because this was popularized yesterday, Michael, that's outside of my purview. (LAUGH) With respect to the opening of the investigation, that is actually being looked at by the inspector general and I think, you know, some people don't like this. It's also being looked at by U.S. Attorney Durham, because people want to investigate the investigators. It seems like it was all done appropriately. I await the results like everyone else. MICHAEL MORELL: You haven't seen anything that raises questions in your mind? PREET BHARARA: I haven't, but I haven't seen all of it. But I would tend to doubt it. With respect to the rest of it, I mean I think it's, you know, incredibly well known, because the president refers to it, you know, caustically in tweets from time to time, among the things that you see are FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who send a number of text messages that are unfortunate and contrary to the way you want FBI agents to act, that showed a level of enmity for the president, who was being investigated, that Bob Mueller found to be unacceptable and removed him from the case. So yeah, that's bad. Now, the problem is that people don't understand -- and this sounds like a weird thing to say, but just to do a little, quick legal lesson -- just because an agent, one of many on a case, behaved in a way that showed a conflict, potentially not necessarily a real conflict but an appearance of a conflict, and/or even behaved unethically, that doesn't mean that all the evidence of bad conduct and criminal activity evaporates. It is true from time to time that you'll-- the example I always give is, if somebody shoots somebody and kills them, there's a homicide investigation, and you have four or five cops or agents on the case. And there's a lot of evidence of the homicide. But it turns out that one of the cops or one of the agents misbehaves and does something bad. And maybe doesn't like the target, the defendant. You take disciplinary action against that person. You make sure that, in a review, nothing that person did affected the outcome or the investigation. Maybe there'll be motion practice about it. But the killer doesn't go free because someone misbehaved. And that's something that people have to keep straight in their mind. MICHAEL MORELL: Right, right.  So back to Volume One -- which is the Russian interference, and some people call it collusion, other people call it conspiracy. Clearly Bob Mueller has said over and over again that they did not find conspiracy. PREET BHARARA: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: Well, just to be clear. Yeah. PREET BHARARA: To be nitpicky. Insufficient evidence to make a case of conspiracy. MICHAEL MORELL: So in the context of Russian interference in our election, what would conspiracy look like? What would something that reaches the bar of conspiracy look like? PREET BHARARA: So it could be a number of things. I mean essentially the law of conspiracy requires a meeting of the minds or an agreement between one or more people to do a thing. And then depending on the particular conspiracy statute, not always, but it usually requires some overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. So, let's say you plan to rob a bank. And you tell me about it, or I have knowledge about it, because I read some notes. And then later, you end up robbing the bank, and maybe even after that, you know, you say, \"Hey, I bought you this nice coat,\" and I have reason to believe, and maybe I even know outright, that you bought the coat from the bank robbery proceeds. Am I guilty of conspiracy? Well, on the facts, on the bare facts that I just recited, probably not. I mean if those facts came to our attention, we would look really hard at Preet Bharara in that case, because it seems too cute that I knew about your plan to rob the bank, I didn't do anything about it and then I benefited from it later, because often people lie about that. And that's the reason why you do, you know, an investigation. And what you have here is not that far off from that. I mean obviously it's much more complicated, but what I've described is sort of a parallel of what we have in the Russia investigation. Because it may be, as often happens in life, I helped you in some way. You know, I drove the getaway car, or I gave you the keys to my car, or I provided you with somebody who could be your partner in robbing the bank, all of which things might not be apparent unless you do a deep dive and an investigation. Interview everybody and everything else. But mere knowledge and benefiting after the fact from your robbery probably wouldn't be a crime of conspiracy. Now, to take it back to the actual case, if you had foreknowledge and some assistance with respect to the hacking or with respect to when some of the material would be disseminated, assuming that the law allows you to say that that's a thing of value, you know, these emails that were disseminated, and the dirt that was put forward, and you have evidence of that, you have documentary evidence of that or testimonial evidence of that, then you're getting much closer to a conspiracy. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay. So let's switch gears from the Mueller investigation to some other issues. Preet, you talk a lot about the importance of the rule of law. It's a big theme in your book. Couple of questions. What does the rule of law mean in layman's terms? And how would you assess the health of it today? PREET BHARARA: So everyone likes to say rule of law. People who follow the rule of law. People who undermine the rule of law. It's one of those phrases that's like apple pie. Right? And depending on circumstances, it can mean different things to different people. To me, the rule of law means that, you know, laws are not to be flouted. They're to be applied equally, whether you're rich or poor, whether you're white or black, whether you're male or female. And that you put the law not only before particular preferences for folks, and without bias towards groups of people, whether people of color or otherwise, but also above politics. So, one of the great pressures on human beings who are required to interpret the law and enforce the law are things other than what's fair and just. And they can be things like pressure from a politician, pressure from someone who is inequitable. It can be in the form of a bribe. There's all sorts of ways in which the proper path to the right result that should be done fairly and equitably, you know, in a colorblind way and in a politically blind way, can be derailed. And it happens all the time. And so, you know, the point of the rule of law is to always, if you're involved in that process and in that industry, if I can call it that, on doing the right thing. To make sure you check your biases at the door. And the result is ordained not by some prior judgment or predisposition or like or dislike for a politician or for a policy or for ambition. I mean there's a million vices that can derail you from pursuing the rule of law, but the rule of law means looking at the facts and the evidence and doing what is right, no matter what other people say, because they have, you know, a political preference, a personal preference, or some religious or racial or other bias. MICHAEL MORELL: And so where are we today? PREET BHARARA: So I think it's challenged. (LAUGH) I think we're in a period of challenge. Look, every day in police departments and in DA's offices in cases we don't necessarily talk about, there are enough pressures as I've described on making sure the rule of law is done properly. You could have a local sheriff who's trying to get reelected, and because he's trying to get reelected he might want to look tough on a particular kind of crime, even though discretion would tell you, don't do that. There are people who think, \"I can't allow this person to get acquitted. I know this person command the crime. They committed the arson and someone died in the home.\" But the case is a little bit weak, and they're going to do something or take some shortcut to assure conviction. All of those things are violations of the rule of law. So those kinds of things happen all the time. They continue to happen. Hopefully they get policed and they get ferreted out. The crisis that I'm talking about comes from the top. Comes from the president of the United States. Who likes to, by the way, himself use the phrase rule of law, but we've seen in case after case after case credible evidence that he doesn't follow the precepts that I've talked about. That what matters often, if it touches him, or his allies or his associates, is, 'Is it good for him or is it bad for him?' So namely, going back to the report a little bit, you know, he pulls Jim Comey aside and says, about Michael Flynn, \"Could you see your way clear to letting him go,\" the former National Security Advisor. That's not rule of law. Or he tries to get Jeff Sessions, his hand-picked attorney general, to un-recuse himself from the Russia investigation because he thinks what? He thinks that might help Donald Trump in getting away with something. That's not rule of law. Or he decides, and this is maybe a little bit more controversial, to pardon people. And he has that discretion. That's a little bit more an outlier issue. But before he did that, with respect to Joe Arpaio, my recollection is there's a report that he also told Jeff Sessions, \"Can you do something about Joe Arpaio?\" And then finally, undermining the rule of law of not just about trying to get special treatment, which is definitely antithesis to the rule of law, for allies, but also worse treatment for adversaries. So just the idea of being present before you've seen the evidence and allowing people, or fomenting the chant, \"Lock her up,\" and saying, you know, \"I'm going to put my adversaries in jail\" -- all of those things undermine the rule of law. And the reason why it's so important, and unlike the garden variety, everyday, local examples I've been talking about, is he's the commander-in-chief. He's the leader of the country. He oversees the Justice Department. And, you know, people start to think, \"Well, maybe law enforcement is a game. Maybe the way these things are applied, it should matter if you're powerful or not powerful, and who's won. And you get a better chance at things than if you've lost or if you're in a minority position.\" And so that I think has been very undermined. At the risk of going on a little bit longer. When you ask, you know, how do I feel about it -- so that's all bad stuff. I still feel pretty good about where we are, because we have a lot of checks and balances and we have a lot of good practices in place. One thing essential to the rule of law is an independent and neutral judiciary. Are there some judges who are not so neutral? Yeah, they're human beings, too. I write about that in the book. But in the federal system, at least, you have life tenure. If you're a federal judge and you piss off the president, you remain a federal judge. If you're U.S. Attorney you piss off the president, you get a podcast. (CHUCKLE) So it's a very different thing. And I think that the judges have been doing a good job. And whether it's with respect to the Muslim ban or the census case or anything else, even knowing that you're going to have the guy with the biggest megaphone in the world call you out by name, accuse you of bias, maybe even say things that, you know, that are borderline racist, you're still going to have your job. You do what you do. You keep your head down. I think there are a lot of positive signs about the rule of law. MICHAEL MORELL: And people are hanging in there on that. PREET BHARARA: I think they are. I think they are. I don't know how much people hang in there if there's a second term, but so far we have a very robust democratic tradition, which includes the rule of law, so I feel okay about it, but I'm worried. MICHAEL MORELL: So Preet, I wanna finish up with some personal questions. PREET BHARARA: Okay. (LAUGH) MICHAEL MORELL: For one, why did you gravitate to the law? And why did you switch from private practice to public service? PREET BHARARA: So I did not do well in chemistry. I'm an immigrant from India. My father and mother also, obviously, came from India. My dad is a pediatrician. Was a pediatrician for many, many years in Asbury Park, New Jersey. He wanted, and I hate to be stereotypical here, but he wanted more than anything else for both of his sons, myself included, to become medical doctors. So, you know, perhaps I wanted to disappoint him. I wasn't good at chemistry. Did fine in biology. The truthful answer is I just-- over the course of time there were certain things that happened, certain things that I read that made me think, you know, the greatest thing in the world for me would be to be in a courtroom. You know, before I understood the kinds of different lawyers you could become, I read Inherit the Wind when I was in junior high, which apparently they now call middle school. And it made such an impression on me. And then, you know, To Kill a Mockingbird, it's a little clich\u00e9 to say that that made an impression on you, but a lot of people read To Kill a Mockingbird, they don't become lawyers. I did. And I just thought there's nothing better than to advocate for a side. I like to argue and I like to express myself. And you asked the question why switch from private practice to public service. I never intended to be long in private practice. By the time I got to law school, I realized that the thing I wanted to be was a prosecutor, and I could choose what kind of prosecutor. To be a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, that was in part because of a class I took called Trial Practice, which was taught at the time by someone that we also both know, Michael B. Mukasey, who at the time was a federal district court judge in the Southern District before he became the attorney general of the United States. And I had never had a more exhilarating experience than doing these simulated things you do in a trial. Cross-examination. Direct examination. Rebuttals. Opening statements. And then to learn what the ethic of that place was, where your only job every day, unlike for other kinds of lawyers, is to do the right thing, and the right way for the right reasons, which I say over and over again in my book. And I got a sense of the culture of that place and the culture of a good U.S. Attorney's office and a good prosecutor's office. So because that office doesn't hire people directly out of law school, I had to go make my bones somewhere else first. MICHAEL MORELL: Preet, you met with President-elect Trump at Trump Tower during the transition. PREET BHARARA: I did. MICHAEL MORELL: What happened in that meeting?  PREET BHARARA: So I had been the U.S. Attorney for seven years, appointed by President Obama. Confirmed by the Senate. And then I s-- MICHAEL MORELL: Unanimously. PREET BHARARA: Unanimously. Right. And then you get to the election in 2016 and Donald Trump won, in a surprise victory, and I began making plans to take a fancy vacation, because I presumed I was going to go into private practice and have dough to go someplace, you know, farther away than Philadelphia, which is often a typical vacation for my family. (LAUGH) And then a few days later, Senator Schumer, for whom I worked as chief counsel, called and said the president-elect had called him, and, among other things, had said, \"Do you think Preet would stay for another term?\" He had been reading about my office and me, I guess. And then I was asked to come meet with him at Trump Tower on the 26th floor, the famous gold elevators, which I thought was a weird thing. I go to the office. You'll appreciate this, given what you used to do. The president was late. The president-elect was late, which I'm told is unusual for him. He's, among other things, you know, a pretty punctual guy. And I was greeted by Steve Bannon and Jared Kushner in his stead. And the reason the president-elect was late that day, I'm told, was that there had been this controversy that he didn't care about his national security briefing, which I guess, you know, is the precursor to the presidential daily brief. But he got enough grief about it that he decided to take it that day, and so he was delayed in meeting me. We had a perfectly pleasant meeting. He made it clear that he had heard about the office and thought the office was successful. And essentially asked me to stay another term. At the same time, he asked me for my phone numbers, which I thought was an odd thing. And so I wrote my phone numbers on a post it pad. I thought it was odd, because obviously I was there, so someone must have had my phone numbers. MICHAEL MORELL: Right, right. PREET BHARARA: And it was a very cheery, positive meeting. I made clear to make a statement that, \"I presume that you want me to stay because you understand the office is independent, and we've gone after Republicans and Democrats and public corruption and everything else. And presumably you want me to continue to do the job as I've been doing it.\" I thought it was important to say that. And then he told me to tell the gathered press downstairs that I've been asked to stay. And I did. So that meeting was fine. MICHAEL MORELL: Then you were asked to step down. \u00a0PREET BHARARA: And I was asked to step down. MICHAEL MORELL: So what happened? \u00a0PREET BHARARA: So the president-elect called me, privately, without the input of the acting attorney general or anyone else. I thought that was very peculiar. Why is the next president of the United States-- who I'd never met him before. Never had any experience with him before. Why is he trying to cultivate what seemed like a personal relationship, or a special relationship, with a sitting U.S. Attorney who has jurisdiction over, among other things, the Trump Organization, the Trump Foundation, all sorts of business matters, campaign matters and everything else. And I was disturbed by it. Made a report of it. Took notes on it. Let the head of transition know about it during the transition period. So he called me twice during the transition period. And I assumed once Donald Trump became the president -- this is before I knew about executive time -- that he would be too busy to be reaching out to the local federal prosecutor in a jurisdiction that has great meaning to him. And I was wrong about that. On March 9th, it was a Thursday afternoon, I got a call, I got a message, I wasn't at my desk and my assistant had left early, asking me to return the call of the president of the United States. So that I thought was a bright light. And, as I've described elsewhere, I had an hour-long discussion with my deputy. \"Do you return the call to the sitting president of the United States?\" And it might seem odd to listeners. You know, the boss. He's the boss. I serve at his pleasure. I'm only there because he asked me to stay. You can only serve if a president asks you, and if a president asks you to go, then you go. So might think it odd that I wouldn't return the call. It seems rude. And I'm sure in his mind he thought it was rude. But there were other considerations, including-- MICHAEL MORELL: Sure. PREET BHARARA: --what it would look like. And remember-- MICHAEL MORELL: Sure. PREET BHARARA: --this was after a campaign in which Donald Trump made a huge issue of this tarmac meeting between then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton, former president, when his wife, Hillary Clinton, was under investigation, and Donald Trump, at rally after rally after rally, cast aspersions on that meeting that happened on the side. And I thought to myself, \"This is a version of that.\" People had already been calling for investigations of Donald Trump. The emoluments clause case I think had already been filed in the Southern District of New York. And maybe he was calling for innocuous reasons. Maybe he was going to tell me, you know, \"I hope you're doing well.\" But it's odd for a person like the president of the United States to be reaching out when he's a president. And so I made the decision I wasn't going to return the call unless I knew what it was about, or unless it would be the attorney general or some other intermediary. I told the attorney general, Jeff Sessions' chief of staff, that this call had happened. He agreed with me that I shouldn't call him back. Or speak to him. So I returned to the call to the secretary at the White House and said, \"I don't mean to be difficult or disrespectful, but I don't think it's right for me to talk to the president.\" Twenty-two hours later I was asked for my resignation. I cannot prove that those two things are connected, because everyone else who was an Obama holdover was asked to leave too. But I've lived long enough to know that those two things are so close in time, they can't be a complete coincidence. MICHAEL MORELL: You're asked to step down, but you don't. PREET BHARARA: I don't. MICHAEL MORELL: You don't. \u00a0PREET BHARARA: Well, at first I don't-- MICHAEL MORELL: Why? PREET BHARARA: So that happened on a Friday afternoon. At first I refused to step down, because I wasn't sure I was being asked to go. You know, I got called on a Friday afternoon by, you know, the acting deputy attorney general, Dana Boente, who I knew from working in the Justice Department. And he just had this sort of blanket directive to tell everyone who was an Obama appointee to go. Now, there were some Obama appointees who were not going to go. They include Rod Rosenstein, who was sitting United States Attorney in Baltimore, who was going to be the DAG. And so I said to Dana Boente, you know, \"Hey, are you sure this applies to me?\" MICHAEL MORELL: Right. I'm having all these other conversations. PREET BHARARA: Yeah. I mean the president-elect of the United States asked to meet with me, asked me to stay on before he picked a secretary of State. It was the same week that he met with Mitt Romney and hadn't decided yet. So he thought it was important enough to call me in, shake my hand, look me in the eye and ask me to stay. And so I just wanted to know if that was right. If it was the president's wish. It would be embarrassing to accidentally resign from a job-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right. Right, right-- PREET BHARARA: --that you liked a lot. MICHAEL MORELL: Yes. PREET BHARARA: And at the same time, the press-- MICHAEL MORELL: Gotcha. PREET BHARARA: --was calling the White House and saying, \"Does it apply to Preet?\" They said, \"Call the Justice Department.\" They called the Justice Department. \"Does that apply to Preet?\" They said, \"Call the White House.\" So that first evening I just wanted a straight answer and not to be subject to, you know, a weird, you know, bureaucratic glitch. Remember, not to compare myself to these people, but a week into the presidency they announced the Muslim ban. And, you know, there's a good amount of incompetence at the White House. Not just, you know, nefariousness, but incompetence. And they hadn't given any thought to the idea of what to do with people who were green card holders returning to the United States. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. \u00a0PREET BHARARA: I'm like, \"Maybe this is one of those kinds of mistakes.\" That they want everyone to go-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right, right. PREET BHARARA: --but there are a few people not. And I thought, \"Maybe that's why the president was calling me.\" MICHAEL MORELL: Right. PREET BHARARA: Maybe he was calling me to say, \"Hey, this doesn't apply to you.\" Maybe he was calling me to say, \"Look, this thing is happening tomorrow. Thanks for your service, but I changed my mind.\" I just wanted to know. So ultimately I said, \"I want to know not from some, you know, bureaucrat at the Justice Department, but I would like to know directly from the person who asked me to stay, does he want me to go.\" Which would not be the kind of thing you do ordinarily. MICHAEL MORELL: Gotcha. PREET BHARARA: \"And once I know--\" MICHAEL MORELL: Gotcha, gotcha-- PREET BHARARA: --\"that the president wants me to go, I will go.\" That took another 24 hours. MICHAEL MORELL: Gotcha. PREET BHARARA: And then I left. MICHAEL MORELL: Gotcha. So at the end of the day, do you think he was trying to build a relationship with you to influence you as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District, the guy who would be looking at activities that he might have conducted as a private businessman? PREET BHARARA: So in hindsight, yes. I mean I'm not making any accusation there was any particular thing, but now that I've seen him in action, now that I've seen -- and at the time I didn't know about these -- the conversations he had with Jim Comey about, you know, laying off people. The conversations he had with Jeff Sessions. The things that have come to the fore in my own district. The stories I've read about how the president has wanted my successor, Geoff Berman, to perhaps un-recuse himself. I don't know if they're true enough, but those are the stories. To un-recuse himself from the Michael Cohen investigation. Donald Trump has shown himself to be, in case after case after case, someone who wants his guy in places where they can be helpful to him. Not to uphold the rule of law, not to do the right thing, not to play it by the rules, not to go by the book, but to benefit him. Because, frankly, there's no other explanation as to why the busiest man on Earth, who has no prior relationship with me, the only significance of me at all to him, other than to, you know, do a good job and maintain the public peace and protect public safety, but that's not what he was calling about, was to maybe be helpful, maybe turn a blind eye to something or maybe cause something to go well for him or maybe cause something to go poorly for one of his adversaries. I will never be able to prove that, but based on a course of conduct, that's what I believe to be true. MICHAEL MORELL: So Preet, last question, you have a terrific podcast called Stay Tuned With Preet. What have you learned from being a podcaster? PREET BHARARA: Boy, I can talk. (LAUGH) No, what I've learned is it is really interesting to talk to people about what they do. People may not know. I just interviewed you for an hour before we did this. And I didn't know it was going to be as fun as it is, and I presume you've had the same experience. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, absolutely. PREET BHARARA: That you think you know something, but then you learn about people. I mean some people that I've known, I learned about aspects of their lives, how they do stuff. And I think the most interesting moments in any podcast is when I'm learning something for the first time. And you don't stick to a script. And it's not quite like examining a witness at trial, but a little bit. You go with the flow. You just use the example of you and me. You know, we had a conversation a little while ago. I had a game plan of what I was going to talk to you about, then we started talking about how to recruit an asset in the CIA. MICHAEL MORELL: A spy. Yeah. PREET BHARARA: How to make a spy. And I think we talked about that for 35 minutes. (LAUGHTER) MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. PREET BHARARA: So what I've discovered is if you're curious, you can learn a lot. I'm having an education beyond what I expected to have, just by having the opportunity to talk to smart, thoughtful people every week. MICHAEL MORELL: Preet, thanks for joining us. PREET BHARARA: Thank you.",

Steve Bullock, the only candidate who didn't qualify for the last debate but did for this one, will use Detroit as a way to introduce himself to Democratic voters. As the only Democratic candidate to win a statewide election in a state won by President Trump in 2016, Bullock is hoping that he can capitalize on his appeal to moderates and rural voters. Our Q:\u00a0Will the Detroit debate give Bullock the name I.D. he needs to jumpstart his campaign? Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Jack Turman:\u00a0Since the last debate, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg has expanded his staff and released more policy proposals. In Iowa recently, Buttigieg said that he wasn't going to be aggressive in the debate \"for its own sake.\" He added, \"Of course I'm going to vigorously defend what I believe in and when there are contrasts to be drawn, we're going to draw them.\" Buttigieg is sharing the debate stage with Beto O'Rourke. Both have said that their relative youth is an asset, and that the Democratic Party embrace new leaders to succeed. Our Q:\u00a0How will Buttigieg and O'Rourke distinguish themselves in making the generational change argument? Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster:\u00a0Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney will be on the debate stage Tuesday night with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The senators are two of the leading proponents for Medicare for All as a fully government run program that would eliminate private insurance, an idea Delaney has frequently criticized on the trail.\u00a0 \"I think they need to defend how they're actually going to beat Donald Trump if they're actually going to tell half the country that they're going to lose their private health insurance,\" Delaney said in Iowa on Wednesday. He also signaled he may question their plans to eliminate student debt by asking \"what are you going to say to someone who just paid off their student loans?\" Delaney went on to add that some candidates are \"running on basically massive upheaval of the entire U.S. economy\" that he says is \"driven by deep distrust for the private economy.\" Looking ahead, Delaney has yet to qualify for the September debate stage. When asked about how candidates move forward if they aren't on that stage, Delaney said \"they may not have to be on the third (stage), but they have to be on the fourth (stage).\" He said not qualifying creates \"more headwinds\" for candidates.\u00a0 Our Q:\u00a0Will Delaney have a moment at this debate that can be a springboard toward getting on one of those fall stages? Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Stephanie Ramirez:\u00a0The former Colorado governor will get to face the candidate he's been criticizing the most in recent months: Bernie Sanders. Hickenlooper is a frequent critic of Medicare for All and the Vermont senator's brand of \"democratic socialism,\" and warns that if Democrats move too far left that Donald Trump will get reelected. Hickenlooper pitches himself as a more \"middle-of-the-road\" candidate, but has struggled to separate himself from some of the other more moderate candidates, particularly Joe Biden. Hickenlooper is celebrating a recent\u00a0Fox News poll\u00a0that shows him at 2% support. It's a big win for him, but a small increase in this crowded 2020 field. Hickenlooper has struggled to break-out of the crowd, endured a\u00a0campaign shake-up\u00a0and repeated calls to run for the U.S. Senate instead. Our Q:\u00a0Will Hickenlooper have a break-out moment from this second debate that could help boost support? Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson:\u00a0Look for Sen. Amy Klobuchar to contrast herself with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who will be a few podiums away from her on Tuesday. Klobuchar's message is that she's been an effective senator who will know how to get things done in the White House. \"Me? Well, I have big bold plans, yes. But I've also given myself and our Congress and our nation deadlines,\" as she said in a July speech centered on what her first 100 days in office would look like.\u00a0 Klobuchar has recently laid out how she would pay for her\u00a0housing plan\u00a0that addresses rural home shortages, and her new\u00a0senior citizen plan, which aspires to end Alzheimer's. But will ask for similar details from her rivals? If candidates are light on specifics, will Klobuchar say they're \"all foam, no beer!\" as she does for some of Mr. Trump's promises?\u00a0 The senator has met the polling threshold for the September debates but not yet the required 135,000 unique donors. Our Q:\u00a0Will Klobuchar's emphasis on not \"over promising\" start to appeal to Democratic primary voters as the primaries move closer -- or will they look elsewhere?\u00a0 Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry:\u00a0Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke's campaign is hoping to bounce back from what was widely perceived as a lackluster debate performance in Miami. Since the last debate, O'Rourke has seen a slip in polls and fundraising. A campaign official tells CBS News that O'Rourke is hoping to \"connect with voters like he does on the ground,\" and says that during the last round of debates he did not come across as himself.\u00a0 Aides say O'Rourke's goal heading into Detroit is to convey a clear sense of who he is to voters. Our Q:\u00a0Can O'Rourke reclaim the momentum and excitement that he had when he entered the race? Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson:\u00a0After prep sessions this week that included watching \"game tape\" of the last debate, Rep. Tim Ryan plans to drive the 3.5 hours from his Ohio district to the Motor City to address one of his key issues: manufacturing jobs.\u00a0 While Ryan's polling support is just above zero, as this week's\u00a0CBS News latest Battleground Tracker\u00a0indicated, he has been for months engaged in debate with his fellow Democrats, the Trump Administration and General Motors over the company's decision to shutter a factory in his district and eliminate roughly 1800 jobs.\u00a0 Ryan says it's an example of how he says the middle class has been\u00a0\"getting screwed\" for the last 40 years, and if there's any place for a pitch like that, it's probably Detroit. Our Q:\u00a0With more than two dozen options to choose from, will Democratic voters find Ryan compelling enough this week to get behind?\u00a0 Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Cara Korte:\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders did not have \"a moment\" in the first debate last month. That might be a good thing, seeing as the night's biggest moment was the contentious debate between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Sanders stayed out of the cross hairs, but it demonstrates how different this election is for him, as he no longer is sharing the spotlight with just one other opponent.\u00a0 This week's debate will be even more challenging as he stands right beside his fellow progressive Elizabeth Warren, forcing Sanders to try to own his ideological turf. Our Q:\u00a0At some point, the two need to clearly differentiate themselves for waffling voters. Will Tuesday be the night or could both candidates hesitate to look like the aggressor? Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak:\u00a0The Massachusetts senator has been living by the \"slow and steady wins the race\" mantra, never seeing a major surge, but finally now polling ahead of everyone except Joe Biden. In the last debate round, the former law school professor must have felt as if she were back in a classroom. She presented her ideas and then watched a group of lesser-known candidates debate their own while dodging every opportunity to criticize hers. \u00a0 Warren often refers to her candidacy and goals as a \"fight\" at campaign stops. But periodic volleys with Mr. Trump aside, Warren has shown a striking ability to stay out of the fray. Bernie Sanders, with whom she will share the stage Tuesday, has absorbed many of the attacks on policies that Warren also champions. When Sen. Michael Bennett takes shots at plans for college debt forgiveness and eliminating private health insurance, he calls them \"Bernie's plan.\" That could be because Sanders introduced specific bills for those things, but Warren has called for equally progressive measures. Either way, it illustrates the extent to which Sanders has become the face of the progressive wing of the Democratic party. Now, Warren and Sanders will share a stage, with her leading him in several polls. If the past is any indication, the two are likely to avoid criticizing one another. Our Q:\u00a0Will Warren have to defend her progressive agenda in the same way Sanders has? Via CBS News Associate Producer Sarah Ewall-Wice:\u00a0\"I just want to be myself,\" said author and activist Marianne Williamson in an interview with MSNBC over the weekend when asked about her strategy heading into the debate.\u00a0 Williamson will be positioned on the far left side of the stage during the debate, which is also where she was positioned during the first debates in June. However, not being center stage didn't hurt her during the first go-round.\u00a0 According to Google, Williamson was the most searched candidate as the debate closed. So what can we expect to hear from her? On Sunday, Williamson's campaign announced if elected president, she plans to create a Department of Children and Youth which would \"work interdepartmentally with all of the different government entities that affect children's lives.\" When asked how the Department would be different than the Education Department in a Face the Nation interview, Williamson said there needs to be more than just education funding; there needs to be wraparound services. Our Q:\u00a0Can Williamson convince the audience that she can put her ideas into action without the political experience that other candidates have in this crowded field? DOWN SOUTH:\u00a0During a neighborhood cookout co-sponsored by South Carolina Teamsters, voters said they'll be watching the presidential debates to see which candidates will make labor unions a top priority while also focusing on healthcare, education, and infrastructure.\u00a0 The Teamsters Union calls itself North America's strongest and most diverse labor union. Compromised of workers from a variety of occupations, Teamsters boasts 900 affiliates throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0says members of the union came from different parts of the state to participate in today's event.\u00a0 Sabrina Isom is a business agent and political organizer for Teamsters Local 509 in West Columbia. She's had a chance to speak with Sens. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren during their visits to Columbia. She says that her and fellow co-workers will be watching the debates this week to see which candidate will boldly speak out for labor unions.\u00a0 \"I want to see some teeth\u2014some action,\" said Isom. \"If they can stand out and say 'I will support labor 100% and that's my key mission as president,' then we'll look at them.\" Evelena Moultrie, a South Carolina teamster and local school bus driver in Hollywood, echoed Isom's sentiment and added that healthcare has to be a top priority too.\u00a0 \"Come December I'll be 65, I will be applying for my Medicare card,\" said Moultrie. \"The Medicare now runs 80-20\u2026what about the people that don't have a job, what about the people that are retiring and can't afford that 20%?\" Moultrie has heard former Vice President Joe Biden speak twice and has attended one of Sen. Kamala Harris' events during their swings through the Palmetto state. While she is still undecided, she maintained that whoever gets her vote will have to be in favor of universal healthcare. \"We need universal health because this is the richest country but yet they will not provide universal health,\" said Moultrie. \"We need something better.\" BY THE NUMBERS:\u00a0The Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Committee met in Washington, DC on Tuesday to go over 23 states' plans for sending delegates to the 2020 Democratic National Convention.\u00a0CBS News Associate Producer Ellee Watson & CBS News Political Unit Intern Julia Cherner\u00a0report that four states will receive additional delegates for holding their primaries after April if their delegate plans reach full compliance. The committee determined Tuesday that the plans for Louisiana, Rhode Island, New York, and Pennsylvania reach conditional compliance. Once the state parties address some technical questions about the plans, they will be in full compliance and will receive extra delegates. At the time of this writing, the committee has only reviewed 14 of the 23 plans.\u00a0 DCCC shake up:\u00a0The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had a big shakeup of top staffers Monday night, as six senior staff members resigned -- including executive director Allison Jaslow. The resignations came amid concerns from minority lawmakers about the organization's diversity.\u00a0 Politico first reported last week that Reps. Vicente Gonzalez and Filemon Velam were pushing for Jaslow's exit and to be replaced by a \"qualified person of color.\" DCCC chairwoman Rep. Cheri Bustos called Jaslow's resignation a \"sobering day\" and said in a statement, \"I recognize that, at times, I have fallen short in leading these talented individuals\u2026 I hear your concerns, and we can and must do better.\"\u00a0 The DCCC has since appointed a special council to search for a new executive director. In a June interview with\u00a0CBS News Political Correspondent Ed O'Keefe, Bustos portrayed the DCCC as having \"the most diverse staff that you've ever seen in this building.\" A DCCC aide also confirmed to\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that five other members resigned yesterday: communications director Jared Smith, communications aide Melissa Miller, political director Molly Ritner, deputy executive director Nick Pancrazio and diversity director Van Ornelas.\u00a0 The aide also said recommendations for immediate restructuring came from other DCCC seniors staffers, all of whom supported Jaslow's interim replacement, Jacqueline Newman. Other organizations/PACs are taking the opportunity to criticize the Democratic campaign arm. The progressive Justice Democrats PAC called the news \"embarrassing\" and criticized the DCCC's role in Democratic primaries. In the past two days, the National Republican Congressional Committee has sent out multiple press releases highlighting the DCCC's upheaval and aimed to tie Reps. Joe Cunningham and Jared Golden to Bustos by bringing up their votes for her as House Speaker.",

            "article_content": "INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - DENNIS ROSSCORRESPONDENT: MICHAEL MORELLPRODUCERS: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON MICHAEL MORELL:Dennis, welcome to Intelligence Matters. It is great to have you on the show. And more importantly, it is great to see you.\tDENNIS ROSS:My pleasure, and really great to see you.\tMICHAEL MORELL:As you know Dennis, I asked you to be on the show today to talk about where we stand, or more importantly where we don't stand, on the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. But before we get to that, I want to get your sense on two other issues.\tDENNIS ROSS:Sure.\tMICHAEL MORELL:The first is the current confrontation between the United States and the Iranians. How dangerous? How did we get here? What should we do going forward? How do you think about this?\tDENNIS ROSS:You really raise, I think, not only an important question, but really looking at it from three different standpoints. The first one, which I think is the most important, is how did we get here? And I think the answer, ironically, is not that the Trump amendment walked away from the JCPOA. Because the Iranians adopt--\tMICHAEL MORELL:That's the Iranian nuclear deal?\tDENNIS ROSS:Right. The Iranians adopted a policy of strategic patience that basically, okay, the US walked away. It would try to outlast Trump. It would try to build on the isolation of the administration. And it would like to keep the Europeans and the Russians the Chinese, in a sense, on board with them. And so basically for one year, they did not walk away from any of the limitations in the Iran nuclear deal in the JCPOA. But when the administration made the decision to go ahead and end the waivers for eight countries that were allowed to buy Iranian oil, that's when we saw the Iranians basically flip the switch.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And that was some breathing space for them?\tDENNIS ROSS:Yes. What's a very interesting ironic point here is the State Department, one week before the decision on the waivers was finalized, assumed the decision was going to be to continue to keep them, because it went to those countries and said, \"Okay, we're not ending the waivers,\" one week before. And I know this because basically I heard it from some of the countries. And obviously, there was a reason they were doing this. Because from the State Department standpoint, we had the best of all worlds. The administration was putting real pressure on the Iranians. You can look at how much the economy has declined in real terms, how the public in a sense is being squeezed. The economy has been in free fall without ending the waivers. So it was the best of both worlds, because there was pressure on the Iranians. And yet, the Iranians didn't have a reason to walk away from the JCPOA. Or at least they had made a decision not to do that. Now, the minute they walk away, as we begin to see it, then it puts the administration in position. Okay, what do you do in response? And what we see with this administration is it's doubling down on economic sanctions. It's tough rhetorical language. But basically, when it comes to doing anything beyond that, that's not what this president wants to do. Look, one can't argue with not wanting to be in endless Middle East wars. That's obviously the right instinct. But you've got to be a little bit concerned that the nature of how the administration has adopted a position sends mixed signals to the Iranians. They made a decision. 'Okay, you're gonna squeeze us this much.' And by ending the waivers, what it did is the Iranians were in a position where they were still exporting about 1.1 million barrels a day of oil. Definitely down from what they were doing before, almost by 50%. And yet, it still will generate enough revenue that all right, even if the economy is in trouble, the Iranian leadership felt they could manage this. Now, when the waivers were ended, that went from 1.1 million barrels a day of export to about 300,000. That's when the Iranians basically said, \"Okay, they're putting maximum pressure on us. We're going to put maximum pressure on them.\" And that's what we've seen. You see it along two different dimensions. Dimension number one is everything in the region. And here I would just flag -- John Bolton, the national security advisor, on May fifth said we had intelligence. This is of course after we made the decision on the waivers, which became effective the day before. May fifth, John Bolton declares we have intelligence that the Iranians and their proxy forces are going to threaten us. They need to know we're sending a carrier strike force there to the region. And he said any threats against US troops directly, US interests, or America's friends in the region will be met with, I'm quoting, \"relentless force.\" Now since that time, I mean, two days after that, you had an explosion in Yanbu, a Saudi port along the Red Sea. Two days after that, you had four tankers that had limpet mines attached to their hulls. Two days after that, you had Houthi drones that hit Saudi petroleum stations. Obviously I'm establishing what is a pretty clear pattern. We had bases in Iraq where US forces were hit by, again, Shia proxy militia rockets. In Basra, we had an oil facility where Exxon was hit by the same, another attack on tankers, so forth and so on. That's one sign of the pressure. By the way, even though supposedly relentless force was going to be the answer to this, the other side was beginning the incremental walk away from the JCPOA, designed to put the administration in a position where, okay, here's the price that we can impose on you. What are you going to do? And by the way, not responding to the shoot down of the drone was probably the right thing to do, because again, what's the strategy here? What was this a part of? What was your next step? But what the Iranians are seeing is, 'Okay, unless we kill Americans directly, we can keep doing this.' Now here, there's a real potential for miscalculation. What if Shia proxy forces kill American forces, say in Iraq, which is not impossible, or even in Syria, where we still have a presence even though it's reduced. The small size also increases its vulnerability. So for me, I think there is a real risk of miscalculation and an escalation. Neither side may want it. But what we're seeing right now is both sides engaging in what I'll call a maximum pressure on the other, each expecting somehow that that will force the other to back down or take a step back.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Dennis, the second issue I wanted to ask you about quickly is the peace negotiations with the Taliban in Afghanistan. Is there real hope here or not? How do you think about this?\tDENNIS ROSS:It's a wonderful question. I have to say that I have a fair degree of ambivalency here. On the one hand, talking about an endless war, this is it. Talking about a war that trying to remake Afghanistan has proven to be impossible for everybody who sought to do it. This is a war that has imposed just a terrible cost on the public. There's clearly war weariness. The negotiations that are underway, I do think, show promise. They probably do reflect a genuine fatigue on the part of all sides. Now, having said that, the only reason for the ambivalency is not that I wouldn't like to see this end, not that I wouldn't like to see this actually produce something. I just wonder how much the Taliban has actually changed. And I worry about the emergence of genuine women's rights in Afghanistan coming out of what can only be described as a kind of medieval darkness that the Taliban represented when it controlled Afghanistan. What worries me is the fact that the very same time that supposedly you had really a pretty remarkable exchange of views between those representing the Afghan government and society and those representing the Taliban in Doha. Really it seemed to be almost a cathartic kind of exchange of views. And yet the same time, you had attacks that killed kids in a school. When both sides actually issued a statement where they explicitly said we have to stop this attack on women and children, and yet this took place at the same time. So the one question I have is do the people who are in these talks, do they either truly represent the Taliban? Or can they control the Taliban? And even though there's all sorts of promises about how women's rights will be respected, I just wonder what will happen. And I worry that, while the US should withdraw, I just wonder whether the Taliban isn't ultimately just biding their time. And it reminds me a little bit of the Vietnamese in terms of their view of negotiations with the United States in the 1970s.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Exactly what Bob Gates told Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation about a month ago.\u00a0 Okay Dennis, the Israeli-Palestinian issue. I can think of no one who has devoted more of his or her professional career to the issue, and no one who knows more about it than you do. So I'm looking forward to what you have to say about this. Perhaps the place to start is with a question that I get asked by many people, including across the country when I travel. Does the peace process still matter, you know? How important is it to Israel's future? How important is it as a source of radicalization for extremism? How important is it to stability in the Middle East? How do you answer that question?\tDENNIS ROSS:Yeah. Look, there's no doubt that for years and years and years, the issue of Arab-Israeli, Israeli-Palestinian peace was seen as the core issue in the region. There was always a presumption that solve this problem and basically you solve the source of instability in the region. That was never true. Going back, I mean, my professor at UCLA was Malcolm Kerr. He wrote a book called The Arab Cold War in the mid 1960s. And it was all about how there was a competition among the Arabs to see who would dominate the region. And they used the Palestinian issue as the club to beat each other over the head with. It was always a kind of instrument, as opposed to something that was the core of all the problems. Decade after decade, we've seen wars in the region that were unrelated to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Now, does that mean it doesn't matter? No. It just means it was never the core problem of the region. There were all sorts of other reasons for conflict and instability. This was one among many. Now, would it be good to end it? Absolutely. Is it still an issue that somehow resonates an as issue of injustice? Absolutely. Do extremists try to exploit it? Yes, but it's clear it's not their main focus. The reason to resolve it is because (LAUGH) A, you know, it would be good to show that a conflict that is seen by everyone who's intractable can actually be resolved. Psychologically, that has an impact in the region and elsewhere. That's number one. Number two: The Palestinians deserve to have a state of their own. They have a national identity. It's never going to be satisfied without a state. The Israelis will find the character of Israel change if they can't, at a minimum, separate from the Palestinians. I can understand well, if you're an Israeli today and you look around the region, and next door in Syria 500,000 dead, the Iranians and Shia proxy militias--\tMICHAEL MORELL:All over the place.\tDENNIS ROSS:All over the place embedding themselves. And they're not there because they want to have a picnic with you. They're not trying to move in close to the Golan Heights because this is a way of singing kumbayah with you. They're there for a reason. And the reason is to somehow find ways to continue to attack you. There's 130,000 Hezbollah rockets in Lebanon. There are ISIS elements in the Sinai. You have Hamas in Gaza. Israel withdrew 100% from Gaza, walked out of the settlements, took the Israeli military forces out, did not impose a quarantine on Gaza after they withdrew. That didn't come until there was a coup by Hamas in Gaza 18 months later. Worried about what the future of the areas around you may be. And there's a sense that if you had a Palestinian state, it would end up being dominated by Hamas next year. So I understand most Israelis say, you know, \"Why should we take a risk right now?\" The issue, I think, for Israelis is not to lose the character of the state, not to have occupation also change who Israel is. The issue is to find a way to preserve the option of two states for later on. You can't produce it right now anyway, partly because Palestinians are divided. You have the Fatah and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. You have Hamas controlling Gaza. They can't come to agreement among themselves. So it's pretty hard for Israel to come to an agreement with Palestinians when there is no consensus or unity on the Palestinian side. In addition to that, if you look at the Palestinian Authority, it is characterized by deep corruption. 80% of the Palestinian public feels the Palestinian Authority is corrupt. Two thirds want Abu Mazen to resign. You have Palestinians positioning themselves for succession after Abu Mazen, Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority. Periods of succession are not a time when you see an impulse towards accommodation. You see a competition to see who can be more pure. So there isn't a two state outcome that can be negotiated any time soon. But from an Israeli standpoint, you can't lose the possibility of two states because you then have one state for two peoples. And that's not what the Zionist ethic was supposed to be. It was supposed to be about building a Jewish democratic state. So from an Israeli standpoint, preserving the option of separation is a key to preserving the option of two states later on.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Dennis, that's my view. I share that view. And I know many Israeli security officials that I've worked with over the years share that view. But is there a different view in Israel? Is there a view that's two states is actually the wrong answer?\tDENNIS ROSS:There is absolutely. They're not a majority. But because of the political system in Israel, where it's a coalition government, and where basically parties to the right of center probably represent, I would say, you know, maybe 52% or 53% of the Israeli public. And as we see frequently in places, we see you can have important minorities who may be critical to a coalition, and the coalition doesn't exist without them, who get disproportionate influence because of that. And within Israel, you have certainly within the right wing, there is a perception, and I would say among the settler community, that basically there is no such thing as a Palestinian state that won't end up being a mortal threat to Israel. Whatever you say about it, there's no insurance. There's no guarantees for it. Sooner or later, you'll end up with a kind of Hamas dominated state. That state will never accept Israel. And it will continue to try to carry out attacks against it. You're putting Israel in a position where it will be mortally threatened if it withdraws from the West Bank. And so look, it's not a point of view that can be dismissed. There is an irony that the vast majority of those who have served in the IDF, in the senior officer corps, those who served in Mossad, those who served in Shin Bet, uniformly they believe it's in Israel's interest to have a two state outcome, even if it can't be achieved any time soon. In fact, you have one group called Commanders for Peace and Security, 200 ex-senior officers who basically say, \"Let's separate.\" They're not saying we can produce a Palestinian state any time soon. But well, they're saying, \"For the sake of our future, for the sake of our security, we need to find a way to separate.\" So yes, there is a constituency that believes that it is against a two-state outcome because they believe it'll always be a threat to Israel. But it is interesting that the vast majorities that have made their careers providing for and committing to ensuring Israeli security don't believe that is an outcome.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Dennis, I wanna get to the Trump administration's approach. And I also think that history's important. So before we get to where we are today, I'd love to get your sense of how we got here. And obviously we could start at many different (LAUGH) points in history. But maybe the place to starts is the negotiations as the end of the Clinton administration. What happened? And then what happened during the Bush administration and the Obama administration? And what did President Trump find when he came to office?\tDENNIS ROSS:So it's a lot to cover. But I'll do it. I'll try to telegraph it. At the end of the Clinton administration, we were arguably the closest we have ever been to producing a peace agreement. Probably the biggest turning point was not getting the agreement with Syria when we were extremely close. You know, often times I've said that this is a conflict where the parties have never been in sync. When one side's been prepared to move, the other has not been. The only time ever that the Syrians were actually prepared to do a deal, there was a very short window: December 1999, January of 2000. And at that point, Ehud Barak wasn't prepared to move as quickly as Assad. We went to Shepherdstown. The Syrians actually moved on every issue. Barak felt, I think, for some understandable reasons, that he had to show it was not easy because the Golan Heights is a strategic plateau. And Colin Powell once said if he were an Israeli, he wouldn't give it up. So it wasn't a simple thing to give up. And it couldn't look like it was easy to give it up. The problem was that the only reason Assad was doing it was because he knew he was dying. And he wanted this issue to be taken care of for his son. When he became convinced after Shepherdstown, when there were criticisms of his foreign minister for being prepared to concede to the Israelis when the Israelis weren't responding, he understood that this was coming from security elements and that would threaten his son. So he didn't do the deal. Why do I raise this? Had that deal been done, then it would have put the Palestinians in a position, would have put Arafat in a position, where Israel had peace with Egypt, Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. It would have put the Palestinians in a position where it would have been very difficult for them not to make an agreement, particularly because we had a commitment from the Saudis, if the peace deal was done with the Syrians, they would establish formal diplomatic relations with Israel. So we have a situation where we don't succeed with the Syrians. Israel withdraws from southern Lebanon unilaterally. Hezbollah claims that they drove the Israelis out through resistance, violent resistance. You can get the Israelis to withdraw. They produce everything and Arafat produces nothing. The worst meeting I ever had with Arafat was immediately after the Israeli withdrawal. It was May 22nd of the year 2000. Worst meeting I ever had with him was right after that. This is a guy who never swore. And he used four letter words for ten minutes and didn't repeat himself. He was so angry because he felt this made him look weak. I believe the second Intifada was born then. I believe he made a decision, \"Okay, what we're going to do is we're going to launch our own resistance against the Israelis. And it'll be violent. And this will force the Israelis to concede more to me. And then I'll look like I achieved the way Hezbollah did.\" He made a terrible miscalculation. We went to Camp David in July. This was about six weeks after this. He said no to everything. Barak was prepared to make very far reaching concessions. We made a proposal. He said no to everything. In the aftermath of that, we had negotiations that looked promising. And by the way, because of that, we were prepared. Again, I should say it looked promising. But it was with all the negotiators for Arafat. We never saw anything directly from Arafat. And I was seeing him. And I was always troubled by the fact that I didn't hear anything new or different from him. I did from his negotiators, which made me somewhat more hopeful. We had several different exchanges. And because of that, I was prepared to recommend to the president that we would present what would be a proposal that ended up looking a lot like the Clinton parameters which we presented in December, the end of September. Instead, the second Intifada broke out. And, you know, while it didn't produce bombings during the Clinton administration, it waits until the Bush administration. Nonetheless, it began a process of violence. And Barak said, \"I can't make concessions in the face of violence.\" In the end, we helped to establish a back channel, which greatly reduced the violence. And so by December, we were prepared to have the parties come here. And we presented the Clinton parameters. I still recall before presenting them, Bandar bin Sultan was the Saudi ambassador to the United States. And I sat with him. And I went through what we were likely going to present. And he said to me something that was quite prophetic. He said, \"If the Palestinians don't accept this, this won't be a mistake. It'll be a crime.\" And when you look at what's happened since, it's hard to conclude anything else. Interestingly enough, just one other little anecdote. I only discovered a little over a year ago, when I was having dinner with one of the former Palestinian negotiators, that with whole Palestinian delegation that was here when they got the Clinton parameters, and I went over them after the president presented them. I went over word for word to be sure they had it exactly. Every one of them agreed they should accept it. And they agreed that they should go in as a delegation to see Arafat and present it that way. One of the Palestinians who didn't come but got enough of a briefing of what was in it, who was back with Arafat, went in and said, \"They're going to come in. They've all betrayed you.\" And so when they walked in as a group, he said, \"You're all traitors.\" And so they ended up rejecting the Clinton parameters, believing somehow that they could hold out, that second Intifada would produce more. And in the end, we know it produced just the opposite. The Bush administration comes in. President Bush looks at what Clinton did. Bill Clinton was intimately involved in this. Threw--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Personally?\tDENNIS ROSS:Yes, threw himself into it, completely believed in it, in no small part because he a kind of obligation to the memory of Rabin. He had told Rabin in March of 1993--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Former Israeli prime minister?\tDENNIS ROSS:Right. You take--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Fascinating.\tDENNIS ROSS:--risks for peace. My job is to minimize those risks. And he's assassinated. So he felt an obligation, a burden. And so that's why he becomes deeply involved in this. Bush looks at it and says, \"Boy, I can't do what Clinton did, meaning I'm not going to involve myself that way. I'm never going to learn those issues the way he learned those issues. I'm not going to spend the time on it. And if he couldn't do that, given everything he did, then it just can't be done.\" And so basically for four years, really longer, until the seventh year of the Bush administration, they pretty much walked away. From time to time they would be involved. They never had an envoy. They never had anybody who played the role that I did. And Condi Rice, Secretary of State, begins to play that role in 2007. But up until that time, it's still largely hands off. And it was precisely because they walked away that you saw the Intifada get dramatically worse. I've often said a peace process may not always be measured by its success. Sometimes it should be measured by what it prevents. We had a second Intifada where over 4,000 Palestinians died, 1,000 Israelis died. The scars of that are still felt, because it killed the peace camp in Israel.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So then happens in the Obama administration?\tDENNIS ROSS:The Obama administration comes in. And the president feels, you know, all right the Bush administration neglected this for too long. And when they finally get involved in it, it's kind of too little too late. So we're going to be involved from day one. And he appoints George Mitchell on the second day of the administration as the envoy for this. But then a mistake is made from the very beginning of the administration. And that is a demand to the Israelis that they do a freeze on all settlement activity including natural growth. Now, the Palestinians took that demand and said, \"Okay, look. We can't accept anything less than that.\" Abu Mazen, later the US, the Obama administration, put him up a tree. How could he be softer on this issue than the administration was? Now, the administration will say, with some justification, it didn't say it was a condition for negotiation. But it felt it would affect the atmosphere. The problem with the decision was it allowed the Palestinians to say, \"We don't have to do a thing until you produce that.\" Put the Arabs in the same place. And it was a standard that couldn't be met, you know? As you'll recall, I was working for the first six months of the administration only on Iran. And after six months, I was asked to go to the White House by the president and do all Middle East issues including this one. I understood, and I told him this. The problem we have is it was right to impose a limitation on settlement activity. It was wrong to say no settlement building whatsoever including natural growth, because that's a standard nobody could meet. It also meant we were measured by it. And it gave the Palestinians and the Arabs an excuse to do nothing until we delivered. And we couldn't deliver that. Had we defined a limitation on settlement activities, we could have defined what success was. That was a huge problem which I felt we never overcame in the Obama administration. You'll recall we could never get back. We went until 2010. We had one month of direct negotiations. And that came at the end of ten months of an Israeli moratorium on new start. And when the Israelis didn't extend it, then Abu Mazen walked away from the negotiations. The truth is we never really overcame what was that standard. And basically, in the second term, John Kerry made an effort. I will say I was involved in a back channel. And the back channel actually was quite productive in the sense that we produced a paper which was a paper, largely, that John Kerry ends up using. But in the end, again, there's a failure. And the true reason for the failure is the gap between the parties psychologically and substantively grew. You know, I look at this today. During the worst of the Second Intifada, you still had contacts not limited to the security elements on both sides. Today, the only contact is between the security elements. And while that security coordination in critical, and it should be built on, there's no political dimension whatsoever. That's much worse than it used to be.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So the Trump administration's approach and where we're at today?\tDENNIS ROSS:Yeah, well, the Trump administration approach is the ultimate deal, the deal of the century. And it's based unfortunately, I think, on a false premise. That is that you can go ahead and you can solve everything right now. The psychological gaps are so great. The disbelief is so great. The political circumstances on each side don't lend themselves to making big decisions. And the problem is by focusing only on the top down, instead of bottom up, what you're basically producing is no prospect, no possibilities.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Do you have an understanding of what this big deal is that they want to put on the table?\tDENNIS ROSS:Well, I have a sense. To be fair, I don't know the details of it because they haven't shared the details with anybody, including by the way, none of the Arab leaders that they would like to sign onto it. And if you don't share it, you don't give them a chance to have any input. And if you, you know, I mean, I often say that when you spring diplomatic surprises, unless you're transforming the world, you drive everybody into their fetal positions. They go on the defensive. The essence of what I think they're trying to do is twofold. In principal, it's not wrong. You should have an economic underpinning for anything you do. But the economic underpinning can't be the sole approach. Palestinians are already highly suspicious this is an effort to buy them off from their national identity. And because the administration won't say a Palestinian state, they won't even create for them the sense of a political horizon that recognizes their political identity, which is a mistake. Look, statehood can take all sorts of different forms. You know, you wouldn't say that Germany isn't a state just because the US has bases in Germany. There can be different kinds of limitations on sovereignty that still doesn't take away from being a state. In any case, I think the essence of what they're trying to do is they've tried to adjust the Palestinian expectations downward. Again, not necessarily the wrong thing to do. But if you're going to do that, you also have to be giving something at the same time. And that's not what the approach has been. The approach has been to meet Israel's symbolic needs, which by the way can be okay. But you've got to meet some Palestinian symbolic needs. And you can't totally cut off all assistance to them at the same time. I mean, what we're seeing is the Trump administration approach to negotiations is always maximum pressure. The idea is maximum pressure will soften up the other side. And then they'll come to the table. We're still waiting to see an example that that works--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Of success, yes, yes.\tDENNIS ROSS:Now, in the Palestinian case, I think they would like to, in a sense, offer the Palestinians less than what we've seen in the past, less than the Clinton parameters, probably more than people think. I still think they're probably likely if they come with a plan. I'm not sure they will anymore, because at this point, they won't come until there is a new Israeli government. The Israeli elections won't be until September. My guess is it'll be November before you can actually see a government. Will they then still present the plan at that point in our election cycle? I'm not so sure, because they have said all along both sides, Israelis and Palestinians, will like some of the plan and dislike some of the plan. That means from their standpoint, some of their base here may not be happy if they think that they're asking the Israelis to take certain steps that will be difficult for them. So will they still present the plan? I don't know.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So Dennis, I guess the fundamental question then is how do we get to a point where we can make progress again? And I should mention here that you have a new book coming out on September third called Be Strong and of Good Courage that I think gets to the heart of what I just asked you.\tDENNIS ROSS:I think the key right now is we have to focus on separation between Israelis and Palestinians. The essence of separation means if Israelis and Palestinians are in a sense politically separated and geographically separated enough that this is sustainable, then you can have two states somewhere down the road. Two states, as I said earlier, is not achievable any time soon. But there is a danger that if Israel keeps building outside of the settlement blocks, and the concept of settlement blocks goes back to the spring of 2000 before we went to Camp David. It's something I helped to develop. The whole idea was, look, you have 80% of the Israeli settlers live on about 4% to 5% of the West Bank closest to the green line, the June 4, '67. So we came up with a concept. Let's thicken that area. Let's absorb the 80%. And then let's compensate the Palestinians with territory. So that uses swaps, our response to the settlement blocks. So if the Israelis build in settlement blocks, that doesn't compromise a two state outcome. If they build outside what would be the settlement blocks, it begins to make it impossible. We are at a state today where 105,000 Israelis live to the east of the security barrier. If that continues, you're going to hit a tipping point where you lose the ability to separate. So the key to the future is stop building outside the blocks. That allows you to preserve the separation option. Now, it's not enough. We need to have an approach where we change the atmosphere, where we begin to restore a sense of possibility. Both publics, Israelis and Palestinians alike today, have complete disbelief about whether any peace agreement, any two-state outcome, is possible. We have to reestablish a sense of possibility. I would like to see an American administration that would broker parallel steps by the two sides. On the Israeli side, they could stop building outside the blocks. And the reason they're doing it is to say we're preserving the option of two states. That would send a big message. On the Palestinian side, if they would acknowledge there is a historic Jewish connection to the land, that would have a huge psychological effect on the Israeli side. So we can come up with these kinds of parallel steps that each side would take. Neither side has to make a concession to the other, which neither is prone to do right now. In a sense, we would produce a kind of simultaneity. That would begin to show that something is possible. And it would begin to give both publics a reason to take a second look. With separation, that's what I think we should be doing.\tMICHAEL MORELL:It takes a big step by both sides, though, in a difficult political environment for both.\tDENNIS ROSS:It does. And that's why, in a sense, you need an administration that is sensitive to what are the political constraints on each side and how these steps-- I picked these two deliberately, because they're what would affect, psychologically, both publics. You know, but there are other things that certainly could be done. I mean, if the Israelis at the same time were to say not only will we not build outside the blocks, but we're saying the reason we won't do that is because we're also not going to apply Israeli sovereignty to the east of the barrier. So that would cement that idea that, okay, maybe we should rethink this. On the Palestinian side, they continue to pay the families of those who are in Israeli jails for carrying out acts of violence or terror against Israelis. That looks like pay for slay if they would move against that. And by the way, there's a simple thing for them to do. They have a social welfare ministry. And they provide payments to families that are in need. Provide an equal approach to all families. Right now, they give more money to the families of those who are in Israeli jails. And they give them priority. Just say, \"Okay, look, we're going to meet their needs. But we're not going to give them priority over everybody else who's in need.\"\tMICHAEL MORELL:And somehow we have to get away from the idea, right, that's become, I think, commonplace that anything that you give to the Palestinians somehow undermines Israeli security at the end of the day, when in fact you believe quite the opposite.\tDENNIS ROSS:Look, I'll tell you one example of this. The Palestinians have built a city in the West Bank called Rawabi. It's about ten minutes from Ramallah. It is a city that every Israeli should see. It's a city that is designed to build a genuine middle class among the Palestinians in the West Bank. I asked one of the developers of it, who's a guy in his mid 30s, I said, \"What are your hopes for this?\" And he said, \"I want to give Palestinians a reason to live to live, not live to die.\" Now, the Israelis have not done what they could have to make it easier to build that city. Here's a classic example of sometimes allowing investing in the Palestinians could be an investment in your own future.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Dennis, thanks for being with us.\tDENNIS ROSS:My pleasure. Thanks for having me. * * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

Read an except below, and watch Tony Dokoupil's interview with Godin on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" May 5! The Biggest Mistake They Made in School Just about everything you learned in school about life is wrong, but the wrongest thing might very well be this: Being well rounded is the secret to success.  When you came home from school with two As, a B+, and three Bs, you were doing just fine. Imagine the poor kid who had an A+ and four Cs. Boy, was he in trouble.  Fast-forward a few decades from those school days, and think about the decisions you make today \u2013 about which doctor to pick, which restaurant to visit, or which accountant to hire. How often do you look for someone who is actually quite good at the things you don't need her to do? How often do you hope that your accountant is a safe driver and a decent golfer?  In a free market, we reward the exceptional.  In school, we tell kids that once something gets too hard, move on and focus on the next thing. The low-hanging fruit is there to be taken; no sense wasting time climbing the tree.  From a test-taking book: \"Skim through the questions and answer the easiest ones first, skipping ones you don't know immediately.\" Bad advice. Superstars can't skip the ones they don't know. In fact, the people who are the best in the world specialize at getting really good at the questions they don't know. The people who skip the hard questions are in the majority, but they are not in demand.  Many organizations make sure they've dotted all their i's \u2013 they have customer service, a receptionist, a convenient location, a brochure, and on and on \u2013 and all of it is mediocre. More often than not, prospects choose someone else \u2013 their competition. Those competitors can't perform in some areas, but they're exceptional in the ones that matter.  The Magic of Thinking Quit  Twenty years ago, I read a book that changed my life. It was called The Magic of Thinking Big. I actually don't remember anything about the book at all. What I do remember is that in one quick moment, it changed the way I thought about success.  My hope is that the next page or two might do the same for you. I want to change the way you think about success (and quitting).  Most people will tell you that you need to persevere \u2013 to try harder, put in more hours, get more training, and work hard. \"Don't quit!\" they implore. But if all you need to do to succeed is not quit, then why do organizations less motivated than yours succeed? Why do individuals less talented than you win?  It involves understanding the architecture of quitting, and, believe it or not, it means quitting a lot more than you do now.  Strategic quitting is the secret of successful organizations. Reactive quitting and serial quitting are the bane of those that strive (and fail) to get what they want. And most people do just that. They quit when it's painful and stick when they can't be bothered to quit.  There are two curves that define almost any type of situation facing you as you try to accomplish something. (A couple of minor curves cover the rest.) Understanding the different types of situations that lead you to quit \u2013 or that should cause you to quit \u2013 is the first step toward getting what you want.  CURVE 1: THE DIP  Almost everything in life worth doing is controlled by the Dip.  It looks like this:  At the beginning, when you first start something, it's fun. You could be taking up golf or acupuncture or piloting a plane or doing chemistry \u2013 doesn't matter; it's interesting, and you get plenty of good feedback from the people around you.  Over the next few days and weeks, the rapid learning you experience keeps you going. Whatever your new thing is, it's easy to stay engaged in it.  And then the Dip happens.  The Dip is the long slog between starting and mastery. A long slog that's actually a shortcut, because it gets you where you want to go faster than any other path.  The Dip is the combination of bureaucracy and busywork you must deal with in order to get certified in scuba diving.  The Dip is the difference between the easy \"beginner\" technique and the more useful \"expert\" approach in skiing or fashion design.  The Dip is the long stretch between beginner's luck and real accomplishment.  The Dip is the set of artificial screens set up to keep people like you out.  If you took organic chemistry in college, you've experienced the Dip. Academia doesn't want too many unmotivated people to attempt medical school, so they set up a screen. Organic chemistry is the killer class, the screen that separates the doctors from the psychologists. If you can't handle organic chemistry, well, then, you can't go to med school.  At the beginning, when you announce that you're premed, you get all sorts of positive feedback and support. Your grandmother can't believe her good fortune! But soon, the incredible grind of organic chemistry kicks in, and you realize you're doomed.  At trade shows, you see dozens of companies trying to break into an industry. They've invested time and money to build a product, to create a marketing organization and rent booth space \u2013 all in an attempt to break into a lucrative market. A year later, most of them don't return. They're gone, unable to get through the Dip.  The same thing happens to people who dream of the untold riches and power that accrue to the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Private jets, fancy country clubs, unchecked decision-making power. Who wouldn't want to live like modern-day royalty? Of course, if you look at the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of a typical CEO, you'll see that he endured a twenty-five-year Dip before landing the job. For a quarter of a century, he needed to suck it up, keep his head down, and do what he was told. He needed to hit his numbers, work longer hours than everyone else, and kiss up to his boss of the moment. Day in and day out, year after year.  It's easy to be a CEO. What's hard is getting there. There's a huge Dip along the way. If it was easy, there'd be too many people vying for the job and the CEOs couldn't get paid as much, could they? Scarcity, as we've seen, is the secret to value. If there wasn't a Dip, there'd be no scarcity.  IMPORTANT NOTE: Successful people don't just ride out the Dip. They don't just buckle down and survive it. No, they lean into the Dip. They push harder, changing the rules as they go. Just because you know you're in the Dip doesn't mean you have to live happily with it. Dips don't last quite as long when you whittle at them.  CURVE 2: THE CUL-DE-SAC  The Cul-de-Sac (French for \"dead end\") is so simple it doesn't even need a chart. It's a situation where you work and you work and you work and nothing much changes. It doesn't get a lot better, it doesn't get a lot worse. It just is.  That's why they call those jobs dead-end jobs.  There's not a lot to say about the Cul-de-Sac except to realize that it exists and to embrace the fact that when you find one, you need to get off it, fast. That's because a dead end is keeping you from doing something else. The opportunity cost of investing your life in something that's not going to get better is just too high.  That's it. Two big curves (a bonus, the Cliff, follows). Stick with the Dips that are likely to pan out, and quit the Cul-de-Sacs to focus your resources. That's it.  CURVE 3: THE CLIFF (RARE BUT SCARY)  Cigarettes, it turns out, were redesigned by scientists to be particularly addictive. If you were going to draw a chart of the pleasure of smoking over time, it would look like this:  Except for that nasty drop-off at the end (otherwise known as emphysema), smoking is a marketer's dream come true. Because smoking is designed to be almost impossible to quit, the longer you do it, the better it feels to continue smoking. The pain of quitting just gets bigger and bigger over time. I call this curve a Cliff \u2013 it's a situation where you can't quit until you fall off, and the whole thing falls apart.  It's no wonder that people have trouble stopping. The thing is, a profession in selling isn't like smoking cigarettes. Neither is making it as a singer or building a long-term relationship with someone you care about. Most of the time, the other two curves are in force. The Dip and the Cul-de-Sac aren't linear. They don't spoon feed you with little bits of improvement every day. And they're just waiting to trip you up.  If It Is Worth Doing, There's Probably a Dip  Tennis has a Dip. The difference between a mediocre club player and a regional champion isn't inborn talent \u2013 it's the ability to push through the moments where it's just easier to quit. Politics has a Dip as well \u2013 it's way more fun to win an election than to lose one, and the entire process is built around many people starting while most people quit.  The Dip creates scarcity; scarcity creates value. The Cul-de-Sac and the Cliff Are the Curves That Lead to Failure  If you find yourself facing either of these two curves, you need to quit. Not soon, but right now. The biggest obstacle to success in life, as far as I can tell, is our inability to quit these curves soon enough.  It's easy to complain that the advice in this little book is brain-dead obvious. I mean, who doesn't already know that the secret to success is to be successful, that providing a great product or service is the right thing to do, and that you shouldn't quit in the face of adversity?  You don't. That's the bad news. The good news is that your boss and your competitors don't know either.  I mean, you know it, but my guess is that you're not doing anything about it. When it comes right down to it, right down to the hard decisions, are you quitting any project that isn't a Dip? Or is it just easier not to rock the boat, to hang in there, to avoid the short-term hassle of changing paths? What's the point of sticking it out if you're not going to get the benefits of being the best in the world? Are you overinvesting (really significantly overinvesting) time and money so that you have a much greater chance of dominating a market? And if you don't have enough time and money, do you have the guts to pick a different, smaller market to conquer?  Once you're doing those things, then you get it.  The Dip Is Where Success Happens  If you haven't already realized it, the Dip is the secret to your success. The people who set out to make it through the Dip \u2013 the people who invest the time and the energy and the effort to power through the Dip \u2013 those are the ones who become the best in the world. They are breaking the system because, instead of moving on to the next thing, instead of doing slightly above average and settling for what they've got, they embrace the challenge. For whatever reason, they refuse to abandon the quest and they push through the Dip all the way to the next level.  Snowboarding is a hip sport. It's fast, exciting, and reasonably priced; and it makes you look very cool. So why are there so few snowboarders? Because learning the basic skills constitutes a painful Dip. It takes a few days to get the hang of it, and, during those few days, you'll get pretty banged up. It's easier to quit than it is to keep going.  The brave thing to do is to tough it out and end up on the other side \u2013 getting all the benefits that come from scarcity. The mature thing is not even to bother starting to snowboard because you're probably not going to make it through the Dip. And the stupid thing to do is to start, give it your best shot, waste a lot of time and money, and quit right in the middle of the Dip.  A few people will choose to do the brave thing and end up the best in the world. Informed people will probably choose to do the mature thing and save their resources for a project they're truly passionate about. Both are fine choices. It's the last choice, the common choice, the choice to give it a shot and then quit that you must avoid if you want to succeed.

I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION. There is breaking news overnight as President Trump announces he has canceled plans for a secret Camp David retreat this weekend with the Taliban to finalize a peace deal in Afghanistan. The President's announcement by tweet said that his top-secret meeting had been immediately scrapped following the Taliban claiming credit for a bombing in Afghanistan that killed twelve people, including a U.S. serviceman. But there are questions this morning about why the talks fell apart and why the U.S. was embracing the Taliban in the first place. Late last night Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Dover, Delaware, to observe the return of Sergeant Elis Barreto Ortiz. Ortiz is the sixteenth U.S. serviceman killed in Afghanistan this year. Secretary Pompeo joins us today along with former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who led U.S. troops fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan after 9/11. We'll also hear from Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons. Plus, a brand new CBS News Battleground Tracker shows one candidate making important gains. We'll have the surprising results. And we'll have analysis on all the news. It's all ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Just days before the eighteenth anniversary of the attacks against America on 9/11, President Trump tweets out a bombshell. He invited Taliban leaders to Camp David this weekend for a summit with Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani. Then President Trump abruptly called off the diplomacy, just days after U.S. officials had said a peace agreement was imminent. Negotiations had been ongoing for nearly a year between the U.S. and the Taliban to get that insurgent group to join the government of Afghanistan and stop trying to overthrow it. That goal would allow for the U.S. to withdraw troops. A senior Afghan official confirmed to me this morning that President Ghani had been informed in advance that the Taliban had been invited to Camp David and that it was the U.S. that called off Ghani's visit. It was not a cancellation made in protest by Ghani. I'm told the reason for the U.S. calling it off goes deeper than Trump's tweet in which he claimed it was the Thursday bombing that caused him to call off the talks. The chain of events also suggests that is the case. Our Charlie D'Agata is in Kabul, Afghanistan, this morning with more. Charlie. CHARLIE D'AGATA (CBS News Foreign Correspondent/@charliecbs): Well, Margaret, moments ago we put the direct question to President Ghani's spokesman: Was President Ghani invited to Camp David? Three times we asked. Each time we were told no comment, which just underlines the sensitivities over that issue here. What I can tell you, is this is an impromptu press conference called in direct reaction to those tweets and developments overnight? Now, the other takeaway is when President Trump openly criticized the Taliban for intensifying violence, including that explosion here in Kabul that killed a U.S. soldier. Spokesman told us President Ghani was happy to hear that and that they're, quote, \"Finally on the same page.\" Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Charlie D'Agata in Kabul. We turn now to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mister Secretary, good morning. MIKE POMPEO (Secretary of State/@SecPompeo): Good morning. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. It's been an eventful twenty-four hours. Do you deny that there were other issues that played into the cancellation of these talks? MIKE POMPEO: Margaret, you have to go back to first principles and what we've been trying to do for, frankly, two and a half years of the Trump administration in Afghanistan. President Trump made clear we wanted to do everything we could to reduce risk to the United States, that we would not have terror strike the United States from Afghanistan as it did on 9/11 and we would never give up protecting the American people. But, at the same time, we want to make sure we've got the Force Posture right that, you know, the thirty-plus billion dollars a year that we're spending there is not a sustainable model. And he wanted to reduce that. So we entered negotiations with the Afghan government, we've worked closely with President Ghani over the past months. We've worked with other Afghan leaders. We've worked with the Taliban to try and get the Taliban to commit to reducing violence. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MIKE POMPEO: They had committed to doing so. To get them to agree to talk to their other taf-- Afghan brothers and sisters, something that multiple administrations have tried to do for, goodness, fifteen-plus years now. We had that and to get them to make a public commitment to break with al Qaeda something that as far back as the Bush administration Americans had been trying to get. We got that, too. And so-- MARGARET BRENNAN: They never agreed to a cease fire. The violence has been-- MIKE POMPEO: That-- so-- so-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --intensifying throughout. MIKE POMPEO: So back-- back to where we were. We were working to deliver that set of outcomes so that we could make good decisions about American treasure and risk. I was just a few hours ago out at Dover Air Force Base for the dignified transfer of the remains of Sergeant First Class Barretto. I was with his family, amazing patriots. I led the CIA where we had officers in harm's way taking real risk every night. President Trump is committed to reducing that risk so that there will be fewer fallen American soldiers--heroes. This is-- this is the mission set; we're trying to do that through peace and reconciliation negotiations. I-- I hope that we can get back to doing that. But it's going to take more than words as President Trump demonstrated. If-- if the Taliban can't live up to their commitments, if they're going to continue to do the things that they've been doing, and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MIKE POMPEO: --as we approached this decision point in the discussions with the Afghans they blow up and-- blow up Kabul and kill an American, President Trump will never do that. He-- he walked away in Hanoi from North Koreans when they wouldn't-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MIKE POMPEO: --do a deal that made sense for America. He will do that with the Iranians. When the Chinese moved away from the trade agreement that they had promised us they would make he broke up those conversations, too. I--I hope we can get to this place. It will be good for the Afghan people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MIKE POMPEO: And if we can get it right, it will be good for American national security as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Certainly. Sixteen Americans have been killed-- MIKE POMPEO: Yes, Ma'am. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in Afghanistan this year. The President said on August 29th, that he is taking U.S. troops down to eighty-six hundred. Is that still the plan? Is that happening? MIKE POMPEO: We're going to have to take a good look at that. We're going to always, as we-- every time we make decisions, and I've watched the President, this will be a-- the President, the Department of Defense's decision about what our force posture will ultimately be. We want to make-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So that order has not been given and he does not intend to do that yet? That's-- MIKE POMPEO: We-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --up for consideration? MIKE POMPEO: We want to make sure every place that there is the risk of terror to the United States--not just Afghanistan, in the Sahel, in the Philippines, we have terror risk all across the world. We want to make sure, always, that we have the right number of forces, the right composition of our forces. We've got great partners in Afghanistan with our NATO partners who are there fighting alongside of us, as well. President Trump will always make the decision about what the right level of American military activity is. And as I think he suggested-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So he is standing by that decision, though? SEC POMPEO: I-- I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I'm asking you to clarify. MIKE POMPEO: I think as you saw in his tweet last night, you know, we've killed over a thousand Taliban in just the last ten days. So it has not been the case that we've been negotiating with our hands tied behind our back. Unfortunately, applying military pressure to the Taliban is necessary to get the negotiated outcome that we're looking for and we're going to-- we're going to keep at that and we'll always protect America. MARGARET BRENNAN: So fourteen thousand is where it stays for the foreseeable future? MIKE POMPEO: I-- I can't answer that question. Ultimately, the President's decision-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Because it was in the deal that within a hundred and thirty-five days, it was going down to eighty-six hundred-- SEC POMPEO: We-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --and the President said that was happening. MIKE POMPEO: We-- we are-- we are absolutely intent upon ensuring that we roost-- that reduce the risk that weill have more folks coming back through Dover. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you went to that dignified transfer last night and that had to be incredibly moving moment. It is the fact that those deaths have continued, that the Taliban never agreed to a cease-fire, that it is the week of 9/11, that this was Camp David that has caused some concern even among Republican allies of the President. Congresswoman Liz Cheney out this morning saying that no member of the Taliban should ever go to Camp David. That was where U.S. leaders fled to as safe haven the night of 9/11. Who told the President that this was the appropriate place for the Taliban to visit? You, yourself, have called them terrorists. MIKE POMPEO: Yeah. Look, I-- I don't talk about internal negotiation or deliberations and who said what to whom and when. I've-- I've honored that for two and a half years now. But make no mistake, we were very thoughtful. We thought about this a long time. And, ultimately, the President made the decision that this was the right place. We-- we know the history of Camp David. That's where peace has been negotiated many, many times and, sadly, you often have to deal with some pretty bad characters to get peace. I-- I'd say to anybody who say you shouldn't negotiate with the Taliban, tell me how else they'd like us to talk to-- to try and get reconciliation, Afghanistan something like the Af-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I guess, as the President himself in Camp David-- MIKE POMPEO: --it's something that the Afghan people-- it's something that the Afghan people want-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MIKE POMPEO: --and something that would be a great thing for America's service members and for American national security. We're-- we-- we understand who the Taliban are. We're clear-eyed and I assure you that even today on the ground, General Miller has all the authority he needs to make sure he preserves and protects American fighting forces there and takes it to the bad guys. So, we're-- we're still at this hard. We'll still be at it hard. In the end, we hope that we can find a solution that reduces the level of violence and increases the probability that we won't have to have more American lives destroyed, more heroes-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Had the-- MIKE POMPEO: --returned. MARGARET BRENNAN: Had the Taliban ever accepted the invitation to come to camp-- Camp David? MIKE POMPEO: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because in a statement today to Tolo News they said that they were invited at the end of August, but that they postponed it until an agreement had-- MIKE POMPEO: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --been signed. MIKE POMPEO: Yeah. There-- there-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That agreement was not signed. MIKE POMPEO: There-- that-- that-- that's correct. There-- there's been some confusion. I-- I think there are other folks speaking. It's a-- a suffice it to say, we-- we were confident that we were going to be able to have these meetings, what would be this afternoon, at Camp David. MARGARET BRENNAN: And why was that meeting called off? MIKE POMPEO: Yeah, the President was very clear. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he said it was immediately called-- MIKE POMPEO: That they didn't deliver-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --off on Thursday-- MIKE POMPEO: --they-- they-- they didn't-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --after this killing. MIKE POMPEO: They-- they-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as I said, sixteen U.S. service people have been killed and throughout that U.S. negotiators have continued to come back to the negotiating table. MIKE POMPEO: Yes, Ma'am. We've given better than we've gotten I can assure you. And I want to assure the American people of that as well. It's not a war of attrition, that's not my point. My point is that we-- we didn't do what previous administrations have done when they entered into negotiations. They-- they were incapable of fighting and talking. We-- we did both. We continued to protect the United States of America during those tough negotiations. You know as for the timing, I'm not going to get into it because it's not appropriate. But know this: the President ultimately made the conclusion that the meetings today wouldn't deliver on the outcome that he's demanding we get for the American people and when he saw that-- when he saw that they couldn't deliver on the reduction in violence commitments that they had made-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MIKE POMPEO: --he said there's no sense in having this meeting. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Secretary, a lot on your plate, a lot to talk to you about. We have to leave it there for today. MIKE POMPEO: Thank you very much, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Secretary Pompeo's former colleague Secretary of Defense James Mattis. He is also a retired Marine Corps general and the author of Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead. Thank you for being here. Good morning to you. GENERAL JAMES MATTIS (U.S. Marine Corps Retired/Former Secretary of Defense/Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thousands of Americans have died at the hand-- hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan. They gave safe haven to Osama bin Laden to plan the 9/11 attacks. Did you ever think you'd see the day when the Taliban was invited to Camp David? GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Well, it was a surprise, Margaret, but I would say that all wars, eventually, come to an end and I salute efforts to try to end that war. No doubt. Secretary Pompeo, just before we are speaking here, he mentioned that we have to stay true to first principles. And I think that we are seeing what he said come true. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were involved from the very beginning of this war-- GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in the invasion in 2001. In your experience can the Taliban ever be trusted to make a clean break with terrorists and honor a diplomatic deal? GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Well, you're going to the heart of the issue right there: can they be trusted? You remember when we reduced nuclear weapons with Russia we talked about trust, but verify. In this case with this group, I think you want to verify then trust. We've asked them-- demanded that they break with al-Qaeda since the Bush administration, they've refused to do so. They murdered three thousand innocent people. Citizens of ninety-one countries on 9/11. We should never forget that, that the Taliban hid those people among them, refused to break with them, and have refused to this day to break. So I think Secretary Pompeo say-- saying go back to first principles is exactly the right thing to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: But every single Democrat running for President is promising to bring the troops home. President Trump campaigned on bringing the troops home. GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Mm-Hm. Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying just pulling out is the wrong decision. GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Margaret-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you remind people why there needs to be a continued presence there? GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Right. The-- the fact is we need to maintain an influence there until the government of Afghanistan and the people of Afghanistan are strong enough to deny Afghanistan as a safe haven. Now one-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The Taliban controls so much territory right now. GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Well, they do. And-- and wars go like that sometimes. But the point is that you may want a war over. You may even declare a war over, but the enemy gets a vote. A-- a fact brought home to me repeatedly over my forty years of service. MARGARET BRENNAN: If you had to fight this war again, and I know you don't get do overs-- GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --but would you have done something differently? GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Well, you can always look back and, hopefully, learn from what you did, learn from the lessons of the-- of the reality on the battlefield that sort of thing. But I think the fundamentals of forcing al-Qaeda and terrorist groups out of those safe havens, ensuring that the Taliban do not give them safe havens, those goals should be foremost and any other goals we then attach to those should be secondary. Don't let them distract you from that primary goal. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you think America got distracted? GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: I-- I believe we did whether it was the war in Iraq or we are back there and we're trying to do perhaps some people say too much in the country. You have to embrace the culture you're in. You don't surrender what we're about, but you cannot walk in and say you are going to turn another culture around in a matter of a couple of years from things that they've stood for over the generations. So, you just have to accept at times you have to have limited goals, but you should not have limited resources. You should put in whatever resources are necessary so when our diplomats negotiate-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: --they negotiate from a position of strength. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have made clear that you will not speak ill of President Trump. You will not speak about him. You say out of respect. In your book you do talk about policy disagreements with past Presidents-- GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that you served under, with Bush and with President Obama as well. With-- drawdown from Iraq--you wrote about Vice President Biden and you said you were telling him what you were seeing on the ground in Iraq and warning him of what a pullout would do. You wrote, \"He exuded the confidence of a man whose mind was made up, perhaps, even indifferent to considering the consequences were he judging the situation incorrectly.\" GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Yeah. Well, I was writing a history book at that point, Margaret, because I started writing this book in 2013. It was done pretty much by version five, by 2017. Had I known the former vice president was going to run for office, I assure you, I would not have probably been that-- that forthcoming. Why do I do that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What should people understand about what you meant there? Were you raising questions about his judgment? GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: I think the Obama administration-- President Obama's administration had made the decision to leave Iraq despite what the intelligence community was telling us would happen. They were very clear that an al-Qaeda-associated group would rise, that the Iraqi government, the Iraqi people, the Iraqi nation was in a post-combat, pre-reconciliation phase. We needed to keep our influence there a little longer and drawdown year by year. Not draw everyone out at one time. The intelligence community was very clear. They forecasted the rise of a group, you and I know it as ISIS, and we should have taken their advice on board. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that your resignation did help to stop the withdrawal from Syria because U.S. troops remain there now? GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Well, I'll-- I'll let the historians sort that out. I-- I don't know what all went into the decision to reverse that-- that call, to pull everyone out. But I-- I-- I just I-- I can't answer that. MARGARET BRENNAN: You write that Pakistan is the most dangerous country in the world, from your perspective. GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Mm-Hm. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is the biggest national security threat? GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: I think the biggest national security threat can be broken into two segments. One is external, and, clearly, those nations Russia and China that are trying to impose their authoritarian models and decisions over other countries whether it'd be in the South China Sea or in the Ukraine, in parts of Georgia that Russia has occupied. They've mucked around in our elections. So, externally, I would look at those two and that's why we rewrote the National Defense Strategy to acknowledge the reality of those nations. Not the nations we wanted to be dealing with, but Russia of Putin. The reality. The Russia, President Xi or excuse me-- the China President Xi. But, internally, my bigger concern is two-fold. It's-- it's our growing debt that we're going to transfer to the younger generation with seeming no fiscal discipline and more than that it's the-- it's the lack of friendliness. It's the increasing contempt I see between Americans who have different opinions. I mean we're going to have to sit down and remember if we want this country to survive we are going to have to work together. And-- and that-- there-- there's no way around that. That's the way a democracy is set up. So, I would-- I would break it into those two fundamental difference threats right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: On that note, we will leave it there. I think a lot of people would agree with you, like everyone to be a little bit friendlier these days. One other thing before you go though, I want to wish you a happy birthday. GENERAL JAMES MATTIS: Oh, thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be back in a minute with Democratic Senator Chris Coons. He's standing by live. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Democrat Chris Coons who's on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He's usually in Delaware when we talk to him. So we're glad to have you here face to face. Good morning. SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-Delaware/@ChrisCoons): Thanks, Margaret. Great to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Obama administration tried to negotiate with the Taliban. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: They never got this far. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you have a problem with the Trump administration doing it? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I don't have a problem with the Trump administration trying to resolve our very long conflict in Afghanistan through direct negotiations with the Taliban. And I agree that we should not fully withdraw from Afghanistan until we've got conditions on the ground that will prevent it from becoming once again a haven for terrorists who might attack us, as happened on 9/11. But I disagree with how our President goes about his negotiations around the world. He seems to think that he and he alone individually can negotiate with Kim Jong-un in North Korea, with Xi Jinping in China, or in this case with the Taliban. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: We don't even have an ambassador in Pakistan or in Jordan. I am concerned that our President isn't listening to his generals, to his diplomats, to the intelligence community. Frankly, that's largely why General Mattis, for whom I have huge respect, resigned in protest-- was our President's tendency to make abrupt decisions without knowing the context or the region, and without relying on the advice of the skilled diplomats and generals we have. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Lindsey Graham was on this program recently raised a concern that the President wasn't listening to his national security advisers in Afghanistan. Do you think Congress needs to put some kind of backstop in place to keep the troop number at a certain level like he's trying to do? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I do think that we need to be engaged in a bipartisan way in making it clear why we value sustained engagement in the world to prevent terrorism from coming to our shores again. This, frankly, is also why I believe Joe Biden would be our best next President, is I think he has deep and wide experience in foreign policy and understands the values of our alliances. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're a Biden surrogate. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I am a Biden supporter. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what his plan is to draw down troops or to negotiate a end to the war? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I can't speak to the specifics of how he would, but I know that unlike our current president he would rely upon and listen to the advice of generals and diplomats. I also think that he's learned from his experience. He has spent decades in Foreign Service, as has General Mattis, as both a senator and a vice president. Look, history moves and if you don't learn from history you can't shape it. One of the things I most respect about General Mattis is how deeply read he is in history. One of my concerns about our current President is-- is his shallow understanding of recent history. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Tim Ryan, who's running against Joe Biden, raised questions this week publicly about whether Biden has the energy and suggested he's declining in clarity. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you respond to that? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I disagree with the congressman. I've known Joe for decades. The reason that I think Joe Biden is consistently top in the polls over and over is because the American people know his heart as I do. They know that he would lead a real change in our place in the world and strengthen our security and prosperity by reembracing our allies. And that, frankly, in the United States he was called middle-class Joe for decades in the Senate because he's never forgotten where he's from-- from Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware. He is the person who I think can actually deliver the change that our middle class is looking for. That's what Donald Trump ran on, but it's not what he's delivered. I do think a Biden administration would make the changes that would strengthen our middle class. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress is coming back to work sometime soon. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Some would say tomorrow. MARGARET BRENNAN: There you go. But the question is whether they're actually getting to work on anything related to gun legislation. We haven't heard any specifics from the Republican leadership. What are you trying to get done? SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, Senator Pat Toomey and I--Pat's a Republican Senator from Pennsylvania. We've been working hard on our bipartisan bill the NICS Denial Notification Act. Tragically, in August, we lost fifty more Americans in mass shooting incidents in Dayton and El Paso, in Odessa. The Odessa shooter failed a background check. Our bill would make sure that state law enforcement is promptly notified when someone fails a background check. I have been talking with Republicans, with Democrats, with the White House over the August recess. I am hopeful President Trump will-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: --actually lead on this issue next week. Take a position. Stick with it. The American people deserve no less. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be tracking that. Thank you very much-- SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: --Senator Coons and a very early happy birthday to you. SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks for joining us. And we'll be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up next Sunday on FACE THE NATION, we'll have a diplomatic duo. We'll talk to both former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more FACE THE NATION in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. There is big news in our CBS News Battleground Tracker. That's our survey of the Democratic candidates and how they are doing in the early contests. There are eighteen states in our aggregate, starting with the Iowa caucus up through Super Tuesday. And there is a big reshuffling in the top tier. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is now at twenty-six percent support, just ahead of former Vice President Joe Biden at twenty-five percent. The third candidate in our top tier is Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. He has nineteen percent support. In the second tier, those are the candidates with higher single digits. California's Senator Kamala Harris now has eight percent support. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg has six percent. Former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke has four percent, and former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker are at two percent. The rest of the field comes in with one percent of the vote or less. Joining us now is CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto. Anthony, always good to have you here. Tell me about this reshuffling. ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, this is the story of Elizabeth Warren rising, not necessarily Joe Biden falling. He is about where he has been. But her support and that boost she is getting is as a result of other candidates, now former supporters, moving to Elizabeth Warren. And we have seen this because in this survey, we have gone back and reinterviewed thousands of voters since the summer. And what we see is, in particular, from Kamala Harris, her supporters are now moving to Elizabeth Warren, and at twice the rate that they've moved to Joe Biden and to other candidates. So, she's clearly picking up some of them. She's consolidating a little bit of the liberal side of the Democratic Party, and also her electability ratings are on the rise. She's sixteen points higher in being perceived by Democrats as being electable, as being able to beat President Trump, and that's always been a key criteria. And, lastly, you know, Margaret, I want to emphasize, this is in those early eighteen states that you mentioned, where the campaigns are really focusing. They are first ones to hold contests, and so that movement really reflects I think where the campaigns are putting their energy. MARGARET BRENNAN: So Warren's gain is Harris' loss, but what does this mean for Joe Biden? ANTHONY SALVANTO: There's still some good news here. He's still up in our delegate count. And here's what that means. I know it sounds like it's a far-off thing. There's the Democratic Convention next summer, but, ultimately, this campaign is a fight for delegates, and delegates are handed out to top finishers in all of these states. Really any candidate that gets above fifteen percent. Well, by the time you get through all of those states, Joe Biden is doing well enough. He's racking up a lot of delegates, a lot of votes in places like South Carolina, that he still has the overall delegate lead in that estimate when we take these vote preferences and we translate them into how the delegates would be awarded in the states. MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's important still to actually clinching the nomination? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. By the time you-- when you get to next summer and you're at the convention-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ANTHONY SALVANTO: --the balloons drop, that's how the delegates are actually awarded to candidates. MARGARET BRENNAN: So let's take a look at some of those key states. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we have them here. We'll bring them up on the screen, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, what are they telling you? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Iowa is tight. It's still with Biden ahead, just narrowly over Bernie Sanders. But then some news out of New Hampshire, where we know that war-- war-- Elizabeth Warren has been really ramping up, staffing up, campaigning a lot, she is now very narrowly ahead of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. That's effectively a three-way race there. South Carolina, I mentioned Joe Biden still has a substantial lead there. African-American support really critical. And then in Nevada, often overlooked-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTHONY SALVANTO: --but an important early primary, we've got Bernie Sanders narrowly up on Joe Biden. MARGARET BRENNAN: So with this information, what do people do with it? What do they predict going forward? ANTHONY SALVANTO: I think what you watch is who has room to move and room to grow, by which I mean, are candidates being considered by voters even if those voters are not making them their first choice yet? And what we see is that Elizabeth Warren does seem to have even more room to grow because she is being considered now by more than half of Democratic voters, even the ones who are not making her their first choice. Even when they describe the candidates-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTHONY SALVANTO: --not she is seen as electable or increasingly electable, but that's still Joe Biden's strong suit. He is still seen as the most. MARGARET BRENNAN: And electable means-- ANTHONY SALVANTO: Being able to beat President Trump in the minds of-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTHONY SALVANTO: --in the minds of Democrats. And that's really been the top criteria for them. They want somebody they think can go on next November 2020 and beat President Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks so much, Anthony Salvanto. And as always, all of the results are available on our website at facethenation.com. We'll be right back with our political panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: It's time now for our political panel. Jamal Simmons is a Democratic strategist and host on Hill TV, David Frum is a staff writer at The Atlantic, Michael Crowley is a White House correspondent covering foreign policy for The New York Times, and Laura Barron-Lopez is a national political reporter at Politico. Good to have you on FACE THE NATION. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ (Politico/@lbarronlopez): Thank you.0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We just revealed that Battleground Tracker that moves Eli-- Elizabeth Warren into the top spot. Is that also what you've been hearing out there on the campaign trail? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Yes. We've seen-- as I-- if-- as I have been on the campaign trail as a number of my colleagues have been, we've seen this slow and steady rise from Warren. She has very systematically put a lot of boots on the ground in places like Iowa and New Hampshire and Nevada. She has been very methodical about getting data on voters. And she has been trying to really utilize her niche, which is I have plans for almost everything. And she is really heavily leaned into that, and it appears to be working because she is slowly gaining on Biden. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it also suggests, according to our polling, that there is more attraction to this idea of the progressive wing of the party. Jamal. JAMAL SIMMONS (Hill.TV/@JamalSimmons): Yeah. I think my-- my math for this election has been pretty consistent. With-- the Democrats need a progressive that they can sell to the center, not a centrist that they have to sell this to the progressive-- to the progressive wing. I mean that's sort of what the John Kerry election was in 2004. That's sort of what the Hillary Clinton election was in 2015. It doesn't work out very well. I want to say this: if you look at the history of the New Hampshire primary, been five times a Massachusetts official has run in the New Hampshire primary. Democrat and Republicans since 1988. Each one of those people either won the Massachusetts-- the New Hampshire primary or they came in second like Romney, but all of them got over thirty percent. Mitt Romney got the lowest at about thirty-one, thirty-two percent when he ran in 2008. So the idea-- the probability is that Elizabeth Warren will win the New Hampshire primary. What does that do to Joe Biden whose entire election is predicated on-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JAMAL SIMMONS: --him being the winner when he may not be winning? MARGARET BRENNAN: David, you saw in just the past few hours another entrant into the Republican race. Mark Sanford, the former congressman from South Carolina, wants to challenge President Trump. Trump campaign says, eh, it's irrelevant. Is it? DAVID FRUM (The Atlantic/@davidfrum): Well, they have certainly made it so that Mark Sanford will not be able to vote for himself in his own state's primary because they have shut down the state primary. Donald Trump is so popular in the Republican Party that he does not want Republicans to vote on his re-nomination, that's how popular he is. There-- the-- the story of the Republican Party-- MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not unprecedented that the caucus has been canceled in some of his states. DAVID FRUM: It is-- it is not unprecedented, but it is something where-- when a President wants to demonstrate the-- the strength of his support in the party that these kinds of acclimations can-- can be useful. The key to Donald Trump's position in the Republican Party is a problem of fractions, which is that he is getting a bigger and bigger share of a smaller and smaller party. MARGARET BRENNAN: Bigger and big-- bigger share of a smaller-- JAMAL SIMMONS: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and smaller party, but, yet, not willing to count him out. DAVID FRUM: Well, that he is going to be the nominee, I think, that we count him in. MARGARET BRENNAN: No. But potential reelection? DAVID FRUM: His-- his potential reelection, I think, suddenly looks worse this fall than it did this summer. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DAVID FRUM: The-- the story that things are beginning to go wrong. The price of his policies is arriving. The bread-and-butter issues, you can just see everywhere around us, the signs not of economic trouble actually but of economic warning. And we're seeing consumer confidence leaking. We are seeing some financial markets reacting badly, and we're seeing that the things the President might try to do to save the economy are temperamentally unavailable to him. That he-- to find some way of reaching some kind of agreement with the Chinese on taking off the table the stupid things that we're arguing about like washing machines and focusing on the important things, intellectual property and the security-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DAVID FRUM: --of the 5G-- 5G network. He can't do that. And the consequences of his inability are affecting real people's wages-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DAVID FRUM: --which are now flat, and soon will be affecting real people's jobs. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Michael Crowley, President Trump has sold himself as a dealmaker. We just saw another potential deal literally fall apart in the last-- MICHAEL CROWLEY (New York Times/@michaelcrowley): Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --twenty-four hours with Afghanistan. MICHAEL CROWLEY: Yeah. Yeah. Well, first of all, what an amazing turn of events. I think that much of Washington was prepared for a big announcement that they had reached a conclusion. Now everything is kind of in pieces on the floor, and it's an example I think of how, you know, the President practices this kind of wild, seat-of-the-pants diplomacy reminds me a lot in broad strokes of his approach to North Korea, the North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-un. You know, I'm going to go meet with this guy who's had basically never been with-- met another foreign leader before. Everyone was astonished, you can't do that. Yes, I can. This Camp David thing would have been the same thing. You know, this is-- this is crazy. What are you talking about? The Taliban is going to come to America? They are going to come to Camp David a few days before 9/11? And this is how the President operates. And I think he loves to, kind of, gob-smack us and also thinks that by, kind of, breaking through these walls things become possible. But, Margaret, we're not seeing the results. I mean his diplomacy with North Korea has, essentially, gone nowhere. Kim Jong-un is still producing nuclear material at a pretty steady pace, launching short-range missiles. Yes, he has stopped some tests. And Afghanistan now, you know, this peace process is in tatters and who knows what happens next. So this President's improvisational, wild style, I think, you know, earlier in his administration, some people thought, wow, he might actually be able to get some things done that other Presidents couldn't with their conventional ways. I think there is a lot more skepticism about that right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, yet, this is a popular thing to run on for Democrats, the idea of ending the war, bringing the boys home is something every single candidate says they are going to do. Very few have actually detailed how they are going to do it. Does this force Democrats to answer those questions now? Or do we just move on to the next crisis? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: I-- I think a bit of both. I think you might see some Democrats trying to answer that, to strike another contrast with Trump. But, again, a lot of what's going on, on the-- during the prime-- in the primary race right now is very insulated. They aren't always reacting to Trump or what he is doing in the immediate sense. They are staying focused on the plans and the visions that they want to bring to the voters. DAVID FRUM: And this may be an opportunity for all normal politicians to reintroduce the American people the basic concepts of operationality. You know, there are reasons why these kinds of discussions are handled at the special envoy or assistant secretary level and not brought to Camp David until there is a success to announce, that you do not commit the President's time, and maybe Democratic candidates could begin. Because, like, one of the great thing-- challenges for the country in 2021, if there is a Democratic President, is all those progressive energy you describe. It's going to find itself running into a whole series of objective walls, a probable Republican majority in the Senate, terrible fiscal problems even if-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DAVID FRUM: --there isn't a recession, much worse fiscal problems if there is, the intractability of the health care problem. So, I-- one of the-- that the-- this moment which is not central to people's voting concerns is a good moment to say, these problems are hard. They are difficult. We are not making promises. We certainly are going to do our best. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DAVID FRUM: But we're going to do our best through channels and we're going to have a special envoy in Afghanistan, not the President doing seat-of-the-pants diplomacy, as Michael calls it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jamal, I want to ask you as well about, you know, pre-- gaffes, I guess, is the word-- JAMAL SIMMONS: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: --we can use on the campaign trail. Kamala Harris, who we showed in our poll, was losing some ground to the benefit of Elizabeth Warren had to apologize for something she said at a rally this week. Or-- let's listen to what she said. MAN: There needs to be accountability. SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS: Yes. MAN: I mean what are you going to do in the next one year-- SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS: Yeah. MAN: --to diminish the mentally retarded action of this guy? SENATOR KAMALA HARRIS: Well said. Well said. MARGARET BRENNAN: I played that so people could judge for themselves. What was she laughing at? JAMAL SIMMONS: You know, it was a bad moment. And I think her campaign would have come off better if she'd said after this when they asked her. You know what, I reacted poorly to that. I wish I hadn't, instead of saying she hadn't heard it. But that's what happens in campaigns. Campaigns have bad moments. Elizabeth Warren is still trying to get past the Pocahontas, and the DNA and all that other stuff. Campaigns have bad moments. The next question is: What are you offering the people, right? Donald Trump is going to say all the things that it is he's going to say about the Democratic nominee. The question is: What are you offering people that they want to be out there and be for and they're going to go and rally behind you because of that-- despite whatever mistakes it is that you've made. And I think people are still waiting to hear from Kamala Harris a concise message about what those things-- excuse me, about what those things are. MARGARET BRENNAN: Crowley, Sharpie-gate? MICHAEL CROWLEY: Thank you for asking. Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do we make of it? MICHAEL CROWLEY: Well, look, you know, we-- we-- we know the details by now. The President taking a Sharpie to his hurricane map and on some level it's a total theater of the absurd. On another, I think it's, you know, encapsulates American politics right now. You know, the President, essentially, tried to distort facts. He got the facts wrong, then tried to retroactively distort them. It looks like he enlisted government officials to back him up. Wouldn't back down, showed, number one, a complete obsession with media coverage, and, number two, an incredibly thin skin. But I think that, you know, there's forty, maybe forty and change percent of the country that thinks this was the media-- the White House's line. You know this is the media going after Trump relentlessly, making too much out of something that wasn't that big of a deal. And this is like this rinse, wash, and repeat cycle we have in the country where now about half the country thinks the President, basically, isn't playing with a full deck and some large number thinks that he can't get a fair shake. And it's going to come right down to November. And I think it'd be close calls to which one of these sides tilts higher. JAMAL SIMMONS: But isn't the National Weather Service event the bigger part of this story, the fact that the President said something that wasn't right, and the scientists and the government are being compelled to, one, not contradict the President, and then, two, put out a statement that seems to contradict other scientists and the government. DAVID FRUM: Well-- and also the President's own defense also raises an interesting point. The President's defense is I heard at one point that Alabama was at risk. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DAVID FRUM: By the time I made my statement, Alabama was no longer at risk, and I insisted it was. The question is, well, what were you doing in that interval? And the answer was, I was taking no briefings because I was golfing. And-- and I think that-- these-- these stories even the small ones, they reveal something about a unique process of government, in which the President does not take his responsibility seriously. It's not just a matter of lying, it's a matter of not doing the work, and that's what necessitates the lie. MARGARET BRENNAN: Laura, there were a number of stories regarding controversy surrounding Trump properties, from the vice president staying at one in Ireland, to what we are now looking at with an investigation in Congress, into properties in Scotland. Tell us what we need to know. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ: Right. So the House Judiciary and House Democrats as a whole are expanding their scope. And they want to define very clearly what their impeachment inquiry would look like. And so on top of potential obstruction of justice issues that came out from the Mueller report, they are adding to that by wanting to look into whether or not the President has violated the emoluments clause, whether or not he is profiting off of the presidency with stays like Pence's in Doonbeg, in Ireland, as well as the President's suggestion that the G7 stay in Doral-- at the Doral resort in Florida next year. And so Democrats want to add those to their impeachment inquiry. And we could see a vote as early as next week on-- on adding this extended scope. JAMAL SIMMONS: Are the Trump-- MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch for that this week. JAMAL SIMMONS: --are the Trump hotels a presidential tip jar. That's what we need to know. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll leave it there. Thank you. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with journalist Garrett Graff. He has a new book out called \"The Only Plane in the Sky.\" It's a detailed account of the morning of September 11, 2001, told by those who lived through it. Garrett, it's good to have you here you know, and reading this, it was very powerful. These are first-person accounts. It's an oral history. Why did you write it this way? It's not a narrative. It's an oral history. GARRETT GRAFF (The Only Plane in the Sky: An Oral History of 9/11/@vermontgmg): And the goal was very much to capture the way that Americans experience that day. You know, we're coming up now. This week will be the eighteenth anniversary of the attack, and we're watching this traumatic moment in American history slip from memory to history. And when we say \"never forget,\" I think we fail to remember just how traumatic, chaotic, and fearful that day actually really was to experience. So the goal was to tell the story, not the facts of the day, which we all know and remember, but the experience of the day, how Americans lived it, coast to coast, morning to night. MARGARET BRENNAN: And reliving it is painful for a lot of people. Why do you think it's important to go through that? GARRETT GRAFF: Well, I think you saw it actually even just this morning. We are still living with the consequences of that day. We are living, you know, still with the world that that day shaped. And it was shaped by the fear, the trauma, and the chaos that the policy-makers experienced that day and their decision and their dedication that that should never happen again. And, you know, we-- we now see American servicemen and women who were born after that attack deploying for the first time to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that that day spawned. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you talk not just to policy-makers, people in the room, you talk to everyday folks who-- who touched this in some way, including, and this-- it stopped me when I hit it, the airline attendant who checked in Mohamed Atta. Tell me about that. GARRETT GRAFF: Yeah. And-- and-- there are so many people that those attacks touched and-- and affected, including, you know, the-- the ticket attendants in Dulles and Newark and-- and Boston and in Portland who checked in the hijackers. And they have these distinct memories of interacting with the hijackers and actually even in Portland and Dulles helping get them on board because they were showing up late to their flights that morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Warning them, hurry up, you're going to miss the flight. GARRETT GRAFF: \"You're-- you're going to miss your plane, Mister Atta.\" I mean, just a chilling, chilling comment in retrospect. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a character in here whose story really stood out to you? GARRETT GRAFF: There are a lot of them, because of sort of just what a human experience that day really was. I mean, a day like 9/11 strips away so much of the posturing and the artifice, you know, from policy-makers, to first responders, to the ordinary office workers who showed up in New York or the Pentagon sort of expecting a normal Tuesday and found themselves amid that tragedy. MARGARET BRENNAN: You spoke for-- to a number of people, including someone who hadn't spoken at all previously to the press, Commander Anthony Barnes. Now he was the liaison between the Pentagon and Vice President Dick Cheney who was commanding things that day. What did you learn from him? GARRETT GRAFF: So Commander Barnes was sort of the director of the White House bunker on 9/11, you know, that bunker under the North Lawn that is operational twenty-four hours a day, has never been used before or since except for the morning of 9/11 when Vice President Cheney was hustled into that. Because, remember, they thought Flight 93 was coming to hit the White House or the Capitol. And so I talked to people and tell the stories in the book of the people who thought that they were going to die at the White House that morning. Commander Barnes was the Navy officer, who was the one who actually asked Vice President Cheney for the authority to shoot down the hijacked airliners. He's never spoken before, and I spoke to him, and he said that he asked the vice president three times, because he knew just how momentous that order actually was, and he wanted to make sure that there was no confusion, and he recalls sort of just how annoyed Vice President Cheney was by that third time, because Cheney had made the decision and knew that it was the right thing to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: A surreal order to be given. GARRETT GRAFF: A surreal day from start to finish. I mean, you know, we tell this very neat story about 9/11 now that we know the whole attack took place in a hundred and two minutes from the first crash to the collapse of the second tower. We didn't know that on 9/11. And that's one of the things that I really tried to capture in the book. It was well into the afternoon. We were still dealing with planes that we thought were hijacked, and we didn't know whether al Qaeda had a whole another wave of attacks planned for the next day or the next month. MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought it was interesting towards the end of the book where you talked to schoolchildren-- GARRETT GRAFF: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and how they remember it. It's just small children and their memories. It's a great read. Thank you for sharing it with us. GARRETT GRAFF: Thanks for having me today. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. And we honor those who died on 9/11 and after that protecting U.S. interests as well as all the families they left behind. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION. Tensions in the Middle East erupt as the U.S. accuses Iran of attacking two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman and firing a missile at a U.S. drone surveying the damage. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll get the latest from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton. President Trump says he'd be open to offers of assistance from foreign countries who say they have damaging information about his opponents. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: There's nothing wrong with listening. MARGARET BRENNAN: That made Republicans and White House advisors cringe and Democrats pounce. We sat down with South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg. He's one of twenty-four Democrats running for President. We'll also talk with the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Adam Schiff. Plus, as the 2020 candidates pick up the pace, offering more policies and more personal attacks-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Joe Biden is a dummy. JOE BIDEN: The President is, literally, an existential threat. MARGARET BRENNAN: --we'll kick off the 2020 CBS News Battleground Tracker with a look at where the field stands in the early primary and caucus states. And what matters most to Democrats when it comes to finding their nominee. Plus, we'll have analysis on all the political news of the week just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin today with the increasing tensions between the U.S. and Iran and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Good morning, Mister Secretary and happy Father's Day. MIKE POMPEO (Secretary of State/@SecPompeo): Thank you. Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: We've had a series of events in past days, the attacks on the tankers and these reports of a missile being fired at a U.S. drone. How is the U.S. going to respond? MIKE POMPEO: Margaret, I think you have to put it in the context of forty years of behavior inside the Islamic Republic of Iran. This is-- this is consistent with how they have behaved previously. They did it when they were in the JCPOA. They built their missile program. We relieved sanctions. They took American sailors hostage. This is a regime that has caused much trouble around the world. The last forty days we've seen a number of activities, not just these past two, but four other commercial ships which challenged the international norms of freedom of navigation. The United States is considering a full range of options. We have briefed the President a couple of times. We'll continue to keep him updated. We are confident that we can take a set of actions that can restore deterrence which is our mission set. MARGARET BRENNAN: You say a full range of options. Does that include a military response? MIKE POMPEO: Of course. Of course. The President will consider everything we need to do to make sure, right? But what's the President said? We don't want Iran to get a nuclear weapon. The previous administration put them on a pathway that virtually guaranteed that they could get there. So we withdrew from the ridiculous JCPOA and are moving ourselves towards a set of policies which will convince Iran to behave simply like a normal nation. And so you've seen them attacking international waterways trying to frankly drive up the price of crude oil around the world so that the world will cry, \"uncle\" and allow Iran to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would they do that if they're so cash-strapped and they need these customers? Why would they attack them? MIKE POMPEO: Because Iran can't sell its crude oil. We have stopped them from doing that. We have put sanctions in place that have taken them from roughly 2.7 ma-- barrels per day, million barrels per day with American sanctions. MARGARET BRENNAN: CENTCOM released this video of purporting to show an IRGC Revolutionary Guard patrol boat pulling up alongside these vessels and removing a mine from the hull of the ship. How certain are you that this is the IRGC and will you take that evidence and present it to our allies and the United Nations? MIKE POMPEO: Of course, we will. MARGARET BRENNAN: When? MIKE POMPEO: And-- and we don't just purport, that's what that video is. This was-- this was taken from an American camera. This is the stuff-- this is the real data. Yes, we've shared it with allies already. You've had the chance to see it. I made a bunch of phone calls yesterday. I'll make a whole bunch more calls today. The world needs to unite against this threat from Islamic Republic of Iran. Margaret-- Margaret-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And is the IRGC-- MIKE POMPEO: Yes, Margaret-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --definitely, the Revolutionary Guard Corps. MIKE POMPEO: It-- it-- it is. And-- and, Margaret, I'll remind you, too. China gets over eighty percent of its crude oil transiting through the Strait of Hormuz. South Korea, Japan, these nations are incredibly dependent on these resources. We're prepared to do our part. We always defend freedom of navigation. We are going to work to build out a set of countries that have deep vested interest in keeping that strait open to help us do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you talk about military response, you're talking about that keeping the waterways open? You are not at this point talking about a strike on Iran? MIKE POMPEO: Oh, goodness. President Trump has said very clearly, he doesn't want to go to war. At the same time, we've made very clear that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have the legal authorization for a strike on Iran? MIKE POMPEO: We-- we always have the au-- authorization to defend American interests. Remember, they now have attacked U.S. aircraft. They-- on June sixth there was a missile fired from Yemen with-- that we assessed had Iranian assistance that took down an MQ-9 aircraft. These are attacks on fundamental, international norms, and now on American interests, and we always have the right to defend our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: But I ask you because there are questions about whether the existing Authorization for Use of Military Force, the AUMF, would actually include a strike on Iran. MIKE POMPEO: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you confident that you could go, and not have to ask Congress for permission to take action? MIKE POMPEO: Margaret, I-- I don't want to get into hypotheticals. But the American people should be very confident. The actions that the United States takes under President Trump will always be lawful, always consistent with our Constitution, and we will always do the hard task it takes to protect American interests, wherever they are. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you need Congress's permission? MIKE POMPEO: To-- to do what, Margaret? I mean depend-- you-- I-- I don't know how to answer the question in the abstract. Permission-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you said a range of options are being looked at. MIKE POMPEO: Yes. Every-- every option we look at will be fully lawful. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you that because when you were trying to lay out this case, as you know, some allies have said that video released was not enough to convince them. With the exception of the U.K. and Saudi Arabia, some allies are saying we need to see more and hear more from the United States. President Trump, as you said, he campaigned against Middle East wars. But there is also this perception that the administration is spoiling for this fight. You were a vocal critic when you were in Congress-- MIKE POMPEO: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --of the nuclear deal you called the JCPOA earlier. The national security adviser right now is one of the architects of the 2003 war in Iraq. According to the latest Economist poll, fifty-one percent of Americans say the President is not honest versus thirty-three who say he is. If you've a credibility gap that is going to be hard for you to sell something to the American public, how do you resolve that? MIKE POMPEO: Margaret, we're not selling anything. These-- these are simple facts. I've had many conversations over the past, frankly, weeks talking about Iran's activity. No one doubts the dataset. I haven't-- I haven't heard a single person say they think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The German foreign minister said the video was not enough. MIKE POMPEO: The German foreign minister has seen a great deal more than just that video. He will continue to see more. I will concede there are countries that just wish this would go away and they want to act in a way that is counterfactual. No one disputes that this is the Islamic Republic of Iran taking these actions to deny this international right away-- waterway and the freedom of navigation that is a fundamental right of every country to travel through that. No-- I've seen no one deny it, and I'm confident that as we continue to develop the fact pattern, countries around the world will not only accept the basic facts, which I think are indisputable, but will come to understand that this is an important mission for the world. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things when you're at the podium at the State Department earlier this week you presented as a fact was an attack that was carried out in Kabul in May. MIKE POMPEO: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Taliban said they carried it out, but you blamed Iran for it. What evidence do you have that Iran was behind that attack? MIKE POMPEO: Margaret, in that same statement the Taliban said they killed ten people. I would suggest to you that the credibility of the Taliban is not something you ought to bring onto your show. We-- I-- I-- I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe Iran was behind it? MIKE POMPEO: I-- I-- we have confidence that Iran instigated this attack. I-- I can't share any more of the intelligence. But I wouldn't have said it if the intelligence community hadn't become convinced that this was the case. MARGARET BRENNAN: So there's more that you can't share with us to back that up? MIKE POMPEO: Yes-- yes, Ma'am. That's correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran state media says that they are going to start looking at ramping up their production of nuclear fuel. What does the U.S. do to stop this if you've already withdrawn from the nuclear accord? MIKE POMPEO: Think about that. Iran is now announcing that in a matter of days, they can begin to spin up their nuclear program. This tells you how flawed the deal was, right? It tells you that the deal had no capacity to actually stop them-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But what do you do now? Do you just keep putting more sanctions on? Desperation doesn't always lead to the best decision making. MIKE POMPEO: Our-- our intention is this. We-- we know that their nuclear program accelerates if they have more money and wealth. If they have more capacity, more resources, they have access to metals and to materials and to fissile material. If we relieve sanctions, their nuclear program presents an even greater risk to the United States. And so our mission has been very clear: deny them the wealth and resources and their capacity to build out a nuclear program, and be prepared to do all that it takes to prevent that from happening. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you quickly about Russia. The New York Times is reporting that the U.S. is escalating digital attacks, cyber attacks, inside of Russia to hit back an attempted interference in 2018. The President has called this report both false and treasonous which then suggests that there is some truth to it. So which is it? MIKE POMPEO: I never comment on intelligence matters. MARGARET BRENNAN: The President said it was-- MIKE POMPEO: I-- I never-- I never comment on intelligence matters. Having-- having come from being CIA director, I know how important it is. But you should know, and your viewers should know that the United States of America, under President Trump, has taken enormous effort to ensure that our elections are not interfered with, not from Russia, not from any other country in the world. It's a serious matter, it's one that this administration took seriously, at the direction of President Trump from the very beginning of his time in office, and we'll continue to do that. I only wish the previous administration had been so serious about preventing election interference. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's interesting that we are sharpening this point because it's the same week when we heard from the President, as you know, who told an interviewer on ABC earlier this week, that he would first listen to a foreign government if they tried to offer him dirt on an opponent and then make a decision as to whether or not to inform the FBI. As the former CIA director, someone who talks every day to foreign governments, what would you advise the President to do? MIKE POMPEO: President Trump clarified his remarks. I think it's pretty clear he'll do the right thing. I'm highly confident of that. I-- I don't have anything else to add. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is-- MIKE POMPEO: I-- I saw his remarks. He said-- he said, I think in both instances he said he'd-- he'd do both. He said he'd report this to the FBI. Look it-- it-- it-- it's you all present this as-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But, he presented-- no, he presented-- he used the word maybe-- MIKE POMPEO: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --and that it was-- he'd listened first-- MIKE POMPEO: I listen-- I listen to this very closely. The President made very clear he's going to do the right thing. I have enormous confidence in that I've watched him do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Call the FBI? MIKE POMPEO: I've watched him do the right thing every time we've had an important national security decision to be made. He's evaluated options and made very good choices about how to proceed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Secretary, thank you for time. MIKE POMPEO: Margaret, thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton. In addition to serving on the Intelligence and Armed Services committees, he has also written a new book called, Sacred Duty: A Soldier's Tour at Arlington National Cemetery. Good morning and happy Father's Day, Senator. SENATOR TOM COTTON (R-Arkansas/@sentomcotton): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me on. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have long been defined as a hawk on Iran. You see these recent attacks, these are commercial vessels not military installations. What kind of response is warranted? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, Iran for forty years has engaged in this kind of attacks going back to the 1980s. In fact, Ronald Reagan had to reflag a lot of vessels going through the Persian Gulf and, ultimately, take military action against Iran in 1988. These unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you-- you're comparing the tanker war in the eighties to now and saying that that's the kind of military response you want to see? SENATOR TOM COTTON: We can make a military wreck-- response in a time and in a manner of our choosing. But, yes, unprovoked attacks on commercial shipping warrant a retaliatory military strike against the Islamic Republic of Iran. MARGARET BRENNAN: A retaliatory strike? When we had Secretary Pompeo on just a few moments ago, he said the U.S. always has the authorization to defend American interests. As someone who sits in Congress, do you believe that he can act-- the administration can act without coming to Congress first? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes, Margaret, going back to President Washington and all the way down to President Trump, the fastest way to get the fire and fury of the U.S. military unleashed on you is to interfere with the freedom of navigation on the open seas and in the air. That's exactly what Iran is doing in one of the world's most important strategic chokepoints. The President has the authorization to act-- to defend American interests. Certainly, he-- it would be in keeping with what President Obama did unwisely in Libya in 2011 in launching a week's long campaign to overthrow the government there. What I'm talking about is not like what we've seen in Iraq for the last sixteen years or Afghanistan for the last eighteen years. But retaliatory military strikes against Iran that make it clear we will not tolerate any kind of attacks on commercial shipping on the open seas. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you believe that the existing authorization for military force is sufficient? You've also said, though, and as someone who's served in Iraq, you have an appreciation for the need to be careful in parsing intelligence and in first reports. How do you convince the American people that they need to stomach something, in terms of a potential strike, that you're describing as somewhat easy to carry out, when there were such vast underestimations of what U.S. force would bring about in Iraq and elsewhere in the past? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Margaret, those are two very different things. In 2002, our intelligence agencies, just like every Western intelligence agency, was trying to assess the state of a weapons of mass destruction program, one of the things that states worked the hardest to keep secret. There's really not much to assess right here. Everybody can see with their own two eyes, those Iranian sailors going up to a ship and taking a mine off of it. Iranian sailors, ultimately, boarded and height-- and took hostage the crew of one of those ships that they just released yesterday. They tried to shoot down one of our surveillance aircrafts over the Persian Gulf as we were simply trying to monitor what had happened there. As you heard Secretary Pompeo have said they've increased their support on attacks on American troops by supporting a Taliban attack in Afghanistan-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR TOM COTTON: --just like they killed five hundred Americans in the Iraq war. So there's no doubt here what Iran is up to. They are struggling under the sanctions that we have placed on them. The status quo for them is unacceptable. They're hoping that they can drive up the price of oil and, therefore, benefit from it, since their oil exports have declined so much. And also, get more pressure put on the United States to back off our campaign of maximum pressure. That's not going to happen. If anything, we need to increase that pressure and I think this unprovoked attack on commercial shipping warrants retaliatory military strikes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So that's a step farther than what the secretary said the President was currently willing to stomach. I want to ask you as well about what the President said this week. He said he would listen, as you heard in that ABC interview, to foreign countries who might have dirt on his opponents before deciding whether or not to report it to the FBI. Doesn't this underest-- undermine all of the efforts to make our elections secure when you have the President of the United States say something like that? SENATOR TOM COTTON: No-- no, Margaret, he said as well not just on ABC, but especially on Fox-- Fox and Friends later in the week that he would, in fact, report those kind of contacts to the FBI. That's a very different thing, too, than what happened in 2016-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but that's why it's relevant now and-- SENATOR TOM COTTON: So-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --what we're talking about now in terms of negative signals-- SENATOR TOM COTTON: --and the President-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --being sent. SENATOR TOM COTTON: The President said that he would report that to the FBI. And, remember, that's just simply receiving information in a hypothetical. What happened in 2016 is Hillary Clinton hired a foreign spy-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What if-- SENATOR TOM COTTON: --who then recruited--let me finish--who then recruited Russian spies to fabricate lies about her political opponents that was then used-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're okay with what the President said? SENATOR TOM COTTON: --that was then used to generate a law enforcement investigation into the administration's political opponents. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're okay with what the President said? SENATOR TOM COTTON: The President said that he would report those kind of contacts to the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: He said maybe. SENATOR TOM COTTON: --FBI. MARGARET BRENNAN: He said maybe. Which I'm asking you. I ask you the same question-- SENATOR TOM COTTON: The President said he would as-- as-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you say maybe as your answer? SENATOR TOM COTTON: --as anyone should. And what people should not do is what Hillary Clinton and the Democrats did which is hire a foreign spy to recruit Russian spies to fabricate lies about their political opponents. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Tom Cotton's answer to the question maybe when it comes to offering you and your campaign dirt? SENATOR TOM COTTON: I would report those kind of contacts to the FBI. MARGARET BRENNAN: No, maybe. Thank you very much, Senator. SENATOR TOM COTTON: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back in one minute with Congressman Adam Schiff. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We are back now with California Congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Happy Father's Day to you, too, Chairman. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D-California/@RepAdamSchiff/Intelligence Committee Chairman): Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. You heard Tom Cotton, the Senator, and before, that the secretary of state, lay out this case against Iran. You, because you're on the Intelligence Committee, have been tracking the intelligence as well. Is there any question in your mind that it is Iran and its Revolutionary Guard that is behind these attacks? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: There's no question that Iran is behind the attacks. I think the evidence is very strong and compelling. In-- in fact, I think this was a class A screw up by Iran to insert a mine on the ship. It didn't detonate. They had to go back and retrieve it. I can imagine there are some Iranian heads rolling for that botched operation. But, nonetheless, the problem is that we are struggling, even in the midst of this solid evidence, to persuade our allies to join us in any kind of a response and it shows just how isolated the United States has become. Our allies warned the United States, I think our intelligence agencies warned policymakers, that this kind of Iranian reaction was likely a result of a policy of withdrawing from the Iran nuclear agreement. And so what we see is a split of the U.S. from our allies and we see Russia and China coming together and having Iran's back. This is, I think, the worst of all situations and the maximalist pressure campaign has massively failed and only heightened the risk of conflict. For my colleague, Senator Cotton, to advocate that we attack Iran and provoke a war that there's no congressional authorization necessary, I think is exactly the wrong answer on-- on both levels. Congressional approval is necessary to initiate hostilities against Iran. We should be trying to corral a response, though, from the international community to protect shipping, to impose sanctions, but because we have so alienated ourselves from our allies that's not happening. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you see the risk of-- of this getting out of control and escalating further? I mean you hear very clearly from the secretary of state, the President is not seeking war. Senator Cotton is laying out a very different pathway. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I think that's true. Certainly, the President has said that he doesn't want war. But, nonetheless, his people, and I don't know if this is Pompeo or Bolton or both seem to be taking actions to undercut that ambitions to stay out of warfare at a time when the President sent a message, apparently, through the Japanese prime minister, of an interest in going back to the table to negotiate, Bolton was announcing new sanctions on Iran. Now is that an effort to scuttle the President's effort to initiate a dialogue? It certainly seemed to have that effect. But I think the-- the whole idea that somehow through this pressure campaign we were going to force Iran to capitulate and say, okay, we'll come back to the table, we'll give up everything was naive-- dangerously naive in the first place and this is what our allies are reacting to. This was eminently foreseeable. These attacks on shipping were eminently foreseeable, and the fact that our reneging on the deal hasn't made us safer is part of the proof. And I-- and I think for the secretary to tell you this morning that, see the flaws in the nuclear deal? Iran can go back to enriching now. We left the nuclear deal. How is that to make the case that the nuclear deal was flawed? We left the deal and now we're going to complain that Iran is leaving as well? MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to switch gears to talk a little bit about Russia. There was this New York Times report, that I'm sure you saw, that the U.S. is stepping up cyber, I guess, offensive actions to shut down, potentially, Russian infrastructure if needed. Part of it is retaliation for attempts to interfere in elections, including 2018, and now. Is the national security community responding in a stronger way to Russian interference than what we hear from President Trump, himself? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Certainly, I think the intelligence community is training its focus and resources on the Russian threat, even if the President isn't. I can't comment on whether the New York Times report is accurate or inaccurate. But, certainly, we-- we've had a heightened focus on Russian meddling in our elections. There have been persistent concerns about Russia and other nations preparing the battlefield in terms of our energy grid, and establishing a deterrent I think is very important. But that effort to establish a determined-- deterrent is dramatically undercut when the President a month ago told Putin over the phone that he still thinks the Russian interference in our election was a hoax. When the President says that he still is open to receiving foreign help and he may or may not call the FBI. What I found most disturbing about that New York Times story about whether we're preparing the battlefield, in terms of the electrical grid in Russia, was the fact that the security officials with the administration felt they couldn't tell this to the President because he might compromise that information in a conversation with the Russians, or he might countermand their orders, their military decisions because of the President's obsequious attitude towards Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Congress getting briefed on that? Is there enough congressional oversight of this kind of program? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: We are certainly. And-- and again I can't confirm whether the program that is described in The New York Times is either accurate or inaccurate, but we certainly press the intelligence community and our military to be briefed, kept currently informed and I think we are-- are being kept informed. But-- but it's a continual effort. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said recently that you may subpoena the FBI director, Chris Wray, to ask him questions about the original counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign as it relates to 2016. Why is that necessary? Are you still suggesting that the President may be a Russian asset? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: What I'm suggesting is that the counterintelligence investigation that began when the FBI had concerns that people around the President and ultimately the President might be acting as witting or unwitting agents of a foreign power. We have not been able to get a briefing on since the day James Comey was fired. Now we are still-- now we are just starting to get some information from the FBI. I think the threat to subpoena the director has had some impact but we still don't know just who did the FBI have concerns about-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --what findings did they make. The special counsel does refer in his report to FBI agents who were abetted and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: --sent some findings back to headquarters. We need to see those findings. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you very much. And we'll be back in just a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Next week, we will talk to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders out on the campaign trail in Columbia, South Carolina. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including an interview with South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is one of the twenty-four Democrats running for President. He's thirty-seven years old and if he wins he will be the youngest President ever. He would also be the first openly gay President. We caught up with him on the campaign trail in Virginia. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: MARGARET BRENNAN: You faulted Democrats, in a speech this week, for kind of not having much of a strategic foreign policy for the past few decades-- PETE BUTTIGIEG (Mayor of South Bend, Indiana/@PeteButtigieg/2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate): I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean by that? PETE BUTTIGIEG: I think that it's been difficult, even confusing, to figure out what our foreign policy is because Democrats became so absorbed in opposing whatever the Republicans were doing. Now often, rightly so. What the Republicans were doing was often terrible. But we got so sucked into that. For example, take the Iraq war, which I opposed as a student and continue to think was a terrible idea. We were so horrified by the way that democracy promotion was done at gunpoint then, that it very nearly made our party into isolationists when actually we've often been the ones who believed in more international engagement. And so-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would fault Joe Biden, who you'll be standing on the debate stage with for his vote. PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, I certainly think that vote was a mistake and-- and I have a different view on that-- that conflict. But it's more than any individual voter, any individual conflict. It's-- what worldview is going to anchor our approach? We're not going to be able to figure out who we are as Democrats by keying off the Republicans and just deciding when we're against it and when we're going to accommodate it. We have to have our own view, and I think our own view needs to be based on the idea that American interests, American values, and American relationships all need to fit together. And it's very clear that the U.S. is adrift. I would argue, under this administration, the U.S. does not have a foreign policy. Maybe an approach, but the approach is not pretty. It involves coddling dictators. It involves blaming fellow Americans for a lot of the problems we have around the world. And it's no substitute for a policy in which the U.S. is leading. We can either lead the rest of the world or we can resent the rest of the world. We can't do both. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump said if a foreign government offered him information on his opponent he'd listen. He said it's just like opposition research. What do you think of that answer? PETE BUTTIGIEG: We're talking about foreign interference in American politics. And by the way, this isn't hypothetical. This isn't theoretical. We were attacked by a hostile foreign power that decided that they could damage America, destabilize America, by intervening in the election to help him win. And they did and he did, and now America's destabilized. If you believe in putting this country first, how could you ever talk about allowing a foreign-- potentially hostile foreign power to interfere in the most sacred thing that we have in our civic tradition in America, which is our elections? MARGARET BRENNAN: He said he'd listen before he'd considered reporting it. PETE BUTTIGIEG: Just call-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a scenario in which that's acceptable? PETE BUTTIGIEG: No. Just call the FBI. It's not hard. It's not complicated. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you've been asked about the President and the Mueller report--you said that if you are elected, that you would consider pursuing obstruction of justice charges. PETE BUTTIGIEG: It's not up to the President to pursue charges. This is the thing-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But his Justice Department-- PETE BUTTIGIEG: --so I absolutely-- I absolutely believe that there are plenty of reasons to-- to think that there may have been illegal behavior and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. PETE BUTTIGIEG: --prosecutors should look at that and no one is above the law. Not a President, not a former President, no one. I also believe that the last place you look for guidance on how to conduct a prosecution is to the Oval Office. The less our law enforcement and prosecution has to do with politics the better. And I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So when some of your competitors say that there should be obstruction of justice charges pursued you're saying you're not endorsing that. PETE BUTTIGIEG: There should be a Department of Justice that can think for itself. There is tons of evidence that would point to an obstruction investigation. I'm just saying it shouldn't be ordered up by the President. MARGARET BRENNAN: You look at a Buttigieg Justice Department, potentially, prosecuting the President-- former President, would you ever consider a pardon? PETE BUTTIGIEG: I don't think that it's appropriate for pardon power to be used to cover for malfeasance or corruption in office. Right now-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Ford's pardoning of Nixon-- PETE BUTTIGIEG: You know, I don't know-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --inappropriate? PETE BUTTIGIEG: --what I would have done in the 70s and-- and-- and that historical counterfactual other than that I'm bothered by the possibility that public corruption went unpunished and the idea that that could happen in the future is equally problematic. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe the Trump administration when it says that those attacks on tankers that happened this week were conducted by Iran? PETE BUTTIGIEG: There is certainly a concern that this is consistent with a pattern of malignant behavior by Iran. What I'm also concerned about is that this appears to be part of an escalation where this administration might be leading us on a path to war that could get away from this White House very quickly. Look, it-- it is nothing new for Iran to be acting in destabilized-- destabilizing ways in their region. We see it quite a bit. The question is what are we going to do to make things more stable before the situation becomes uncontrollable? MARGARET BRENNAN: So what would you do? PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all, engage our allies. We are not alone. At least we shouldn't be acting alone. And if we want to see stability in the Middle East we should be engaging with our partners there as well as allies like our European partners who are such an important part of the Iran nuclear deal. And, by the way, another thing I would never have done-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. PETE BUTTIGIEG: --is to get us out of the nuclear deal setting off a chain reaction that has destabilized the regional security framework and the politics of that area, and making it that much harder for any moderates that-- that are still in the Iranian regime to get anywhere because they look foolish for having staked their careers on the idea that you could trust Americans. We need to have a completely different approach. And when the same people who led us to the war in Iraq, like the National Security Adviser John Bolton, are now, apparently, guiding our policy toward Iran in-- in the White House, it makes you wonder whether we can really take this President at face value when he says he doesn't want us to go to war. MARGARET BRENNAN: You also said you would rejoin that nuclear accord with Iran, but the U.N. watchdog, the IAEA, has already said that Iran is ramping up its production of nuclear fuel. There are bans on arms that are going to expire right on the precipice of the election and shortly after you'd be entering office. So is that really a viable alternative? PETE BUTTIGIEG: We're going to have to do something new. The point is that we never should have left it in the first place. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want new negotiations and a new deal with Iran? PETE BUTTIGIEG: Any negotiation is going to have to meet the needs and the realities of the moment. Unfortunately, the moment we're in is one where the United States' influence in this region has diminished because of the-- the way that we have withdrawn. So what we're going to have to do is re-engage with our partners, re-engage with anybody who has an interest in stability in the region and do whatever we can to once again meet the objective of stopping Iran from developing nuclear capabilities which is exactly what that deal was doing. Even this administration certified that that was the case. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Mayor, thank you for your time. PETE BUTTIGIEG: Good to be with you. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: The full interview is on our website at facethenation.com. We will be right back with a look at where the 2020 field of Democrats stand in the primary season. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Today, we are unveiling our CBS News 2020 Battleground Tracker which we launched in 2016 in partnership with YouGov. The first part of the 2020 Battleground Tracker will focus on the Democratic caucus and primary contest, up to and including Super Tuesday. We'll have polling specific to Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina along with aggregate polling from those states, plus, the other fifteen where contests will be held starting on February 3rd in Iowa through March the 3rd, which is Super Tuesday. In that aggregate of eighteen early contest states, former Vice President Joe Biden is leading the field of candidates with thirty-one percent of voters support. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are behind him with seventeen and sixteen percent respectively. Senator Kamala Harris rounds out our top tier at ten percent. Our next group has Mayor Pete Buttigieg polling at eight percent, former Congressman Beto O'Rourke at five and Senators Corey Booker and Amy Klobuchar polling at two percent. The rest of the field comes in with one percent of the vote or less. Joining us to tell us more about this first batch of polling as well as what we can look forward to this campaign season is CBS News Elections and Surveys Director Anthony Salvanto. Anthony, I know you live for this. Explain what's so different about the Battleground Tracker? ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, it promises to be a big election, so we've got to go big with the polling. And what that means is talking to more people than we ever have before, more than you will see in most other polls. It means being in the states that really matter, the districts even that are going to matter and award delegates. But, mostly, Margaret, it means putting this in terms that voters can relate to, understanding how they think about this race and getting beyond the horse race. So, for example, you mentioned as clear in all these early states Joe Biden is leading when we pollsters come along and ask who are you going to vote for in six months? But it's early so what are voters doing? They are considering some of these candidates when we ask them, which candidates might you choose? Then we see a much closer contest. We see Warren under consideration. Certainly, Sanders, Harris, and to a lesser extent Buttigieg. Those are the folks that really define that top tier and those are the folks that voters are starting to narrow their choices already in this big field. You also see differences in what voters want in a candidate in general. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. And that's what I want to ask you. What are voters looking for?  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a divide among Democrats? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. In fact, there is. We asked people, what should the parties' message be? Should it be that the party would, if they win, return things to the way they were before President Trump took office? Obviously, Democrats want to defeat President Trump. Or should the party press for a more progressive or liberal agenda that it's ever had before? And there's differences in vote choice based on how people divide on that. The folks who go with more of that return message are much more for Joe Biden but the folks who say they want a more progressive agenda, well, there you've got a mix--not just Biden but also Warren and Sanders, really, jockeying with him for the top spot. MARGARET BRENNAN: And what makes someone electable? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, that's the word that gets thrown around this town-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Electability, right. ANTHONY SALVANTO: --a lot, right? So what we did was we-- we turn people into political strategist a little bit and maybe they do a better job than a lot of the-- the folks in this town. We asked them, who do you think has the best chance to beat President Trump? And by and large they think that Joe Biden does have a very good chance. The other candidates when voters tried to game out those chances placed the more at maybe they can win than a definitely win. That's one of the big things that's propelling Joe Biden. But then we went a little further and we said, okay, Democrats, tell us what you think swing voters are going to want come that general election in 2020? MARGARET BRENNAN: In other words, not you, but what do you think others are looking for? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Exactly. So, as they game that out, Democrats say they think those swing voters are the ones they got to try to lure back to the party might more-- might be more inclined to want a moderate and even a white male for those swing voters they think would be concerned about race and gender even as the Democrats themselves, of course, have the most diverse primary field in history. MARGARET BRENNAN: Most diverse, also, most crowded that we have seen. And that's one of those questions we often ask when we are talking to candidates is is that hurting you that this field is so full, twenty-four candidates? So is it? I mean why are there so many? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, there are so many in part because I think the rules incentivize this, which is to say this year the Democrats have changed their rules so that party leaders and elected officials don't have as much say in the initial part of the contest as they used to. They got rid of what they called super-delegates. That-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Part of this is a response to 2016? ANTHONY SALVANTO: It's definitely a response to 2016 when a lot of Democrats felt that those party leaders may have had their fingers on the scale for-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTHONY SALVANTO: --Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders. So this year you've got much more power at least in that first run with voters and electing delegates to the convention. That's one reason. And the other is that with such a front-loaded schedule, a lot of big states are going to be holding their contests early-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTHONY SALVANTO: --not just the ones you mentioned, you know, California, Texas, et cetera, that brings a very diverse electorate into the mix. And so a lot of candidates feel like, well, they can pick up delegates in all of those different places, maybe why not take a shot? And that's one reason why you're going to see so many candidates on those stages come next week. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, I know we will be talking a lot to you in the coming months. Thank you. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thanks. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll have more results from our 2020 Battleground Tracker ahead. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: It's time now for some political analysis. Amy Walter is the national editor of the Cook Political Report. Antjuan Seawright is a Democratic strategist and contributor on our digital network, CBSN. And Leslie Sanchez is a CBS News political contributor and also a familiar face on CBSN. Good to have you all here. Amy, I want to start with you. You heard Anthony lay out the Battleground Tracker and some of the nuggets he picked up and it reminds me of the way you framed it, revolution versus restoration. AMY WALTER (Cook Political Report/@amyewalter/The Takeaway): Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: It seems among the Democrats the fight to be had is on the revolution part of the ticket. AMY WALTER: Right. And that's where the Warren and the-- the Sanders fight is right now. They're taking about a third of the-- of the vote. But we were talking right before the panel, the person then we-- we wonder then who will Biden ultimately have to fight with for that restoration? And that's-- we haven't seen that quite yet. Even Pete Buttigieg I think is on the sort of Warren and the Sanders part of that, again saying we need somebody different. We need a-- we need a new way of thinking about things. We don't need to go back to the old ways. He says that a lot, right? MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. AMY WALTER: Let's not go back to the 90s. We need to be looking to the future, not such veiled swipe at a candidate who was very active in the 90s. The person who really is I think a threat to then Joe Biden is somebody like Kamala Harris, where you see that, she doesn't pop up really very much in the polling, her numbers overall are pretty low, but when you ask people about their second choice, her name comes up very high in that list. I think she's at forty-five percent in your poll, which suggests that people don't necessarily are not thinking a whole lot about her. They don't know a whole lot about her quite, yet, but they have her in the back of the mind of sort of a, hmm, if not Joe Biden, maybe I'll take a look at her. MARGARET BRENNAN: Maybe we'll give her a shot. But she is someone that in that interview with Pete Buttigieg he did also take a little bit of a gentle swipe, Antjuan, we'll say in terms of trying to differentiate how he would respond to potentially prosecuting the existing President. Are we going to see these elbows get a little sharper next week on the debate stage or are we still going to have these just sort of veiled swipes? ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT (Democratic Strategist/@antjuansea): Well, politics is a contact sport, and so you just have to assume for people who want to separate themselves from their opponents they're going to do everything they can to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: They've been pretty gentle so far. ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: It's too early. We're not even in preseason yet. We're still in the training camp phase-- phase of this process. It's too early. Of course, they're going to be, it is going to be a strong attempt to define their opponents but also to swipe at the frontrunner, Joe Biden, we've seen some of that to this point, I think it actually backfired, I think it has made him stronger. But to Pete's point, he is trying to climb the ladder of getting to the space that you're talking about where he is well positioned to be an alternative to Joe Biden. But the candidate who has the ability to take a (INDISTINCT) and keep on ticking will ultimately be the one that I think will be able to take on Donald Trump, and to this point the polls indicate that person is Joe Biden. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. And so when we see that debate stage it's not going to be ganging up on Joe Biden. That's not going to be a successful strategy? ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: I think-- I-- I will not do-- I do not think it will be. I think that what the voters are hungry and thirsty for is what people are for, laying out your own policy agenda. We've heard that time and time again. And I think that if I was on that stage I would strictly talk about what I was for, but I would speak to quality of life issues, because I think that's where everyone is, everybody wants to feel secured, they want to feel like they their America is better than their parents' and grandparents' generation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Leslie, there was a lot of attention this week to internal polling-- LESLIE SANCHEZ (CBS News Political Contributor/@LeslieSanchez): Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --or other polling that might suggest President Trump is more vulnerable particularly in the Heartland than he would allow others to believe. LESLIE SANCHEZ: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: Where are these sort of soft spots for him? LESLIE SANCHEZ: Right. I think it's a really fair question when you're talking about incumbency but I also would like to look at the historical context, right? We know for the most part people prefer to give President two terms unless there's something wildly different about it, just, historically, you're going to do that. What's different about Trump is if we even compare, I would told my Democratic colleagues to Obama at his point in his administration, 2011, 2012. They are within three or four points of each other in terms of approval rating. He also had just-- had a big defeat in the midterms, you know, speaking of Obama and same kind of, you know, bruised egos in that sense, but by the time he got to election day there was a resounding defeat, and that's part of what Republicans are looking at, the President, his-- is mostly flat lined when it comes to approval rating but what I am not hearing talked about is style of leadership. That's what Republicans learned in the primary last go around. It was not an issue mano a mano on policy, it was this new approach, a new more centrist approach that wasn't particularly Republican it certainly wasn't conservative. But it was breaking the polarization-- it's-- it's a bold polarization but it was breaking traditional Washington and that's what's you're going to need in contrast to this President if any Democrat is going to get leeway. MARGARET BRENNAN: And is Biden the biggest threat still to him? I mean, that's certainly from our polling what people's impression is that he is the best shot. LESLIE SANCHEZ: I think for most part you could say that because he's going to appeal to a lot of that Rust Belt voter, the-- the-- the working laborer, a lot of areas that Trump did well in that other Republicans have not done particularly well in and not consistently. But, again, I'm going to go back to the economy, if you look at the economic numbers in those states--which is what we looked at in the midterms as well--if it's over fifty percent, then it's likely to swing toward Republicans, and that's what I'm going to be watching. MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: But-- but I think-- LESLIE SANCHEZ: But, plus. ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: But-- but it's been pretty obvious that health care is the number one issue of the day for Democrats and Republicans. And to your point, here's an interesting thing about Joe Biden. He is one of very few people running in our primary that could bring the many corners of our party together-- together and takeaway from the Trump voter who voted for him in '16 who voted for Barack Obama in 2008. And if health care is the number one issue of the day-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: --the Republicans have failed the American people as it relates to access and affordability. AMY WALTER: There is one really important thing, though, in that-- the pushback from the Trump campaign on the polling they said, well, in our own polling when we gave voters a choice, of a candidate who had these certain qualities, then the numbers got much tighter. This is called an informed ballot, basically, what they were saying is if you had a choice between Donald Trump and a socialist, who would you vote for, right? That there's a reason that the term socialist is coming up a lot, not just from the Trump campaign, but everywhere else-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You're teaming up perfectly here, Amy. AMY WALTER: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to play the sound bite here from Senator Bernie Sanders. BERNIE SANDERS (Wednesday): I do understand that I and other progressives will face massive attacks from those who attempt to use the word socialism as a slur. But I should also tell you that I have faced and overcome these attacks for decades and I am not the only one. AMY WALTER: Yeah. Well, what the poll showed is that that's not working really well right now. Because when you ask Democratic voters who they think is the most electable, who's the-- who's a candidate-- who's best able to beat Donald Trump, this is where Joe Biden wins, in part, because it's harder to attack him with those qualities. So it's pretty clear what the Trump campaign wants to do. Look, they're not going to win because Trump's numbers are going to increase. LESLIE SANCHEZ: No. AMY WALTER: Obama's numbers as he ran through 2012, his approval ratings went up, that's not what's going to happen here. His numbers are going to probably stay the same, Trump's are but he has to make whoever the Democrat is as unpopular as he is. And if you look, there's a new NBC-Wall Street Journal poll. The candidates who they said who are you the most uncomfortable with, Trump's number one at fifty-two percent, Sanders number two at forty-one percent. That's the danger. LESLIE SANCHEZ: Well, in the historical part you had more people-- Trump get more support in terms of the primaries than ever before, he also had more people voting against him in the primary-- AMY WALTER: That's right. LESLIE SANCHEZ: --than ever before. So it was the dichotomy of the two-- AMY WALTER: --Yeah. LESLIE SANCHEZ: --which again, goes to that point of what were they looking for with Trump if you look at the voters? AMY WALTER: That's right. LESLIE SANCHEZ: Authen-- Authenticity. They were tired of this polished-- as people in the business, you know, who do a lot of the messaging and preparing candidates, voters were tired-- AMY WALTER: Yep. LESLIE SANCHEZ: --of the veneer around politicians, they wanted somebody who was nontraditional in that sense who had conviction, whether you like it or not. And then-- and the funny part about-- about the President is he said, they said, oh, he'll be more presidential when he gets into the White House, you know, oh, yeah, when I get there I'm going to be more presidential and it's like wearing a pair of shoes that are too tight. You know, you may get down the hall but the second you can't, you're going to take him off and that's what he's done. And people have respected, they may not like his style but they respect what he's done and now he gets legitimate credit for a booming economy. That is a really difficult thing to move against as a candidate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we've got to-- we've got to leave it there, unfortunately. It's all the time we have. AMY WALTER: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But we have, what, more than five days to go. I'm sure we'll be bringing you back to talk more. ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So thanks to all of you on our panel. And we will see you Friday night when our digital network CBSN airs a special two-hour edition of red and blue, live from Columbia, South Carolina, where twenty-two pres-- Democratic presidential candidates will be appearing at one of the biggest events in the primary season, Congressman Jim Clyburn's Annual Fish Fry. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That is going to do it for us today. Thank you all for watching. And we want to wish all the fathers out there a very happy Father's Day, including my dad, my father-in-law and my husband, who has his very first Father's Day today. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. We'll see you next week.",

            "article_content": "On March 5, 2019, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell sat down for an interview with correspondent Scott Pelley in the Special Library at the Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington, D.C. Below is the transcript of that interview and of their conversation in the Fed's Board Room. Scott Pelley's interview with Mr. Powell aired Sunday, March 10, 2019. SCOTT PELLEY: Have you stopped raising rates? FED CHAIR JEROME POWELL: Well, that's a good question. We see the economy as in a good place. We think that the outlook is a favorable one. Inflation is muted and our policy rate we think is in an appropriate place. So what we've said is that we would be patient as we watch to see how global economic conditions evolve and how our own economy evolves. PELLEY: What does patient mean? POWELL: Patient means that we don't feel any hurry to change our interest rate policy. What's happened in the last 90 or so days is that we've seen increasing evidence of the global economy slowing down, although our own economy has continued to perform well. Growth abroad, if it slows, can be a headwind for us. In addition, there are things like Brexit and slowing in China and Europe that can be headwinds. So, what we've done is we've said that we're going to wait and see how those conditions evolve before we make any changes to our interest rate policy, and that means patient. PELLEY: What would it take to raise or lower interest rates? POWELL: We'll be looking at a range of data. For here domestically, we'll be looking at growth, we'll be looking at the state of the labor market, job creation, wages and that kind of thing. We'll also be looking at inflation, of course. And abroad, we'll be looking to see how foreign growth is evolving, particularly in China as I mentioned and in Europe. We'll also be watching events such as Brexit. And we'll be putting that all together and deciding when it will be appropriate to change our policy. For now though, we're to be patient and allow things to evolve. PELLEY: The Chinese growth rate has been dropping. The Chinese recently announced they were expecting about 6% growth. How big a problem is that for the United States? POWELL: Well, Chinese growth is important for world growth. It's important for European growth as well. There's a lot of trade between Europe and China and between the United States and China. So a healthy global economy can be a tailwind for the United States, as it was in 2017 and a little bit in 2018. If it slows down, the global economy, then we'll feel that as a headwind. So, we don't actually believe that very negative outcomes are the most likely outcomes there. The Chinese authorities have been deploying many measures to support growth in China. And we also think that Europe is more likely to have a positive growth rate this year. So overall, we think the U.S. outlook is a positive one. PELLEY: You think the European growth rate is going to be positive despite the fact that the British, in some form or fashion, are going to be leaving the European Union? POWELL: Yes. Growth in Europe has slowed substantially over the last year or so. And we're watching that very carefully. But we still think that it's likely that there'll be materially positive growth this year. But again, it's something we're watching carefully. And, of course, we're watching the Brexit situation quite carefully as well. PELLEY: We have seen big swings in the stock markets in the United States. And I wonder, do you think the markets today are overvalued? POWELL: We don't comment on the valuation of the stock market particularly. And we do though, we monitor financial conditions carefully. Our interest rate policy works through financial conditions. So we look at a very broad range of financial conditions. That includes interest rates, the level of the dollar, the availability of credit and also the stock market. So we look at a range of things. And I think we feel that conditions are generally healthy today. PELLEY: Generally healthy? One of your predecessors back in the '90s famously said that the market in those days was irrationally exuberant. You don't see that today? POWELL: We don't see much evidence of that today. There, as always, in our very highly developed and large capital markets, there are places you can point which are, let's say hotter than others. But, generally speaking, credit spreads, which is the compensation you get above risk-free rates for taking credit risk, are at relatively normal levels. By some measures the stock market valuation is closer to its sort of normal levels over long periods of time. There are pockets though. There are things, for example, the leverage lending corporates. We've seen high growth in leverage lending to non-financial corporates. And that's something we're watching carefully. PELLEY: Why so?  POWELL: So whenever there's a lot of borrowing, perhaps because of an excess of optimism, there's a risk that later on, borrowing will have been too optimistic or too excessive. And that goes for households. That goes for businesses. What we're seeing now is some companies borrowing fairly large amounts of debt. And the sense of it is that if there were a downturn, having highly leveraged companies would be an amplifier, could be an amplifier, to a downturn. I don't think it's the kind of thing that we saw in the financial crisis, where you had, you know, the subprime mortgage crisis. It doesn't seem to be like that, generally. But at the same time, it could be an amplifier to a downturn. PELLEY: And this is something that concerns you today? POWELL: It's something we've been actively monitoring for some time. And we'll continue to do so. PELLEY: Where do you see weakness in the U.S. economy? POWELL: Generally speaking, the U.S. economy is coming off a very strong year last year. We had growth just a touch higher than 3%. And that strength was pretty widespread. You know we have high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, wages are moving up. Consumer confidence is high, business confidence is high. We've seen a bit of a slowing, but still to healthy levels in the U.S. economy this year. So the U.S. economy does seem to be favorable. The outlook for the U.S. economy is favorable. I would say the principal risks to our economy now seem to be coming from slower growth in China and Europe and also risk events such as Brexit. PELLEY: A record seven million Americans have fallen behind on their car payments. Never happened before. What do you make of that? POWELL: Well, if you, so, take a step back and look at the broader consumer credit picture, which is generally a healthy one. Mortgage credit is in good shape. Default rates are low. And as I mentioned, wages have moved up significantly. So the consumer's in a pretty good place. What's happened with automobiles is that the car sales have been quite high for a number of years. So the whole body of outstanding auto loans is much larger than it was. Auto default rates have actually not moved up. They've actually been fairly stable. But the number of people who are experiencing, you know, auto defaults has gone up because the number of borrowers has gone up. I think it also though shows that not everyone is experiencing this widespread prosperity that we have. And that's something we pay attention to as well. PELLEY: Retail sales declined in December, the fastest pace since 2009. Are these things taken together suggesting that the system is blinking red? POWELL: Well, we look at a wide range of data. We never focus too much on one month's report, on one series. And I think generally, the outlook for the U.S. economy remains a favorable one. You point to the retail sales number. And it was surprisingly weak. And we're, of course, watching that. We'll be watching the next month retail sales. The reason it's a surprise is that we had lots of other reports of relatively healthy levels of spending over the holidays. And that comes from a number of different channels. And so we'll be looking to see, there's also evidence, by the way, that spending has popped back up in January. But that's a surprisingly weak reading. And we'll be watching the next month's reading shortly. PELLEY: But the overarching question is are we headed to a recession? POWELL: The outlook for our economy, in my view, is a favorable one. It's a positive one. I think growth this year will be slower than last year. Last year was the highest growth that we've experienced since the financial crisis, really in more than ten years. This year, I expect that growth will continue to be positive and continue to be at a healthy rate. PELLEY: You mentioned growth last year being slightly over 3%. That was with the tax cut and with unemployment in this country at a rate that we haven't seen in decades. Is that the best the economy can do now, 3%, slightly over? Are the days of 4% growth over? POWELL: So growth really amounts to, you can break it down into a couple of things. One is how fast is the labor force growing? And the other part is how fast is productivity growing? The labor force, back when we used to have 4% and 5% growth years, the labor force was growing quickly, 2.5%, 3% in some cases back in the '60s and '70s. We have an older population now. And our labor force is growing more slowly. It's growing less than 1% a year. So, it's not likely that we could sustain the kinds of growth rates that we had when population and the labor force was growing more quickly. Nonetheless, we can grow at a healthy rate. And last year was a good year. PELLEY: So 4% is something we shouldn't expect in the future? POWELL: There will be years of 4% growth. But it would be challenging to see sustained 4% growth, again, because of the slow growth of the workforce. Our workforce is growing at a trend rate of about 0.5% a year. To get to 4% headline growth, you would need 3.5% productivity growth. We don't have any modern experience of productivity, which is just the increase in output per hour worked, running at those kinds of levels for a long period. But, you know, who's to say what's possible with productivity?  PELLEY: Will you allow your inflation target to drift up above 2%? POWELL: We have a 2% inflation target. And we say that it's symmetric. And what we mean by symmetric is that if inflation is below target or above target, we look at it symmetrically in the sense that we'll always be trying to get back to 2%. But that we won't be trying to do that any differently if we're a couple of tenths above 2% or a couple tenths below 2%. PELLEY: So over time, you want to average 2%, but if the inflation rate goes above 2% that doesn't mean you're going to slam on the brakes? POWELL: We haven't actually said that we want to average 2% inflation. What we've said is something a little bit different, which is that we look at errors above and below 2% symmetrically. Honestly though, inflation has mostly been below 2%. We haven't had inflation above 2%. And so it has averaged less than 2%. And that's something that is worth thinking about because we want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2%. And we have to reach 2% sustainably and symmetrically we think for that to be the case in the long run. PELLEY: Want to make sure I understand. If the inflation rate rises something over 2% for a limited period of time, that doesn't mean the Fed's going to jump on the brakes? POWELL: I think we wouldn't overreact to inflation modestly above 2% any more than we overreacted to inflation modestly below 2%. I think we'll always be moving inflation back to 2% with our policy. But I think we do that in a symmetric way. PELLEY: Were the recent rate increases wrong? The president called the Fed \"crazy\" and out of \"control.\" POWELL: I feel, and our committee feels, that our interest rate policy is in a very good place right now. It's roughly neutral in a sense that our interest rate is in the range of estimates of a rate that is neither urging the economy to go faster, nor trying to slow it down. And we think that's an appropriate place for an economy that has the lowest unemployment in 50 years, that has inflation right about at our 2% objective, that has returned significantly to good health. PELLEY: Traditionally, presidents don't criticize the Fed. When you heard President Trump call the Fed \"crazy\" and \"out of control,\" what did you think? POWELL: I don't think it would be appropriate for me to comment on other elected officials or on the president. PELLEY: You have a rule about speaking about President Trump? POWELL: I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on the president. PELLEY: And therein lies the rule. You don't do it? POWELL: No, I don't. I don't think it's appropriate. I really don't. PELLEY: Isn't it your duty to respond when the president calls the Fed a \"much bigger problem than China\"? POWELL: My duty is one that Congress has given us, which is to use our tools to achieve maximum employment and stable prices and to supervise and regulate banks so that they treat their customers fairly and so that they're strong, well-capitalized and can perform their critical function in good times and bad. That's my job. And I think for me to get into responding to any elected official would be a distraction from that job. PELLEY: Do you listen to the president? POWELL: I don't comment on the president or any elected official. PELLEY: Can the president fire you? POWELL: Well, the law is clear that I have a four-year term. And I fully intend to serve it. PELLEY: So no, in your view? POWELL: No. PELLEY: You were raising interest rates at the end of last year and just in the beginning of 2019. The president sounded off on that. And you stopped raising interest rates. Was it because of pressure from the White House and the President? POWELL: Not at all. Not at all. And it's very important that the public understand that we are always going to make decisions based on what we think is right for the American people. We have a very wide network of contacts throughout American business and American life. We talk to them regularly. We listen to diverse perspectives and then we make a decision. And that decision is the best one we can make in real-time to serve the interests of the American people. We will never, ever take political considerations into effect. This is a strong institution, which has a strong culture, which is as I've described it. PELLEY: Help the audience understand how this was constituted by the Banking Act of 1935. How independent is the Fed? Who do you answer to? POWELL: We answer to the American people and to their elected representatives in our system of government. So when we say we're independent, what does that mean? What it means is that we serve long terms that are not at all synced up with the election cycle. And it means that we are directed to execute policy in a strictly non-political way, serving all Americans. And that's what we do. We are independent in that sense. Our decisions on rates can't be reversed by any other part of government. So, of course, Congress created us and could un-create us. But, nonetheless, that's what independence means for us. But the other side of independence is accountability. That independence is a precious thing. It enables us to better serve the public. It's critical for our service to the public. But it brings with us a duty to seek and embrace accountability and thereby, democratic legitimacy. And in our system of government, our accountability runs through the elected representatives and the oversight committees in Congress. PELLEY: Your Fed is apolitical? POWELL: Strictly non-political. PELLEY: Where are you taking us? What is an ideal economy in your view? POWELL: Well, I think of the direction I'd like to see us keep going. And that is right now, unemployment is at a 50-year-low. And we're at a pretty good \u2013 we're pretty close to price stability as well. But we have longer run issues. And it would be important for us as a nation to address these issues. In particular, you're not counted as unemployed if you haven't looked for a job in the last four weeks. And we have an unusually large number of people in their prime working years who are not in the labor force. The United States has a lower labor force participation rate than almost every other advanced country. That is not our self-image as a country. It's very important that we bring people back into the labor force so that they can contribute to our shared prosperity and reap the benefits of doing so. The economy will be stronger and the country will be stronger if we can do that. Not all of the tools to accomplish that are the Fed's. Many of them are in the hands of Congress. PELLEY: Where did these people go who are no longer looking for work? POWELL: They went a lot of places. Many of them are discouraged from finding work. There are a range of causes, really. And part of it is evolving technology. So as technology evolves, it requires rising skills on the part of the people. U.S. educational attainment has not moved up as rapidly as it has in other countries. Globalization's also a factor. For many advanced economies, manufacturing, to some extent, has moved into developing countries. And so the manufacturing employment and the manufacturing base is smaller than it was. So for whatever reason, and the opioid crisis is related to, I think, to those other factors. There are just are quite a few people who are out of the labor force, particularly young males, who would be better off in the labor force, and the country would be better off for it as well. PELLEY: Many people lost a great deal during the Great Recession. Wages are now increasing at around 3%. Are those people going to be made whole ever? POWELL: Well, the financial crisis did a great deal of damage to many people's lives. And, of course, not all of them will be made whole. People lost their houses. They lost their livelihoods, lost their jobs, and there's no way that they're all going to be made whole. So I think what we can do is learn our lessons from that crisis. That was the worst financial crisis in 75 years. We tried very hard to learn the lessons of what went wrong and to build a much stronger, more resilient, better capitalized financial system so that it will be more resilient to the kinds of shocks that happen in the economy. PELLEY: What went wrong was that American banks let the country down. Are American banks safe today? POWELL: American banking system is much, much stronger and more resilient than it was before the financial crisis. Particularly the largest banks have double or more the amount of capital, which is to say resources to absorb losses. They're far more liquid. It's often a lack of liquidity that causes a financial institution to fail. So they have far higher levels of liquidity. Because of stress testing they also have a much more forward looking sense of what the risks are that they're actually running and the ability to manage them is much higher. In addition, we've required them to undergo resolution planning in case they do fail. There's a plan for what to do, which doesn't involve a taxpayer bailout. So overall, there's no question that, not just the banks, but various aspects of the financial system, are in a much stronger place. We never declare victory on this. We are still working on it and we will continue to be vigilant because people's lives can be permanently damaged by that kind of event. And we really want to avoid that. PELLEY: But in 2007 the Fed missed the reckless criminal banking that was happening throughout our banking system. How do you know today that the banks are safe? POWELL: Well, as I said, we spent ten years analyzing, understanding what went wrong and trying to correct it. And we've done a great deal. As I say, we don't declare victory on this. We never will. We are going to keep our vigilance high on this. But overall, there's no question in my mind that the financial system is much stronger and better able to perform its critical function in good times and bad. PELLEY: A collapse of the financial system like we saw in 2008 cannot happen again? POWELL: Cannot is a strong statement. You know, I would say that our system is vastly more resilient and strong than it was before the financial crisis. PELLEY: How concerned are you about either criminals or more importantly hostile nations attacking our banking system through the computer system? POWELL: So cyber risk is a major focus. Perhaps the major focus in terms of big risks. I think the kinds of risks that happened to us in the financial crisis, we've worked hard to build up resilience against those. Cyber risk is a constantly evolving risk. We devote very large amounts of time and resources to protect the Fed, but also to protect financial institutions and the financial markets. And private corporations do the same thing. The banks we supervise are required to have plans in place and state of the art, you know, technology and the like. I would say for cyber risk though I've never felt a time when I think we're doing enough. We just have to keep running hard to keep up with the risk. PELLEY: I have the sense that I just hit on the thing that keeps you up at night. POWELL: I would say of the risks that we face, that certainly is the largest one. PELLEY: What's the worst case scenario that you worry about? POWELL: Well, what you worry about, one case that we think about a lot is if there were a successful cyber-attack on an institution, or a financial market utility \u2013 a payment system \u2013 which managed to take down that institution or that utility for an extended period of time. How do we build the resilience, the redundancy in case that does happen? And even more, how do we do everything we possibly can to make our institutions and our utilities resilient against that activity, so that kind of an attack, so that it doesn't succeed? PELLEY: According to federal statistics, the upper half of the American people take home 90% of income, leaving about 10% for the lower half of Americans. Where are we headed in this country in terms of income disparity? POWELL: Well, the Fed doesn't have direct responsibility for these issues. But nonetheless, they're important. And in particular, I would point to a couple of things. One is just relatively low mobility. We think of ourselves and we've always been a country where anybody can make it to the top. But the data show now that actually, the chances of making it from the bottom to the top in the United States are lower than they are in many other comparable countries. This is not our national self-image. And I think that comes down to better education, better training, getting people into the labor force and putting them on the path to prosperity. The other issue is related to that and that is the relative stagnation of incomes for most people. For a long time, we saw rising incomes generation upon generation. That process has slowed down. And I think it's important that we do those things we can from a public policy standpoint to give people the tools to take part in the economy. And also to create an environment where productivity can go up. It's really rising output per hour, what we call productivity, that allows real wages to rise over time. It allows living standards to rise over time. PELLEY: Adjusted for inflation, this generation of middle Americans have not done better than their parents. What one thing can we do to get the economy for those people unstuck? POWELL: Well, there's no silver bullet. There's no one thing here. But I would say right at the top of the list would be education. People need the education and the training to be able to compete successfully in a global economy where technology is driving so many things. And that's a key thing that, as a country, we need to continue to focus on and do better. There really is no substitute for your workforce having the skills and aptitudes to compete in the global markets. Our workers are the best in the world. But we're leaving \u2013 some people are being left behind. PELLEY: I had the opportunity recently to speak with one of the world's leading experts on artificial intelligence, who told me quite matter of factly that 40% of all jobs [could] be wiped out by automation and AI. Is that something you're looking at? POWELL: We do pay attention to, not just to AI, but to evolving technology generally. I think you have to start with a longer perspective, which is over time, technology has tended to raise living standards and also over time prosperity from technology has tended to be spread broadly. But that doesn't necessarily hold over short periods of time. And there's no law of nature that says it will continue to hold. I think what we can do as a country is try to be leaders in technology, but also make sure that our workers have the education and the skills they need to benefit from advancing technology. PELLEY: The Federal Reserve back during the Great Recession added something like [$1.7] trillion worth of mortgages that the rest of the economy really didn't want in order to make lending begin to happen again in this country. With the benefit of hindsight, was that the right thing to do? And is it the kind of thing that the Fed would do again if another big sector of our economy collapsed? POWELL: When the financial crisis hit, the Fed cut our interest rates to near zero, effectively as low as we could. And that wasn't enough. The economy needed more support. So we went and bought longer duration bonds, both Treasury securities and mortgage backed securities, because that would've lowered, and did lower, longer term rates and provide support to the economy. Since that time, there have been countless studies of the effect of those purchases, which we refer to as quantitative easing or QE. And most studies say, conclude, that those programs did provide meaningful support to the economy. There's a range of perspectives, but I would say that's most studies. So that's an extraordinary tool that one wouldn't use in the ordinary course. But we have said that, if needed, we will use all of our tools to give the economy the support that it needs. PELLEY: So the lesson that the Fed learned was that was an effective tool and is now part of your toolbox? POWELL: Quantitative easing is certainly in the toolbox. Our first order of business in a downturn would be to cut interest rates to support economic activity. If we needed to resort to our other tools, including forward guidance, including, quantitative easing, if we needed to do that, we would certainly do it. PELLEY: No one seems to talk about the national debt anymore. Have you noticed that? POWELL: Well, it's not our job. Fiscal policy is not the Fed's job. But when something threatens the overall economy, I feel that we have a duty to speak up. PELLEY: Does the national debt threaten the overall economy? POWELL: In a long-run sense, U.S. debt is on an unsustainable path. And what I mean by that is that the debt is growing faster than the economy. That cannot go on indefinitely. I wouldn't want people to think that we're on the verge of a debt crisis or anything like that. I don't believe that is the case. But what happens is you borrow more and more, and you're going to be spending more and more taxpayer dollars on servicing debt rather than investing in the things that we need to succeed as a country. Better education, things like that. So it is important that we get our hands around the debt. And ultimately, we will. There won't be any choice in the end. But, again, we don't do fiscal policy. We don't give Congress advice on particular fiscal policies. But I will say that it's important that we address this issue. PELLEY: What do you mean we won't have any choice in the end? POWELL: Well, the record is if something is unsustainable and cannot go on indefinitely, it will stop. So ultimately, countries, and businesses, and people who borrow excessively have to face that they've borrowed excessively. Again, the United States is a long way from any such event. The problem is more that we're spending more and more of our precious resources on servicing debt rather than investing in the things that we really need to succeed as a country. PELLEY: The bleeding will stop one way or the other. POWELL: In the long run, yes. PELLEY: Congress has been raising the debt ceiling steadily. Do you think that's something that should continue to happen for the economy? POWELL: The debt ceiling is really just something that allows the federal government to borrow to pay for the programs that Congress has already authorized. The real point is that Congress has to better match spending and taxes-- tax revenue. The debt ceiling is something that only the United States has. They have a separate vote in effect on whether to raise the debt ceiling to allow the money to be borrowed to actually pay for the programs that they've approved. So, again, we don't do fiscal policy here at the Fed. But when something threatens the overall economy I feel an obligation to speak up. And in the debt ceiling, the idea that we would somehow come to a place where we're not honoring all of our obligations is something that could threaten the economy. PELLEY: A large bank merger has recently been announced, and I wonder whether we still have banks that pose a systemic risk to the economy, that they are too big to fail. That was a big problem in 2008. It cost taxpayers $700 billion. Aren't we still in the same place? POWELL: We're in a very different place. So we have identified eight banking institutions in the United States as systemically important. And we have focused the highest expectations, and regulation, and requirements on those eight institutions. And that's not going to change. They're very highly capitalized. They have high amounts of liquidity and just in general high requirements. For banks below that level though, as we move down into smaller, more traditional banks, that present less of a threat to the economy, we think it's appropriate that they not be subject to quite the same high level of expectations as we impose on those banks. PELLEY: But the eight banks that you just mentioned are still too big to fail. And your answer to that is to watch them, not break them up. POWELL: No, I think in the sense of too big to fail, no, that's not the case. The Fed doesn't have the authorities that we had before the crisis to do some of the things we did during the crisis. And what we have instead is a resolution mechanism so that if a large financial institution does fail, it can be addressed in what amounts to a bankruptcy kind of a format. PELLEY: It can be unwound over time. It doesn't have to be-- POWELL: Yes. PELLEY: --a collapse. POWELL: We didn't have a means of allowing a large financial institution's fail before the financial crisis. We have that now. And we've spent many years building up a framework around it and requiring the banks to have higher levels of liquidity and capital and to have plans. I think we've made a great deal of progress. That's not to say that the failure of a large bank wouldn't be a very challenging event for the economy and for the financial markets. But I think we've made a great deal of progress in addressing that problem. PELLEY: Any of these eight large banks in your view can be unwound in an orderly way? POWELL: I believe that is right. Certainly that is the goal that we've been working for a decade now. And I think we've made tremendous progress toward it. PELLEY: What is the biggest threat to American prosperity that no one is talking about? POWELL: That no one is talking about? I would point to our longer-run challenges. So, the U.S. economy right now is in a pretty good place. Unemployment is at a 50-year low. Inflation is close to its target. We are growing at a reasonable rate. But we face longer-run challenges. And I would like to see a stronger national focus on, for example, labor force participation. There are plenty of prime-aged people who are not in the labor force and who would be better off in the labor force. And I'd like to see us find policies that can support and reward work, provide training and education, and generally try to raise U.S. labor force participation so that we're no longer at the bottom of the league table among advanced economies. I think that's a win-win. That gives us faster growth. It gives us more widespread prosperity. These people can contribute to our shared prosperity, and they can also benefit from doing so. PELLEY: This may not be a fair question, so let me kind of ask it as a sidebar. Do you know how many of those people there are? What's the number of people who are working age, but are unattached from the workforce? POWELL: Well, the number is very large. But a lot of people are doing so by choice. Really, the question is, so our labor force participation rate right now is 63.2%. If it were to go up three or four percentage points, that would be very good. That would be very good. Because some people in their prime-age working, prime-age labor force participation is much higher than that, but still lower than in other countries. Really I could get you a number, but I don't have one off the top.  PELLEY: \u00a0That's\u2014 POWELL: \u2013 off my head. PELLEY: \u2013 that's why I asked. Because I didn't know whether this was top of mind and right off the top of your head or\u2014 POWELL: It's a complicated answer. PELLEY: Well, of course it is. All of this is. PELLEY: You had dinner with the president recently. And you took your vice-chair with you. Did you feel like you needed a witness? POWELL: It would not be appropriate for me to talk about private conversations like that. I will say that that we had, at the president's invitation, we had dinner. [Treasury] Secretary [Steven] Mnuchin, [Federal Reserve] Vice Chair [Richard] Clarida, the president, and I had dinner. We talked about the economy. But I wouldn't want to get into talking too much about the contents of a private meeting. PELLEY: \u00a0Without getting into the contents, did you feel like the president was listening to you? POWELL: I try not to comment on the president. I just don't think it's appropriate for me to comment on the president or frankly any other elected official. If I do that, I think it's a distraction from the important job that we have. PELLEY: This builds on a conversation that we were having a short time ago. You mentioned the opioid crisis. It's that big a problem in the labor force? POWELL: Yes, it is. The opioid crisis is millions of people. They tend to be young males. And it's a very significant problem. And it's part of a larger picture of low labor force participation, particularly by young males. PELLEY: I mean, you seem to be talking about part of this generation being lost, unattached from the rest of the economy. POWELL: That is the issue. When you have people who are not taking part in the economic life of a country in a meaningful way, who don't have the skills and aptitudes to play a role or who are not doing so because they're addicted to drugs, or in jail, then in a sense they are being left behind. And there are too many of those people. And I think bringing them into the labor force would enormously benefit our country. We'd grow more strongly. And I think it would be good for the economy and good for the country. PELLEY: Many people seem to believe that the American dream is dying. To them you would say what? POWELL: Well, I have a more optimistic view than that. I do believe the United States has very strong institutions. It is the world's leading democracy. We still have the strongest economy in the world. And we have longer-run problems, as is always the case with an economy. And it's important-- PELLEY: But the middle class is getting left behind, Mr. Chairman. POWELL: What's happened is that incomes for sort of the median family have gone up at a much slower rate than they had in generations over the last century let's say. And that's not a good thing. And I think as a country we ought to be doing those things that will enable people to succeed, whatever part of the economic world they come from. And I think that's about our workers having the education and the skills that they need to capitalize on the great opportunities that are presented by technology. PELLEY: You mention education a lot. What is missing? POWELL: Well, U.S. educational attainment led the world for a long time. We were the first country in the world to have gender-blind secondary education. And what you see from that period of our history is technologies evolving very quickly, but living standards are rising and on a broad basis in the 1970s, around about that time, you saw educational attainment flattening out for the United States. And you saw it rising all around the world, in emerging market countries and also in the other advanced economies. And just about that time, you also see median incomes, middle class incomes flattening out. And you also see lower mobility for people at the bottom end. So I think at the top of the list of things that we could do to improve living standards, improving the education system is right at the top of that list. It's very, very hard to do it. PELLEY: I spoke to a gentleman who was at the time, the president of Caterpillar, the company that makes heavy mining and construction equipment. And he told me that he wanted to build a new manufacturing plant in the United States but he couldn't find enough American workers who had the education to operate computerized machine tools. POWELL: \u00a0We hear that all the time from our business contacts. And it is very disturbing. I mentioned these people who are out of the labor force or on the fringes of the labor force. And you hear all the time of lack of skilled labor. Even carpenters, electricians, plumbers, factory workers who can operate, you know, computerized equipment. There's a great need for those people. And we absolutely can match up the people we have with those jobs. It's just something we need to focus strongly on as a country. PELLEY: A recent Gallup poll showed that more young people in America believed in socialism than capitalism. That's got to be hard to hear for a guy who used to work in private equity and is now chairman of the Fed. POWELL: I think that our market-based economy has served us very well over time. Very well. And I think it'll continue to do so. Let's remember that the U.S. economy is the strongest in the world. Let's remember that having a market-based system where private actors make decisions about allocating capital and things like that has served us well. PELLEY: Finally, let me just nail this point home. Most people remember 2008 and the Great Recession. Can you tell me in this interview that our banking system is safe and sound and that can't happen again? POWELL: What I can tell you is that our banking system is incomparably stronger and more resilient than it was before the financial crisis. Particularly our largest banks have far higher levels of capital to absorb losses. They're far more liquid. Often, financial institutions have problems because of a lack of liquidity. Our banks have much, much more liquidity than they had. Our banks are far more aware of the risks that they're running and better able to manage them. And if they do fail, we now have a system for resolving them in bankruptcy. So we are in a much better place than we were. We will never declare victory on this. We're always going to be vigilant about emerging risks, and we're going to be vigilant about not backsliding and perhaps inadvertently allowing the financial system to weaken again. PELLEY: In those days the Fed did not see the Great Recession coming. I wonder what has the Fed learned from that lesson? POWELL: Well, I think we've learned a wide range of lessons. One of which is, that to our surprise, the financial system was not strong enough to withstand the shock that hit it. We really did think and I think broadly experts thought that the system was strong enough. And it turned out not to be. So the crisis exposed great weaknesses, not just in the banking system, but all across the financial system. We've spent a decade building higher resilience. As I mentioned, we will never declare victory on this. We'll always be remaining vigilant. PELLEY: But the Fed won't be fooled again? POWELL: Well, we are determined to remain vigilant and to continue to monitor for emerging risks and to sustain the gains in resilience that we have, you know, fought for and won. PELLEY: One more follow-up. Do hostile nation states have the ability to take our banks down through cyberspace? POWELL: The part of it that we control is to have our banks be as resilient as they possibly can and also our government institutions, like the Fed. We spend a great deal of resources and time on cyber resilience. And so do our banks. And we actively cooperate with other government authorities on this. And it's just something where I think you can never sleep well with this new risk and just do everything you can to stay ahead of it. And that's going to be what we do. PELLEY: Yeah, but that is the question. Are we ahead of it? POWELL: What we can do is focus on analyzing the latest threats, playing the best defense, making sure that our institutions are resilient and won't be successfully attacked, and also if they are successfully attacked having a backup plan, having redundancy. And so we do all of those things. There's a great focus on this at all private institutions, also public institutions. At the Fed we have a particular role in making sure that our banking institution is resilient to cyber risks. We take this very seriously. \u00a0I'd say in a sense it is our top priority. But I think it's just something where we're going to be working hard to stay ahead of the threat for a long time. PELLEY: It's become your top priority? POWELL: In a sense, it's the biggest risk. You know, the kinds of risks that we faced in the financial crisis are very real, but we know I think generally what to do there. We raised capital standards. We raised liquidity standards. The banks are taking much less risk now. So, we addressed all of those things that happened in the last crisis. Cyber is a relatively new kind of a risk with nation state actors. And it's one where the playbook is still being developed in real time. And, yes, it is a very high focus for many aspects of government and the private sector. PELLEY: \u00a0Too many unknowns. POWELL: Many unknowns. And it's an evolving situation. It's, you know, the threats evolve and develop. And-- we do everything we can to stay ahead of them. PELLEY: The dollar is strong, which to most people sounds like a good thing. But of course that limits imports if American goods become too expensive. The president said recently, \"I want a strong dollar, but I want a dollar that's great for our country, not a dollar that's so strong that it makes it prohibitive for us to do business with other nations and take their business.\" Are we now in danger of having a dollar that's too strong? POWELL: So the Fed doesn't have responsibility for the dollar. That is a responsibility that lies with the administration and with the Treasury Department. So we don't comment on the level of the dollar. I would say that it is one financial condition among many that we monitor.  PELLEY: Are you concerned about it? POWELL: I think financial conditions broadly continue to be in an appropriate place and supportive of a favorable outlook for the United States. At this point, the interview moved to the Federal Reserve Board Room. PELLEY: That Federal Open Market Committee that sits around this table [in the Federal Reserve Board Room] is the committee that makes the decision about interest rates. You've had four interest rate increases in your tenure. I wonder, were any of those unanimous? POWELL: They were all unanimous. PELLEY: All four? POWELL: Yes. PELLEY: No disagreement about raising interest rates? POWELL: No. It's not at all unusual to have a dissenting vote about monetary policy. That's traditionally happened with great frequency. It has not happened yet on my watch. That's not to say that we don't have vigorous discussions and a range of perspectives. And I think one of the great benefits of the system that we have is we have 12 Reserve Banks. And they bring different perspectives to our discussions, and that's, to me, a very healthy thing. You want to hear disagreement around issues before you make a decision. I think mistakes get made when everyone agrees and no one tries to explain why the decision is incorrect. PELLEY: Well, tell me what are these meetings like around this table? As far as I know no television camera has ever been in here during an Open Market Committee meeting. POWELL: Well, they go something like this. We all sit around this table. And there's lots of staff sitting around. And we begin with a briefing on the economy and of changes in financial conditions. And, then, participants have a chance to offer their own commentary on the state of the economy. We take a break. We have dinner. And the next morning, we come in. And we talk about monetary policy as a follow on to what we discussed the day before about the economy. We discuss monetary policy. There's a presentation by staff. Individual participants contribute what they want to contribute to that discussion. Then, generally, the chair offers a proposal. And then, there's a vote on that proposal. PELLEY: How lively is the discussion? How often are there dissenting views? POWELL: Dissenting views are very common. But really, it's more, though, different perspectives. Not every different perspective leads to a dissenting vote. We always have a range of perspectives on every issue. So, you're guaranteed that with a committee that has as many as 19 members. Right now, we have 17 participants on the FOMC. You're going to get a range of perspectives on, essentially, everything. And that's very healthy, I think. PELLEY: And the various bank presidents are coming from various places in the country. You have someone coming from the bank in San Francisco, somebody coming from the bank in Dallas, somebody coming from the bank in Minneapolis. So you get a really good look around the country that way. POWELL: You really do. One thing the presidents can do is they report on what's happening in their district. So, each of the 12 Reserve Banks, now, has a very highly developed network of contacts that reaches far beyond the business community, deep into the business community, but also into academe and all different walks of American life. And they, pretty systematically get the perspectives of people through surveys and conversations and they accumulate that. They come here and they talk about what's going on in their district. So, you gain, just listening to what's going on around the country, I think you gain an understanding of what's happening, which is superior to just looking at the national numbers. If you're just looking at the national level numbers, you're going to miss a lot of nuance in my opinion. So it's a good system and I think it's served us well, served the public well. PELLEY: How much do you think the average American understands about the Federal Reserve? POWELL: I think it is understandable that most people would not pay a lot of attention to central banking. They have other things to do in their lives. That is very understandable. It is, central banking and the Fed, are important things in our society. But they're not things that are widely understood. And I, frankly, think it's our obligation to be as transparent and explain ourselves as clearly as possible because what we do affects all Americans. And any American who wants to understand what we do should be able to do so straightforwardly. PELLEY: Everybody's got a mortgage or a car payment. POWELL: That's right. No, our interest rate policy affects everyone and so does financial regulation, indirectly. So that's why I say we have an obligation to be as transparent as possible, to explain ourselves to the American people and to their elected representatives in Congress. PELLEY: Well, when the committee does decide to raise interest rates, how does that affect people? POWELL: Well, we raise one interest rate called the Federal Funds Rate. And when we raise that rate, other short-term, overnight interest rates, so borrowings that are a day long or a month long or a few months long, those will be affected by our change in policy.  PELLEY: So the banks pay a higher rate once you increase-- POWELL: When consumers who have floating-rate debt will pay a modestly higher rate. We move rates up quite gradually. So you might or might not notice it. But, generally speaking, borrowers will pay a slightly higher rate when we raise our Federal Funds Rate. PELLEY: Why are the rate increases so gradual? POWELL: Well, we think that's what the economy has needed. We held our rate, our policy rate, near zero for almost seven years. That's something that's without precedent. And I think we were wise to do so. And then, about three years ago when the economy had really begun to return to health, we very gradually raised rates to a level that's more normal in a healthy economy. Rates are still quite low. But they're closer to a normal level for a healthy economy. PELLEY: Is it sort of an attitude of wait and see? You raise the interest rate a quarter of a point and see what happens? And, then, if the economy can take it, you raise another quarter, just tiny, little steps at a time? POWELL: So looking back, I think we've been very careful to give the economy every chance to recover and return to growth and return to health. And that's one reason why we've moved so gradually. I think today we actually think our policy rate is in a good place. And we've said that we're going to be patient and wait to see how events evolve before we make any change to our policy. PELLEY: We had the boom and bust in the '90s. We had the boom and bust in the mid-2000s. Are you trying to avoid another boom and bust cycle? POWELL: Well, yes. A boom and bust cycle's not something we want. Well, you know, we're using our tools today to try to sustain this long expansion. The economy's been expanding now for almost ten years. And we want to use our tools to allow the economy to continue to expand, to continue to keep the labor market strong, job growth strong, the economy growing and also keep inflation close to our two percent objective. PELLEY: This is the longest expansion in American history. How long can it last? POWELL: It will be the longest in a few months if it continues. I would just say there's no reason why it can't continue. PELLEY: For years? POWELL: You know, eventually expansions come to an end. The business cycle has not been repealed. But I would say there's no reason why this economy cannot continue to expand. PELLEY: This expansion's not worn out yet? POWELL: I don't think so. I think there's every reason to think that this expansion can continue to expand.",

            "article_content": "Here's what you need to know in politics this week... TRUMP, DEMOCRATIC RIVALS TO SPEAK AT CRIMINAL JUSTICE FORUM Via CBS News Associate Campaign Producer Eleanor Watson and CBS News Campaign Reporters LaCrai Mitchell and Tim Perry: President Trump will travel to South Carolina on Friday to participate in a criminal justice forum where Democratic presidential candidates will also be speaking. The forum is hosted by the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center and Benedict College\u2014a historically black college in Columbia\u2014from Friday to Sunday. Mr. Trump's attendance at the event was first reported by The State.\u00a0 The forum will focus on\u00a0Criminal Justice Reform After the First Step Act, which the Trump administration signed into law in 2018. Mr. Trump is expected to speak on Friday, and the Democratic candidates will speak on Saturday and Sunday. The act is one of the bipartisan accomplishments of this administration.\u00a0All of the senators\u00a0running for president voted for the bill. \u00a0 The First Step Act is an effort to reduce the number of prisoners while maintaining public safety. The law requires programming to prepare and test prisoners on their readiness for life post-prison. The act also changes the penalties for some federal offenses and increases funding for grant programs. Mr. Trump in his rallies has pointed to criminal justice reform as one of his accomplishments, but the Democratic candidates on the trail have pushed for further efforts to curtail mass incarceration. Senator Cory Booker, who is one of the candidates participating in the forum, told reporters on Saturday that he commends Mr. Trump for deciding to attend. \"This is an important urgent conversation, there should continue to be people from both sides of the political aisle all over the political spectrum, engaged in substantive conversation about how do we end a system of mass incarceration, how do we end a criminal justice system that has woefully too little justice,\" Booker said after meeting with voters in Hartsville, South Carolina. At the forum, former Vice President Joe Biden will likely face\u00a0further criticism\u00a0for his\u00a0tough on crime\u00a0record as a senator and his role in the 1994 Crime Bill that provided money for more prisons. And Senator Kamala Harris, who made her name as a no-nonsense prosecutor, is likely to face questions about her record as well.\u00a0 WARREN TO ANNOUNCE PLAN TO PAY FOR \"MEDICARE FOR ALL\" Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak: Senator Elizabeth Warren said Sunday that she will release a plan to pay for Medicare for All in the coming weeks.\u00a0 The senator has come under fire for not answering whether she would raise middle class taxes to pay for Senator Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All plan, which she has embraced and supported. Speaking to a crowd a slightly under 500 people, Warren said, \"Over the next few weeks to put out a plan that talks about specifically, the cost of Medicare for All, and specifically, how we pay for it.\" No voter brought up the issue, but Warren said she wanted to address it. She went on to promise that she \"will not sign a bill into law that does not reduce the cost of health care for middle class families.\"\u00a0 Asked about the announcement of the payment plan, Warren said, \"Nothing's changed. I've been working for a long time on this question about what the cost will be and how to pay for it.\" She refused again to say whether middle class taxes would go up, but she said \"you'll be able to look at it\" in the plan. THE INSIDE SCOOP ON BEN & JERRY'S SUPPORT FOR BERNIE Via CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga: Long before political reporters scribbled explainers on \"democratic socialism,\" Bernie Sanders had two men in his corner: Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield. Most Americans have never seen them, but they know them: \"Ben & Jerry\" ice cream pints have lined freezer aisles in supermarkets across the country for decades, though their enterprise was just a couple of years old when they met Sanders in 1981. That was back when Cohen and Greenfield scooped flavors out of a renovated Vermont gas station, when Sanders' \"political revolution\" mostly occupied downtown Burlington, and everyone had more hair. On Saturday, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 30-year old progressive firebrand, endorsed Sanders' presidential bid in Queensbridge Park. The candidate's list of endorsements for his 2020 presidential bid is growing, and Cohen and Greenfield are sticking with him. GOP'S WILL HURD SAYS DEAL WITH TURKEY LOOKS LIKE \"SURRENDER\" Via CBSNews.com reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez: Outgoing Texas Republican Congressman Will Hurd expressed concern about the White House-brokered temporary ceasefire in northern Syria, saying it resembles a surrender to the Turkish government and U.S. adversaries entangled in the country's protracted civil war.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"I still haven't seen all the details but what I'm learning, it looks more like terms of surrender than a peace deal,\" Hurd said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. \"And unfortunately, our enemies and our adversaries \u2014 like Iran, Russia, Turkey \u2014 they're playing chess and unfortunately, this administration is playing checkers.\"\u00a0 Facing growing criticism from Democrats and Republicans in Congress, an American delegation led by Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo brokered an agreement on Thursday with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who pledged to halt his invasion of northern Syria for five days to afford Kurdish fighters the opportunity to abandon territory reclaimed during the fight against ISIS.

            "article_content": "Less than 24 hours before the polls in Mississippi open, Republican candidate Tate Reeves, the state's lieutenant governor, brought in Vice President Mike Pence for a quick rally on the state's Gulf Coast. During his speech, Reeves tried to illustrate some similarities between himself and Pence, says\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0 \"Mr. Vice President, you have cut regulations in Washington, and I have cut regulations in Mississippi \u2013 and low and behold our economy is booming,\" Reeves said. \"It's not just happenstance, it's because conservative policies work.\" On Tuesday, Reeves will face Democrat Attorney General Jim Hood \u2013 who has held the AG's office since 2004.\u00a0Hood has competed and kept this race tight, with the latest Mason-Dixon poll showing Reeves with a three-point lead in a typically conservative state that voted for Trump by 17 points in 2016.\u00a0 University of Mississippi political science professor John M. Bruce told\u00a0Navarro\u00a0Hood's statewide success in the past makes the race interesting. \"From a political science perspective, this would be a really neat experiment to see if somebody who clearly has a statewide constituency and name recognition, if they're office bound. Can you move his personality and his record out of the AG's office, and still make a play?\" During his speech, Pence criticized Hood for his work as AG and tried to tie him to his national party. \"The Democratic Party of Jim Hood is dominated...it's dominated by left wing radicals who want higher taxes, green new deal, Medicare for All,\" Pence said. \"Jim Hood doesn't represent the values of Mississippi.\" Meanwhile in Kentucky, President Trump is headlining another rally to support a Republican governor in a\u00a0competitive race. After visiting Mississippi on Friday, he is back in the South to support incumbent Republican Governor Matt Bevin.\u00a0 Bevin is competing against Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear, whose father Steve Beshear was governor from 2007-2015. Bevin won against the Democrat in 2015 by nine points, but since then, he has received high disapproval ratings and had fights with teachers over pension funds. During the debate, Bevin called the teachers \"selfish and shortsighted.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump's visit is meant to drum up excitement for Bevin, but outside the rally, supporters of the president were tepid about their support for Bevin. \"I'm voting for Bevin because he's the lesser of two evils,\" Sue Mardis of Lexington, Kentucky told\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. \u00a0 One of Mr. Trump's supporters in line told\u00a0Watson\u00a0that he will be voting for the Democrat on Tuesday. \"Because Mr. Bevin is not for public education, and I'm a teacher\" James Payne said. Payne came to support Mr. Trump and expects most of the rally will be about the president, not Bevin. When asked why the race is competitive, Silas Carty from Magoffin county said, \"Because of the teachers - they're siding with Beshear.\" Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. CDT in Mississippi and in Kentucky from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. EST.\u00a0 JOHN DELANEY Former Representative John Delaney was one of two presidential candidates to officially file for the New Hampshire primary today, appearing at the State Capitol in Concord to present declarations of candidacy and bank certified checks to Secretary of State Bill Gardner. Delaney, who has campaigned for nearly 2.5 years in the Granite State said he's in it to win, has ruled out a third-party bid if he loses the Democratic nomination. Asked if Democrats can win a general election by raising taxes on the middle class,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says Delaney declared, \"It makes it harder. I'll leave it at that.\" KAMALA HARRIS CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says workers from two unions in southern Nevada - the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 and Bartenders Union Local 165 - will question Kamala Harris\u00a0this Friday in Las Vegas. Some 200 members are expected to attend the town hall, the first of a series planned with presidential candidates in Nevada. Among the topics likely to come up with the senator from California: \"Medicare for All.\"\u00a0 As candidates have continued to court the influential labor group, the Culinary union has made clear their hesitation over such single-payer healthcare proposals. \"I don't think that's the solution for them. I don't think that the members will listen to me about that,\" Geoconda Arguello-Kline, the union local's top official,\u00a0told PBS\u00a0last month. BERNIE SANDERS Ninety-nine days ahead of the New Hampshire primary, Senator Bernie Sanders' New Hampshire campaign continues to plug its statewide grassroots efforts. In a memo obtained by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga, State Director Shannon Jackson writes, \"Senator Sanders has visited all 10 counties in New Hampshire, held 32 events, and spoken to over 14,000 people.\"\u00a0 The campaign also boasts 90 staff members, according to the memo, more than any other presidential campaign team in the Granite State. Over 9,000 New Hampshire residents have contributed to Sanders' campaign, according to the campaign, with organizers knocking on 100,000 doors for the Vermont lawmaker. In February of 2016, the Sanders campaign had over 105 full time staff, according to a former 2016 campaign aide. The Vermont lawmaker won the 2016 New Hampshire Primary by over 20 points, adding his name to the ballot for a second time, last week in Concord. MARIANNE WILLIAMSON Author Marianne Williamson also filed for the New Hampshire primary on Monday.\u00a0Sganga\u00a0says Williamson announced to reporters and supporters in Concord she plans to release a comprehensive healthcare plan in the coming days. \"I have for so long felt that Bernie is not quite everything I want. Elizabeth is not quite everything I want. Pete and Amy \u2013 that to me is just another cover for same old, same old. So I found my hybrid. I have experts working on it.\" ANDREW YANG Andrew Yang says he will release his tax returns in \"the next number of days,\"\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Ben Mitchell\u00a0reports. In a\u00a0one-on-one interview\u00a0in Iowa, Yang says his team has been in the process of preparing his returns for some time.\u00a0 Yang also talked about his Medicare for All plan, and why he adopted the label but not all of the policies associated with other candidates' plans, like eliminating private insurance.\u00a0 \"Medicare for All as a policy platform, to us, is very straightforward, which is just everyone can have access to Medicare or Medicare like public program. To me, it's not necessarily baked into the definition of 'Medicare for All' that we get rid of private insurance wholesale,\" Yang said.\u00a0 When asked if he would eliminate the employer-insurance model, Yang said he would not, in part to protect the plans of union workers who bargained for their insurance benefits. \"Over time, the goal is to show workers around the country that the public option, the public program, is superior in many ways to what employers are paying for,\" Yang said. \"None of those things are free. You're paying by accepting lower wages, as in the case where many many union workers and negotiate for health care benefits, and we're all paying because these health care insurance costs are baked into the prices that we pay every day.\"\u00a0 NEW HAMPSHIRE Tomorrow marks municipal elections for New Hampshire, with a key mayoral contest shaping up in Manchester. The Granite State's largest city is hosting a tight race between incumbent Democratic Mayor Joyce Craig and Republican challenger Victoria Sullivan.\u00a0 \"We like to toss around the term #Friendship2020 here in New Hampshire,\" New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley announced this morning on a call with reporters. \"This week, staffers from more than eight presidential campaigns have come together to knock doors and help elect local Democrats on Tuesday. And staffers for different campaigns a few weeks ago stood in the rain at 6 a.m. shoulder to shoulder to support local Democrats.\" Sullivan, who served as co-chair of Senator Rand Paul's 2016 campaign, has been endorsed by Kentucky lawmaker.\u00a0Sganga\u00a0says Manchester is located in Hillsborough County, a \"Trump-Obama pivot county\" and politically diverse region of New Hampshire. President Trump won Hillsborough County by a slender margin of .2%, while President Obama won in 2012 and 2008 by margins of 1.1% and 3.7% respectively. ONLINE AD SPENDING A progressive digital strategy firm is partnering with Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager in an effort to counter President Trump's digital advertising blitz,\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reports. PACRONYM, the Super PAC affiliated with the firm ACRONYM, says it plans to spend $75 million on an advertising campaign called \"Four is Enough,\" a multi-platform effort to communicate with voters on the issues before the Democrats pick their Presidential nominee.\u00a0 The campaign will be helmed by Tara McGowan, founder of PACRONYM and ACRONYM, and advised by David Plouffe. PACRONYM says it will target voters in Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, while relying on \"a rigorous testing component to increase engagement and measure message effectiveness.\" The group notes that the Trump campaign has already spent over $26 million on Facebook and Google ads alone, and so far no group affiliated with the Democrats has been able to counter the Trump campaign's massive digital spend. \"This election is already being fought and it's being fought online. There will be no magic message, ad, or candidate. We are going to have to grind out this victory the hard way, and it will take time to learn how to build the most effective case to the right voters. This is a DEFCON 1 situation,\" Plouffe said in a statement.\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE Kweisi Mfume, a former president of the NAACP, has entered the race to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Congressman Elijah Cummings,\u00a0CBSNews.com's Caroline Cournoyer\u00a0reports. Mfume announced his candidacy on Monday at the Reginald F. Lewis Museum in Baltimore. He said\u00a0Cummings' death\u00a0spurred him into action. \"A month ago, I would have never imagined that I would be before you this afternoon in this capacity,\" Mfume said in a speech posted on his Facebook page. \"Today we're here without Elijah, but his memory and his spirit to fight on is alive and flourishing, it is out of that unpredictable reality that I stand before you.\"\u00a0 Cummings died October 17 at the age of 68. He won his seat in Congress after it was vacated by Mfume, who resigned to lead the NAACP. 2020 MERCH Small-dollar donations are a driving force in the 2020 Democratic presidential race, and in a primary cycle where, for the first time, making the debate stage also depends on meeting small-donor thresholds, campaigns are getting creative with merchandise. That's because when it comes to merch, candidates do not have to separate purchases made from their online stores or at events from other donations when filing with the Federal Election Commission, so every purchase appears as another small-dollar donation. It turns out, having supporters spend $35 on a hat or just $4.99 on a set of stickers could go a long way.\u00a0 So what are campaign's selling?\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0found out what some of the top sellers have been so far in 2019. From Andrew Yang's MATH hats to Pete Buttigieg's \"Boot Edge Edge\" and limited edition t-shirts, the donations are adding up to the tens of thousands and beyond. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign has unveiled a plan to strengthen unions, with the goal of doubling union membership in his first term as president. The plan was released shortly before Sanders was set to speak at the AFL-CIO convention in Iowa.\u00a0 As with his presidential bid in 2016, Sanders has premised his campaign on supporting and uplifting working-class Americans. Sanders's \"Workplace Democracy Plan\" includes a provision to end \"right to work\" laws in several states, which prohibit workers from collective bargaining. The provision would also give every American union worker the right to strike and ban the replacement of striking workers. It's unclear how this provision would be accomplished. The plan also includes an executive order preventing large companies which engage in union-busting practices from receiving federal funding. \"Corporate America and the billionaire class have been waging a 40-year war against the trade union movement in America that has caused devastating harm to the middle class in terms of lower wages, fewer benefits and frozen pensions,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"That war will come to an end when I am president.\" Other provisions in the plan include requiring companies that merge to honor existing union contracts, stopping corporations from forcing workers to attend mandatory anti-union meetings, and establishing federal protections against the firing of workers for any reason other than \"just cause.\" Sanders has been a leader in fundraising and has consistently been at the top of polls. However, the latest poll of Democratic Iowa voters by\u00a0Monmouth University\u00a0found that Sanders was slipping in the state, as he garnered only 9% support compared to 16% in April.

            "article_content": "Detroit \u2014 When Democrats talk about Michigan, they tend to focus less on Hillary Clinton's loss here in 2016 and more on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's victory in 2018. Two years after Donald Trump won Michigan by fewer than 11,000 voters, becoming the first Republican to be successful in the Wolverine State in three decades, Democrats won five statewide offices and flipped two congressional seats. Whitmer won nine counties that voted for the president.\u00a0 The governor's election and other 2018 victories serve as a roadmap for Democrats plotting a comeback in Michigan, a state critical to rebuilding a once steady blue wall in the Midwest that crumbled in 2016.\u00a0 \"In my campaign I hardly ever talked about what's happening in Washington D.C. I talked about how we're going to fix the damn roads, how we clean up drinking water, and ensure people get access to the skills they need to get good paying jobs,\" Whitmer told CBS News. \"Stay focused on the things that really matter. People in Michigan don't care about the president's Twitter feed. We care about feeding our families.\" By hosting an early presidential primary debate here, Democrats are sending a clear message that they have learned from the past. \"The first lesson people learned was to prioritize the state,\" says Matt Grossman, Director of the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State University. \"This year it will definitely be considered a top tier from the beginning, and the Democrats will not be caught sleeping on Michigan.\" But with the president back on the ballot next year, Democrats are trying to figure out what a winning coalition might look like in Michigan. They are debating whether they need a candidate who can reclaim white, working-class voters who switched to Trump in 2016 and have become synonymous with the Midwest or one who can turn out base voters, particularly African-Americans, in the state's urban areas who stayed home in the last presidential race.\u00a0 The Democrats' focus on Detroit makes a case for an approach that emphasizes increasing turnout in diverse areas. Forty percent of voters in Wayne County are black. Clinton won the county in 2016, but by 76,000 fewer votes than President Obama did in 2012. In Genesee County, which includes Flint, Clinton underperformed Obama by 26,000 votes.\u00a0 Beyond his strong support from black voters, Obama ran a campaign in Michigan that was uniquely tailored to the state, focused on the auto crisis and the bailout and painting Mitt Romney as part of the corporate elite who contributed to job loss.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\"We in African-American communities will determine the destiny of the nation...I will make sure that when we come to communities like Detroit, we just don't talk to people but we invest in those communities,\" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker told the NAACP conference in Detroit last week.\u00a0\u00a0\"I think there are two things you're talking about: One Donald Trump should not be president, but the second thing is talking about our vision, and talking about an America that works for everyone,\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told reporters at the same conference. \"That creates education opportunities and career opportunities that doesn't just work for white people but black people as well. That's what my plans are all about.\"\u00a0Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won the Michigan primary in 2016, and believes he still has a message that resonates across the state. \"I think they're people who had voted for Obama and gave up on political establishment. We need an agenda that says to them, Trump lied to you. He did not provide healthcare to everyone,\" he told reporters in Detroit last week.\u00a0\u00a0Exit polling in 2018 showed vulnerabilities for Trump's re-election in Michigan, including 56 percent of voters disapproving of him. Turnout in the governor's race in Wayne County increased by 29 percent. And nationwide, turnout among African American voters increased by 11 points compared to the previous midterm.\u00a0\u00a0\"Michigan will be Democratic in some years and Republican in some years. I don't think we'll ever make the mistake like we did in 2016 and not turn out again,\" Whitmer said. \"We had record turnout in 2018 and I think we're prime for that this year. But people want to come out for a candidate who they believe in.\"\u00a0\u00a0After the 2016 election, the state Democratic Party launched \"Project 83,\" a grassroots organizing project in all of the Michigan counties. And the state has taken steps to expand access to the ballot box in 2020.\u00a0\"We have to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,\" Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes told CBS News, arguing that candidates should talk about what they perceived to be failed Trump promises in the Midwest but also focus on what they would do as president. Most critically, she says, candidates have to become familiar to voters here.\u00a0\u00a0\"It's great they are here now for these debates, but they need to come back,\" says Barnes of the 2020 candidates. \"And if they don't, it will be to their detriment.\"\u00a0\u00a0Kabir Khanna contributed to this report Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden now has the backing of one of the largest trade unions in the country after the International Association of Firefighters said they support his presidency. A nearly 3-minute long video features highlights from Biden's addresses to the group over the years, touting his outreach to working, middle class Americans as being the \"centerpiece of everything I have done.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 BREAKING NEWS: The International Association of Fire Fighters endorses @joebiden for President of the United States. https://t.co/yewUm8wMGd IAFF General President Harold Schaitberger said the organization is \"proud\" to stand with Biden in his bid for president. He called Biden a compassionate problem solver, a staunch advocate for working families and commended his leadership and experience on the international stage.\u00a0 \"Joe Biden proves civility and decency will enhance the political discourse that our country needs right now,\" Schaitberger said. \"The endorsement of the IAFF was approved because Joe Biden will be a champion for the public safety of Americans.\" President Trump appeared to react to the former vice president's endorsement on Twitter Monday morning, referring to the union as \"dues sucking firefighters\" who \"always support Democrats.\" The Dues Sucking firefighters leadership will always support Democrats, even though the membership wants me. Some things never change! Biden, who comes from a middle class family himself, has repeatedly endorsed the efforts of America's unions nationwide, saying they \"built the middle class\" of the country. The former vice president most recently stood side by side with members of the United Food and Commercial Workers labor union as thousands employees of Stop & Shop grocery stores went on strike over what they said was an unfair contract proposal. \u00a0 It was during an IAFF speech last month that Biden teased his long-rumored run for president amid persistent chants of \"Run Joe Run\" from the crowd. Several times during his remarks, which could have been easily confused for a campaign rally, Biden alluded to his future run, telling the crowd \"we're ready to take anybody on.\" \u00a0 Biden finally ended months announcing on Thursday that he would be launching his third presidential campaign, largely running as a referendum on President Trump. \u00a0 \"We are in the battle for the soul of this nation,\" he said in a campaign roll out video. \"If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was quick to mention the controversy he's faced over the past week in his first speech since several women accused him of touching them inappropriately. Biden began his address to the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Friday, by joking, \"I had permission to hug Lonnie,\" referring to his on-stage embrace of IBEW President Lonnie Stephenson. However, Biden quickly pivoted to praising the union workers and expressing his faith in the future of American manufacturing. He said that blue collar workers were not receiving proper credit for their work. \"All you're looking for is to be treated fairly, with respect, with some dignity. Because you matter,\" Biden said, adding that millionaires on Wall Street \"could not function without what you do.\" \"We've gotten so damn elitist,\" Biden said. His criticism of elitism, and lifting up of the forgotten man, was reminiscent of President Trump's appeal to members of the white working class. \"You guys are like me. I never walk away from the table without thanking the waiter,\" Biden said to his audience, exemplifying his appreciation for members of the service industry. \"How do you think we built the great middle class? Unions!\" Biden said, to huge cheers and a standing ovation from the audience. \"Minimum wage, overtime pay, forty-hour week, weekends off...all those rights exist, because you -- and my family way back in the day in Scranton -- fought for those rights.\" Biden called the presidency of Donald Trump \"a tragedy in two acts\": the first being his treatment of others, and his focus on personal grievances. \"For three years now, Americans have been focused on the past, not the future,\" Biden said. \"This country can't afford more years of a president looking to settle personal scores.\" Biden also brought children up to the stage at one point. and shook their hands. He put his arm around a young boy, and joked again, \"I got his permission to touch him.\" The crowd laughed and applauded. Biden later told reporters that he \"would not be surprised\" if more allegations of inappropriate behavior surfaced. He also said that despite the jokes at the IBEW speech, \"it wasn't my intent to make light of anyone's discomfort.\" \"I'm sorry I didn't understand more. I'm not sorry for any of my intentions. I'm not sorry for anything I have ever done. I've never been disrespectful intentionally, to a man or a woman,\" Biden continued. However, Lucy Flores, one of the women who accused Biden of touching her inappropriately, wrote on Twitter that she did not find Biden's jokes during his IBEW speech to be funny. \"t's clear @JoeBiden hasn't reflected at all on how his inappropriate and unsolicited touching made women feel uncomfortable. To make light of something as serious as consent degrades the conversation women everywhere are courageously trying to have,\" Flores said. Biden expressed contrition over the accusations against him in a video posted to Twitter Thursday, saying that he would be more \"respectful and mindful\" of personal space without directly apologizing. The women allege that Biden \u2014 while he was vice president \u2014 made them feel uncomfortable at Democratic Party functions, sparking a debate about the possible\u00a02020 presidential candidate's behavior. \"Social norms have become to change, they've shifted. And the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset. And I get it,\" said Biden in the video posted Thursday. \"I hear what they're saying. I understand it. And I'll be much more mindful. That's my responsibility. My responsibility, and I'll meet it.\"\u00a0 While he still considers politics to be about personal connection, he said he \"will be more mindful and respectful of people's personal space.\" Biden is mulling a presidential campaign, although should he announce a White House bid, it's not expected to be until\u00a0later this month at the earliest. \u00a0 Flores, a Democrat who served in the Nevada State Assembly, wrote a piece for New York Magazine's\u00a0The Cut\u00a0on Friday alleging that Biden \"inhaled\" her hair and then kissed her before a campaign rally in 2014, when she was pursuing a bid to be Nevada's lieutenant governor. Soon after former congressional aide\u00a0Amy Lappos\u00a0told the\u00a0Hartford Courant\u00a0that Biden reached for her face and rubbed noses with her during a 2009 fundraiser in Greenwich, Connecticut. The New York Times\u00a0reported\u00a0Tuesday night that two more women have accused Biden of touching that made them uncomfortable. Biden's supporters, including several women, have been quick to defend the former vice president. A spokesperson for Biden also sent a list to reporters of quotes from women affirming their support.

            "article_content": "Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders announced he will run again for the Democratic nomination in the 2020 presidential race. The three-term Independent senator is the 10th candidate to join the most diverse Democratic Party field in U.S. history. That's very different from four years ago, when the 77-year-old Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley were Hillary Clinton's only Democratic challengers. Only on \"CBS This Morning,\" John Dickerson spoke to Sanders about taking another shot at the presidency, and why he believes this campaign will succeed: JOHN DICKERSON: So Senator Sanders, you're gonna run for president? BERNIE SANDERS: I am going to run for president, that's correct. JOHN DICKERSON: What's gonna be different this time? BERNIE SANDERS: We're gonna win. We are gonna also launch what I think is unprecedented-- in modern American history, and that is a grassroots movement, John, which will have at least one million people from every state in this country-- coming together to not only defeat Donald Trump, not only to win the Democratic nomination-- but also to lay the groundwork for transforming the economic and political life of this country. That's what's different. JOHN DICKERSON: And that's your theory, which is that without the-- without the groundswell, without the grassroots you can't change the politics in Washington-- BERNIE SANDERS: That's exactly right. Look John, we are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all, and the reason for that is the power of the insurance companies. We pay by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That's the pa-- power of the pharmaceutical-- industry. We have a corrupt political system in which billionaires can contribute unlimited sums of money. That's the power of the top 1% and the billionaire class, and on and on it goes. So somebody could come before you and say, \"Look, I wanna do A and I wanna do B,\" and that's fine. But at the end of the day, the only way that real change takes place is when millions of people stand up, fight back, and say, \"Enough is enough. We're gonna have a government that works for all of us, not just the few.\" JOHN DICKERSON: This time you're running in a field with a lot more Democrats. How has the field changed since the last time you ran-- BERNIE SANDERS: Well, obviously it's a different campaign. Last time it was just Secretary Clinton, and now it will have who knows, ten, 15, 20 candidates. JOHN DICKERSON: Doesn't that make it harder? BERNIE SANDERS: In some ways it does. In some ways it makes it easier. When you're running against one person you know you gotta have 51% of the votes. Now who knows what you need, 30, 35%. But bottom line for me is I think-- it is absolutely imperative that Donald Trump-- be defeated, because I think it is unacceptable and un-American, to be frank with you, that we have a president who is a pathological liar. And it gives me no pleasure to say that, but it's true. BERNIE SANDERS:  We have a president who is a racist, who is a sexist, who is a xenophobe, who is doing what no president in our lifetimes has come close to do doing, and that is trying to divide us up. What presidents-- even conservative presidents, liberal presidents, they understand their function is to bring our people together. This guy is trying to divide us up. That has got to end. JOHN DICKERSON: But all of your opponents will say, \"We've gotta get Donald Trump outta the White House.\" That's not your distinguishing characteristic. So-- BERNIE SANDERS: That is not my distinguishing characteristic. I think what I am very proud of in-- in a sense, this campaign, John, is a continuation of what we did in 2016. You will recall-- you may recall that in 2016 many of the ideas that I talked about-- Medicare for all, raising the minimum wage-- to $15 an hour-- making public colleges and universities tuition-free-- spending at least $1 trillion and rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure-- criminal justice reform-- all of those ideas people would say, \"Oh Bernie, they're so radical. BERNIE SANDERS: \"They are extreme. The American people just won't accept those ideas.\" Well, you know what's happened in over three years? All of those ideas and many more are now part of the political mainstream-- and a majority of the American people now support 'em. So what this campaign is about is understanding that three years ago we began the political revolution. Now it's time to complete that revolution and to take those-- that vision and implement it into reality. JOHN DICKERSON: So you're saying the party came your way? BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I don't wanna say that. I think most people would say that. JOHN DICKERSON: Is that your argument then against your competitors, which is, \"I was Medicare for all before Medicare for all was cool?\" BERNIE SANDERS: (LAUGH) I guess that's one way of looking at it. But it-- it's-- no. N-- I know many of the people, certainly the senators who are running, and without exception I am fond of them. They are, in some cases, my friends. I think maybe the-- the s-- what distinguishes-- this campaign from the others-- is not only that these are issues that, in fact, we did raise and-- and had to take on enormous opposition-- as we did. But also that what I understand from the bottom of my heart, that real change in this country will never come about unless there is struggle, unless millions of people stand up-- and fight for that change. We have three people in America today who own more wealth than the bottom half of the American-- society. BERNIE SANDERS:   We are the only major country on Earth not to guarantee health care to all. We pay the highest prices for prescription drugs, we have a dysfunctional-- child care system. We have a president who doesn't even acknowledge the reality of climate change, let alone take on the fossil fuel industry. Real change, John, is not gonna come when somebody gets to the White House and say, \"Oh gee, members of Congress, I think you should, you know, take on the hundreds of millions of dollars spent by the pharmaceutical company, do the right thing.\" That's not how it's gonna happen. It happens when people stand up and fight back. That's the way that real change has always happened in this country. JOHN DICKERSON: You used to talk about a revolution. That's what you're talking about here? BERNIE SANDERS: That's right. In other words, w-- once again, it's not gonna happen inside the beltway. The only way that Congress and the White House is gonna move is when millions of people really do stand up and say, \"Enough is enough. We want a government--\" not just rhetoric; this is reality-- \"a government that works for all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors.\" JOHN DICKERSON: You used to day-- or you-- you-- you once-- BERNIE SANDERS: Oh, this is dangerous. You're quoting me to myself. (LAUGH) All right. What did I say? JOHN DICKERSON: You told Bob Schiefer-- you said, \"I think it's fair to-- to-- to say that I'm, perhaps, the most progressive member of the United States Senate.\" That's the last time you ran. Is that still true? BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah, I think so. JOHN DICKERSON: Let's talk about one of those-- well lemme ask you this: Is the size of the-- the-- or is the revolutionary nature of each individual policy prescription you make, whether it's on climate change or health care-- is the size and boldness of it-- a signal of how serious you are? Because some of your competitors will be saying, \"Well, let's have Medicare for all but let's not do as much as Bernie Sanders wants.\" Does that mean they're not as serious as you? BERNIE SANDERS: I don't wanna-- look, these are my friends, these are good and serious people. So I'm not here to criticize my opponents, and I hope that the campaign that will take place-- within the Democratic-- primary pa-- process will be one on issues and not personal attacks. I think all that I'm saying here is that what I understand from the bottom of my heart is that at a time when, for example, the drug companies make billions and billions of dollars in profits, that they themselves will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent a Medicare for all, you gotta take 'em on. So does-- do many members of Congress say, \"We oughta lower drug prices?\" Almost everybody recognizes that. But the-- you cannot make those changes unless there is a movement of people who make the Congress and the president an offer they cannot refuse. JOHN DICKERSON: Here's why I ask: There is a debate in the Democratic party which you know so well, about whether your proposals are just too big for the system of government at it exists right now. They're just too large. You talk about a revolution, but other candidates are saying, \"We need a more-- yes-- increase the number of people who are covered by health care, yes, it's a right. But we can't go all the way to what Bernie Sanders is suggesting--\" BERNIE SANDERS: John, we are sitting here in Burlington, Vermont, my hometown. Get on your-- get in your car, go 50 miles north and you'll be in Quebec, Canada. Now, somehow or another in Canada, for a number of decades they have provided quality care to all people without out-of-pocket expenses. You go in for cancer therapy, you don't take out your wallet. And they do it for about 50% per capita of the cost that we spend. BERNIE SANDERS:   Now, if our friends in Canada can do it, if our friends in the U.K. can do it in a different way, if our friends in Scandinavia can provide quality health care to all of their people as a right for far less cost than we spend, you tell me why we can't do it. And I will tell you the answer. So I'm not gonna give you the opportunity; I'm gonna give you the answer. And that is, it is not a health care issue, it is a political issue, it's an economic issue, it's the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies. And I'm prepared to take them on. JOHN DICKERSON: Lemme ask you a policy question and a political question about Medicare for all. When you go to Canada still two-thirds of the people who have the health care in Canada have some form of private help with that insurance. Your Medicare for all plan, as I understand it, has no private element to it. BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if you want-- you know-- in Canada and what I want, is to cover all of the basic health care needs. If people want cosmetic surgery, fine, they can go to a private-- insurance. The other thing that we do which has not been talked about enough is I'm a strong defender of Medicare as it currently exists. But Medicare today does not cover-- dental care, it does not cover eyeglasses, it does not cover hearing aids. And that is something that many seniors our concerned about. Our legislation will provide that coverage. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, but lemme ask you, on your Medicare for all you-- have talked about the fact that polls show 70% are in favor of Medicare for all. But that number drops to 37% if somebody hears private insurance is going to go away, which is what your-- BERNIE SANDERS: Well-- JOHN DICKERSON: --which is what your plan offers. So I guess my question is, you're offering something that the polling shows people can get very spooked very quickly about. BERNIE SANDERS: No. Yeah, but that's because we're gonna be taking on the insurance companies and the drug companies who are gonna spend a whole lotta money distorting what we believe in. For example, they're gonna say people, \"You're gonna lose your current health insurance (UNINTEL) employment.\" Yeah, but you're gonna have the same exact doctor, you're gonna have more freedom of choice under our proposal than you have under the current proposals. So there's a lotta misinformation that's going around on this issue. The bottom line is the average middle class family will save money-- will spend less money on health care, will have more choice, and have broader coverage than is currently the case. JOHN DICKERSON: So the other b-- the other challenge to your m-- to your health care plan will be cost. People-- you can explain it to them but there w-- people will say, \"My goodness, there's no way this is-- everybody's gonna get covered and there gonna are gonna be--\" BERNIE SANDERS: But John, this has-- JOHN DICKERSON: --you know, some of the estimates that come out-- BERNIE SANDERS: No, I need you and the media to help us explain-- JOHN DICKERSON: --trillions of dollars-- BERNIE SANDERS: --the truth. We spend twice as much per capita on health care as the Canadians, all right? And the reason is we waste an enormous amount of money in administration and in an incredibly dysfunctional and complicated system. Our proposal will cost the American people less than the current dysfunctional system. There are some estimates, by the way, that over the next ten years the current system, if not changed, could run up to $50 trillion. BERNIE SANDERS:   Now, here's where the dishonesty comes in. All right, people say, \"Bernie Sanders wants to raise your taxes.\" What they forget to tell ya is that Bernie Sanders is gonna do away with all of your private health-- private health insurance premiums. You're a family of four, John. The average family now is paying $28,000 a year for health insurance. That's gonna end. No more out-of-pocket expenses, no more deductibles. The cost of prescription drugs is gonna go down. We expand the kinds of coverage available for senior citizens. It's a good deal. JOHN DICKERSON: But that transition, which is essentially transitioning from private premiums you pay now into some federal system-- just that alone is a massive transformation of the-- of-- of the federal system, which just that part of it is-- I mean, you're asking pe-- BERNIE SANDERS: Let's not go l-- let's not go all that crazy. Currently we have Medicare, right, for the elderly. Guess what? Medicare's probably the most popular health insurance program in America. We have Medicaid. That's a pretty popular program. We have the... Veterans Administration, which if you talk to veterans, is a pretty popular program. We are already spending a whole lotta money on public health programs. So all we are doing is taking a popular program that most seniors are very proud of, Medicare, and we're expanding it over a four-year period to all of our people. JOHN DICKERSON: What happens to the 180 million people in the private insurance market now? BERNIE SANDERS: They will continue to be able to go to the doctors they want, the hospitals they want. The color of their insurance card will change. JOHN DICKERSON: And they will no longer be private; it'll be a public system? BERNIE SANDERS: It'll be Medicare. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. So y-- I mean, you're adding 180 million people to Medicare, so that'll take a little doing. BERNIE SANDERS: Look, back in 1965, I think, Medicare was established and everybody said, \"Oh my God, it's impossible. This is communism, this is taking away everybody's freedom.\" Today Medicare is a very popular program, Medicaid is a popular program. Yeah, so it's gonna take an effort. But I think-- two points, John, on this issue. Number one, we as Americans have gotta ask ourselves, \"How come every other major country guarantees health care to all people at far lower costs per capita than we do?\" BERNIE SANDERS:  That's number one. Number two, fundamental question, \"Is health care a human right or is it not?\" If you have the money, your kid is sick, you can get great health care. You don't have the money, your kid is sick. You're in trouble. Or you may go bankrupt after you come out of an expensive-- hospital procedure. We can do better as a nation. JOHN DICKERSON: Quick question about the politics of this. The Democratic party just benefited from a revolutionary response at the ballot box, and winning 40 seats in the House. In the Senate the Democrats didn't do as well because of the structure of the way it works. BERNIE SANDERS: We had a lotta seats, you know, that we had to defend. JOHN DICKERSON: Of course. But that's part of the structure of the way politics works. My question to you is, you talk about a revolution. You just had a revolution in 2018 essentially, and it was unable to get past the structural system in the Senate-- BERNIE SANDERS: All right, John-- John, revolutions do not happen overnight. One of the revolutions that I am very proud of-- it's not just that many of the ideas that we brought forth in 2016 are now supported by a strong majority of the American people, it's that we are getting more people, ordinary people, young people participating in the political process. And I think the future of the Democratic party, frankly, is bringing young people-- black, and white, and Latino, and Native American, and Asian-American into the political process. And I'm very proud (and we're gonna build on this) that in the last campaign-- you know, we lost. We got 46% of the pledged delegates. But we won more votes from young people than Clinton and Trump did combined. JOHN DICKERSON: Does your success hurt in the marketplace of ideas? Which is to say, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez can talk about a Green New Deal and is getting a lotta coverage for that, but that shrinks the amount of time that people are maybe paying attention to Bernie Sanders or some other idea. Does it change the marketplace of ideas-- BERNIE SANDERS: Quite the contrary, quite the contrary. The fact that we have more voices out there talking, in this case, about the existential threat to our country and the world, which is what climate change is, and the absolute need to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy-- and by the way, when we do that we create millions of good-paying jobs. And we are gonna pay attention to our brothers and sisters in the fossil fuel industry who will be hurt by this transition; we are not gonna leave them on the side of the road. JOHN DICKERSON: You were supportive of the fact that Amazon pulled out of New York City, that it-- that that deal did not go through. BERNIE SANDERS: I was, and-- but I was also supportive-- (LAUGH) and-- and maybe at the lead-- of telling Amazon, owned by the wealthiest person in the world, that they cannot continue to pay their employees $9 or $10 or $11 an hour; they have to raise the minimum wage-- their minimum wage to 11 bucks an hour, which as you'll recall-- happened. We did that with Disney-- as well. What you have-- and with a company like Amazon is-- a very profitable company owned by the wealthiest guy in the world, who among other things we recently learned paid zero federal taxes. So you're a worker out there, you're makin' 40,000 or 50,000 bucks a year. You pay more in taxes than Amazon did, that made billions of dollars in profit. And what I did not like about what they did to New York-- that's New York's decision, not mine. BERNIE SANDERS: But I don't like a powerful company kinda playing off one state or one city against another. \"All right, you're-- Los Angeles. What are you gonna give me? You're New York City. What are you gonna give me? How much corporate welfare are you gonna give me? Because I have some jobs.\" I don't think that's a good way to do business in America. JOHN DICKERSON: Are corporate tax rates gonna go up under Bernie Sanders? BERNIE SANDERS: Absolutely. JOHN DICKERSON: How high? BERNIE SANDERS: Now, I can't give you-- yeah, that's something we gotta think about. But let's deal with this-- I will tell you this very frankly, John: I worry very much that in our country-- you ain't gonna hear anyone else tell you this. You're not gonna hear it on CBS too much, so-- is that this country is moving toward an oligarchic form of society, and that means that we have a small number of billionaires-- Jeff Bezos being one-- who have enormous economic and political power. BERNIE SANDERS:  And that's why I've introduced a very progressive estate tax to deal with that issue. But at a time when we have so many social needs-- when we have children in this country who are going hungry, when we have veterans who are sleeping on the street, when we have to combat climate change, you know what? Yeah, we are gonna ask the billionaires and the wealthiest people to start paying their fair share of the-- taxes. No apologies on my part. JOHN DICKERSON: What's your opinion of capitalism these days? BERNIE SANDERS: Wha-- pardon me? JOHN DICKERSON: What's your opinion of capitalism at these-- at its-- BERNIE SANDERS: Look, I think-- what we see-- in this country and around the world is a lotta great entrepreneurs who come up with some great ideas and some great products. But I think what is happening is some of these folks-- we-- have a system which allows these people to accumulate huge amounts of-- income and wealth. So when I talk about democratic socialism you're not talkin' about the government running the local grocery store or anything else like that. What we are saying is that in America-- and by the way, Franklin Delano Roosevelt talked about this way back in the 1940s, that people are entitled not only to certain constitutional political rights, they are entitled to economic rights. BERNIE SANDERS:   So if somebody wants to call me-- a radical, okay, here it is: I believe that people are inherently entitled to health care. I believe people are entitled to get the best education they can. I believe that people are entitled to live in a clean environment. People are entitled to have decent-paying jobs. That's what I believe. JOHN DICKERSON: The president mentioned socialism in his State of the Union Address. BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah, I heard that. JOHN DICKERSON: What's he going after there? BERNIE SANDERS: Oh look, he's gonna appeal-- he's gonna lie-- he's gonna say, \"Bernie Sanders wants-- the United States to become Venezuela.\" Bernie Sanders does not wanna have the United States become the horrific-- economic situation that unfortunately exists in Venezuela right now. What Bernie Sanders wants is to learn from countries around the world. Bernie Sanders wants to learn from Finland in terms of why they have the highest-quality public educational system in the world, learn from s-- Sweden and Denmark why they have virtually free child care and high quality free-- health care for their people, why other countries are doing a better job in dealing with income and wealth inequality than we are. So you got a president who is a demagogue, a president who is leading us in an authoritarian direction. I would hope that the American people don't believe too much of what he says. JOHN DICKERSON: Democrats, you know this well, come to you and say, \"You're not a Democrat. Why are you running in the Democratic primary?\" BERNIE SANDERS: Well, first of all, I am a member of the Democratic leadership. I've been in the Democratic caucus. I am part of the leadership of the Senate. I have been-- part of the Democratic-- caucus in the House for 16 years. And I'll-- I'll-- I will say this-- in terms of that-- so-- and I have knocked my brains out, running around the country to help Democrats win-- the House, to help governors win-- Democratic governors win their seats. BERNIE SANDERS:  But this is what I will also say-- if you look at polling in this country what you find is that a whole lotta people are dissatisfied with both the Democratic and Republican parties. Usually the Republicans come out lowest, Democrats-- and more and more people are seeing themselves as independents. So if-- if the Democratic party is gonna do well in the future I think they have to reach out to those Independents, including, by the way, a lot of young people, a lotta people of color, and bring them into the Democratic party. And I think I'm in a good position to do that. JOHN DICKERSON: The revolution you're talking about, does it require making a moral case about wealth in America? In other words, not just that it shouldn't be concentrated, but that the people who are concentrated with that wealth are-- are bad people-- BERNIE SANDERS: No. JOHN DICKERSON: That's part of what the-- fueled the uprising in the Gilded Age against-- concentrated wealth-- BERNIE SANDERS: It's not-- look, I-- I wouldn't use it that way. I mean, there are some bad people who are poor, there are bad people who are rich, there are bad people who are middle class, there are bad people who are black, and white, and Latino, everything else. I don't-- I don't look at it that way. What I look at it is-- is we have created a system which is basically out of control. And that system is that you have billionaire corporations-- billion-- corporations like Amazon that make billions in profit, don't pay a nickel in taxes. You have three people who own more wealth than the bottom half of American society. That is the issue. It's not those three people; it is that we have allowed that to take place. So I got-- we got veteran sleeping out on the street, we have kids who can't afford to go to college, you got 30 million people who have no health care, and then you got three people who own more wealth than the bottom half of America. That is wrong. That's morally wrong, in my view. That is bad economics. JOHN DICKERSON: The system in Washington that you're familiar with, even though you're tryin' to run a revolution from the outside, is it possible to have bipartisan, \"Let's reason together--\" in Washington? Or do you need to do things like get rid of the filibuster, to break through some of the systemic things that block both Republicans and Democrats? BERNIE SANDERS: No, I'm not crazy about getting rid of the filibuster. But I-- I think the problem is people often talk about the lack of-- comity-- and the anger. The real issue is that you have in Washington a system which is dominated-- by wealthy campaign contributors. Who in their right mind-- so you go out, do a poll, all right? BERNIE SANDERS:  Here's a suggestion. CBS: do a poll. Do you think it is a good idea to give $1 trillion in tax breaks to the top 1% and private corporations, and then cut social security, Medicare, and Medicaid? That's the Republican agenda. What percentage of the American people support that-- 5%, 10%? Nobody. And yet that's what happens. Why? Because billionaires and wealthy campaign contr-- contributors significantly control what goes on in Washington. BERNIE SANDERS:   And that is why, among many other things, we have to overturn Citizens United, we have to do away with this horrible voter suppression. Every American, regardless of your political view, should be outraged that you have governors and attorney generals in this country tryin' to keep people from voting because of their color or because of their economic status. Outrageous. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about a theory that Howard Schultz-- Howard Schultz has now said he would not run as an Independent if the Democrats moder-- nominated a moderate-- BERNIE SANDERS: Oh, isn't that nice. But you raise a good thing. (CLAP) Why is Howard Schultz on every television station in this country? Why are you quoting Howard Schultz? Because he's a billionaire, right? There are a lotta people I know personally who work hard for a living, who make $40,000, $50,000 a year who know a lot more about politics than, in all due respect, does Mr. Schultz. But because we have a corrupt political system anybody who is a billionaire who can throw a lot of TV ads on television suddenly becomes very, very credible. So what Mr. Schultz-- what is he, blackmailing the Democratic party? If you don't nominate Bernie Sanders he's not gonna run? Well, I don't think we should succumb to that kinda blackmail. JOHN DICKERSON: The other reason-- is that he represents an argument that some people make, which is, \"If you're worried about Donald Trump, the Democratic party to win voters in various parts of the country needs to pick somebody who is not so radical.\" That's also what his theory represents-- BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I think his deeper theory is, \"Hey, I'm a billionaire. Leave me alone. And-- let me make as much as money as I can without paying my fair share of taxes, and let me continue to have undue political influence.\" Which you are quoting me. Here is a billionaire-- no one's ever heard of this guy, or not many people have. He's a billionaire and he's thinkin' of running for president, suddenly he's a very famous guy. That's-- that is a problem with our political system. JOHN DICKERSON: You'll be 79 when you're inaugurated. BERNIE SANDERS: Yes. JOHN DICKERSON: That's old, by the standards of presidents. BERNIE SANDERS: Yes. (UNINTEL)-- JOHN DICKERSON: Should people be concerned about that? BERNIE SANDERS: I think-- you know, when we look at-- at people w-- whether they're old or they're young, you gotta look at the totality of-- of the person. I'm sure you have bumped into people who are 90 who do great work, (CLAP) you have bumped into people who are 45 or 50 you gotta wake up 'cause they're falling asleep all of the time. I have been blessed, thank God-- I'm gonna knock-- (KNOCKING) this is wood, I'm gonna knock on it-- with-- with good health and with good energy. I was a cross-country runner, a long distance runner when I was a kid and I've been runnin' hard-- in a sense-- since then. BERNIE SANDERS:  So you know, I think as a nation, as we try to-- stand up and-- and oppose all forms of discrimination, whether it is racism, or sexism, or homophobia, or Islamophobia, whatever it may be, I think we gotta take a hard look at ageism as well-- as well. Judge a person on, you know, whether you like them, whether their ideas make sense, whether you think they can do the job. I-- I think that's how we should look-- at p-- at-- at-- at people running for office-- not just on one criteria, about age. JOHN DICKERSON: We're out of time, but I got a couple more questions for ya. There has been talk b-- Andrew McCabe was the deputy-- director of the F.B.I. He has a book out, he talked about the 25th amendment with respect to this president. You're thinking of being president. Is it wise for the institution of the presidency to have-- have kind of informal talk about the 25th amendment? A lotta progressives like the idea. Is that good and healthy for presidents-- BERNIE SANDERS: Look, Trump has-- you know, look, all that I will-- I will answer that question by saying this: There are right now a number of investigations, most significantly the Mueller investigation-- looking, in this case, whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Yeah, I think it's a little bit-- preliminary to be giving you answers before we see the results of those investigations. JOHN DICKERSON: But should be-- people be talking about the 25th amendment? BERNIE SANDERS: Again-- I don't talk about it. JOHN DICKERSON: Foreign policy. You wanted America out of a lot of the wars that it was engaged in. Donald Trump wants that too. You said about North Korea that it was-- that it was a good-- first step-- to deesc-- a positive step to deescalate tensions. It would seem like Donald Trump's foreign policy is in sync with your view-- BERNIE SANDERS: No, it's not, in-- in this sense. Trump has gone-- it appears, has gone out of his way to antagonize our long-term allies. I mean, to insult our Canadian neighbors, to insult Germany-- the United Kingdom, France is, you know, almost incomprehensible. On the other hand-- I have called for-- you're absolutely right. I-- I think-- the idea that we are gonna withdraw troops-- from-- Syria or from Afghanistan-- is-- is the right thing, but it has to be done not through a tweet. BERNIE SANDERS: This is not easy stuff. You can't turn your backs on your allies, you can't leave people in danger. So the idea of getting out of wars that we have been in for a very long time is good, but it has got to be done in the right way. It has to be done with our allies, not through t-- tweets. JOHN DICKERSON: Last question: There were charges in your last campaign that women felt-- there was discrimination against them, that there was sexism. You met with some of those former staffers. What did you learn? BERNIE SANDERS: I learned that was true. And-- it-- it-- it breaks my heart. And-- you know, our campaign kind of exploded; we went from a few people to a lotta people. And I will be very honest-- in telling you that t-- in retrospect, some of the people that were hired should not have been hired and some women went through experiences that they should not have. But lemme also say this-- in my 2018 campaign for reelection to the United States Senate from Vermont and in this campaign for president, we are going to have the strongest protocols-- to protect women and anybody else against-- any form of harassment. We are gonna be training every employee who works for us-- and we're gonna give people who feel that they've been harassed the opportunity to talk to people outside of the campaign. So this has been an issue that has upset me-- and we're gonna rectify it in this campaign. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Senator Sanders, thank you. BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you very much, John.",

            "article_content": "Des Moines \u2014 Democratic presidential candidates are trading in kumbaya for combat.\u00a0 With three months to go before the Iowa caucuses, the 2020 campaigns are moving out of the introductory phase of the primary season and into the knife-sharpening phase, seeking to snuff out the competition as voters get closer to making up their minds.\u00a0 Candidates debuted new attack lines during major party cattle calls and campaign events across Iowa over the weekend and have continued to hone them throughout the week. In this phase of the campaign, it's Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren at center stage, with the surging South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg looking to portray himself as a \"unity\" candidate.\u00a0 The new urgency of the campaign has forced several campaigns to reshuffle or reassess their respective standings in the race. The impeachment inquiry hanging over Washington and driving the daily news cycle has made it more difficult for lower-tier campaigns to break through. At the same time, few voters on the ground are asking about the latest moves in Washington, and are instead focused more on health care, the economy, and climate change. \u00a0 After spending the past several days on the ground in Iowa, attending presidential town halls and talking to lots of voters, here are five things we are learning about the state of the race.\u00a0 Biden is attacking Warren. Buttigieg is attacking Warren. Warren is attacking Biden and Buttigieg. Juli\u00e1n Castro is attacking Buttigieg.\u00a0 In other words, this is the part of the campaign season when candidates stop being polite and start getting real.\u00a0 Facing criticism from Biden over her plan to pay for Medicare for All in Iowa over the weekend, Warren suggested the former vice president may be \"running in the wrong presidential primary.\" In a Medium post, Biden called Warren condescending. \"Some call it the 'my way or the highway' approach to politics. But it's worse than that. It's condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view,\" he wrote. \"It's representative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share: 'We know best; you know nothing.'\"\u00a0 Biden continued the attacks during an interview this week with host Joe Madison on SiriusXM. \"If you don't agree with Elizabeth Warren, you must somehow be not a Democrat. You must somehow be corrupt. You must somehow not be as smart as she is,\" he said.\u00a0 And as Buttigieg is gaining ground in Iowa, Warren debuted a new line of criticism for him in the Hawkeye State. \"I'm not running some consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone,\" she said on stage at the Liberty and Justice dinner, a big annual gathering of Democrats, which was seen as the launching pad for Barack Obama in 2007. \"Anyone who comes on this stage and doesn't understand we're already in a fight is not going to win that fight,\" she said. This came after Buttigieg had targeted Warren during the Democratic debate in Columbus last month, where the Massachusetts senator was pressed on her health care proposal. In Iowa, Buttigieg took a not so subtle swipe at Warren, who has been leading polls in the state: \"We can do it and we can do it together and agree on everything and solving problems than just fighting.\"\u00a0 As Buttigieg rises in the polls, he has also been the subject of criticism from within the party. In an interview this week on The Daily Show, Juli\u00e1n Castro addressed the lack of support the Indiana mayor has among African American voters.\u00a0 \"We are going to need a nominee that can resonate in the African American community,\" he said. \"I saw a hundred different cities when I was HUD secretary and I was mayor of a city that is 14 times larger than South Bend. In fact, we could almost fit South Bend in our Alamo Dome in San Antonio.\"\u00a0 New polls show the former vice president leading nationally but lagging behind in first two early states. A new Quinnipiac University poll found Warren with 20%, Buttigieg with 19%, Bernie Sanders with 17% and Biden with 15%.\u00a0 While his diverse coalition set him apart from his fellow contenders and helps boost him in states like Nevada and South Carolina, there are questions about whether a poor finish in Iowa could stunt the campaign. This is the third time Biden has competed in the Iowa caucuses after his unsuccessful run in 1988 and 2008. And Iowa voters often mention their familiarity with Biden and their respect for him, even as they are interested in the other candidates. \"I like Joe but he's not a candidate for me. He's not connecting with American especially with younger folks,\" said Meghan Torkelson, who came to see Buttigieg in Decorah and is still deciding on a candidate.\u00a0 \"Biden is a very good man. Very good VP,\" said Jerry Hageman, who attended a union party gathering in Cedar Rapids over the weekend. \"Personally he's got baggage that Trump's gonna take advantage of.\"\u00a0 Others echoed those sentiments, saying that while they liked Biden they were still searching for an alternative.\u00a0 \"To be frank, I was supporting Joe Biden because of his experience but I am not certain right now,\" said Daniel Power, a professor at University of Northern Iowa who came to a Democratic fish fry in Cedar Rapids. \"Time for a generational change,\" he said, noting that he had an interest in New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. \"Joe learns things about people all the time, he wants to help people and see if they are okay but I am not feeling the energy with his campaign,\" said Tom Kinn, president of the national association of letter carriers, who also attended the fish fry in Cedar Rapids.\u00a0 While some campaigns are surging, other are reshuffling or packing it up all together. Beto O'Rourke's withdrawal from the race underscored the pressure of the calendar: With just three months to go before the Iowa caucuses, campaigns have to figure out if they are able to actually compete.\u00a0 Kamala Harris let go of her New Hampshire field staff to focus on Iowa. She has tailored her campaign to smaller, more intimate events. She has even been cooking for supporters in their own kitchens, for example.\u00a0 In September, her campaign said they were aiming for a top three finish. Yet in an interview with CBS News' Ed O'Keefe, the senator looked to manage expectations. \"We are going to end up in Iowa doing very well,\" she said. \"Iowa being the first state, you know, got to be all in here in order to be able to get to the point that we can actually get to New Hampshire and other states later.\" Castro also laid off staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina in order to focus on Iowa. In October, his campaign made an aggressive fundraising pitch to raise $800,000 by the end of the month or else would have to drop out of the race. He reached the goal, but has not yet made the cut for the Democratic debate in November.\u00a0 Underdog candidates often point to the campaigns of John Kerry in 2004 and John McCain in 2008, noting each had to rise again from the dead and eventually became their respective party's nominee. But in a field this crowded, campaigns are also conscious of giving voters any excuse to look to another candidate.\u00a0 As candidates jockey for position in Iowa, several have evoked the come-from-behind caucus victory of Barack Obama in 2008. Campaigning in the state over the weekend, Buttigieg tried to draw parallels, telling the audience that \"the first time I came here was a volunteer to knock on doors for a candidate with a funny name.\" \u00a0 The reference resonated with Jack Knight, an Iowa resident who came to see Buttigieg in Decorah over the weekend. \"The whole atmosphere feels like Obama when he was getting his momentum. Pete is not Obama, but the atmosphere is the same... I have to go to more rallies for more candidates, [but] I am going for the feeling.\" Iowa Democrats are proud of the role they played in helping to elect a history-making president. And underdog campaigns here point to Mr. Obama's election as a reason to hold out hope that, with a good organization, anything can happen.\u00a0 \"In Iowa they actually make decisions based on what is possible, even if other people don't think it's possible,\" Harris said. \"This is what Iowa has done in the past and this is what I'm betting on.\" But strategists also caution there are significant differences between now and then. \"The candidate pool this time is so incredibly deep,\" says Elesha Gayman, a former state lawmaker who worked on Mr. Obama's campaign in the state in 2008. \"[Mr. Obama] just had that captivating thing about him, whereas this time there are multiple candidates that have that.\" \"What we were looking at when Obama first ran and what we're looking at today, there's a different skill set we need,\" she says. \"We needed that hope and that vision then, but there's a lot of other stuff going on...it's really hard to compare the times because our country is in such a different era.\"\u00a0 Perhaps the biggest driver for some lower-tier candidates staying in the race: Polls continually show that a significant portion of Iowa caucus-goers still remain undecided. The Quinnipiac University poll released this week found that 52% of those who named a first choice candidate also said they might change their mind before the caucus. Only 46% said their mind was made up.\u00a0 Many voters interviewed by CBS News said they had narrowed down the field to a few candidates, but figured they still had time to decide. As Kieth Rollenhagen, a retired building designer from Ames, said ahead of a Warren event there: \"I'm an Iowan, so I haven't decided yet.\"\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "\"Where Did You Get This Number?\" is a podcast going inside the 2020 presidential campaigns, with analysis from CBS News campaign embeds, polls and other stories from the 2020 race. Subscribe today! The 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are heading out West more often, specifically to California and Nevada. California has nearly 500 primary delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday, March 3, and along with Nevada, it reflects a greater diversity of the American electorate than the other early states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.\u00a0 Certain campaigns, like Senator Bernie Sanders'\u00a0and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg's, have even been upfront about staking their presidential runs in the later states. On this week's episode of the \"Where Did You Get This Number?\" podcast, host Anthony Salvanto takes a look at how the 2020 race is playing out in the West, specifically how the Nevada caucus works, the effects of Senator Kamala Harris suspending her campaign, and Bloomberg's ad buy in California.\u00a0 Nevada's caucus doles out delegates through voters ranking up to five candidates. If a voter's No. 1 candidate doesn't clear a viability threshold, or get a minimum of 15% of the votes, their vote is automatically realigned to their second pick. However, a new a rule now allows voters to push \"unviable\" candidates over the threshold.\u00a0 \"During realignment, we can go to a second choice pick. So let's say that Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden all cleared that 15% during the first set of votes that were cast,\" explained Alex Tin, a CBS News 2020 campaign reporter based in Las Vegas. \"But the change that they clarified... was that you and I can get together, our first choices weren't viable, and potentially coalesce into a second choice candidate that is now newly viable instead of our options only being Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren having cleared that first realignment threshold.\"\u00a0 Many California donors and endorsers are also realigning their support after Harris dropped out of the race recently. Tin cited the United Farm Workers, \"a major labor union\" that represents most of California's agricultural workers in the Central Valley. \"And that union endorse her very early on and was seen as a loss for some of the other candidates who are really trying to court not only the labor vote, but specifically in California, that working-class Latino vote that is so coveted,\" Tin said.\u00a0 California is also seeing a significant bump in Bloomberg campaign ads, though whether they're going to be effective is yet to be determined.\u00a0 \"I was talking on background a couple weeks ago to a staffer working for a campaign in California who was griping to me that, you know, when she turns on the TV, all she sees are Michael Bloomberg ads,\" Tin recalled. \"She [saw] them when she was watching 'Face the Nation.' She watched them, an ad right before, and it felt like every commercial break after that on Sunday.\"\u00a0 Subscribe to\u00a0\"Where Did You Get This Number?\"\u00a0and listen to the latest episode to hear more on Sen.

Ryan raised only $889,000 in the second quarter, and was not present for the recent debates in September and October. Before running for office, Ryan was notorious in the House for launching an ill-fated campaign to unseat Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader in 2016.

That can happen for our country, too,\" de Blasio said in his campaign roll-out.\u00a0 But for de Blasio, the fight against President Donald Trump is a personal one.\u00a0 \"I'm a New Yorker, I've known Trump's a bully for a long time, this is not news to me or anyone else here, and I know how to take him on,\" de Blasio said.\u00a0 \"Don't back down in the face of a bully. Confront him. Take him on,\" he added. \"Donald Trump must be stopped. I've beaten him before, and I will do it again.\" The mayor cited his city's efforts in taking the Trump administration head on -- from his fight in the court system challenging the White House's \"zero tolerance\" family separation policy to joining a pack of other cities in committing to the Paris climate accord despite Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the pact.\u00a0 During an appearance on ABC's \"Good Morning America\", de Blasio dubbed the president \"con don\", saying \"every New Yorker knows he's a con artist.\" \"He's trying to convince working Americans he's on their side, it's been a lie since day one.\" Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has already weighed in on de Blasio's run, tweeting that the mayor is a \"JOKE\", adding \"if you like high taxes & crime, he's your man. NYC HATES HIM!\" The Dems are getting another beauty to join their group. Bill de Blasio of NYC, considered the worst mayor in the U.S., will supposedly be making an announcement for president today. He is a JOKE, but if you like high taxes & crime, he\u2019s your man. NYC HATES HIM! In his campaign spot, de Blasio also touted his resume in helping the working class while leading one of the largest cities in America, including his effort to help raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, provide legal guarantees for paid sick leave, comprehensive guaranteed health care and free pre-K for New York City's children.\u00a0 \"It doesn't matter if you live in a city or a rural area a big state or small state, doesn't matter what your ethnicity is,\" he said. \"People in every part of this country feel stuck or even like they're going backwards.\"\u00a0 De Blasio said as president he will work to take on the wealthy and big corporations.\u00a0 \"I will not rest until this government serves working people,\" he said. \"As mayor of the largest city in America, I've done just that.\" The long-anticipated declaration makes de Blasio the 24th person and third mayor angling for the job in 2020. He plans to head to Iowa Thursday night and South Carolina over the weekend to campaign. Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "Round two of the opening Democratic presidential debate turned up the heat Thursday night, with 10 candidates pushing to make themselves seen and heard. Former Vice President Joe Biden faced a fiery challenger in Sen. Kamala Harris when she questioned his record on school busing during the 1970s and invoked her own personal experience as a young girl. After the debate, Biden's campaign told CBS News Harris' attacks were a \"low blow.\" Former Massachusetts Democratic Governor Deval Patrick told \"CBS This Morning\" he was surprised at how \"uncomfortable\" and \"awkward\" Biden seemed during his exchange with Harris. \u00a0 \"I agree with Senator Harris that Vice President Biden is not a racist. I was surprised about how awkward or uncomfortable he seemed in answering the question because he's answered the question many, many times over the years,\" Patrick said.  In the 1970s and 80s Biden opposed the federal government's involvement in using busing to help desegregate schools. Taking aim at Biden, Harris said, \"You also worked on them to oppose busing and there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to schools every day and that little girl was me.\" \"The fact is \u2026 there are lots of progressive Democrats and liberal-minded people who are uncomfortable with busing and were at the time,\" Patrick said. \"In many respects we sent the kids in to do what the adults wouldn't do. We sent the kids in to integrate the schools because the adults wouldn't integrate the neighborhood. And sooner or later we're going to have to confront the bigger question about the importance of learning to live an integrated life.\" Biden also faced questions from Harris over his comments about working with segregationist senators, saying, \"It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this country.\" Patrick also felt Biden didn't address that issue as well as he has in the past though he agrees with the sentiment that it's important to be able to work with people whose views differ from yours.  \"I think the point he was making is if you want to get things done in Washington, you have to be willing to work with people who don't agree with you on everything. You know, there is a value in a politics that says we can work together on some things without having to agree on everything.\" Former aides to former President Barack Obama encouraged Patrick to run for the Democratic nomination this year himself. He said no, citing \"the cruelty of our elections process,\" and how it could affect his loved ones.  Asked if he wishes he were up on that stage Thursday night, Patrick said, \"That's not how I was thinking about it although when I was thinking about it many months ago one of the questions was, how do you break through in a field this large and talented without being a celebrity or sensationalist, and I'm none of those things.\"",

            "article_content": "Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is plunging $500 million into an effort to close all of the nation's remaining coal plants by 2030 and put the United States on track toward a 100% clean energy economy.\u00a0 Addressing the Massachusetts Institute of Technology commencement, Bloomberg laid out his plan, which in many ways bypasses the top national politicians even though, as he told MIT's class of 2019, \"climate change is now first and foremost a political problem, not a scientific quandary or even a technological puzzle.\" Bloomberg said he'd work with states and utilities to shutter \"every last U.S. coal-fired power plant by 2030.\" It's a goal he says is achievable -- \"we're already more than halfway there,\" he said, touting the 289 coal-fired power plants shut down since 2011 through a partnership between Bloomberg Philanthropies and the Sierra Club. He added that 51 have been closed since the 2016 election, and \"despite all the bluster from the White House, as a matter of fact, since Trump got elected, the rate of closure has gone up.\" The former New York City mayor, who considered joining the 2020 Democratic presidential field, slammed the candidates whose climate plans set a 2050 goal for mitigating the effects of climate change. \"Politicians keep making promises about climate change mitigation by the year 2050 -- hypocritically, after they're long gone, and no one can hold them accountable,\" Bloomberg observed. His own initiatives would take coal out of the climate equation 20 years earlier. Though he didn't mention the former vice president by name, Joe Biden introduced his climate plan this week, and it features a goal of net-zero emissions by no later than 2050.\u00a0 Bloomberg is also working to stop construction of new gas plants. \"By the time they are built, they'll be out of date because renewable will be cheaper,\" he said at the MIT address, adding that we \"don't want to replace one fossil fuel with another.\" The push to end use of both natural gas and coal is the reason he's named his initiative \"Beyond Carbon.\" The billionaire Bloomberg's investment in the Beyond Carbon initiative marks the largest ever philanthropic effort to combat climate change, according to the mayor's foundation. The organization will bypass the federal government and instead seek to pass climate and clean energy policies, as well as back political candidates, at the state and local level. \"We're in a race against time with climate change, and yet there is virtually no hope of bold federal action on this issue for at least another two years. Mother Nature is not waiting on our political calendar, and neither can we,\" Bloomberg said in a statement.\u00a0 Bloomberg considered but ultimately passed on seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Instead, he vowed to point his vast wealth and political connections toward fighting climate change and defeating President Trump. The initiative mirrors Bloomberg's work on gun control, which has focused on bolstering state and local efforts. The former mayor's financial contributions to Democratic candidates who backed stricter gun laws was also considered integral to the party's ability to retake the House in 2018. Bloomberg's foundation has spent several years working with the Sierra Club to seek the closure of the nation's coal plants. Since 2011, about half of the 530 plants across the U.S. have been closed.",

            "article_content": "With a historically diverse Democratic field of presidential candidates, we looked at what traits voters are prioritizing in 2020. Do they want a woman? Would they prefer voting for someone white or a person of color? Would they like someone young or old? These issues can be hard to talk about and even harder to poll. People sometimes say they want one thing but choose differently. To figure out what candidate qualities actually matter to voters, we looked at what they do, not only what they say. In partnership with YouGov, we gave voters a series of match ups between hypothetical candidates for the Democratic nomination in 2020. We randomly varied several traits for each candidate: their age, race, gender, job title, social class, and home region. None of the profiles were meant to imply any real candidate in the race. We labeled them as \"Candidate A\" and \"Candidate B\" rather than use any names. In one example, Candidate A might have been a 60-year-old, black, female state attorney general, and Candidate B might have been 35-year-old, white, male U.S. representative. Voters were simply asked to choose one of the two candidates. Here's how the first match up might have looked on the screen\u2026  We then gave voters another match up and asked them to do the same. It might have looked like this\u2026  We gave each voter several match ups, randomizing traits each time. We collected thousands of decisions about all sorts of match ups. Again, all match ups were hypothetical, and no actual names were used. In the end, the analysis combines all choices made by voters and offers a look at what traits stood out in their selections. This technique, known as conjoint analysis, is used often in marketing and political science. (See technical details\u00a0here.)\u00a0  We looked at choices among voters who identify as Democrats, as well as independents who lean toward the Democratic Party, many of whom will cast ballots in a 2020 Democratic presidential primary or caucus. Here are the traits that emerged as important to these voters.  What traits are democratic voters prioritizing in 2020 candidates? Instead of just asking them, we looked at what types of candidates they *choose* in a series of hypothetical match ups. Excited to share new @CBSNews/@YouGov data on this topic, featuring conjoint analysis! (1/12) \u2014 Kabir Khanna (@kabir_here) May 2, 2019 Voters showed a clear preference for females, all else equal. When given one male and one female, voters selected the female 59 percent of the time. Men and women both preferred female candidates, but women were especially likely to pick females over males \u2013 by over 20 percentage points.  Voters picked people of color more frequently than whites, by 57 percent   to 43 percent. Voters had a slight preference for Latino candidates and a strong preference for black candidates. When match ups include a white and a black candidate, for example, voters chose the black candidate 60 percent   of the time.  There were some differences by voter race. Black voters chose black candidates over two-thirds of the time, and Latino voters had a stronger preference for Latino candidates. However, even white voters chose candidates of color more often than white candidates.  Overall, voters strongly preferred younger and middle-aged candidates to candidates in their 70s. To analyze age, we looked across all match ups to see how often certain ages were selected, regardless of who the opponent was. In this analysis, if a trait is selected more than half the time, it means that the trait increases the odds of selection.  Voters chose people in their 40s about 57 percent of the time and people in their 50s about 56 percent of the time, indicating that these age ranges are desirable, on average. People in their 60s were chosen roughly half the time. People in their 70s, on the other hand, were only picked 37 percent of the time. In these hypothetical match ups at least, there is little appetite among voters for septuagenarians. This effect was among the strongest we found. There are few differences by voters' own age \u2013 even older voters preferred younger candidates.  Going beyond demographic traits, we also tested various job titles, including elected offices at the federal and state level, as well as people in the private sector. (Elected officials included Senators, U.S. Representatives, governors, mayors, and state attorney generals.) Voters had a strong preference for elected officials, choosing them in match ups with a businessperson 63 percent   of the time.  CBS News Poll Analysis: Majority of Democrats want a candidate who will unite the country  We tested three backgrounds with respect to social class: working class, middle class, and wealthy backgrounds. Voters of all education and income levels preferred working class and middle class background to wealthy ones. Looking across all match ups, working class was chosen 59 percent   of the time, middle class 55 percent  of the time, and wealthy only 35 percent   of the time.  There were not huge differences by the candidate's home region. Voters did not differentiate much between people from the Northeast, Midwest, and West. However, voters were less likely to choose people from the South when they were pitted against people from other regions (45 percent   vs. 55 percent).  Self-identified liberals and voters who told us they were very likely to vote in a 2020 primary or caucus were especially likely to pick women and people of color. They also had a stronger distaste for businesspeople and people from wealthy backgrounds, indicating that such candidates may face a hurdle when trying to court the party's base in the primary.  While these results illuminate what traits matter to Democratic leaning voters in the abstract, an important caveat is in order. As opposed to these hypothetical profiles, real presidential candidates are more than a bundle of six traits. The have distinct policy positions, histories, and personalities. Their baggage, good and bad, will likely also matter to voters. That said, this analysis reveals a latent appetite among the Democratic rank-and-file for certain types of qualities in 2020.  This CBS News survey was conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 2,210 U.S. registered voters interviewed online between April 22-26, 2019. This sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the American Community Survey, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, as well as 2016 Presidential vote and registration status. Respondents were selected from YouGov's opt-in panel to be representative of all U.S. registered voters. Candidate traits were randomized independently of one another. Trait order was randomized across respondents and fixed within respondents.  Kabir Khanna is Deputy Director, Elections & Data Analytics at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign announced Tuesday that it has raised $25.3 million in the third quarter of 2019, the most of any 2020 Democratic presidential candidate in a quarter to date. According to the campaign, September was its single best month of fundraising in the 2020 election cycle thus far. The cash raised in the third quarter comes from 1.4 million donations. The average donation was $18.07. \"Bernie is proud to be the only candidate running to defeat Donald Trump who is 100 percent funded by grassroots donations \u2014 both in the primary and in the general,\" said Sanders' Campaign Manager Faiz Shakir in a statement. \"Media elites and professional pundits have tried repeatedly to dismiss this campaign, and yet working-class Americans keep saying loudly and clearly that they want a political revolution.\" Despite the third quarter being notoriously challenging to raise funds in, Sanders' fundraising numbers surpass his second quarter totals. In the second quarter, Sanders raised more than $18 million and also transferred $7.6 million from other accounts. His campaign says it did transfer $2.6 million in the third quarter but that is not included in the $25 million total. The campaign did not say how much cash on hand it had at the close of the quarter. According to the campaign, \"teacher\" was the most common occupation listed for a person donating to Sanders in the third quarter. The three most common employers were Starbucks, Amazon and Walmart.\u00a0 Since his campaign launched in February, it has raised $61.5 million from a total of 3.3 million individual donations. Early this month, the campaign\u00a0announced\u00a0it had received contributions from more than one million donors. And 99.9% of donors have also not maxed out on their contributions and can give again. The Sanders campaign is only the second to announce how much cash it raised in the third quarter. On Tuesday, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign announced it raised $19.1 million during the same timeframe, down from his $24.9 million field-leading cash haul in the second quarter. Buttigieg's average donation from July thought September was $32. Unlike Sanders, Buttigieg has taken a more traditional approach to fundraising, coupling grassroots donations with high-dollar efforts. According to his campaign, Buttigieg's third quarter cash haul brings his total fundraising to more than $51 million in 2019. Since its start, the campaign has received more than 1.25 million donations from a total 580,000 individual donors. That includes an estimated 182,000 new people donating in the third quarter. Buttigieg's campaign has not said much cash on hand it had at the end of September, but it had more than $22 million at the close of the second quarter in June. The campaign has been hiring more staffers in recent weeks, particularly in early states like Iowa.\u00a0 In an apparent dig at other candidates including Sanders, Buttigieg's campaign manager Mike Schmuhl pointed out he did not transfer millions of dollars into the presidential campaign from other accounts. \u00a0 \u00a0 While several other candidates are likely to announce how much they've raised in the third quarter in coming days, all presidential candidates must file their third quarter fundraising numbers with the Federal Election Commission by October 15.

            "article_content": "Despite its large population and 55 electoral votes, California is often overlooked in the general election, unless presidential candidates need to jet to the state for a quick Hollywood fundraiser. It's a firmly Democratic state, so Republican and Democratic nominees don't need to make regular campaign stops there. However, with its new primary date on Super Tuesday on March 3 and its host of delegates to be won, California is key for candidates hoping to win the Democratic nomination. This weekend, fifteen Democratic candidates are descending upon the state to campaign, with most of them also speaking at the state's Democratic convention on Saturday. Six of those candidates \u2014 Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Jay Inslee, Bernie Sanders and Beto O'Rourke -- already made a public appearance Saturday morning, at an SEIU breakfast. Harris, one of the state's senators and former attorney general, is hoping to capitalize on a home state advantage in the California primary. Her campaign announced Thursday that 33 State assembly members were endorsing her presidential candidacy, after one report observed that she does not have her home state \"locked up.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is leading in national and state polls, will not be in the Golden State on Saturday. He's campaigning in Ohio, another state which is generally ignored in the primary elections, but it is considered critical in the general election.\u00a0 Biden's strategy is to methodically win over white, working class, midwestern voters who have voted for Republicans in recent years, making Ohio a more strategic target than California. He will be speaking at a Human Rights Council dinner in Columbus Saturday. Even if one candidate wins the California primary decisively, the state has 495 delegates \u2014 enough to grant a significant amount to candidates who won lower shares of the vote. It's still a key battleground that could provide a number of delegates who come in second or third in the primary. \"There's a chance for maybe two, three, maybe even as many as four \u2014 depending on how the contest is going \u2014 candidates to collect enough delegates here to continue on,\" CBS News correspondent Ed O'Keefe said on CBSN. The primary date was previously in June, but the state moved the election to March to have more relevance in determining the eventual nominee.

            "article_content": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has entered the presidential race, rounding the number of Democratic candidates to an even two dozen.\u00a0  Mayors of the largest city in the U.S. tend not to do well on the national stage \u2014 just ask President Trump's current lawyer and failed 2008 Republican presidential candidate, Rudy Giuliani. But de Blasio is hoping that he will be able to stand out from the myriad other contenders, and not just because he is the tallest candidate in the race at 6'5\". His campaign slogan, \"Working People First,\" echoes the populist message that catapulted him to the mayoralty in 2013, when he was the clear underdog in the Democratic primary. His interracial family, which was featured in advertisements in the 2013 race, could be an asset for a white man in a race full of white men. And de Blasio does have a real, concrete progressive accomplishment implemented during his tenure: universal pre-K for all children in New York City. The question for de Blasio is not why he is entering the race, but why not, according to longtime New York political operative Hank Sheinkopf.  \"He has nothing to lose, he has potentially lots to win,\" said Sheinkopf, whose clients have included President Clinton and Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who mulled a 2020 bid. \"Lightning might strike.\"  After all, another unlikely contender from New York muscled his way through a large primary field to win his party's nomination in 2016. But Mr. Trump had universal name recognition thanks to his long-running TV show \"The Apprentice\" and his decades as a talk show guest and tabloid fixture. De Blasio, meanwhile, has struggled to establish himself as a national progressive figure.  De Blasio's message overlaps with many of his fellow candidates, including Sen. Bernie Sanders, who spoke at de Blasio's second inauguration ceremony in early 2018. Christina Greer, a Fordham University professor, also argues that de Blasio's focus on working people is similar to Joe Biden's, but is more inclusive than the former vice president's emphasis on the white working class.  Greer said that de Blasio could make inroads with white progressives in Iowa, and send his wife, Chirlane McCray, who is black, as a surrogate for his campaign in South Carolina. While there are 23 other Democratic candidates, Greer added, de Blasio is hoping he can edge out the \"15 [candidates] who are dead on arrival.\"  But aside from his numerous competitors, de Blasio also has some hurdles to overcome as he seeks the nomination. Several city agencies have been in constant turmoil during his tenure, particularly the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA).  The commissioner of NYCHA stepped down in 2018, after it was revealed that there were dangerously high levels of lead paint in public housing, which is home to more than 400,000 low-income New Yorkers. Federal prosecutors brought a lawsuit against City Hall earlier last year, accusing NYCHA officials of deliberately covering up poor conditions in city housing. It was dropped when de Blasio and the Department of Housing and Urban Development came to an agreement earlier this year to institute a federal monitor for NYCHA.  \"The housing authority and its mismanagement is a serious problem for the mayor,\" said Sheinkopf. \"It calls into question his managerial skills.\"  De Blasio may also face questions about state and federal investigations into his campaign finances during his first term, although prosecutors never pressed charges against him. The city Department of Investigation also recently concluded that de Blasio solicited contributions from people who had business pending with the city, and the matter is currently under review by the city Conflicts of Interest Board.  De Blasio has another problem: he overwhelmingly unpopular in his own city. An April Quinnipiac poll found that he had a 42 percent approval rating, and 76 percent of New York City residents did not want him to run for president. De Blasio has been widely mocked for his some of his counterintuitive habits, such as advocating for climate change while still riding in an SUV to attend his gym in Park Slope, Brooklyn, every day.  \"Some people might question, 'Why is it the people of your city despise him so much?'\" Greer said. However, de Blasio overwhelmingly won re-election in 2017, and remains popular among black New Yorkers.  \"There's this dissatisfaction with him, and still, no one ran against him,\" Greer said, meaning that no one offered a credible challenge to de Blasio in 2017. Greer said there was a \"disconnect\" with how people see him, and his electoral victories. This could lead de Blasio to believe that the criticism of his entry in the presidential race is coming from a handful of cranks, not legitimate critics.  But his struggles during his time as mayor are unlikely to be swept under the rug, in large part thanks to the famously tenacious New York City press corps.

            "article_content": "JOE BIDEN:\u00a0The former vice president's campaign\u00a0tempered expectations for victory in Iowa\u00a0on Tuesday while acknowledging the former vice president has to do a better job at attracting younger voters to his candidacy, reports\u00a0CBSN political reporter Caitlin Huey-Burns.\u00a0 The campaign said Tuesday that it expects the Democratic presidential primary to be a lengthy battle, with three or four other contenders sticking it out for the long run. \"We know it's going to be a dog fight,\" a senior campaign adviser told reporters on a conference call when asked whether the Iowa caucuses were considered a must-win contest. \"Do I think we have to win Iowa? No,\" the adviser said. \"We don't underestimate the impact\u2026but we think there are several candidates in this field, probably three or four, who will be in this for a while.\"\u00a0 While there are still five months to go before voters in Iowa weigh in on the presidential election, the Biden campaign's efforts to downplay expectations for the first-in-the-nation caucuses signal the current front-runner is taking nothing for granted and that he expects the nomination could be a long slog. The comments come as Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has been steadily gaining ground and building out one of the most robust organizations in Iowa. CORY BOOKER: The New Jersey Senator released a plan to address climate change ahead of CNN's Climate Crisis Town Hall on Wednesday night.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says the plan, which would cost $3 trillion, looks to create a 100% clean energy economy by 2045.\u00a0 The proposal also aims to rapidly end fossil fuels by eliminating fossil fuel subsidies and banning fracking. \"We are facing a dual crisis of climate change and economic inequality,\" Booker said in a statement. \"Without immediate action, we risk an incredible human toll from disasters, health impacts, rising national security threats, and trillions of dollars in economic losses.\"\u00a0 If elected, Booker said he would also push Congress to create a United States Environmental Justice Fund, which would advance environmental justice and have an annual budget of $50 billion. The United States Environmental Justice Fund would be used to improve the infrastructure of water service lines that service residential, school and daycare areas in order to prevent lead contamination. Funds would be allocated to also clean up \"orphaned\" Superfund sites. PETE BUTTIGIEG:\u00a0Over Labor Day,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0caught up with the South Bend mayor during campaign stops in Cedar Rapids, Iowa to\u00a0talk\u00a0about his time in Afghanistan, discuss the latest with the Taliban peace negotiations and learn more about his approach to foreign policy. \u00a0 Buttigieg left Kabul in September of 2014 after a seven-month deployment. The mayor said that, at the time, he figured he would be one of the last U.S. troops to Afghanistan. Five years later, however, Buttigieg is running for president while nearly 14,000 American troops remain in the country. \"We need to wrap this up quickly,\" he told CBS News about the conflict there, which has now eclipsed Vietnam as the longest war in U.S. history. \"The one thing that everybody should be able to agree on, Democrats, Republicans, the Afghan government, the Taliban, the international community, and me is that we are leaving,\" Buttigieg said. OUT WEST:\u00a0As Cory Booker\u00a0and Marianne Williamson campaign this week in Las Vegas, Bernie Sanders announced today he has\u00a0locked up another endorsement\u00a0in the state: Clark County Commissioner Tick Segerblom, who represents a diverse, mostly working class slice of southern Nevada.\u00a0 \"I had several candidates come to my house and talk to me,\" Segerblom, who had supported Sanders\u00a0as early as August 2015, tells\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin. \"I wanted to make sure my decision was right. I've seen everybody up close now, and all the candidates are great, but Bernie's the one guy who has been consistent and authentic on every issue,\" he added. This comes two months after Harris\u00a0secured the backing\u00a0of Justin Jones, another Clark County commissioner.\u00a0 IN THE SENATE:\u00a0Mike Johnston has suspended his campaign for the U.S. Senate in Colorado, according to\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ellee Watson. Johnston was one of the frontrunners in the field of 11 before former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper jumped in.\u00a0 The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has endorsed Hickenlooper and has told CBS News in a statement that Hickenlooper is the \"strongest candidate\" to beat Republican Sen. Cory Gardner. Johnston in his statement said, \"To win this Democratic primary would now require an expensive and negative campaign. That is not who I am, and no race is worth conceding victory to a brand of broken politics that I have spent my life trying to change.\" IN THE HOUSE:\u00a0Coastal counties in North Carolina's 3rd and 9th Congressional districts are expected to get hit hard by Hurricane Dorian this week, potentially disrupting their early voting already underway and Sept. 10 special elections. Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the State Board of Elections, encouraged voters on Sunday to vote early while conditions are safe. \"We do not want Dorian to put a damper on turnout for these important elections,\" she wrote in a press release.\u00a0 NC-3 covers much of the eastern coast, which is set to be hit the most from Dorian. Republican candidate Dr. Greg Murphy\u00a0announced on Facebook\u00a0that he has suspended campaign events over the next few days and advocated early voting \"as we have no idea how the storm will impact our counties and for how long.\"\u00a0 While NC-3 is considered a safely red district, NC-9 is a toss-up between Democrat Dan McCready and Republican Dan Bishop.\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports absentee/early vote results as of early Sunday morning show close turnout between Democratic, Republican and unaffiliated ballots already cast. Overall, about 24,000 ballots have been cast in NC-3 and 46,000 ballots cast in NC-9, a bit over 9% of that district's eligible turnout. Early voting is set to end on Friday, Sept. 6, right about when Dorian touches the state's coast.",

            "article_content": "At ' campaign rallies, the Vermont senator has a habit of listing the various people and groups he's tangled with over the years, such as health insurance companies and President Trump. But for many of the crowds that turn out to see him, the entity that garners the most hisses and boos is the Democratic establishment.\u00a0 In a race that's seen quite a lot of volatility in the polls, Sanders' support has remained relatively consistent. An independent who identifies as a democratic socialist, he's widely adored by the left wing of the party, which still resents the Democratic power brokers they blame for Sanders' loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primary.\u00a0 Yet Sanders remains something of an ideological outlier among Democrats despite the fact that some of his signature ideas, such as his \"Medicare for All\" plan to replace private health insurance, have become much more mainstream than they were just a few years ago. And he continues to swear off the big-money donors who are helping propel some other candidates for the Democratic nomination, such as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden. \u00a0 In an interview with CBS News, Sanders said the financing of some of his Democratic rivals' campaigns exemplifies the \"rotten\" nature of American politics. Sanders, a fierce critic of 2010 Supreme Court \"Citizens United v. FEC\" decision that allowed for individuals and corporations to give more freely to political campaigns, believes candidates who rely on big-dollar fundraisers are beholden to the interests of wealthy backers.\u00a0 \"Why would many, many billionaires be contributing to candidates if they didn't think they were getting something out of it? They're not doing it through the goodness of their hearts,\" he said. A recent\u00a0Forbes\u00a0list found that Sanders was the only candidate among the fields' top tier, which also includes Biden, Buttigieg, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, to not have a single billionaire donor. According to Sanders and his campaign, this means that the senator is the true champion of the working class, relying almost exclusively on small donors while his opponents show open hands to the open wallets of the ultra-wealthy. Biden and Buttigieg have defended themselves from these allegations and say that big donations from do not make them beholden to any donors' interests. When asked if that defense showed either naivete or a lack of honesty, Sanders was hesitant to say his opponents were lying but still expressed skepticism. \"[Accepting money from billionaires] doesn't the pass, in a sense, the lab test,\" said Sanders. The Vermont senator is never slow on the trail to contrast his fundraising style with that of his rivals. For example, he's remained an outspoken opponent of super PACs, which are groups that are allowed to raise and spend massive amounts of money to support a candidate so long as they don't coordinate with the candidate's campaign.\u00a0 Most candidates also swore off super PACs in the early days of the campaign. But when a pro-Biden super PAC emerged last month, Sanders promptly added to his stump speech a line about neither wanting, having, nor needing a super PAC. At a town hall in Ottumwa, Iowa, on Sunday, Sanders added to that line, saying that his campaign doesn't have \"bundlers\" \u2013 a term for people who help wrangle donations from mostly high-dollar donors \u2013 two days after the Buttigieg campaign released the mayor's list of bundlers. Despite his self-imposed limits on what money he's willing to accept, Sanders has reached historic fundraising heights. The campaign announced last month that they had received more than 4 million individual donations by more than a million Americans. According to the campaign, no candidate in history has reached that mark so quickly. The average contribution to Sanders is $18 and the campaign's emails to supporters have stated that their goal is to reach 5 million donations by the new year. Back on the trail, Sanders mocks his opponents, saying that he does not spend time \"in billionaires' living rooms and walk away with hundreds of thousands of dollars.\" Buttigieg recently came under scrutiny for holding fundraisers that were closed to the press. For the sake of transparency, the campaign reversed that policy last week. CBS News asked Sanders if Buttigieg having media present ensured that no nefarious deals between candidate and donor were taking place. \"No, not really,\" said Sanders, who still acknowledged allowing press into the fundraisers was a step in the right direction.\u00a0 \"I think what history tells us is that the big donors, the people who make large contributions, do get access. They get tax breaks, they get deregulated. That's the way the unfortunate system is working.\" CBS News reporter covering climate change and energy.",

Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2014 two high-profile progressives who frequently tout their strong and early support for Medicare-for-all \u2014 said their health care plans involve tax hikes, but for billionaires and large corporations. \u00a0 \"Costs will go up for billionaires and go up for corporations. For middle-class families, costs, total costs, will go down,\" Warren told the audience, though she did not directly say that these families would not see their taxes go up. \"We are the Democrats,\" says Sen.

That's what the Republicans are trying to do.\" #DemDebate https://t.co/GM9LbJo6bV pic.twitter.com/nEhWcDyLWh Sanders offered a more forceful response when pressed by CNN's Jake Tapper to explicitly say whether his proposal would require middle class Americans to pay more in taxes. The self-described democratic socialist stressed that his plan involves no deductibles and no co-pays, but that it is has been mischaracterized by Republicans and the private health care industry.\u00a0 \"Jake, your question is a Republican talking point,\" Sanders said, eliciting applause and cheers from some in the audience. \"By the way, the health care industry will be advertising tonight on this program ... they will be advertising tonight with that talking point.\" South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg did not explicitly say whether he supports a middle-class tax hike to partly pay for his health care plan, which he portrayed as a more incremental proposal that would eventually lead to the creation of a single-payer system.\u00a0 \"This is a distinction without a difference, whether you're paying the same money in the form of taxes or premiums,\" Buttigieg said. \"Look, in this country ... if you don't have health coverage, you're paying too much for care. And if you do have health coverage, you're paying too much for care.\" Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke offered the only clear-cut answer to the moderator's question: \"The answer is no. The middle class will not pay more in taxes in order to ensure that every American is guaranteed world-class health care.\" Meanwhile, the more moderate candidates \u2014 including Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan \u2014 singled out Sanders and Warren, denouncing their Medicare-for-all plans as anti-capitalist and too ambitious and saying their proposals would strip some of Americans of the health care provided by their employers.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Trump, guns and health care were the main themes struck by Kamala Harris, as she made her pitch across Iowa this week in her new campaign bus, hoping to regain some lost ground in recent polls.\u00a0A tan lab-mix named Angel stood at the middle of the stone driveway and watched as the large, black bus with giant letters spelling KA-MA-LA in bright yellow, purple and fuchsia crept past leafy green trees and shrubbery to Coyote Run Farm. The California senator popped out in Timberland boots, a blue shirt and jeans to make a lap around the farm with the owner as a wall of photojournalists bumped and stepped on one another trying to capture the 2020 candidate's every movement and utterance.\u00a0 This was day four of Harris' \"3AM Agenda\" bus tour through the Hawkeye state, and it landed her in rural Lacona, Iowa. Harris' 3AM pitch addresses the kitchen-table concerns that \"wake people up at night.\" The hundreds who came to see Harris were excited and cheered her on and she slammed President Trump's Oval Office tenure. Still, many were hesitant to throw their support to Harris, whom they view as a newcomer to the national stage, as well as to Iowa. Harris, until this bus tour had spent little time in the state, making just six stops here since she announced her presidential bid in January. Her recent five-day bus tour, which wrapped up Monday, took Harris through 16 stops and 11 counties in the first caucus state. She has faced some criticism for not prioritizing Iowa after she cancelled a late May trip to participate in a disaster aid vote in Washington.\u00a0 It was evident that Harris' campaign was determined to change previous perceptions of her in the state, and that started by complementing her ground tour with some air support. On the first day of the tour, the campaign had announced a \"six-figure\" TV and digital ad buy, the first 2020 top-tier candidate to make such an expenditure.\u00a0On the ground, Harris first hit Sioux City on the Missouri River, then made its way toward Des Moines for the Iowa State Fair before heading east to Davenport on the Mississippi River. At each stop, Harris made her 3AM pitch, talking about her middle-class tax cut, her \"Medicare-for-All\" proposal and her plan to raise teacher salaries.\u00a0 \"It was from my conversations [in Iowa] that I came up with our Teacher Pay proposal that is going to be the first in our country's history federal investment in closing the teacher pay gap,\" said Harris at a Sioux City rally.\u00a0She also dropped some new lines into her regular stump speech. At a Saturday gun forum organized after the El Paso mass shooting, Harris told the audience, to a loud applause, \"People say to me, '(Did) Donald Trump cause those-those folks to be killed?' Well no, of course he didn't pull the trigger, but he's certainly been tweetin' out the ammunition.\"\u00a0The 2020 candidate held four rallies, stopped at a Storm Lake taqueria, a Des Moines Baptist church, greeted voters at the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding and landed at the Iowa State Fair with a big endorsement from an Iowa Democratic power-couple, Bob and Sue Dvorsky. The fair included a campaign tradition \u2013 a stop at the pork chop flip where Harris told news reporters, \"I think I can also flip Republicans.\"\u00a0\u00a0The reaction to Harris varied across the state, but a few things stood out: Harris' message on guns yielded some of the largest applause lines at every event. Not everyone agreed with her health care proposal \u2013 but nearly everyone who came to see the senator was shopping around less on issues and more on one measure: Who can beat Donald Trump?\u00a0\"Her health care program, I've got a little bit a difference with that but I'm all right with that. She's just a strong, type of person that's going to take on Donald Trump really \u2013 the type of person we need. Just like all Democrats, we want somebody that will win,\" said Kirk Scheelhaase, a farmer who told CBS New he's also a Biden supporter. Scheelhaase said he was still enthusiastic about seeing Harris at her Thursday rally in Sioux City, Iowa.\u00a0In Storm Lake, a voter who brought up health care with the senator may not have gotten the answer he was looking for. \"We get our bill/statements \u2026 Medicare pays about less than half for doctors \u2013 about half for other things. I mean, they pay very small portions,\" the voter said. \"Somebody else is going to pay for all them things.\" Harris responded, \"Well, [what] part of what my plan would do is extend it so it would also cover vision, dental and hearing aids, which of course right now Medicare does not cover. But the idea is we have everybody insured.\" \u00a0At a teacher pay roundtable in Fort Dodge, CBS News asked Carol Ernst if she had settled on voting for Harris. \"No, I have not,\" said Ernst, \"I'm just looking at some of the issues for me, personally. The issues that I'm most concerned about are health care and gun legislation.\"\u00a0\u00a0About an hour south of Des Moines, neither guns nor health care were the focus for Loras College senior Jake Janson. The Coyote Run Farm intern is passionate about climate change, and he told Harris he planned to caucus for the candidate who would make climate change \"the biggest priority.\"\u00a0 \"I don't know if I want to have kids \u2014 like, it's just that scary,\" said Janson, who said he would consider Harris but for now, climate-focused Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is his first pick. Climate change had come up at an earlier event, too. Harris said at Storm Lake stop, \"The way I used to joke about it is that I care about the environment, not because I have any particular interest in hugging a tree, but I have a very strong interesting in hugging a healthy baby.\"\u00a0 In Mount Pleasant, which went for Donald Trump in 2016, a young couple left Harris' rally telling CBS News that while they feel both sides are too extreme, they think they might end up voting for Mr. Trump again. \"We need to find a middle ground on these topics,\" said the husband, who only identified himself as Leroy. The topics he was referring to were gun control and Medicare for All. Health care remains a subject of concern among voters here. In Muscatine, Harris played bingo with a few senior citizens and was scolded by one. \"Just leave our health care system alone,\" the older woman warned.\u00a0But at one of the last events \u2013 a health care roundtable in in Burlington, two voters told CBS News, they're more concerned about student loan debt \u2013 and that's why they'll be voting for Elizabeth Warren.\u00a0 \"They can't buy cars, or they can't buy homes,\" Debra Bowen said of college students saddled with debt. \"Or they can't afford to change jobs and do all sorts of things that impact the economy. They can't have the lives that we had, and so something has to be done\u2026 and what [Harris is] planning doesn't come anywhere close to helping anybody, except helping maybe public teachers.\"\u00a0\"We do have a really progressive stronghold I think here in the party,\" said Doan Shulte, who attended the Burlington event. \"A lot of Bernie people were disenfranchised when Hillary got [the nomination].\" Harris came across as \"more centrist\" to Shulte, who said she's narrowed her choices down to Harris, Warren and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\u00a0 Many of the diehard Iowa caucus goers are watching the ground game closely \u2014 who has the most staff on the ground, who's spending the most time in the state. By the time the Iowa State Fair rolled around last week, Warren's team boasted around 65 full-time, paid staff, nine offices and a team of interns. Sanders has a total of 66 paid full-time staff with ten offices and two interns in Iowa.\u00a0 Harris' campaign has confirmed she has around 50 paid, full-time staff, plus 15 fellows. She has also seven offices in the state, many of which opened on August 1. While Joe Biden built what appears to be one of the largest ground games in the state, he also started much later than some of the other campaigns. Biden has 75 paid full-time staff and plans to have at least 12 offices open by the end of the summer. \u00a0 During the bus tour, Harris attracted enthusiastic crowds of 300-400, but recent polling suggests she still has some catching up to do. An August 8 Monmouth University Poll showed Biden leading the state with 28% support, with Warren trailing at 19%. Sanders dipped to 9% and Harris came in at 11%, up from 7%. Correction: An earlier version of this story said that Harris came in at 7% in the most recent Monmouth poll.\u00a0",

Buttigieg announced early Wednesday morning that he is forming an exploratory committee to seek the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, revealing the news\u00a0on Twitter.\u00a0 In his press conference, Buttigieg emphasized his unique position as a millennial politician, noting that he was a member of the first generation that would be worse off than its parents. He also pointed out that he will be the age that President Trump is now in 2054, meaning that he understands the challenges of the future in a way that older candidates cannot. \"I'm the only one living a middle-class lifestyle, in a middle-class neighborhood, in Middle America,\" Buttigieg said, about what separated him from other candidates. Buttigieg also said that he had not formally announced that he was running for president, but was following the typical process by announcing his exploratory committee. \"We've found a terrific response, and so far from what we've seen this morning, it is only more encouraging,\" Buttigieg said. He also, however, acknowledged that he was a long shot for president. \"I get the odds, but I also believe that we can do something that no one else can do,\" he said, adding that digital and social media would allow candidates to have a wider audience than in the past. Buttigieg compared 2020 to the 2016 presidential election, saying that this campaign should be more about ideas, whereas the 2016 race was focused on Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. \"The message with her party was 'I'm with her,' which then became, 'against him.' Where I live, people said: 'What about me?'\" he said. An openly gay Democrat elected in one of the most conservative states in the U.S., Buttigieg served as a naval intelligence officer in Afghanistan. At 37 years old (he just had a birthday), he's the youngest candidate \u2014 and the first millennial \u2014 in a rapidly growing field that could see a few White House aspirants who are twice his age.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014\u00a0Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg formally announced he is running for the Democratic presidential nomination Sunday, launching a multimillion-dollar ad campaign that frames his candidacy as the best hope for defeating President Trump. Bloomberg's first minute-long\u00a0advertisement\u00a0will debut nationally on \"60 Minutes\" on Sunday evening, and appear again on NBC Sunday Night Football. It will begin airing across most Super Tuesday states Monday, according to a campaign aide. The former mayor is spending at least $34 million on the ad, which will run through December 3. Keeping with his long-standing practice, Bloomberg will self-fund his campaign and doesn't plan on accepting campaign contributions. If elected president, he would not accept a salary, according to aides. Turning down campaign contributions means he won't be eligible to appear in Democratic debates, which require candidates to obtain a certain number of donors under current party rules. \"If the DNC changes the rules and Bloomberg is eligible, obviously he will appear,\" spokesman Jason Schechter said. Bloomberg, 77, is a media mogul and former three-term mayor of New York. He has toyed with running for president as an independent or Democrat since 2008. He enters the field far back in an historically crowded field, according to\u00a0recent CBS News polling\u00a0that placed him in the single digits among Democrats from early primary states. In a letter on his revamped website\u00a0Sunday, Bloomberg wrote that the country \"cannot afford four more years of President Trump's reckless and unethical actions.\" \"He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage,\" he wrote. The ad released Sunday says Bloomberg \"could have just been the middle class kid who made good,\" but instead \"became the guy who did good.\" \"After building a business that created thousands of jobs, he took charge of a city still reeling from 9/11,\" the narrator says. \"A three-term mayor who helped bring it back from the ashes, bringing jobs and thousands of affordable housing units with it. After witnessing the terrible toll of gun violence, he helped create a movement to protect families across America and stood up to the coal lobby and this administration to protect this planet from climate change.\" The ad says he will seek to \"restore faith in the dream that defines us where the wealthy will pay more in taxes and the middle class get their fair share. Everyone without health insurance can get it, and everyone who likes theirs, keep it.\" It ends with a tagline: \"Jobs creator. Leader. Problem solver.\" Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait informed employees that the news division won't be doing any investigations of Michael Bloomberg and his family during the campaign, a courtesy it will also extend to Bloomberg's rivals in the Democratic presidential primaries. He explained in a memo Sunday that Bloomberg News \"cannot treat Mike's Democratic competitors differently from him.\" Micklethwait said that Bloomberg News would publish articles or summaries of investigative work by other \"credible journalistic institutions.\"  Should Bloomberg be chosen as the Democratic nominee, Bloomberg News will reassess how it will cover him, Micklethwait added. The editors of Bloomberg's Opinion page, which \"reflected his views,\"  David Shipley, Tim O'Brien, as well as some members of the Board responsible for the editorials will be taking a leave of absence to join Bloomberg's campaign, Micklethwait also announced.",

            "article_content": "Midway through his career as an electrician, Bob Newton watched as his yearly health care costs went up and worried if he would be able to cover the copays on his annual doctors' visits. At the advice of friends, he joined a union, IBEW Local 701 outside Chicago, and he never worried about paying for the doctor again. \"As a union electrician, I got rejected for nothing...I got into it specifically because of the health care benefits,\" Newton said. Newton, like many of the nearly 15 million union members across the country, likes the insurance he has now. And union members remain a core Democratic constituency, particularly in the Rust Belt states President Trump flipped in 2016.\u00a0 But some within the party say that embracing \"Medicare for All,\" which would eradicate most forms of private insurance, will alienate the union rank-and-file that Democrats have long counted on in pivotal states like Pennsylvania and Michigan.\u00a0 \"Unions built America's middle class. Unions will rebuild America's middle class,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren says in nearly every stump speech she gives. A former academic who has devoted much of her life to strengthening protections for working Americans, Warren has long been an outspoken supporter of unions. Her campaign is unionized, as are the campaigns of several others in the Democratic field.\u00a0 Warren is also a proponent of Medicare for All, and said at the last debate that private insurance should essentially be done away with. This worries Newton, who is concerned that it might spell the end of the supplemental insurance his union negotiated for that is coupled with his Medicare plan. Nearly two-thirds of Democratic voters in early primary states think health care should include a public and private option, not only a public one, a CBS News Battleground Tracker poll found. And some unions have been vocal in their misgivings about the Medicare for All plans pushed by candidates like Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 \"We cannot support the notion that our members, who have employer-provided, union-negotiated healthcare, should be forced to give it away in favor of a government-run program,\" said Harold Schaitberger, general president of the International Association of Firefighters (IAF). \"The elimination of employer-based insurance in favor of a Medicare-for-all proposal is bad idea that punishes working families who have been able to secure quality healthcare.\" The IAF threw its support behind former Vice President Joe Biden, a defender of private insurance, days after he announced his candidacy. Other Democratic presidential candidates, such as Sen. Michael Bennet, warn that Medicare for All could alienate unions and divide the party.\u00a0 \"Running on a plan that takes Medicare Advantage away from 20 million Americans, running on a plan that takes the healthcare plans away from every single union member in America that's negotiated for their healthcare plan just to me is not a plausible way of unifying Democrats,\" Bennet told WGBH in Boston last week.\u00a0 Two dozen interviews with union leaders, voters and scholars suggest that Newton is not alone in his misgivings about Medicare for All. At the same time, it might be a stretch to say that union members won't turn out for a candidate who wants to do away with private insurance.\u00a0 Gary Burtless, an economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who studies the future of the middle class, says that eliminating private insurance may be at odds with the interests of most union members.\u00a0 \"If you force people into one health insurance plan called Medicare, it does reduce workers voices over the specific contents of the health insurance plan,\" he said. \"Non-union workers are the most who are going to gain the most from this kind of Medicare expansion.\" But some activists say those strong private insurance plans come at a cost to unions, which might negotiate better wages for their members if health care weren't a bargaining chip. \u00a0 \"Unions hold the line better, but at the expense often of taking less wage increases,\" said Andy Stern, president emeritus of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU). Randy Bryce, an outspoken member of an ironworkers union in Wisconsin who ran as a Democratic challenger to then-Speaker of the House Paul Ryan in 2018, says the current system isn't working. He's supported Sanders since the last presidential election.\u00a0 \"The cost of health insurance is going up to the point where it's almost equal to the amount we make per hour on our check,\" he said.\u00a0 Over a half dozen local union leaders said their primary concern in this election is beating Republicans on \"Right to Work\" laws and getting Mr. Trump out of the White House. Newton agrees, saying he could even vote for Sanders or Warren if they demonstrate that they have the best chance of beating the president.\u00a0 \"There is a big philosophical question of what do people win through collective bargaining,\" Stern said, \"and what do people fight for, policy-wise, for everyone?\"\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the House.",

            "article_content": "According to financial disclosures and tax returns provided by the campaign, former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Dr. Jill Biden have earned more than $15 million since 2016. The majority of the income comes from book deals and speaking engagements, with the Bidens earning around $9.5 million in 2017, the year after Biden left office. That year, the Bidens donated more than a million dollars to charity, according to the documents. On the campaign trail, Biden regularly touts his middle-class bona fides by referring to his nickname \"Middle-Class Joe,\" a nod to his more modest upbringing in Pennsylvania and Delaware. He has centered his campaign on fighting for the middle class, even though he may now be one of the wealthiest Democrats in the presidential field.\u00a0 Since leaving office, both Bidens have worked as college professors. Jill Biden taught at Northern Virginia Community College and made more than $180,000 in two years, while her husband was named the \"Benjamin Franklin presidential practice professor\" at the University of Pennsylvania, earning more than $775,000 in two years. The couple paid a roughly 33 percent federal income tax rate in the past two filing years.\u00a0 Most of the former vice president's speaking fees were to promote his book \"Promise Me, Dad,\" but at least 17 were additional appearances. In total, this resulted in more than $4 million of income. During this time, Jill Biden pulled in more than $700,000 for speaking engagements.\u00a0 Joe Biden was paid more than $100,000 per speech at some events, organized by groups such as the Jewish Community Center of San Francisco and at universities including Long Island University, Vanderbilt University, and Brown University, among others. \u00a0 A list of charitable donations shows that a year before the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF) endorsed Biden for president in April 2019, the Bidens donated $25,000 to the IAFF Foundation and $10,000 to another fire department. A Biden spokesman indicated on Twitter after the documents' release that this donation was for the foundation's disaster relief fund. In 2017, the Bidens also gave $180,000 to the United Jewish Federation of Chicago, $120,000 to the Delaware Center for Justice, Inc., $100,000 to the Joseph Biden Foundation and $150,000 to the children's tragedy assistance foundation named for their late son, Beau Biden.

            "article_content": "Des Moines \u2014 Elizabeth Warren may technically be in the \"exploratory\" phase of a presidential campaign, but her message during her first solo swing through Iowa was clear: \"I'm in this fight.\" Throughout five campaign stops across the state, which hosts the nation's first caucuses in 2020, Warren heavily played up her biography as the Oklahoma-born daughter of a janitor who found her life's work in consumer protection and Wall Street accountability. One of the first top-tier contenders to enter what figures to be one of the most crowded fields for Democrats in some time, Warren is aiming to lay down her marker as its resident economic populist and pitch herself as the ultimate fighter for the middle class. \"Why has America's middle class been hollowed out? What is happening to opportunity in this country? Why is the path so rocky?\" she said to a crowd of around 500 people in Council Bluffs on Friday evening. \"Whatever issue brought you out here tonight,\" Warren told a crowd of 725 in Des Moines on Saturday night, \"I guarantee that it intersects with a Washington that is working for the rich and and the powerful.\" In various speeches and question-and-answer sessions, Warren described her early campaign as a fight. \"I am dead serious when I say this is the fight of our lives,\" she said at her first stop. \u00a0\"We're in this fight together,\" she told an overflow crowd. \"It's time to dream big and fight hard,\" she said, closing out another. \"What pulled me in is what is happening to working families across this country. That is the reason why I'm in the fight,\" she told reporters.  That fight, of course, also involves President Trump, whom Warren notably made a point not to name during her stops in Iowa, unless prompted by a member of the audience. But it was high in the minds of many voters who came to see Warren and who told CBS that defeating Mr. Trump next year is Priority Number One.\u00a0 \"Oh, it's the most important: get him out,\" said Cathy Sanchez, a preschool teacher and Warren supporter at an event in Council Bluffs, for example.  In many ways, Warren's trip showcased the different ways Democratic voters are going about looking for a candidate who can take on Mr. Trump. And on that front, there were mixed views on Warren's approach so far.  At an event in Sioux City, one voter questioned Warren's strategy of releasing a DNA test to prove Native American heritage. \"Why did you undergo the DNA testing and give Donald Trump more fodder to be a bully? The woman asked Warren during a question and answer sessions at the Orpheum Theater in Sioux City. Earlier in the week, days after Warren announced her exploratory committee, Mr. Trump tweeted a meme hitting her over the heritage question.  \"Yeah, well. I'm glad you asked that question,\" Warren replied. \"I am not person of color. I'm not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is difference from ancestry. Tribes, and only tribes, determine tribal citizenship. And I respect that difference.\"  \"I can't stop Donald Trump from what he's going to do. I can't stop him from hurling racial insults. I don't have any power to do that,\" Warren continued, to which another audience member shouted out, \"Yes you do!\" \"But what I can do is, I can be in this fight for all of our family,\" Warren continued. The election is \"not about my family, but about the tens of millions of families across this country who just want a level playing field.\"  While Warren has received backlash within the party for her handling of the DNA test, some other voters who came to see her in Iowa say her overall approach and message competes with the president's. \"She is not going to take any crap from Trump,\" said Denny Carney, a retiree from Des Moines. \"Hillary [Clinton], in the debates, kind of let him run over her. And I don't think she would let him do that. Trump would make a big mistake to go after her.\" Others were drawn to her economic pitch, particularly her references to a time when wages matched opportunities. \"My daddy ended up as a janitor and I got a chance to become a public school teacher, a college professor, and a U.S. Senator,\" Warren told the crowd in Des Moines. \"Today a minimum wage job will not keep a momma and a baby out of poverty. And that is wrong.\" \"It reminds us of when we were growing up,\" said Ed Slattery, a retiree from Des Moines. \"It's the Democratic Party getting back to its roots,\" said his wife Mary, a librarian. Both said they supported Bernie Sanders in the last presidential primary, and voted for Clinton in the general election. Like many of the voters who came to see Warren, the Slatterys were just starting to take a look at the Democratic field and had a ways to go before making decisions about any potential candidates. \"She's true to her word,\" a Council Bluffs resident named John (who declined to give his last name) told CBS after Warren's event there. He's most concerned about the cost of his prescription medication, which he has to pay nearly $300 for out of pocket. \"She's battle-tested, and she's like the tortoise that gets the hares,\" he said, even though he is also interested in other potential candidates like Joe Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.  But even some of those most inclined towards Warren in the primary wondered about general election electability. \"She's being portrayed in the right wing media as this wild-eyed liberal from the East Coast,\" said Bill Shackelford, a retiree from Des Moines. \"I don't know if America is ready for her yet, but I hope so,\" said Sally Carney, a Des Moines resident who plans to back the Massachusetts senator.  For her part, Warren sought to address this potential vulnerability \u2014 and implicit comparisons to Clinton's candidacy \u2014 as she introduced herself to Iowans. \"All three of my brothers still live in Oklahoma. And one of my three brothers is a Democrat,\" she said. \"We gotta stay focused on what matters to us. And what matters to us is that everybody gets a fighting chance.\"  \"It's not like I have tested this out with some focus groups, or done a bunch of polling,\" she said in Des Moines and at other stops. \"I'm in this fight because it's been the fight of my lifetime.\" Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

Here are some highlights from his answer: \"1a and 1b,\" he said, would be \"[German Chancellor] Angela Merkel, or [French President] Emmanuel Macron, who in many ways I think is emerging as a kind of successor generation leader in Central Europe. I think we need to shore that up and have that conversation.\" His second world leader would be Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. \"We need to engage with Iran,\" he said. \"Now, I wouldn't do it without some kind of sense that there was momentum, but if our respective diplomatic relationships could produce even the smallest incremental trust building measure, I think that would justify a conversation about how we could cause tensions in that region to go down, rather than up.\" Asked if that means he'd be willing to lift sanctions on Rouhani and other world leaders, he said: \"I think we could find a way if the focus of U.S. policy were to de-escalate, rather than ratchet up tension. Number 3? Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, someone who \"represents a part of the country \u2014 the world, Central America, where we have a lot at stake.\" And fourth would be Chinese President Xi Jinping. \"The China challenge is going to be one of the dominant issues for the United States in my lifetime,\" Buttigieg said, adding later that, \"I think we need to have a very frank conversation, about ways in which we will adjust the future of the relationship. And, that may include an orderly decoupling of some of our technological interdependencies.\" \"This is not just about trade. This is about technology security and stability,\" Buttigieg said.

The 2020 Democratic candidate and entrepreneur opened two new offices in the state on Sunday, following weeks of expanded hiring that included a new strategist focused on early states.\u00a0 The office openings came on the heels of a relatively good showing for Yang in the newest Des Moines Register/CNN poll. While he's only polling at 2%, he also saw a 9-point increase in an aggregate measure that takes into account voters' first and second choices, as well as candidates they're actively considering \u2014 a jump second only to Elizabeth Warren.\u00a0 At all of his events, he kept hitting on the idea that \"Iowa is magic,\" saying that voters in that state can actually make a real change in the direction of a country and calling it \"one of the few states where democracy actually works.\" In an interview with CBS News, Yang said,\"We are going to compete in Iowa and contend the whole way.\" Yang added, \"We're going to put up a record fundraising number in [the third quarter of the year], we're going to have the resources to compete everywhere in the country. \"\u00a0\u00a0 DOWN SOUTH Votes were canceled in the U.S. House of Representatives as hundreds of family members and friends assembled in Charleston to celebrate the life of Dr. Emily Clyburn, wife of House Majority Whip James \"Jim\" Clyburn. CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell says a similar gathering took place in her honor in Columbia on Sunday, where guests included Nancy Pelosi, John Lewis, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Tim Ryan.\u00a0 During Monday's service, an emotional Clyburn held back tears as he described life with his partner of 60 years. He told a story of Emily teaching him long ago the importance of bragging gently when you win and weeping softly when you lose. \"That's the reason you don't see me bragging a whole lot and I'm not gon' let you see me cry,\" said Clyburn.\u00a0 Dozens of congressional members, along with Joe Biden, Marianne Williamson and Ryan, were also in attendance. OUT WEST Pete Buttigieg and Tom Steyer will headline\u00a0a fundraiser for the Nevada State Democratic Party\u00a0on Saturday, joined by Representative Ro Khanna (campaign co-chair for Bernie Sanders), Carolyn Booker (mother of Cory Booker) and Douglas Emhoff (husband of Kamala Harris).\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says the first annual \"Keep Nevada Blue\" event comes after a banner year for the party in which they took control of the governor's mansion, the state legislature and a handful of congressional seats.\u00a0 Among those not attending will be Marianne Williamson, who was\u00a0initially slated\u00a0to speak at the Reno gathering. This comes not long after Williamson's Nevada state director\u00a0parted ways\u00a0with the author's presidential bid, citing \"new opportunities.\"\u00a0 GUN DEBATE Eight of the top presidential candidates teamed up together for the second video in the Giffords PAC's #GunSafetySeries,\u00a0notes\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ellee Watson. The video comes as President Trump is expected this week to confer with Congress about what kind of gun control legislation he would be willing to sign.\u00a0 After the mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso, Mr. Trump indicated he'd be willing to pass expanded background checks. Since then, he has backtracked and said the U.S. already has \"very, very strong background checks\" for gun purchases. WOMEN IN POLITICS On Monday, more than 450 women and men gathered in New York City to hear from the president of EMILY's List along with several lawmakers and current candidates running for office in 2020. The progressive political action committee is hoping to build off the momentum that lead to a record number of women being elected to office in 2018 as they focus on 2020.\u00a0 Maine state House Speaker Sara Gideon, who was in attendance, is seeking to unseat Sen. Susan Collins. In her pitch to potential donors, Gideon argued a vote for Collins is a vote for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Trump administration.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Theresa Greenfield, who is seeking to unseat Sen. Joni Ernst in Iowa, warned about efforts to cut social security and Medicaid, giving an early preview of what Democratic messaging will be for 2020. While Mr. Trump was brought up on several occasions, he was not the main focus for much of the event, where candidates remained focused mostly on the topics of health care and protecting the middle class.\u00a0 EMILY's List President Stephanie Stephanie Schriock told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0their goal is to be \"joyful warriors\" rather than focusing on fear. IN THE HOUSE There may be one more election in 2019. With Republican\u00a0Representative Sean Duffy\u00a0officially resigning Monday due to family health concerns, Wisconsin Democratic Governor Tony Evers announced that, if necessary, a primary for the 7th Congressional District will be held December 30, 2019. A general election is set for January 27, 2020.\u00a0 According to state law, the earliest a primary could happen would be December 24, 2019, which a governor's office spokesperson told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0was \"problematic\" because it would occur on Christmas Eve, a state holiday. There were thoughts the special election could have also been held in conjunction with the state's nonpartisan spring elections, but the spokesperson said that would've kept Duffy's district without a representative for more than six months. North Carolina's 9th Congressional District, the last high-profile special election this year, was without a representative for a bit over nine months. Down in Texas,\u00a0fresh off unveiling their plan to flip the state blue in 2020, Texas Democrats announced that Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez will be a keynote speaker at their annual Johnson-Jordan dinner in October. In a Monday press release, they said the DNC is \"planning unprecedented investments to help flip Texas,\" and a DNC spokesperson told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0a couple weeks ago that they increased their investments in the state party by 33% compared to this time in 2015.\u00a0 \"With unprecedented investment from national partners like the Democratic National Committee, this is our moment,\" said Texas Democrats' Chair Gilberto Hinojosa.\u00a0 Earlier this month, Trump Campaign Communications Director Tim Murtaugh told\u00a0Navarro\u00a0they encourage more Democratic spending in Texas. \"We've been hearing about how Texas is going to turn blue for the last 30 years. Right?\" he said. \"They can't win Texas, Donald Trump is going to win Texas. That's money they can't spend in Michigan. So, great.\"",

            "article_content": "The Democratic National Committee has asked its media partners to seek an alternative venue for the December Democratic presidential debate amid an ongoing labor dispute between the University of California and the AFSCME Local 3299.\u00a0 In October, the DNC announced PBS NewsHour and Politico would host the 6th debate on December 19th at UCLA. But on Tuesday, the AFSCME Local 3299 sent letters to six presidential campaigns, including that of Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg, notifying them of an ongoing speakers' boycott because of the University of California's \"continued role in contributing to economic and racial inequalities at the UC and across the State of California.\" The AFSCME Local 3299 accuses UC of refusing to negotiate a fair contract and outsourcing jobs to private companies that pay less, and asked candidates to refuse to attend or speak at any UC events until issues were settled. On Wednesday, the DNC confirmed with\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0that they asked partners to find another venue. The story was first reported by Huffington Post. In response to the news, the AFSCME Local 3299 released a statement saying, \"We applaud the decision by the DNC to stand with University of California workers in their fight for fair treatment from California's 3rd largest employer. And we are grateful to the candidates and other leaders who have stood with us in solidarity on our picket lines.\u00a0 Just as our next President must heal the divisions in our country, they must also work to confront the staggering inequality and mistreatment of low wage workers that have become all too common in today's economy. While a change of venue for this debate is no doubt inconvenient, it pales in comparison to the effect that the University's lawless outsourcing practices are having on thousands of families and communities across California. It is past time for UC to honor the aspirations of those who do the hard, physical work of making this institution run and not just ivory tower elites.\" Meanwhile, the DNC said it will release more info on its 6th debate as it becomes available.\u00a0 MICHAEL BENNET Senator Michael Bennet filed for the New Hampshire Primary Wednesday afternoon, appearing with a small handful of supporters. The Colorado Senator delivered a 40 minute critique of \"Medicare for All,\" raising taxes on the middle class, candidate celebrity and what he calls \"a lurch to a set of policies that are good for raising money.\" According to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga, Bennet said he remains unsurprised by early Granite State leads for Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders: \"Well, Bernie's run before. He's well known, and I respect and admire his commitment to his ideology. And Elizabeth also is, you know, the closest thing we have to celebrity candidate.\" Doubling down on his criticism of Warren, Bennet argued the Massachusetts lawmaker's healthcare proposal is \"incredibly rosy.\" \"Thirty-one trillion dollars,\" Bennet declared, fist pounding on the filing room table. \"Which is what Bernie says the bill will cost and I guarantee you he's closer to the number than Elizabeth is\u2014I guarantee it\u2014is equivalent to 70% of all the revenue that we will collect as the federal government over the next 10 years.\" Asked about Donald Trump Jr.'s tweet naming a person identified by some outlets as the alleged whistleblower, Bennet said he did not see the post, then added, \"If that's true, that's a terrible, unpatriotic act. It's despicable. There's a reason there's a whistleblower law, and that's to protect people who are standing up to power, standing up to authority. And for weeks, Donald Trump has been asking somebody to reveal who the whistleblower was. A President of the United States of either party should never do that.\"\u00a0 STEVE BULLOCK Montana Governor Steve Bullock is up on the airwaves in Iowa with two new ads, as he hopes to boost his polling numbers in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says the half million dollar ad buy will last a few weeks, and the ads will air in several Iowa markets, including Des Moines and Cedar Rapids.\u00a0 In one ad, titled \"Responsibility,\" Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller explains why he endorsed Bullock. \"As Iowans, we know our right to go first in the nation comes with a special responsibility to sort through a crowded field and caucus for a Democrat who can beat Trump,\" Miller says. \"This year, that's what matters most. And that's why I strongly support Steve Bullock for president.\" The other ad, titled \"Only,\" uses clips from news anchors reading about Bullock's record and winning in a state where President Trump beat Secretary Hillary Clinton by 20 points. In the closing of that ad, Bullock says \"I approve this message to beat Trump and be a president for all of America.\" KAMALA HARRIS CBS News campaign reporters Adam Brewster,\u00a0Musadiq Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Tim Perry\u00a0have exclusively learned that Kamala Harris' campaign is announcing an African American Steering Committee in Iowa. Harris campaign says the committee consists of leaders across the Hawkeye State tasked with working with state organizers to \"continue engaging the African American community in Iowa.\" In addition, the Harris campaign is naming Mia Mayberry as its new Iowa Deputy Political Director in charge of African American outreach. Mayberry, a native of Quad Cities, is the former Vice Chairwoman of the Rock Island County Board of Supervisors. \"We are fully committed to running a campaign that embodies the values that Senator Harris holds,\" Diedre DeJear, Harris' Iowa Campaign Chair, said in a statement released by the campaign. \"We are better as a country when more people are included and our team has made meaningful, continued engagement with communities of color a top priority throughout this race,\" DeJear added. The campaign says the committee will \"help leverage their own networks and insight to help amplify both Harris and her organizing team's efforts in the state.\" Although the latest census shows African Americans make up roughly 4% of Iowa's population, they are still a heavily sought after group among many of the Democratic candidates. Last week, CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0plans for the Harris campaign to divert resources from other early voting primary states to Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state. AMY KLOBUCHAR Filing for the New Hampshire Primary, Senator Amy Klobuchar touted yesterday's elections as a sign of President Trump's weakened influence.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says Klobuchar told press crowded in the secretary of state's office, \"This is a country of democracy. And the president is not King, and our citizens last night, made their voices no loud and clear.\" \u00a0 Speaking to the concerns of centrist Granite Staters, Klobuchar declared, \"We lost in 2016 \u2013 our party \u2013 to in the middle of the country, in a big, big way. We lost, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Iowa and Indiana. So my plan is to build a blue wall around the heartland, and make Donald Trump pay for it.\" Asked to weigh in on Joe Biden's accusation that Elizabeth Warren has an \"elitist view of policy,\" Klobuchar said, \"You know, I wouldn't use that word.\" Restating her debate stage argument, Klobuchar said that no candidate \"has monopoly on good ideas.\" Klobuchar added of Warren, \"She's put some ideas out there. I think mine are better for a bunch of reasons. And that's just how I would argue it. I would say that if you're going to make changes for people with healthcare, you actually have to be able to get it done.\" ELIZABETH WARREN Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley on Wednesday endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president, breaking from the other three members of the so-call \"squad\" of first-term congresswomen of color, all of whom endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in recent weeks.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says that Pressley, the first black congresswoman to be elected from Warren's home state of Massachusetts and as a rising star in the Democratic Party, is a valuable endorsement for Warren. But the endorsement is certain to fuel speculation that Pressley is eyeing Warren's senate seat, should the senior senator give it up for the Oval Office come January 2021.\u00a0 CALIFORNIA Rusty Hicks, the chair of the California Democratic Party, condemned Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren late\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0for electing to \"publicly snub California's Democrats\" in electing to skip the party's presidential forum later this month in Long Beach.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0notes the candidates will still be out west that weekend, however, as they are both slated to speak that\u00a0Sunday\u00a0in Las Vegas at an event hosted by Nevada Democrats.\u00a0 NEVADA At least eight total\u00a0candidates, including the four top-polling presidential hopefuls in the state \u2013 Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 have followed Juli\u00e1n Castro in denouncing a City of Las Vegas proposal as effectively \"criminalizing the homeless.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says several dozen turned out to a morning\u00a0rally\u00a0opposing the measure in front of city hall, including staff and supporters from a number of the presidential bids. The Sanders campaign on Tuesday said they emailed supporters about the\u00a0rally, urging them to \"stand in solidarity with the homeless community of Las Vegas.\" HAWKEYE BREAKDOWN A new Quinnipiac University Poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucus goers finds a four way race at the top 89 days out from the Iowa Caucuses.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Adam Brewster\u00a0say Senator Elizabeth Warren leads the pack with 20%, followed closely by Mayor Pete Buttigieg (19%), Senator Bernie Sanders (17%) and former Vice President Joe Biden (15%). Senator Amy Klobuchar followed them at 5%, and Senator Kamala Harris, who is betting big on Iowa, was at 4%.\u00a0 Representative Tulsi Gabbard, businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang were all at 3%. All of the other candidates polled at 1% or less. The poll of 698 likely Democratic caucus goers was taken from October 30 to November 5 and has a margin of error of +/- 4.5 points.\u00a0 The poll found that 46% of likely caucus-goers have made up their mind, while 52% said they may change their preference. Among the top 4 polling candidates, 61% of Sanders supporters said they made up their mind, which topped Biden (48%), Warren (44%) and Buttigieg (40%). Thirty-four percent of respondents said healthcare is their top issue when deciding who they will support, higher than any other issue. Among those who say healthcare is the top issue, 26% support Sanders, 22% support Warren, while Biden and Buttigieg were tied at 15%. \u00a0\u00a0 CENTER STAGE The New Quinnipiac Poll of Iowa Democrats gives Tulsi Gabbard the necessary polling to appear in the November Democratic presidential debate, notes\u00a0CBS News Political Unit AP Sarah Ewall-Wice. Gabbard is the 10th candidate to qualify. Presidential hopefuls needed to meet 3% polling in four national or state polls or 5% polling in two state polls as well as receive contributions from 165,000 unique donors to qualify. She will be joining Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang on the debate stage. Candidates have until November 13th to meet both qualifications. The DNC previously announced the debate hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post will take place November 20th in Georgia. Meanwhile, the poll also qualified Amy Klobuchar for the December debate, making her the 6th candidate to meet both thresholds. She will join Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren who have previously qualified for the 6th debate. Candidates have until December 12th to meet the requirements to participate. That debate will take place on December 19th. HE'S BACK CBS News Political Correspondent Ed O'Keefe\u00a0has learned former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is poised to launch a comeback bid for his old Alabama U.S. Senate seat on Thursday, according to multiple Republicans familiar with Sessions's plans. Sessions stepped down from his Senate seat at the start of the Trump administration to lead the Justice Department, a resignation that led to a tumultuous special election that resulted in Republicans losing the seat.\u00a0 If Sessions prevails in a crowded primary, he would face his successor, Sen. Doug Jones, D-Alabama, who is his party's most vulnerable incumbent given the overwhelmingly Republican nature of the Cotton State. Tomorrow, November 7, also marks an important date in the life of Jeff Sessions: It is the date, exactly one year ago, that he was forced out of his job as attorney general by President Trump. KENTUCKY GUBERNATORIAL RACE\u00a0With all precincts reported in Kentucky's gubernatorial race, Democrat Andy Beshear had over 5,000 more votes than incumbent-Republican Governor Matt Bevin. But while Beshear declared victory Tuesday night, Bevin said he wasn't conceding and today requested a re-canvass to double check how votes were tallied, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro.\u00a0\u00a0 At a press conference in Frankfurt, Bevin said that the re-canvass would occur at 9 a.m. next Thursday and that potential ballot irregularities were a reason for his request. \"We know there have been thousands of absentee ballots that were illegally counted. That is known and this again, is something that is being looked into. We know there are reports of people have been turned away, incorrectly turned away from various booths around the state. Again, things that need to be corroborated and looked into,\" Bevin said.\u00a0 He also criticized Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is overseeing the re-canvassing process, due to her father being previously convicted for illegally funneling contributions to her 2014 Senate campaign against Senator Mitch McConnell. \"This is a family and an office that has already been very corrupt, so for her to try to jump the gun on this and interject herself into this, a little suspect as well.\"\u00a0 Grimes told WKYT in Lexington that she's seen more than 20 re-canvasses, none of which led to a change in outcome. As it stands now, Beshear is governor-elect and will be inaugurated on December 10th. In a press conference today, Beshear said he was done with the race and looked forward to transitioning into office. His campaign said Wednesday they hope \"Bevin honors the results of the re-canvass, which will show he received fewer votes than Andy Beshear.\"\u00a0 The governor-elect added Wednesday, \"This isn't about politics anymore. That ended last night. This is about me being the best governor I can be for the people of Kentucky.\" Awaiting Beshear is a newly-elected Republican cabinet, including Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who is the first African American to hold that title in the state.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren on Friday pledged to \"fight to pass legislation that would complete the transition to full Medicare for All\" by her third year in office.\u00a0 \"Every serious proposal for 'Medicare for All' contemplates a significant transition period,\" Warren wrote in a first-term transition plan, followed by a series of measures she said she would take in her first 100 days of office to pave the path toward eventual health care for all Americans. The Massachusetts senator's plan says that the first bill Warren would pass is a \"comprehensive set of anti-corruption reforms which include ending lobbying as we know it and knocking back the influence of Big Pharma and insurance companies.\"\u00a0 It would be followed by a lighter version of Medicare for All, which would continue to allow Americans to stay on private health insurance for the time being. Warren refers to that bill as \"fast-track budget reconciliation legislation,\" which she wrote would expand public health care to cover all children and for families at less than twice the federal poverty level. The use of reconciliation means that it would need only a simple majority of senators to pass, rather than the usual supermajority of 60. Warren says she'll improve Medicare for everyone over 50 years of age and afford every American \"the choice to enter an improved Medicare program.\" The transition plan is likely to be regarded as something of a middle ground between plans proposed by Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. Sanders wrote the Medicare for All bill, and Warren is fond of saying on the trail that she is \"with Bernie on Medicare for All.\"\u00a0 The South Bend mayor has adopted a centrist version he calls \"Medicare for All Who Want It.\" While Warren says that Sanders' bill already includes the potential for a small private market to cover the special needs of some unions, she, too, has opened the door allowing some private market coverage. She says she would \"allow private employer coverage that reflects the outcome of a collective bargaining agreement to be grandfathered into the new system.\" But Buttigieg communications adviser Lis Smith fired back at comparisons between his plan and Warren's in a statement.\u00a0 \"Despite adopting Pete's language of 'choice,' her plan is still a 'my way or the highway' approach that would eradicate choice for millions of Americans,\" Smith said.\u00a0 Former Vice President Joe Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, argued that Warren's progressive plans could lose Democrats the general election. \"We're not going to beat Donald Trump next year with double talk on health care, and we're not going to beat him with a plan that hikes taxes on the middle-class, kicks Americans off their private insurance, and kills millions of jobs,\" Bedingfield said in a statement. Still, Warren's plan remains closest in essence to the plan favored by the party's most progressive members and introduced by Sanders. The Vermont senator, for his part, didn't name Warren, but took a thinly veiled swing at her with a tweet quoting a nurses association leader's assertion that any watering down of his plan is a mistake.\u00a0 \"We know that there are ample opportunities for politicians to compromise on Medicare for All, and we know, having worked with Senator Sanders before, that he won't compromise when people's health is at stake,\" the tweet said, quoting National Nurses United Co-President Debora Burger, along with a video of her and other NNU executives talking about Sanders' plan.

            "article_content": "Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would \"love to explain\" to Bill Gates how much he would pay under her proposed wealth tax after the world's second wealthiest person said he believed he might fork out $100 billion under the levy. Gates, who added he was \"just kidding\" after making the remark, is just one of several billionaires who have spoken out against Warren's wealth tax, which would add a 6% surcharge on fortunes above $1 billion to raise money for her \"Medicare for All\" plan. Gates is one of several billionaires who have publicly questioned Warren's plan. On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon \u2014 worth an estimated $1.6 billion \u2014\u00a0told\u00a0CNBC that the Democratic presidential candidate \"vilifies successful people.\" Billionaire investor Leon Cooperman, meanwhile, was reduced to tears while discussing the 2020 election on CNBC,\u00a0saying\u00a0he believes Warren is calling billionaires \"deadbeats.\" Bill Gates on a wealth tax:\"I've paid over $10 billion in taxes. I've paid more than anyone in taxes. If I had to pay $20 billion, it's fine.\"\"But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I'm starting to do a little math over what I have left over.\" The debate over taxation and fairness comes amid rising wealth inequality. While the U.S. tax system is supposed to be progressive, meaning that wealthier households pay a larger share of their income in taxes than the middle class and the poor, America's 400 richest families now pay a lower tax rate than people in the middle class, according to recent research from two prominent economists, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California at Berkeley. Speaking at the New York Times' Dealbook conference Wednesday, Gates expressed concern about Warren's proposed tax, although he added that he's in support of progressive taxation. \"I've paid over $10 billion in taxes. I've paid more than anyone in taxes,\" Gates said. \"But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I'm starting to do a little math over what I have left over.\" Senator Bernie Sanders, who has proposed his own wealth tax to fund social programs, jumped into the fray on Thursday, tweeting that Gates would still be a multi-billionaire even if he paid $100 billion in wealth taxes. \"We could end homelessness and provide safe drinking water to everyone in this country,\" he wrote. \"Our message: the billionaire class cannot have it all when so many have so little.\" Say Bill Gates was actually taxed $100 billion. We could end homelessness and provide safe drinking water to everyone in this country.Bill would still be a multibillionaire. Our message: the billionaire class cannot have it all when so many have so little. https://t.co/fVlxuIGygf If Gates paid a 6% tax on his wealth above $1 billion, he would pay an estimated $6.5 billion per year to the IRS on his fortune, excluding any other income and investment taxes and the 2% additional wealth tax proposed by Warren on wealth above $50 million. But Gates' fortune is managed by Cascade Investment, a holding company that invests his funds and manages his Microsoft stock. And Bloomberg's Billionaire Index estimates Gates' annual returns on those investments at 7.5% \u2014 in other words, his wealth could accumulate, albeit at a much slower rate, even if he faced a 6% wealth tax. Gates also said he wasn't sure if Warren would meet with him. \"I don't know how open-minded she is or if she'd even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money,\" he said. Warren shot back on Twitter, saying she'd be happy to sit down with him. I'm always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views. @BillGates, if we get the chance, I'd love to explain exactly how much you'd pay under my wealth tax. (I promise it's not $100 billion.) https://t.co/m6G20hDNaV \"I'm always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views,\" she wrote, tagging Gates in her tweet. \"If we get the chance, I'd love to explain exactly how much you'd pay under my wealth tax.

            "article_content": "Nancy Pelosi is supportive of the impeachment inquiry against President Trump, but she doesn't\u00a0like\u00a0the idea of impeaching a president because \"it divides us.\"\u00a0 In an interview on Bloomberg TV's \"Balance of Power,\" which aired on Friday, the Democratic house speaker said she didn't approve of the impeachment of Bill Clinton and resisted the idea of impeaching George W. Bush. In this case, though, she said she has \"no choice\" but to support the inquiry. She also said she's \"not a big fan\" of Medicare for All, the controversial health care policy being pushed by several Democrats running for president.\u00a0 Her comments aired one day after the House voted to formalize the impeachment inquiry and the same day that Senator Elizabeth Warren released her plan to pay for Medicare for All. In reference to the impeachment inquiry, she said she doesn't want to divide the country but feels \"we have no choice, we took an oath to protect and defend our democracy.\" Pelosi said Republicans, however, must \"have a higher loyalty to the president than they do to their oath of office\" because not a single one voted for the\u00a0House resolution\u00a0on Thursday that formalizes the impeachment inquiry and sets the rules for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry, which includes public hearings.\u00a0 Public support for impeachment has grown since the inquiry started, with some polls showing a majority in favor of it, but the issue is far from achieving a major consensus.\u00a0 Pelosi also said the House may broaden the inquiry's scope to include\u00a0evidence of obstruction of justice from the Mueller report. The inquiry is currently limited to Mr. Trump's July 25 call with the Ukraine president in which he pressured the foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate, and his son. It is illegal to seek election help from a foreign entity. \"What we are talking about now is taking us into a whole other class of objection to what the president has done,\" Pelosi said.\u00a0 On the topic of health care, Pelosi said she welcomes a debate on Medicare for All but believes that the plan is too expensive.\u00a0 She prefers the mantra of \"'Health Care for All Americans' because there is a comfort level that some people have with their current private insurance.\" On Friday, Warren released a plan that shows how she would pay for Medicare for All without raising taxes on the middle class. Her plan requires more than $20 trillion of federal spending and would be paid for \"with targeted spending cuts, new taxes on giant corporations and the richest 1% of Americans,\" according to the plan. Pelosi helped pass the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's signature legislation, and said she thinks \"the Affordable Care benefit is better than the Medicare benefit.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The first 10 Democrats took the stage Wednesday night in the first debate of the 2020 presidential election. The debate kicked off with Sen. Elizabeth Warren saying there needs to be \"structural change\" in the economy.\u00a0 Here are the facts behind some of the key issues that were brought up:\u00a0 Fact: The economy expanded a healthy\u00a03.1% in the first three months of the year, but the\u00a0Federal Reserve and private economists forecast growth for all of 2019 of only around 2%. Economic growth in the U.S. has been slow yet steady over the last year, boosted by healthy consumer spending and tax cuts. Dating back to 2009, the economy has grown for 10 straight years \u2014  the longest continuous expansion in more than 150 years.\u00a0 On the down side, the first quarter of 2019 may be as good as it gets for quite a while. Economists expect annual growth to cool to roughly 2% as the fiscal boost from tax cuts fade, trade tensions crimp spending and global economic growth slips. Growth could weaken even more over the next two years, according to the Fed. Meanwhile, economic measures like GDP don't capture just how many Americans are still hurting despite the lowest unemployment in half a century. A decade after the recession ended, research shows that 40% of families sometimes struggle to pay for food, housing, health care and other basic needs. Fact: Two-thirds of American taxpayers got a tax cut in 2018, although nonpartisan experts at the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute say corporations and the rich were the biggest beneficiaries of the tax cut. Middle-income workers saw a tax cut of about $20 per week, too small for most of them to notice. That may explain why about 7 of 10 taxpayers told a CBS News poll earlier this year they either saw no change or paid more in taxes because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Meanwhile, corporate taxes were cut from 35% to 21%, fueling a surge in stock buybacks last year, which topped a record $1 trillion. Fact: Wealth inequality in the U.S. today is at its highest level in 80 years, while income inequality is at the highest ever recorded. The richest 1% of the population holds 37% of the nation's wealth, according to latest available data compiled by the World Inequality Database. That's more than the wealth owned by the entire bottom 90% of the population. When it comes to income, the division is even more stark. The top 1% of Americans took in 47% of all national income in 2014, according to the database \u2014 the highest share for as long as data is available, and four times what the bottom half of Americans took in that year. Fact: Last year, 6.8% of the total taxes collected by the IRS came from corporations \u2014 the lowest level since 1960. Business income taxes in 2018 fell to their lowest level in over 50 years. The Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which slashed the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, played a big part, but the overall trend has been going on for decades. In 1960, corporations provided about one-quarter of overall tax revenue, and individuals provided just under one-half, according to IRS data. That's now flipped, with 57% of last year's tax revenue coming from people.  Fact: The federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 since 2009 \u2014 a record stretch without an increase from Congress \u2014 doesn't provide a living wage for most families, according to MIT researchers. Since the federal baseline wage last increased a decade ago, the cost of living has risen 18%, eroding the buying power of millions of low-wage workers. That $7.25 per hour wage is the equivalent of $6 an hour in today's dollars. In response, 29 states have increased their federal wage laws in recent years. But workers in 21 states are subject to the $7.25 per hour baseline wage. The current federal minimum wage does not provide a living wage for most families, according to an MIT\u00a0analysis. Fact: Health care costs are rising far faster than the cost of living, digging into American families' pocketbooks and causing half of families to cut back on medical care. The typical family with employer-based health care spent $5,547 on premiums alone in 2018, a 65% jump since 2008, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The cost of living rose 17% during the same period. Health care costs are now one of the household expenses that families worry most about affording, the KFF said. That's causing half of Americans to skip care -- like seeing a doctor or filling a prescription \u2014 because of worries about cost, the research group found. Fact: Student debt has more than doubled in the past decade, with economists finding that the loans are putting a handbrake on the U.S. economy. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are two of the presidential hopefuls who have unveiled plans for erasing the $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loans held by 44 million people. They argue that such measures will provide a stimulus to the economy by easing the financial burdens on middle-class families, allowing them to invest in new business formation, housing and education for their own children. The typical monthly student loan repayment is about $400 per month, or $4,800 per year, which economists say makes it harder for families to afford a home, car or invest in a business. They plan to finance their plans with taxes on the ultra-rich (Warren) or on stock and bond trades (Sanders). Even the CEO of the nation's largest bank, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, calls the nation's student debt burden a\u00a0\"disgrace\" that's \"hurting America.\" But how to pay for fixing the problem? \"How they go about taxing,\" Dimon said Wednesday, \"I'll leave that to the politicians to figure out.\"",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says he has \"a lot more work to do to earn\" the trust of black voters as a newcomer on the national stage. The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, spoke about how he plans to win their votes on \"CBS This Morning\" Thursday. While new polls have Buttigieg leading the field in New Hampshire and in a tight race with the top candidates in Iowa, he has polled low among black voters. The candidate said he's found that a lot of voters, particularly African Americans, sometimes feel \"taken for granted by the Democratic Party.\" \"When you show up and you're new on the scene, as opposed to having had years or even decades in Washington, you got a lot more work to do to earn that trust,\" Buttigieg said. \"When you talk in particular to African American women, who have been the backbone of the party in so many ways \u2026 there's a lot of skepticism of the new person showing up.\" Asked how he plans to increase his support in that voter block, he said he would point to things he has done in South Bend that could be done on the national level to improve people's lives.  \"For example, we've got a lot of challenges around housing right now as a country,\" he said. \"In South Bend, I directed resources to low-income and mainly minority neighborhoods to improve the quality of life there. When we look at the national picture for African Americans, we see a wealth gap and an income gap. We need economic empowerment. At home, we worked to make sure that we reduced unemployment, reduced poverty, and had a lot of show for it.\" He said that when he talks to voters, they \"want to know what's in your heart.\" \"So the biggest thing I have to convey is how my makeup, my being, my faith teaches me my responsibility to make sure that I'm lifting up those who have so often been excluded in our society and our politics,\" he said.  Buttigieg also addressed his low polling among young voters. Asked if he was out of touch with his own generation, he said, \"No, but it is certainly the case that often younger candidates tend to attract more support from older voters.\"  He said he is working to attract voters of all ages, but added, \"many of the younger voters are more attracted to, for example, the Sanders campaign definitely has more young voters.\u00a0 \"I was a big fan of Bernie Sanders when I was 18 years old,\" he said.\u00a0 Here is more of the interview with Buttigieg: Buttigieg said the impeachment process is \"of such importance that you can't think about it in terms of politics.  \"Sometimes there's a situation so grave constitutionally that you just have to let it play out and then let the chips fall where they may politically,\" he said.  But he added, when he's with voters his focus is \"preparing for an America after Trump.\" \"Because by definition, we're running not only to be the nominee capable of defeating Donald Trump but also being ready to lead the era that is coming next,\" he said.  Asked why he hasn't pledged not to take big-dollar donations, Buttigieg said he needs to be \"ready to compete\" against President Trump. \"We are getting ready for the fight of our lives. We're going up against Donald Trump and his allies, who I believe raised $125 million just in the last quarter in order to stay in power,\" he said. \"If somebody wants to contribute to my campaign, to support us in taking on Donald Trump, then we're going to need to bring everything we've got to that fight.\"  Buttigieg said he has 700,000 donors so far. \"I believe the average donation to my campaign is $32,\" he said. His campaign manager said in October that his average donation was about $40, according to The New York Times. \"Remember, every single contribution to my campaign is made public,\" Buttigieg added. \"The person who made it, what they do for a living. And this is about making sure that we are ready to compete. He said he makes \"exactly one promise\" to any donor: \"I'm going to take that contribution and use it to defeat Donald Trump.\" Responding to fellow candidate Mike Bloomberg, who said Mr. Trump would \"eat up\" the other Democratic candidates, Buttigieg shared what he thinks it will take to beat the president in 2020.\u00a0 \"First of all, it would be a good idea to have somebody who's actually from the industrial Midwest, the kinds of communities that this president appealed to. Secondly, I think it might be a good idea to have somebody who's actually from the middle class,\" he said.  Buttigieg added, \"I may be the only person on that debate stage who's not a millionaire,\" referring to the next Democratic debate on December 19 in Los Angeles. So far, six other candidates have qualified: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer, all of whom are worth at least $1 million, according to Forbes. \"I think it's really important right now to have somebody who is a little more in touch with the day-to-day lives and concerns of Americans,\" Buttigieg said. Buttigieg said he could not promise to forgive all student debt like some of his rival Democrats.  \"This is personal for me because one of the reasons why I am literally the least wealthy candidate running for president right now is that I'm married to a teacher. As a household, we've got six-figure student debt right now. So I get it,\" he said. \"But that doesn't mean I can just say we're going to make it all go away and it's all free now.\" Instead, he would make public college free for most Americans.  \"What I'm proposing is that we make college tuition free, public college, for the first 80% of Americans. If you're between that 80% and 90%, [with income] over $100,000, it will be a sliding scale. If you're fortunate enough to be in that top 10%, I still wish you well, but I think you ought to pay your own tuition. And that's just a difference I have with some of the other candidates who think that even the child of a billionaire should have their college tuition debt paid \u2014 or their college tuition paid completely by taxpayers.\" The South Bend mayor said the No. 1 qualification for a vice president is \"somebody who would have to take over the country.\" \"It's the one decision you make as a candidate that's really a presidential decision because the whole country has to live with it,\" he said.  Buttigieg added that with the VP and Cabinet roles, he believes balance and diversity are important.  \"It's one of the reasons I've committed to having a Cabinet that's at least 50% women. Not only because it's the right thing to do, but because we'll make better decisions, and I think that balance is crucial whenever you're building out a team,\" he said.\u00a0 Editor's note: We have updated the video accompanying this story to replace an incorrect graphic in the original.",

            "article_content": "The Super Tuesday primaries on March 3, 2020, have a diverse electorate and the largest single-day delegate prize on the Democratic calendar next year. They have attracted added attention lately, since former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has staked his newly launched presidential bid on these contests, instead of charting a more conventional path through Iowa and New Hampshire. This CBS News Battleground Tracker shows Bloomberg stands in fifth place across the Super Tuesday states, while it's Joe Biden, along with Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders just behind him, who continue to form the top tier there. Pete Buttigieg is in fourth at 9%, as yet unable to match the levels of support he's seen in Iowa. Another late entrant into the race, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, has yet to gain much traction at 1%. Watching this unsettled campaign elicits mixed emotions from Democrats: they're more likely to say they feel \"nervous\" than \"optimistic.\" Only 22% say they're \"excited,\" and just 18% feel \"inspired\" \u2014 this, despite saying they want a candidate who is inspiring. Four in 10 Democratic voters continue to be uneasy about their party's prospects of nominating someone who can beat President Trump next November. When asked why they are uneasy, 36% say that campaigns are just uncertain, 29% that the candidates are fighting too much among themselves, and 22% that it's not a really strong field of candidates. And beyond the candidates' own supporters \u2014 who do have confidence in them \u2014 none of the top-tier candidates are seen by a majority of Democrats as probably beating Mr. Trump. Biden does best on this measure, but even he has not convinced a majority of Democrats that he would win, beyond his own backers. So, does this leave an opening for Bloomberg to gain in these states? He does relatively better in vote share among those Democrats who think the campaign is taking the party in too liberal a direction. But those voters are heavily outnumbered: just 22% of Democrats actually think the party is becoming too liberal, while most say they like the ideological direction the party is headed. To the extent Bloomberg has support, he's primarily drawn from former Biden backers. Moderate and conservative Democrats are more inclined than liberal Democrats to like that he entered the race. At the moment, Bloomberg's wealth may be more of a hindrance than a help, especially among the more liberal wing of the party. About half \u2014 in particular, Warren and Sanders backers \u2014 believe it shows rich people can have too much influence in politics. Just over a third either say they believe his personal spending on the campaign shows his \"dedication\" to the effort or independence from big donors. Voters may not yet be familiar with him or at least with the story he's telling. While more Democrats say Bloomberg's ads are memorable compared to those of other candidates, half say they don't know about Bloomberg's past support for Democratic positions on items like gun control and climate. Half like him personally, which is far fewer than those who say they like the top-tier candidates. Bloomberg's campaign approach is politically interesting, betting that the outsize attention heaped on small, earlier states like Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina won't decide the race. About half of Democrats in Super Tuesday states say the outcome of those early states may have some impact on what they ultimately think. We asked what, in particular, voters think they can learn from the early states, and 49% say those results might tell them who the real contenders for the Democratic nomination are, while 22% say it will give insight on who might be able to win in November. Back up atop the leaderboard, Biden's standing continues to be boosted by moderate Democrats, but it also reflects differences on how the Democratic Party should approach economic issues. By two to one, Democrats would prefer the party's platform emphasize policies that favor the middle and working class more than the wealthy. Warren and Sanders do better among this group. Biden, however, has a clear edge among those who think the party should treat all classes equally. Democrats are more likely to think their taxes would go up under Warren and Sanders than under Biden. Some of the policies proposed by Warren and Sanders include raising taxes on the wealthy, and it is upper-income Democrats, more so than those with lower incomes, who believe their taxes will increase if either of these candidates become president. Biden's supporters are more likely to think Warren will raise their taxes than they do any of the other top-tier candidates. Democrats in these states are looking for a nominee who is practical over one that is idealistic. Biden leads among those who want a practical nominee, while Sanders has the edge among those who want an idealistic one. Warren gets a similar level of support among both groups.\u00a0 This CBS News survey was conducted by YouGov between December 3-11, 2019. A representative sample of 21,461 registered voters was selected in 14 states expected to hold primaries on Super Tuesday (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota,\u00a0 North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia). This sample includes 10,379 self-identi\ufb01ed Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents. This sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the American Community Survey, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, as well as 2016 presidential vote.

            "article_content": "Columbia, S.C. \u2014\u00a0Former Vice President Joe Biden rang the alarm that \"Jim Crow is sneaking back\" at a campaign rally in South Carolina, the south's first primary state that is seen as key to clinching the Democratic nomination. Biden launched his third bid for the presidency on April 25 in Pennsylvania, and crisscrossed Iowa before heading to South Carolina this weekend.\u00a0 Biden held a campaign rally Saturday in Columbia, the Palmetto State's capital and home to the University of South Carolina. Bidden added to his usual fighting-for-the-middle-class stump speech by calling for protecting voting rights and ending \"systemic racism.\" Biden cited numerous states' voting laws which he said are \"mostly directed at people of color.\" On systemic racism, Biden gave the example that if two men named \"Jamal\" and \"John\" applied for the same job, \"John\" would easily get the gig. Rally attendee Jessica Ellmore, 33, said before the rally her top issues were criminal justice reform, the maternal mortality rate and gun violence. Ellmore attended the rally because she likes Biden but does not want to pigeonhole him only as former President Obama's second-in-command.\u00a0 Biden received one of his loudest applause lines when he vowed, as he had at other rallies, to repeal the tax cuts passed by the Trump administration. Ruby Hall, who described her age as \"60-plus,\" said before the rally that repealing the tax cuts was one of top issues because she paid an extra $500 this year and attributes this to the tax cuts. Hall clapped and found a Biden sign to wave when she heard Biden's promise to repeal. During the 2018 midterms, Biden stumped for other Democratic candidates across the state, boosting his popularity. \"I think he enjoys favorability, likeability, and favorability through the party,\" Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist based in South Carolina and a CBSN contributor said. \"It was pretty evident in the 2018 midterms that he was one of the most \u2014 if not the most \u2014 requested surrogates for Democrats up and down the ballot, across the country.\" After the rally, the former vice president attended a \"finance event\" organized by State Sen. Richard \"Dick\" Harpootlian, who told CBS News the gathering would be a \"well-appointed, well-attended event.\" He talked with donors about what he expects during the campaign from President Trump, whose presidency Biden has framed as a threat to the character of the country. Since Biden announced his candidacy, Mr. Trump has been poking at Biden over Twitter as \"Sleepy Joe.\" \"There's so many nicknames I'm inclined to give this guy,\" Biden said, to laughter. \"You can just start with 'clown.'\"\u00a0 \"On every single issue and on every demeaning thing he says about other people, I have no problem responding directly,\" Biden said. \"What I'm not going to do is get into what he wants me to do. He wants this to be a mud wrestling match.\"\u00a0 Before the campaign, he did say something about the president he now regrets --\u00a0 that if he were in high school he would have taken Trump around back and \"beat the hell out of him.\" \"Well guess what, I probably shouldn't have done that,\" Biden said Saturday, \"I don't want to get it down to that level. The presidency is an office that requires some dignity.\" Biden also alluded to having had private conversations with the president. \"I let him understand what I think about him,\" he said. And as he touted his foreign policy credentials, comparing himself to former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and noting that he has met \"virtually every major world leader,\" Biden also said that since Mr. Trump has been president, \"at least 14 heads of state [have contacted] me -- including very, very conservative heads of state.\" The host of the fundraiser said it's Biden's pragmatism that makes him the right candidate for next year's election. \"We have issues like Medicare for All and the Green [New] Deal and they are great ideas and I think Joe Biden will support the general sense of all of these things,\" Harpootlian told CBS News. \"However, somebody is going to have to beat Donald Trump to make these things happen.\" \"We have a president who looks straight to the camera and lies and makes things up,\" Harpootlian added. \"So you need somebody who is adept at responding to that. Nail him down.\" Harpootlian said he has already raised \"a bunch\" of money for Biden but would not cite a specific amount. Biden's connections to South Carolina go back years and are bipartisan, as seen with his eulogy for long-time\u00a0Democratic South Carolina Sen. Ernest F. \"Fritz\" Hollings\u00a0in April and his eulogy for Republican\u00a0Sen. Strom Thurmond in 2003. The former vice president has thrown his support behind a national $15 hourly minimum wage and greater healthcare coverage by presenting options for Americans to opt into a \"public option\" health plan through either Medicare or Medicaid. According to a jobs report released Friday, the U.S. has an unemployment rate of 3.6 percent, the lowest in 49 years. Bo Erickson is a reporter covering the White House for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidates sparred over health care at the Iowa Democratic Party's annual Liberty and Justice Celebration, a big event for Democrats and supporters that filled a basketball arena in downtown Des Moines. The fundraiser marked the beginning of the final three-month stretch leading up to the Iowa caucus, and was an opportunity for top-tier candidates to see their campaigns launch like Barack Obama's did in 2008. The event came after Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled her much-anticipated proposal to pay for Medicare for All earlier on Friday. She claims she can fund the plan without raising taxes on middle-class Americans \"by one penny.\" After accusing Warren of \"mathematical gymnastics\" in a campaign email on Friday, former Vice President Joe Biden did not address Warren's plan directly in his speech Friday evening, although he took a swipe at her and Senator Bernie Sanders by saying his health care plan would not take \"four years or five years or ten years to happen.\" \"There will be no increases in taxes for the middle class. None. None. None,\" Biden said about paying for health care reform, in an oblique reference to Warren and Sanders. Biden has emphasized the need to build upon and preserve the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law by President Obama while he was vice president. Warren responded with an indirect swipe at Biden, saying in her speech that \"it's easy to give up on a big idea, but when we give up on a big idea, we give up on the people whose lives would be touched by that big idea.\" \"Anyone who comes on this stage and tells you to dream small and give up early is not going to lead our party to victory,\" Warren said. Meanwhile, Sanders \u2014 the architect of a Medicare for All proposal in Congress \u2014 promised supporters at the event: \"We will pass, whether the insurance companies like it or not, Medicare for All.\" Senator Kamala Harris struck a balance by promising Medicare for All with the option to keep private insurance. \"I am running for president to make sure there is Medicare for All to bring down costs, and to ensure that you also get choice,\" Harris said. A New York Times/Siena College poll published on Friday showed Warren leading in Iowa in a tight race, with Sanders, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Biden close behind. However, the margin of error in the poll was plus or minus 4.7%, meaning that the top three candidates \u2014 Warren, Sanders, and Buttigieg \u2014 are virtually tied. Although her frontrunner position in Iowa may be tenuous, enthusiasm for Warren could be seen at the event on Friday. CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns reported that the section of the stadium seating Warren supporters unfurled a banner during her speech, saying: \"Win with Warren.\" As Warren speaks, her section unravels this sign: pic.twitter.com/n35LxIG25P Musadiq Bidar contributed to this report.

It's not the first poll to show Warren leading \u2014 Quinnipiac also showed her leading by a few points earlier this month before the most recent debate \u2014 and a CNN poll released Wednesday that showed Biden leading the Democratic field with the widest margin in months. CNN's poll had Biden clocking in at 34%, compared to Warren at 19%. But the Quinnipiac poll is still sure to stir talk of Warren's potential strength and Biden's potential weakness in the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses. Respondents in Quinnipiac's poll still believe Biden has the best chance of defeating President Trump in the general election. The Quinnipiac poll\u00a0also has Senator Bernie Sanders at 15%, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 10%, Senator Kamala Harris at 5%, and Senator Amy Klobuchar at 3%, with no other Democrat topping 1%. Quinnipiac polled 1,587 self-identified registered voters from October 17 to October 21. Warren and Biden will face off again in the next Democratic debate November 20. Warren is expected to soon outline how she'd pay for \"Medicare for All.\" She previously stumbled over questions and faced criticisms from her competitors about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to pay for the single-payer plan.

            "article_content": "After the fourth Democratic debate, at least a few of the presidential candidates received financial validation. Senator Amy Klobuchar, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Bernie Sanders' campaigns are all reporting significant fundraising boosts for the 24-hour period following the primetime event in Ohio on Tuesday. During that time, Klobuchar raised $1.1 million in donations, which amounts to nearly 25% of what she raised from July through September, according to her campaign. It was not only her campaign's best day in online fundraising to date, her team also gained more new supporters than on any other day. This comes after Klobuchar took aim at one of the current Democratic frontrunners, Senator Elizabeth Warren, for evading 'yes' or 'no' questions on whether taxes would go up for the middle class under Medicare for All, which Warren supports. \"At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's gonna pay for this, and that taxes are gonna go up, and I'm sorry Elizabeth, you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're gonna send the invoice,\" Klobuchar said during the debate. The Minnesota senator also went after Warren over her proposal to tax the wealthy's assets. \"I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth,\" Klobuchar said, \"because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire (Tom Steyer) wants to protect billionaires. We just have different approaches.\" Buttigieg was more aggressive on Tuesday than he had been in previous debates. And it seems to have paid off. His senior adviser, Lis Smith, tweeted that his campaign received more than $1 million from \"tens of thousands of donors\" and saw more traffic to their website in the past 24 hours than any other day. Like Klobuchar, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor went after Warren over Medicare for All and any associated tax increases during the debate. \"We heard it tonight, a 'yes' or 'no' question that didn't get a 'yes' or 'no' answer,\" he said after she was asked about her support for the health care plan. Buttigieg also got into heated exchanges with Beto O'Rourke over the former Texas congressman's call for mandatory gun buybacks. \"I don't need lessons from you on courage \u2014 political or personal,\" Buttigieg said to O'Rourke over gun legislation. \"Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done.\" Buttigieg also went head-to-head with Representative Tulsi Gabbard over foreign policy. Both are military veterans, but Buttigieg told Gabbard she was \"dead wrong\" for previously supporting U.S. troop withdrawals from Syria. Tuesday's debate was Sanders' first public appearance since he had a heart attack earlier this month. The Vermont senator said he was \"feeling great\" on stage, and his brief absence from the campaign trail hasn't hurt his fundraising lead. After the debate, his campaign announced that it raised $620,000 from more than 40,000 contributions. Sanders leads all Democratic candidates in fundraising, with more than $33 million cash on hand as of September 30. He also had the best quarter of any 2020 presidential candidate this cycle, raking in nearly $25.3 million dollars from July through September. By CBS News' count, Sanders and Buttigieg have both already qualified for the next debate on November 20 in Georgia. Klobuchar has so far met the fundraising threshold but not the polling one. Candidates have until November 13 to meet both. CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

Rand Paul on Thursday defended President Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine President asking Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, declining to say whether such a request was wrong.\u00a0 The senator gave his comments as the White House has said it will not comply with\u00a0the House's impeachment probe.\u00a0 Paul, appearing on \"CBS This Morning,\" declined to give a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer when asked in various ways whether Mr. Trump was in the wrong to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival. The senator instead said the American people want everyone to be treated fairly and that Mr. Trump simply has a more \"direct\" way of making requests.\u00a0 \"Is it wrong, or isn't it?\" asked \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Anthony Mason, of the president's request to investigate the Bidens.\u00a0 \"Well the \u2014 no I think it's not incorrect or wrong to,\" Paul responded. \"It's OK for the president to be\u2014\" Mason questioned.\u00a0 \"Well, no, let me finish,\" Paul said. \"What I would say is that aid that we give to other countries should be contingent upon behavior.

Well I don't know, ask the American people if they think $50,000\u2014\" Paul said.\u00a0 \"I'm asking you, you're a senator,\" Mason said.\u00a0 \"Well I know, but ask the American people do you think $50,000 a month that Hunter Biden was getting might have been corrupt?\" Paul said.\u00a0 \"You were running for president in 2016, would you have done this if you were elected?\" co-host Tony Dokoupil said.\u00a0 \"I think everybody has different ways that they would approach things,\" Paul said.\u00a0 \"You sir, you,\" Dokoupil said.\u00a0 \"Well the thing is, now we're getting down to whether or not it's personality and how he interacted in a phone call. Do you impeach people because he has a more direct way of approaching?\" Paul said.\u00a0 \"It's not a question of impeachment. It's a question of, is it right or wrong to ask a foreign leader to ask in an election? With, by the way nearly $400 million in aid hanging over his head?\" Mason said.\u00a0 \"I guess the thing is, would you say we can't investigate corruption if they happen to be a political figure?\" Paul said.\u00a0 Paul also defended the president's decision to pull troops from northern Syria, a move that Mr. Trump's critics and even many of his staunchest supporters say endangers Kurdish allies and threatens to undo progress in the battle against ISIS.\u00a0 Paul said the president from the beginning said the goal was to defeat ISIS, and Paul thinks the U.S. has achieved that goal. Paul said the U.S. may have even encouraged peace talks between the Kurds and Turkey.\u00a0 \"What kind of war do you go to with 50 soldiers?\" Paul said, suggesting the number of troops the U.S. was keeping in the region could do little good.\u00a0 \"I think it's a smart thing to do,\" Paul added of the president's decision.\u00a0 Paul said he has not spoken with Mr. Trump since the president announced the troop withdrawal.\u00a0 Paul has authored a book, \"The Case Against Socialism,\" in which he argues an expanded welfare state will cripple the economy built on capitalism. The working class and middle-class bear a lot of the weight in other countries. \"The big lie you're getting from the left in our country is oh, the rich people pay for it,\" he said.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Income inequality is worsening across the U.S. even as the economy extends the longest expansion in the country's history. New data from the U.S. Census Bureau show that the gulf between the highest earners and everyone else is the widest it's been in at least 50 years.\u00a0 For decades, income growth among higher-earning families in the U.S. has far outpaced that of lower-income households, prompting proposals from some lawmakers to increase taxes on the ultra-rich. The economy has grown for 123 straight months, or just over 10 years. That tops the previous record expansion that lasted from March 1991 to March 2001, according to Natixis.\u00a0 \"When you have a system where inequality is rising \u2013 and where some groups are perpetually overrepresented at the bottom of the income and wealth distribution, even when they follow the standard prescription for realizing the American Dream \u2013 it's a recipe for a politically and socially divided nation,\" said Cornell sociology professor Kim Weeden, director of the school's Center for the Study of Inequality.\u00a0 The Census annually tracks income inequality using a standard measure known as the Gini coefficient (The number ranges from 0, which indicates that a nation's income is equally distributed, to a maximum of 1, meaning a single person collects the entirety of country's income.) In 2018, America's Gini coefficient rose to 0.485 \u2014 that is \"significantly higher\" than its score the previous year, according to the bureau. Weeden added that the latest Census data don't tell the whole story, noting that wealth \u2014 which factors in assets like the value of a home or stock holdings \u2014 is even more uneven in the U.S. than income, which for most people comes from their wages and salaries. \"Many of the major economic decisions that middle-class Americans make \u2013 whether it's to start a new business or to purchase a home in a neighborhood with well-resourced schools for their children \u2013 are more closely tied to wealth than to income,\" she said. Around the U.S., income inequality is significantly higher in five states, the Census data show: California, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana and New York. That gap has been especially visible in places like California and New York, with their sprinklings of tech and Wall Street billionaires, respectively, as well as large populations of poor and homeless people. But inequality is also taking root in other parts of the country. Louisiana, for one, has a Gini coefficient of 0.494, making it more unequal than dozens of other states. The reason: The incomes of Louisiana's richest families have grown far more quickly than than incomes for the poorest, previous research has found.\u00a0 Nine states saw a widening of income inequality last year, the Census said: Some critics contend that the new U.S. tax code, signed into law by President Donald Trump at the end of 2017, is exacerbating the problem because the lion's share of the tax breaks go to the wealthy.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are both campaigning for the 2020 presidential election, have rolled out separate wealth tax proposals. While they vary on the details, they both propose raising taxes on the assets of the ultra-rich and using the additional revenue to fund social programs such as education and health care.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg wraps up a campaign bus road trip Tuesday in Iowa that has been focused on touting his \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" policy across the caucus state. Buttigieg is hoping his more moderate version of \"Medicare for All\" will differentiate himself from the pack of nearly 20 presidential candidates, telling CBS News' Ed O'Keefe in an exclusive interview that he's hoping to woo undecided Iowa voters through an aggressive ground game. \"You're going to see, in addition to the national conversations that I'm having in places like the Democratic candidate debates, you're going to see me on the ground, here in Iowa, directly making the case to voters,\" Buttigieg told CBS.  Only one in five likely Democratic Iowa caucus-goers has made up their mind about who to support in the 2020 presidential race. Buttigieg, the 37-year old Afghanistan war vet, Rhodes scholar and small city mayor who is also openly gay, contends that Americans are looking for a different kind of leader than the current commander-in-chief.   \"I think people are not only looking not only for a set of policies but for a kind of leader that is going to lead us in a very, very different place than this current president is. And this is my opportunity to show, as well as tell, what kind of leader I would be for the American people,\" he said. While nine of ten Democratic voters say health care is \"very important\" in early contest states according to new CBS News polling, Buttigieg says his plan to make Medicare available for every American is a \"better option\" than his opponents.  \"'Medicare for All Who Want It' means we take a version of Medicare and we make it available for every American. I believe that this will be a better option than any of the private plans out there. I also believe Americans ought to be able to decide for themselves,\" Buttigieg explained.  He added, \"I think that it's going to lead toward everybody, or almost everybody opting into that public plan, but you're not required to. So the important thing to me is not whether or not the government's the main insurer. The important thing to me is that everybody get care.\" Asked if the Buttigieg plan would mean a tax increase for middle class Americans, the Democrat said the health care plan would be funded by raising taxes for the top 2 percent of earners. He conceded, however, that the nation's tax code needs to be fairer.  \"There are corporations and very wealthy Americans who should be paying their fair share, and we're going to adjust that, not just in order to fund our healthcare plan, but in order to fund the needs of this country. It's not punitive. It's not unreasonable, it's just what we need in order to make sure that we can move forward as a country,\" he said.  While Buttigieg is still ranked among the top-tier candidates, landing fourth in the latest Iowa polling, the gravity of running such an historic campaign is not lost on the candidate. Buttigieg says that the nation is \"definitely ready\" for Chasten, his husband of just over a year, to become \"First Gentleman.\" Ed O'Keefe is a senior White House and political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

According to a criminal complaint filed in the U.S. District Court of Kansas, the Army solider spoke with an undercover FBI agent on the Telegram messenger app, where he relayed instructions on how to make \"a Middle East style bomb.\" Jarrett William Smith, a 24-year old private first class infantry soldier stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas, was charged with one count of distributing information related to explosives and weapons of mass destruction. Smith joined the Army on June 12, 2017 and was transferred to Fort Riley on July 8, 2019.\u00a0 Prosecutors allege Smith discussed his plan to kill far-left-leaning \"antifa\" activists and described how to build a bomb that could be triggered by calling a cellphone. Smith reportedly said on Facebook that he wanted to travel to Ukraine to fight with a paramilitary group known as Azov Battalion. Smith also suggested targeting a major news network with a car bomb, though the news network was not identified in the complaint. Smith appeared to be targeting former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke\u00a0as well, according to prosecutors. O'Rourke is currently running for president in the 2020 presidential election. \"You got anyone down in Texas that would be a good fit for fire, destruction and death?\" the undercover FBI agent allegedly asked Smith. \"Outside of Beto? I don't know enough people that would be relevant enough to cause a change if they died,\" Smith said allegedly. In a statement to CBS News, O'Rourke's national press secretary thanked the FBI for its diligence: \"We take any threat like this very seriously,\" Aleigha Cavalier said. \"And our team is in direct contact with the FBI regarding this case. This isn't about any one person or one campaign and we won't let this scare us or cause us to back down in fighting for what's right.\" Smith was arrested Saturday. In an interview before his arrest, Smith told investigators he knew how to make improvised explosive devices and routinely provided instruction on building them. He stated he did this to cause \"chaos.\" Smith could face up to to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 if he is convicted.

            "article_content": "Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren officially launched her presidential campaign Saturday morning, over a month after she announced an exploratory committee to test the viability of a bid for the White House. The rally for Warren's announcement took place in Lawrence, Massachusetts, the site of a 1912 strike by textile workers, making it a symbolic location to launch a campaign largely focused on economic inequality.\u00a0 Warren was introduced by a few members of Congress who also endorsed her, including Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Joe Kennedy III, who was a student of Warren when she was a professor at Harvard University. Warren introduced her campaign by telling the story of Lawrence, where laborers -- many of whom were immigrants -- toiled under terrible working conditions. She framed the 1912 walkout by women textile workers as a blueprint for her campaign, one focused on economic inequality. \"These workers \u2013 led by women \u2013 didn't have much. Not even a common language. Nevertheless, they persisted,\" she said about the strike, using one of her iconic campaign phrases to applause. \"Hard-working people are up against a small group that holds far too much power, not just in our economy, but also in our democracy. Like the women of Lawrence, we are here to say enough is enough!\" Warren said. She said that President Trump was a \"symptom of what's gone wrong in America,\" meaning a \"rigged system that props up the rich and the powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else.\" \"This is the fight of our lives. The fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone. I am in that fight all the way,\" Warren said. \"And that is why I stand here today: to declare that I am a candidate for President of the United States of America.\" Warren incorporated systemic racial inequality into her message of fighting economic inequality, saying that \"race matters\" when discussing issues such as housing prices and criminal justice. \"We can't be blind to the fact that the rules in our country have been rigged against other people for a long time \u2013 women, LGBTQ Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, immigrants, people with disabilities \u2013 and we need to call it out,\" she said. \"The rules of our economy have gotten rigged so far in favor of the rich and powerful that everyone else is at risk of being left behind.\" She said that her three priorities were to end corruption in Washington, change the rules in our economy and strengthen democracy by enacting voting rights laws. She also discussed top progressive issues like her support for Medicare-for-All and combating climate change, and promised not to receive donations from super PACs or federal lobbyists, challenging every other candidate to do so as well. \"I will never give up on you and your future. I will never give up on your children and their future. I am in this fight all the way,\" Warren said at the end of the speech. \"It's a long way to election day. But our fight starts here. And it starts with you.\" She left the stage to the Aretha Franklin song \"Respect.\" Warren's nascent campaign has been plagued with controversy over a DNA test she took in the fall to show that she has some Native American heritage. President Trump has often taunted Warren, dubbing her \"Pocahontas\" to mock her heritage claims. To announce the results of the DNA test, Warren used a campaign-style video that tried to directly address questions about her background. The Cherokee Nation\u00a0criticized Warren's announcement\u00a0last year, saying her use of a DNA test is \"useless\" for determining tribal citizenship and that using DNA analysis to determine connection to any tribal nation is \"inappropriate and wrong.\" Warren apologized to leaders of the Cherokee Nation earlier this month. Warren also apologized Wednesday afternoon for claiming she was of \"American Indian\" origin in a Texas Bar registration card from 1986. Warren said she wrote that based on stories her family told about their heritage. The Trump campaign released a statement about Warren's candidacy on Saturday, calling her a \"fraud.\" \"The American people will reject her dishonest campaign and socialist ideas like the Green New Deal, that will raise taxes, kill jobs and crush America's middle-class,\" Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement. \"Only under President Trump's leadership will America continue to grow safer, secure and more prosperous.\" \"I am sorry that I extended confusion about tribal citizenship and tribal sovereignty and for harm caused I am also sorry for not being more mindful of this decades ago tribes and only tribes determine tribal citizenship,\" Warren told reporters. While Warren represents Massachusetts, she was born and raised in Oklahoma, attended college in New Jersey, and taught at law schools in Texas and Pennsylvania before teaching at Harvard. She is a staunch consumer advocate who played a key role in the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau during the Obama administration. Warren was the third senator to officially launch her campaign, after Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has also announced an exploratory committee. Senators Bernie Sanders, Sherrod Brown and Amy Klobuchar are also publicly mulling presidential bids.\u00a0 \u00a0 Ed O'Keefe and Jack Turman contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate who narrowly lost the race for Georgia governor in 2018, will deliver the Democrats' rebuttal to President Trump's State of the Union address on Feb. 5, according to two sources familiar with the decision. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked Abrams to deliver the rebuttal three weeks ago. Party officials familiar with the plans say that Abrams will make the address Tuesday night from her hometown of Atlanta. \"She is just a great spokesperson. She's an incredible leader. She has led the charge for voting rights which is at the root of just about everything else,\" Schumer said. \"And she really has, if you look at her background, she knows what middle class people, working class people go through.\" Abrams wrote on Twitter Tuesday afternoon: \"At a moment when our nation needs to hear from leaders who can unite for a common purpose, I am honored to be delivering the Democratic State of the Union response.\" Abrams, the former minority leader of the Georgia state House of Representatives, was defeated by Republican Brian Kemp in November, after prevailing in a close primary in part because she opted to focus on drawing out like-minded liberal voters instead of attempting to broaden her appeal to swing voters. The strategy was an outgrowth of her work with the New Georgia Project, an officially nonpartisan organization she helped establish that registered tens of thousands of mostly minority voters across the state beginning during the 2014 election cycle. She initially did not concede the race to Kemp, due to concerns over voting irregularities, but acknowledged that Kemp had won later in the month. \"This speech is not a concession, because concession means to acknowledge an action is right, true, or proper,\" Abrams said at the time, but she added that the \"law offers no possible remedy.\" \"I don't want to hold public office if I need to scheme my way into the post,\" Abrams added, on why she would not bring forward a legal challenge. If she had won, Abrams would have been the first black female governor in the country. She remains a popular politician among Democrats, and a leader on the grassroots left. In late November, the Abrams-backed group Fair Fight Action filed a federal lawsuit challenging the way Georgia's elections are run. Since losing her gubernatorial bid, Abrams has said she is open to running for political office again. In recent days, she was spotted in Washington lunching with California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, and met with other party leaders about a potential 2020 U.S. Senate bid against GOP Sen. David Perdue, of Georgia, one of President Trump's closest allies on Capitol Hill. The response is a tradition undertaken by a representative of the president's opposing party, who gives a speech immediately after the State of the Union to rebut claims made in his address. The first rebuttal was delivered by Republican Sen. Everett Dirksen and Rep. Gerald Ford in response to President Lyndon B. Johnson's 1966 State of the Union. Since 2011, there have been responses in English and one in Spanish given by a separate speaker. The address has usually been given by a member of Congress or a sitting governor, making Abrams an intriguing choice given that she doesn't currently hold a political office. Only one other time has an elected official not holding statewide or federal office given their party's response: Elizabeth Guzman, a Democratic member of the Virginia House of Delegates, delivered the Spanish-language response for Democrats in 2018. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra will give the Spanish address this year. Ed O'Keefe is a senior White House and political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Grand Rapids, Mich.\u00a0\u2014 Eirran Betka-Pope was on her lunch break when she spotted hundreds of Donald Trump supporters protesting outside the office of Rep. Justin Amash, the first Republican on Capitol Hill to say Congress should begin impeachment proceedings against the president. The protesters, who stood on the sidewalk with \"Squash Amash\" signs, saw his comments as the ultimate betrayal of a president they adore. But for Betka-Pope, a Trump critic, Amash's actions were commendable \u2014 and worthy of a counterprotest. The 32-year-old from Grand Rapids, who works in theater and sketch comedy, put on a Trump mask she happened to have in her car and joined the crowd on the sidewalk. She held up a piece of paper that read \"I suck.\" For the next half-hour, Betka-Pope stood silently as some people insulted her. A few passing drivers honked in support. More than one person flashed a middle finger. Betka-Pope happily took the abuse for the congressman. But the one thing the Democrat says she won't do to show her appreciation for Amash is vote for him. \"There are other candidates more aligned with my values,\" she said. Amash's is another cautionary tale for GOP lawmakers who consider opposing Mr. Trump, whose job approval rating among Republicans has hovered around 90% for the past year, according to Gallup. Those who stand against him quickly find it is a lonely place to be and may spell the end of their political career. In the era of tribal politics, the worst thing to be may be a politician without a tribe. The biggest winners to come out of Amash's big stand may be Democrats.\u00a0Amash ultimately left the GOP and is running for his seat as an independent. He is flirting with running for president as a Libertarian, a threat that could wound Mr. Trump one more time. More than 200,000 Michigan voters supported a third-party candidate in 2016, when Mr. Trump won the state by just over 10,000 votes. If Amash goes that route, he could help a Democrat win, just as he could if he stays in the race for the Grand Rapids-area House race. His exodus from the GOP has set up a three-way race that could divide right-leaning voters and help the Democratic nominee win what was once a GOP stronghold. Democrats now see it as one of their best chances to pick up a House seat next year. \"I think this was a district everybody was eyeing when we thought we'd be running against one Republican,\" said Brian Stryker, a Democratic pollster who's working for Hillary Scholten, a Democrat seeking the nomination. \"It's better to have two Republicans on the ballot.\" Once a bedrock of Republicanism in the state, Kent County has become more Democratic as Grand Rapids and its suburbs have grown diverse and better educated in recent years, thanks to growth in several universities and the medical sector. The boyhood home of Gerald Ford and hometown of\u00a0Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u00a0now looks a lot like the politically divided suburban districts Democrats flipped in 2018 to win control of the House. Democrats and Republicans\u00a0vying for the seat\u00a0are both raising money easily, with two Democrats on pace to surpass Amash and one Republican already doing so. In a cruel twist for the congressman, Democrats say they're poised to hammer Amash for the times he voted with his former party, such as his support for a House bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. Amash, the son of Arab Christian immigrants from Palestine and Syria, has always charted his own path. As a young state lawmaker he earned the nickname \"Mr. No,\" holding a hard line against government spending and what he viewed as overreach. He came to Congress in 2010 with the class of small government, tea party Republicans. He quickly stood out as an ideological purist, even in a class of professed purists. His willingness to buck GOP leaders earned him his first primary challenge in 2014 from a Republican businessman with establishment backing angry that Amash voted against a GOP budget that included a business tax cut. But Amash survived by digging in, holding regular town halls and explaining every vote he took on his Facebook page. He went on to win the general election by 20 percentage points. Amash won easily again in 2016, even as he criticized Mr. Trump for caring more about accumulating power than following the constitution. Since then Trump appears to have only firmed up support with Republican voters, while more Democrats moved in. Amash's independence looked more like a liability than an asset. Anna Timmer, a former Amash supporter who volunteered for his first congressional campaign in 2010, said voters like herself were willing to overlook his opposition to Trump then because many Republicans were unsure about him as well. \"People didn't know what they were going to get with Trump,\" Timmer said. But by 2018 they knew what they were getting \u2014 and they liked it, she said. On Amash, she said: \"I think he saw the writing on the wall.\" Amash won re-election last year by 11 percentage points \u2014 half the margin he had two years earlier and one of his closest races since taking office. Before the year ended, several conservatives and Trump loyalists started talking about mounting primary challenge in 2020. Amash laid out his position on impeachment in May\u00a0with a series of tweets, saying special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's conduct during and after the 2016 presidential election includes \"multiple examples of conduct satisfying all the elements of obstruction of justice.\" The politically powerful DeVos family said it would no longer give him money. GOP state Rep. Jim Lower announced his candidacy two days later, and raised $50,000 in roughly 48 hours. Amash announced he was leaving the Republican party on July 4, writing in a\u00a0Washington Post op-ed\u00a0that \"modern politics is trapped in a partisan death spiral.\" Mr. Trump responded by calling Amash \"one of the dumbest & most disloyal men in Congress.\" Since making his decision, the 39-year-old congressman has been difficult to pin down on his future. His office and campaign declined to make him available for an interview. Speaking to a reporter from Reason magazine at a Libertarian Party convention last month, Amash said he's still weighing whether he should run for Congress or for the White House as a Libertarian. \"If I feel I can be effective on the national stage, spreading the message of liberty and the message of respect and love then that's what I'll do,\" he said. Asked by the Detroit News if he could play a spoiler for Trump in Michigan next year, Amash dismissed the idea. \"Who knows?\" he said. \"Maybe he'd deny me Michigan.\"",

            "article_content": "Des Moines\u00a0\u2014 Faced with a bounty of potential candidates vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, party voters appear to be putting a premium on electability, a signal of a more strategic approach to the selection process. Interviews with voters and strategists show a baseline for support coming into focus for 2020: Can this candidate beat President Trump? \"I didn't know it was that bad to lose,\" said Des Moines resident Debbie Whittie, who came to check out one of Elizabeth Warren's events over the weekend. Whittie, who works for a credit union, says she is more engaged in political news than ever before. \"I'm already worried about that,\" she said when asked about electability. \"I really think I should go for 'the best,' but that consideration is going to have to be in my best.\"  Jeanne Williamson, another Des Moines resident and a Democratic caucus-goer, said she will be taking a hard look at how the candidates stand on various policies. But, \"That's my first reaction: to beat Trump,\" she said while standing in line to see Warren on a chilly Saturday evening.  \"I would vote for anyone probably who could defeat Trump,\" said Sally Carney, another Iowa Democratic voter. \"Oh, it's the most important: get him out,\" said Cathy Sanchez, a preschool teacher who came to Warren's event in Council Bluffs. Bill Shackelford, a retiree, said he wants \"someone who is not subject to being characterized by the right wing\" and therefore vulnerable to defeat by Mr. Trump. \"Don't underestimate him,\" he said of the president.  \"People are going to want to see how the person can match up to Trump,\" said Mike Vlacich, a New Hampshire Democratic strategist who managed Hillary Clinton's campaign in the state. \"Voters are going to try to visualize this person on a debate stage with Trump and on social media and ask, does this person have what it takes?\" In that way, a voter is \"going to be a little more of a political scientist,\" Vlacich said, and \"less interested in sending messages or proving points, but making sure we have what it takes to win the White House back.\"  Who that candidate will be is anyone's guess at this point. And voters had varying views about how to beat Trump, whether it be through character and policy contrasts, inspiration and passion, or adopting the incumbent's own tactics. But the sentiment is driving interest and attendance at political events at this early stage in the cycle. And the prospect of taking Mr. Trump on is attracting what is expected to be the largest Democratic field in two decades.  \"For the last generation, [when] there has been such an overwhelming presence of individuals on the Democratic side, a lot of Democrats didn't see a path to victory,\" said New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairman Ray Buckley. \"Donald Trump has convinced every single person on every street corner in America that they could do a better job as president.\" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney are the only candidates who have so far made official moves towards presidential bids. But several others are at least seriously considering bids, including a number of incumbent senators, former mayors, businessmen, and a former vice president.  Electability, though, is difficult to measure, particularly at this stage in the cycle. And perceived electability doesn't always equal success, as the 2016 election most recently demonstrated to Democrats. But the reaction among Democratic voters to the current president is so viscerally negative that it has become a unifying force in the party.  Some Democrats are concerned about the official party operation getting too involved in picking who is the most electable. And the Democratic National Committee is making an effort to be as inclusive as possible, as evidenced by their debate schedule and overall strategy. Activists, too, acknowledge the concern about letting the perfect be the enemy of the good.  \"There's definitely a pragmatic streak. We're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater,\" said Neil Sroka, spokesman for the progressive activist group Democracy for America. \"No doubt defeating Donald Trump is the priority. But we have to be more than a party standing against Donald Trump. We have to stand for something.\"  In her stops through Iowa over the weekend, Warren did not mention Mr. Trump by name. Instead, she aimed to introduce herself to voters as a \"fighter\" for the middle class and for a \"fairer\" economic playing field. One voter asked why she gave Mr. Trump \"fodder to be a bully\" by releasing a DNA test, a signal that some may not like a candidate who plays the president's game. Others thought the approach showed a certain toughness, or didn't matter much to them at all. Warren has shown a propensity for sparring with Mr. Trump, particularly through his preferred medium of Twitter. But in Iowa, she made a point not to make the trip about him. She did, however, try to pitch herself as having a broader appeal beyond her current fan base. \"We gotta stay focused on what matters to us. And what matters to us is that everybody gets a fighting chance,\" Warren said. \"You don't have to persuade people ... Democrats, Republicans and independents get it.\" Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "As health care took center stage for a second night at the Democratic presidential debates, Senator Bernie Sanders went back on the defensive, backing up his \"Medicare for All\" proposal and lambasting current health care policy as \"irrational.\" In his first network interview since Tuesday's debate, Sanders took on criticism by another top tier candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, who claimed that \"Medicare for All\" policies would mean a big deduction in Americans' pay checks.\u00a0 \"This is what I believe and this is what the case is, we are now spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country,\" \u00a0Sanders told \"CBS This Morning\" on Thursday. \u00a0\"The function of health care must not be as is the case right now, for the drug companies and insurances companies to make huge profits while 87 million Americans can't afford the health care that they have.\" Sanders, who recently traveled to Canada with a group of American diabetics to expose the stark disparity in prices of medically-necessary insulin between the U.S. and its neighbor, said the U.S. needs to model its health care systems like that of other countries around the world.\u00a0 Through \"Medicare for All,\" the progressive plan would essentially\u00a0eradicate most forms of private insurance\u00a0-- something Sanders contends would limit profiteering by a litany of insurance companies.\u00a0 \"We can cut the costs that people pay for health care substantially by eliminating the profiteering, the complexity and the bureaucracy of the current system,\" he said. But a CBS News poll found that nearly two-thirds of Democrats think a national health care plan would work better if it does compete with private health insurance.\u00a0 Sanders argued, however, that \"competition is terrible in health care.\" \"The function of an insurance company is to deny you the claims you thought you had,\" he said.\u00a0 The candidate wouldn't say whether he and fellow \"Medicare for All\" supporter Sen. Elizabeth Warren, had a pact of sorts to not attack one another while on the debate and campaign circuit.\u00a0 \"Look, Elizabeth and I have been friends over 20 years. She's running her campaign and I'm running my campaign. They're different campaigns. But I think the most effective campaign, to be honest with you, is to talk to the American people about why the middle class is disappearing, why we have massive income and wealth inequality,\" he said.\u00a0 He added, \"You talk about those issues, you do well. If you try to beat up on somebody else, frankly, I don't think it's good politics.\" Asked how he intends to stand out from his colleague in the Senate ahead of the next debate, Sanders told CBS: \"I'll let you guys and the punditry and the American people make that decision.\" \"We've got to take on corporate greed, we've got to create an economy that works for all of us not just the 1%. That's my message. That's what I campaign on,\" he added.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kamala Harris is laughing off critics who say that she's struggled to articulate a clear health care policy. When asked about the confusion surrounding her stance on the issue in an interview with CNN on Wednesday, the 2020 presidential candidate chuckled, saying, \"There's a lot that you're building into this question that's not accurate.\" But despite that assertion, Harris has had to clarify her stance on \"Medicare for All\" several times since the start of the year. Here's a rundown of what Harris has said about her support for expanding government-run healthcare and how she would pay for it. \u00a0 Harris was first questioned on her healthcare stance during a CNN Town Hall appearance in late January. \"I believe the solution, and I actually feel very strongly about this is, we need to have Medicare for All. That's just the bottom line,\" Harris said to applause at the event, which was broadcast live from Des Moines.\u00a0 CNN's Jake Tapper followed-up with a question. \"I believe [Medicare for All] will totally eliminate private insurance,\" said Tapper. \"So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it?\" Harris responded, \"Well listen, the idea is everyone gets access to medical care. And you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require. Who of us have not had that situation where you've got to wait for approval and the doctor says, 'Well, I don't know if your insurance company's going to cover this?' Let's eliminate all of that, let's move on.\" This sparked confusion as to whether Harris' version of Medicare for All would allow for any private insurance. In May, Tapper revisited the subject with Harris in a lengthy sit-down interview that covered multiple topics. \"I support Medicare for All but I really do need to clear-up what happened on that stage,\" said Harris. \"It was in the context of saying, 'Let's get rid of all the bureaucracy, let's get all of the waste.\" \"Oh, not the insurance companies?\" said Tapper. \"No, that's not what I meant,\" said Harris. \"I know it was interpreted that way. If you watch the tape, I think you'll see that there are obviously many interpretations of what I said. What I meant is: let's get rid of bureaucracy.\"\u00a0 But Harris also affirmed that she supports Sen. Bernie Sanders' Medicare for All bill, which she has co-sponsored in the Senate. Sanders' bill would eliminate almost all forms of private insurance, although it would allow for supplemental private insurance for cosmetic surgery. \"So it doesn't get rid of all insurance,\" added Harris. The next time Harris created confusion around her Medicare for All stance was on night two of the first Democratic presidential debate on June 27th. Harris and Sanders were the only two candidates to raise their hand when MSNBC Moderator Lester Holt asked who was in favor of doing aways private health insurance in favor of a government-run option.\u00a0 Starting with CBS News the following day, the California senator spent the morning explaining on network-after-network that she had misheard the question. \"So the question was, 'Would you be willing to give up your private insurance?'\" said Harris. \"That's not how it was asked\u2026that's what you heard, right?\" said CBS News' Tony Dokoupil. Harris again tried to clarify her stance. \"I am supportive of Medicare for All,\" she said, \"And under a Medicare for All policy, private insurance would certainly exist, and for supplemental coverage. But under Medicare for All, in my vision of it, we would actually extend benefits. So for example, vision care, dental care, hearing aids, which currently are not covered.\" This past week, the senator continued to discuss her version of a Medicare for All plan. In an interview that aired Wednesday, Harris told CNN's Kyung Lah she still supports Sanders' plan; however, she thinks the transition period will take longer than four years, which is what Sanders proposes. More importantly, Harris -- who has campaigned on lower taxes for the middle class -- said she is not in favor of a middle class tax increase to pay for it. When asked how she would pay for a that some estimate will cost around $30 trillion over 10 years, Harris noted that Wall Street could help pick up the bill through new taxes aimed at the wealthy. The CNN correspondent pressed again, noting that Sanders and other proponents of Medicare for All say it would be impossible to achieve without a middle class tax hike.\u00a0 Then came Wednesday night's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" interview, where Harris was asked if she supports Medicare for All. \"I do,\" she replied. \"Is this something that you -- Medicare for All would cost the middle class or lower middle class, lower class more with something that would increase taxes?\" asked Kimmel. \"No, it would not,\" said Harris. However, the Medicare for All bill introduced by Sanders, as it currently stands, does propose raising taxes on the middle class, although it also says that middle class families would save money under the plan. Families of four making less than $29,000 a year would also not pay additional fees.\u00a0 In a statement to CBS News, Harris' campaign said that new taxes on the middle class are \"off the table\" for the senator.\u00a0 \"A number of measures have been proposed as potential revenue raisers to pay for Medicare for All.\u00a0Sanders\u00a0and other experts have probably put out more than a dozen ideas, one of which is increasing middle class taxes. That one is off the table for Kamala. She believes we can raise revenues by targeting higher-end earners, corporations, and things like Wall Street financial transactions, which she mentioned on CNN. A recent financial transaction tax proposal was estimated to raise $2 trillion alone, for example, and\u00a0CNN has reported\u00a0Medicare for All would cost $1.4 trillion a year.\" That financial transaction tax proposal, however, is estimated to raise $2 trillion over the course of a decade.\u00a0 Harris' latest comments on the issue come as Medicare for All has become a major sticking point in the Democratic primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden, an opponent of Medicare for All, has recently traded jabs with Sanders over the issue. Other candidates, including Sen. Michael Bennet and former Rep. John Delaney, have also been vocal in their criticisms of Medicare for All.\u00a0",

With political campaigns for the 2020 election heating up, such figures provide fodder for candidates who argue the economy is hobbled by searing inequality and vulnerable to a downturn after 10 years of growth since the last recession. The data also highlight what is often a disconnect between \"headline\" economic numbers, such as unemployment and gross domestic product, that pundits and politicians often trumpet and the more complex reality facing millions of Americans.  Although the U.S. jobless rate is at a nearly 50-year low, for example, many employees in retail, the restaurant sector and other service jobs regularly face sharp swings in income and lack basic benefits, such as adequate health care insurance, paid-time off from work and company-sponsored retirement plans.  What that means on the ground: Even a thriving economy can leave people close to the edge. The Fed found that 27% of survey respondents would have to borrow money or sell something to cover a $400 emergency \u2014 12% couldn't cover it at all. Other findings from the annual Fed report, which is based on a survey last fall of 11,000 people: \"Across the country, many families continue to experience financial distress and struggle to save for retirement and unexpected expenses,\" Fed Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman said in a statement that accompanied the report. The findings align with considerable other research showing how many people \u2014 including some in the middle class \u2014 routinely find themselves stretched financially. According to a study earlier this month from the non-partisan Urban Institute, for instance, 4 in 10 Americans sometimes grapples with what economists call \"material hardship\"\u00a0\u2014 difficulty paying for basic needs such as food and housing. Not everything is doom and gloom. Asked how they're doing economically overall, three-quarters of Americans said they're \"doing OK\" or \"living comfortably\" \u2014 that's up significantly since the Fed launched the yearly survey in 2013. Most people also say local economic conditions are in decent shape. Yet such self-reported descriptions can mask the gap between America's economic winners and losers. College graduates report far higher levels of well-being than those with only a high school degree, while whites are significantly more likely than minorities to say they're bearing up financially. The depth of financial distress around the country \u2014 and at a time of relative economic strength \u2014 also raises questions about what will happen when the U.S. economy inevitably slows down. \"[A]nother year of economic expansion and the low national unemployment rates did little to narrow the persistent economic disparities by race, education and geography,\" the Fed researchers wrote.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden raised $6.3 million in the first 24 hours since announcing he was running for president, according to his campaign. The high number notably edges out Sen. Bernie Sanders, who raised around $6 million in the first 24 hours of his campaign, and Beto O'Rourke, who received $6.1 million. Biden has received some criticism for turning to wealthy donors to help fund his campaign. The former vice president attended a private fundraiser in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, hosted by Comcast's chief lobbyist on Thursday evening, just hours after he announced that he was running for president. However, Biden's campaign boasted that 97 percent of donations were under $200 in a campaign email. The email also said that the campaign had received donations from all 50 states and that the average donation was $41. Approximately 97,000 people contributed to the campaign in the first 24 hours, and 65,000 of those individuals were new donors who did not come from existing email lists. \"We are incredibly heartened by the energy and enthusiasm displayed throughout the country for Joe Biden,\" said Kate Bedingfield, communications director for the campaign. \"It is crystal clear from the last 24 hours that Americans are ready for dignified leadership, someone who can restore the soul of the nation, rebuild the middle class so everyone gets a fair shot and unite the country behind the core values we all believe in. That person is Joe Biden, and today's announcement demonstrates Americans agree.\" \u00a0 Biden started the race at a fundraising disadvantage, since he was unable to raise money during the first quarter of the year like most of the other candidates. However, Biden raised more than all but four of the other candidates in his first 24 hours as a candidate than most did in the entire first quarter. His campaign is likely to be a fundraising juggernaut to rival that of Sanders, who raised $18 million in the first quarter. However, Biden may be more reliant on wealthy donors than Sanders, whose average donation was $20. The only other candidates who have raised over $6 million so far are Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, O'Rourke and Sanders.

            "article_content": "French yellow vest protesters set life-threatening fires, smashed up luxury stores and clashed with police Saturday in the 18th straight weekend of demonstrations against President Emmanuel Macron. Large plumes of smoke rose above the rioting on Paris' landmark Champs-Elysees Avenue, and a mother and her child were just barely saved from a building blaze. French police tried to contain the demonstrators with limited success. One perilous fire targeted a bank on the ground floor of a seven-story residential building. As firetrucks rushed over, a mother and her child were rescued as the fire threatened to engulf their floor, the city's fire service told The Associated Press. Eleven people in the building, including two firefighters, sustained light injuries, as other residents were evacuated to safety. The rioting comes at the end of a two-month national debate that Macron organized to respond to protesters' concerns about sinking living standards, stagnant wages and high unemployment. After the weekly protests dwindled recently, protesters were hoping to breathe new life into their movement against a president who they see as favoring the elite. The violence started Saturday when protesters threw smoke bombs and other objects at officers along the famed avenue \u2014 scene of repeated past rioting \u2014 and started pounding on the windows of a police van, prompting riot police to retreat. Simultaneous fires were also put out from two burning newspaper kiosks, which sent black smoke high into the sky. Several protesters smiled as they posed for a photo in front of one the kiosk's charred remains. Demonstrators also targeted symbols of the luxury industry, as shops including brands Hugo Boss and Lacoste were smashed up and pillaged, and mannequins thrown out of the broken windows. A posh eatery called Fouquet's, which is associated with politicians and celebrities, was vandalized and set on fire. A vehicle burned outside the luxury boutique Kenzo, one of many blazes on and around the Champs-Elysees. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said up to 8,000 demonstrators were in Paris on Saturday, including 1,500 \"ultra-violent ones that are there to smash things up.\" Castaner ordered police to retaliate against these \"inadmissible\" acts, condemning those who \"call for violence and are here to ferment chaos in Paris.\" Paris police told The Associated Press that 82 people were arrested by mid-afternoon. Police closed down several streets and fanned out around the Right Bank. Yellow vest groups representing teachers, unemployed people and labor unions were among those that organized dozens of rallies and marches Saturday in the capital and around France. Protesters dismiss Macron's national debate on the economy as empty words and a campaign ploy by Macron to gain support for the European Parliament elections in May. Protesters are angry over high taxes and Macron policies seen as coddling business. \"Those who participated in this great debate are mostly retirees and upper middle class, meaning Macron's electorate, even though we understood this great national debate was supposed to respond to the yellow vest crisis,\" lawyer and protester Francois Boulo told Europe-1 radio.",

            "article_content": "New Jersey became the latest state on Monday to boost its hourly minimum wage to $15 after Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed into law a measure phasing in the higher rate over five years. Murphy signed the bill alongside Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver and Democratic legislative leaders at a raucous event in Elizabeth where advocates cheered, \"Ready for 15,\" carried banners with their union affiliation and applauded loudly once the bill was signed. \"It is a great day to make some history for New Jersey's working families,\" Murphy said. \"And that's just what we're going to do. We've talked long enough about putting New Jersey on a responsible path to $15 an hour minimum wage. Today we start our way on this path.\" New Jersey joins California, Massachusetts, New York and the District of Columbia in phasing in the higher rate. The $15 wage is a prominent policy goal of left-leaning groups, as well as the fulfillment of a key campaign promise by Murphy. The governor, Senate President Steve Sweeney and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin announced a deal on the higher wage last month following yearslong efforts by left-leaning groups and unions in the state to raise the wage. Today, we made history.Today, we put New Jersey\u2019s minimum wage on a path to $15/hour.https://t.co/Pehn0g0O1y pic.twitter.com/iFEpUjsYhI Republican Gov. Chris Christie vetoed a similar bill in 2016 to raise the wage. Republicans and many businesses testified during hearings the higher wage will increase costs and hurt commerce. On Monday, Republican senators raised concerns it would lead to businesses laying off workers and moving to automation. Others worried if a recession hits, the high wage could be untenable for businesses. \"The amount of job loss that we are going to see among small businesses will be tragic,\" state Sen. Declan O'Scanlon said in a statement. In an interview, Murphy, the former Obama administration ambassador to Germany, dismissed concerns over automation and said he hasn't seen evidence a higher minimum wage correlates to jobs lost because of artificial intelligence or automation. He also acknowledged raising the minimum wage too high too fast could hurt the state's economy, which is why the measure phases it in, he said. \"I start from the basis that you've got full-time work earning poverty wages in 2019 in New Jersey,\" he said. \"There's no excuse that could justify this.\" The bill raises the current $8.85 minimum wage to $10 an hour in July, and then increases the rate by $1 in subsequent years until it reaches $15 in 2024 \u2014 but not for all workers.  Farm workers' wages will climb to $12.50 over five years, for example. Workers for small businesses and seasonal employees will see their minimum wage reach $15 an hour only in 2026. Tipped workers, who currently have a minimum hourly wage of $2.13, will see it climb to $5.13 an hour by 2024. The new law comes as the 2020 presidential contest begins to take shape, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey announcing last week his plan to compete in the Democratic primary next year. Oliver, the lieutenant governor, implored those assembled Monday to push for a higher minimum wage as part of the next election, eliciting one of the loudest applauses of the day. \"I don't want you to forget 2020 because we need a federal minimum wage (increase),\" she said. A constitutional amendment that raised the minimum wage and requires it to climb with inflation went into effect in 2013 in New Jersey. Once the wage reaches $15 in 2024, it will continue to climb based on the consumer price index because of that amendment.",

Warren is considered the first household name Democrat to announce her potential candidacy, although she is only one of several possible candidates pondering a bid. \"I want to be in this fight,\" Warren told Rachel Maddow on MSNBC show. \"This is truly about what kind of country we are going to be. I never thought I would get into politics, not in a million years, but I got in this because I believe this is the fight we must fight. I can't tell other to fight it. I have to be there right beside them.\" Warren called out the Trump presidency as \"one grift after another\" and called President Trump an \"accelerant for corruption.\" \"I see him as what happens when corruption invades a system, that, it gets a little bit corrupt and a little more corrupt and a little more corrupt and then it gets bigger and they get bolder and bolder,\" she said.\u00a0 Warren spoke briefly about foreign policy, saying she is in favor of removing American troops from Syria and Afghanistan and that she would like to ask the people in the \"defense establishment\" who support keeping troops \"what they think winning looks like.\"\u00a0 \u00a0But she said she is not in favor of \"foreign policy by twee\" and she emphasized the need to coordinate with U.S. allies.\u00a0 Warren called for grassroots involvement in the primaries, saying she didn't want billionaires \"self-funding\" their runs or for billionaire donors to determine. A refusal to take corporate or PAC money was a signature part of potential 2020 Democratic candidate\u00a0Beto O'Rourke's 2018 Senate bid, which\u00a0shattered fundraising records but was ultimately unsuccessful.\u00a0 \u00a0 There was no mention of the video Warren released taking a DNA test proving there is a strong likelihood she has Native American heritage. Mr. Trump has frequently targeted Warren, mockingly calling her \"Pocahontas.\" After picking Maddow, a self-proclaimed liberal, for her first interview, Warren will be taking on a\u00a0candidate's schedule\u00a0and head to Iowa, the critical first caucus state in the 2020 Democratic primaries. Warren will travel to four Iowa cities during her brief time in the state. In her letter to supporters Monday morning\u00a0announcing her presidential bid, Warren said that she \"never in a zillion years\" thought she would run for office. By afternoon, Warren claimed she had already received donations from all 50 states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.\u00a0 In a video released on social media, Warren said she's running in order to take a stand for middle-class Americans. She lays out the vision for her presidency in the video as one in which democracy and our economy \"work for all of us.\" \u00a0 \"In our country if you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to take care of yourself and the people you love. That's a fundamental promise of America,\" she said. Warren talked about her own family's struggles -- her father was a janitor and her mother worked at Sears -- and yet, Warren grew up to be be a teacher, a law professor and a senator. Now, she believes \"working families today face a lot tougher path than my family did. And families of color face a path that is steeper and rockier. A path made even harder by the impact of generations of discrimination.\" Grace Segers, Ed O'Keefe and Caroline Linton contributed reporting",

            "article_content": "American taxpayers send more foreign aid to Egypt than to any other nation except Israel. But America's nearly one and a half billion dollars a year is going to a regime accused of the worst abuses in Egypt's modern history. Opponents of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi have been imprisoned by the thousands. El-Sisi has strangled freedom of speech. And his troops have murdered protestors. As you might imagine, President El-Sisi does not do a lot of interviews. And we were surprised when he sat down with us. El-Sisi was apparently surprised by our questions because his government has asked us not to broadcast his interview. This is an American citizen. In 2015, he was sentenced to life in this Egyptian prison. His crime was transmitting false news, news which offended the man we met recently in New York: President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. Scott Pelley: Do you have a good idea of how many political prisoners you're holding? President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: We don't have political prisoners nor prisoners of opinion. We are trying to stand against extremists who impose their ideology on the people. Now they are subject to a fair trial. And it may take years, but we have to follow the law. Scott Pelley: Mr. President, the organization Human Rights Watch says that there're 60,000 political prisoners that you're holding today as we sit here. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: I don't know where they got that figure. I said there are no political prisoners in Egypt. Whenever there is a minority trying to impose their extremist ideology. We have to intervene regardless of their numbers.  The \"extremists,\" as he calls them, made up Egypt's largest political party, the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is controversial. Its stated goal is peaceful pursuit of Islamic government. But over its 90 years, members have committed violence. In 2013, El-Sisi outlawed the Brothers as terrorists. But President Trump hasn't designated them a terrorist organization. Nor did President Obama when Andrew Miller was Egypt director in the National Security Council. Andrew Miller: While individual Muslim brothers clearly have resorted to violence, many have left the party before doing so precisely because they're discontent with the peaceful, gradualist approach of the senior Muslim Brotherhood leadership. The Brotherhood was one of Egypt's largest education, charity and healthcare associations. Many members are middle class; academics, doctors and lawyers. Modern Egyptian history is a cycle of tension between generals and the Brothers. But this time, critics say, El-Sisi has gone too far.  Andrew Miller: Sisi began by jailing the Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamists. He extended it to secular opposition groups. And now he's even going after poets and artists and bloggers, people you wouldn't normally think of as political activists or primary public players. Scott Pelley: Why would he do that? Andrew Miller: Because he views any opposition to him as a threat to his standing and as a threat to his objective. We have to remember, he is a military officer. He spent his entire career in the military before he became president. And the idea that someone wouldn't obey or listen to his orders is anathema to him. El-Sisi rose in 2011's Arab spring after Egyptians overthrew a dictator and elected the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohammad Morsi. Morsi made El-Sisi Minister of Defense. But Morsi's government was chaotic. He assumed autocratic power. And after a year, there was another uprising. With a good deal of popular support, El-Sisi seized control.  President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: The Egyptian people rejected such a strict religious government. It is the right of the Egyptian people to choose the form of government they like. Scott Pelley: They are also the leading political opposition to you. Is that why they have been outlawed? President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: No, no, no. We are only dealing with extreme Islamists who are carrying weapons. We would welcome them to live among the people but we don't want them to carry weapons and destroy the Egyptian economy. Abdul Mawgoud Dardery: General Sisi, unfortunately, kidnapped democracy. He kidnapped our dream of being free.  Abdul Mawgoud Dardery was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood-controlled parliament.  Scott Pelley: But he says he didn't have any choice, he was leading a popular revolution against the Morsi government. That's his argument. Abdul Mawgoud Dardery: That is not his responsibility as an army general. He was the defense minister. He betrayed his president. He took an oath in front of the president to protect the constitution. The constitution does not give him any right to represent the people. He never did, he never will, represent the people of Egypt. Scott Pelley: Mr. President, I've spoken to a number of your countrymen who refuse to call you Mr. President because they say you're a military dictator. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: I don't know who you talked to. But 30 million Egyptians took to the streets to reject the ruling regime at the time. It was a must to respond to their will. Secondly, the maintenance of peace after this period required some measures to restore security.  What El-Sisi calls 'measures to restore security' include the massacre of at least 800 Muslim Brotherhood supporters in Cairo's Rabaa Square. In August 2013, after weeks of protests, Egyptian forces moved in. Among the survivors was Mohamed Soltan, the Egyptian-American imprisoned for reporting false news. Soltan was released 21 months after the Obama administration intervened. Mohamed Soltan: I was targeted. I was targeted because I had a camera. I had a phone and I was tweeting. Scott Pelley: Where were you shot? Mohamed Soltan: I was shot in my left arm. I was rushed to the makeshift hospital where there was blood and bodies, injured bodies, everywhere. Piled upon each other. The Rabaa Square protest camp was assaulted while El-Sisi was in charge of security. Scott Pelley: Did you give that order? President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: Allow me to ask you a question. Are you closely following the situation in Egypt? From where do you get your information? There were thousands of armed people in the sit\u2013in for more than 40 days. We tried every peaceful means to disperse them. Scott Pelley: Human Rights Watch issued a report, which you may have seen, describing Rabaa. And it says, and I quote, \"using armored personnel carriers, bulldozers, ground forces and snipers, police and army personnel attacked the protest encampment with hundreds killed by bullets to their heads, necks and chests.\" Was that necessary to the peace and stability of Egypt? President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: You are calling the Human Rights Watch report a sound statement. Which is not true. There were police personnel and they were trying to open peaceful corridors for the people to go safely to their homes.  Though El-Sisi told us thousands of protestors were armed, at the time, his government said just over a dozen weapons were found.  Scott Pelley: You're a military man. You were educated by the U.S. military. Does that sound like proportional force to you? President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: I don't know how come they had 15 or 16 firearms. I would like to tell the American people the situation on the ground could have destroyed the Egyptian state and caused massive instability, more than could be conceived. Whenever there is an armed confrontation with a big number of people, it's difficult to control the situation and to decide who killed whom. The situation in his prisons is within El-Sisi's control, and there, according to the U.S. State Department, the killing and torture continue. Mohamed Soltan: In the last six months of my imprisonment, I was in utter isolation. I was systematically, psychologically tortured.  Scott Pelley: What do you mean? Mohamed Soltan: Light control, spotlight\u2026  Scott Pelley: To keep you from sleeping? Mohamed Soltan: On me, yes, to keep me from sleeping, 36 hours. Strobe light until I got, I went into a seizure. Guards that were assigned to me right outside my cell would pass razors under the doorstep and the officer doctors would tell me, \"Hey, Mohamed, cut vertically not horizontally so you can end it faster.\"  Prison is a tool of politics in Egypt. When El-Sisi ran for re-election last year, he jailed one of his leading opponents and won, his government says, 97 percent of the vote. El-Sisi sees himself as a guardian against the chaos that destroyed Syria, Libya and Yemen. But critics, including Obama national security official Andrew Miller, argue that repression stands to make Egypt more explosive, not less.  Andrew Miller: This is the most repressive government in modern Egyptian history. You have death sentences galore and mass trials. It's, extremely concerning. Scott Pelley: But Sisi would tell you that he's the reason that Egypt is stable. Andrew Miller: It's a curious way to describe Egypt to call it stable. Since Sisi took office, living standards have declined. The country is crumbling. The insurgency problem in the Sinai has only gotten worse. It's backed by the Islamic State, entering its sixth year. And you've seen the mass incarceration of peaceful activists alongside hardened jihadists, which threatens to turn more Egyptians to terrorism. That seems to be a recipe for the very instability that Sisi claims he's preventing. President El-Sisi is fighting terrorism. Last month, a tourist bus was bombed near the great pyramids. The next day, Egyptian forces killed 40 suspects. In 2017, ISIS affiliates murdered Coptic Christians at church and 311 Muslims in a mosque. In our interview, El-Sisi revealed officially for the first time, that his military is cooperating with Israel in the Sinai.  Scott Pelley: Would you say that this is the deepest and closest cooperation that you've ever had with Israel? President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: That is correct. The Air Force sometimes needs to cross to the Israeli side. And that's why we have a wide range of coordination with the Israelis. Scott Pelley: It's been estimated there are about 1,000 terrorists in Sinai. With more than a billion dollars in U.S. military aid every year, why haven't you wiped them out? President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: And why hasn't the US eliminated the terrorists in Afghanistan after 17 years and spending a trillion dollars? President Trump met El-Sisi and King Salman of Saudi Arabia in 2017 to open a Saudi center against extremism. Ironic, after Saudi officers murdered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and the U.S. State Department said El-Sisi is guilty of disappearances and torture.  Scott Pelley: Why should the American people continue to invest in your government? President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: They're investing in security and stability in the region. The United States is in charge of security worldwide. Scott Pelley: Mr. President, your critics, critics in the United States Congress, critics within the United Nations, say that you are holding tens of thousands of political prisoners. That hundreds of people, unarmed people, have been killed in the streets of Cairo. They claim that you have blood on your hands. How do you explain all of this? President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi: We are dealing with fundamentalists and extremists which caused damage and killed people over these last years. I can't ask Egyptians to forget their rights or the police and civilians who died. For now, the White House calculates that fighting terrorism is more urgent than the threat that El-Sisi's repression will ignite another revolt. Egypt's parliament is debating whether to suspend term limits to allow El-Sisi to continue building an Egypt unlike any the modern world has known. Produced by Rachael Morehouse.

            "article_content": "Perry, Iowa\u00a0\u2014 At 77, Joe Biden would be the oldest person elected president, and Pete Buttigieg, who turns 38 next month, would be the youngest. Yet in Iowa, where the first contest of the Democratic primary will be held in February, the two Democratic hopefuls are locked in a dogfight for senior citizens, a pivotal demographic given their high turnout rate.\u00a0 Older voters head to the polls with much greater regularity than other Americans. And nationwide,\u00a0CBS News polling shows\u00a0Biden's consistent lead is boosted by elderly voters, with 39% of voters 65 or older picking Biden, his largest coalition of support. But in Iowa, statewide polls indicate Buttigieg has also captured the imagination of older voters. The fresh-faced millennial mayor of South Bend has made wooing older voters a priority, vowing to protect Social Security and promising a \"Gray New Deal\" for seniors.\u00a0 Last month, a Des Moines Register poll found Buttigieg leading in the state among likely caucus goers. It also found that he was the top pick of the 65-and-over crowd, outpacing Biden among a constituency he had dominated earlier in the race.\u00a0 Buttigieg's strategy makes sense. Almost 80 percent of Iowans age 65 and older who were registered to vote in the 2018 midterm election did so, making up almost a whopping third of all votes cast, according to the Iowa Secretary of State's office. And while much of the focus in the 2018 midterm elections was on the higher-than-average turnout of young voters, older voters increased at similar levels.\u00a0 While Buttigieg courts these older voters, the Biden campaign says it's not concentrating on any one voting bloc, although it plans to \"more aggressively\" engage with Iowa seniors.\u00a0 Asked if Buttigieg's support among older voters might chip away at his own standing with seniors, Biden replied, \"I haven't seen it so far, but maybe.\" He added that he thought Buttigieg was an \"attractive\" candidate but one who \"hasn't cut it\u2014anything\u2014nationally.\" Some observers say Biden's recent heavy campaigning in Iowa, including a recent eight-day swing, indicates his campaign may feel more threatened by Buttigieg's appeal to seniors than Biden is willing to admit. \"I think he does have some more elderly support\" compared to rivals, Clay County Democratic Chair Ryan Odor told CBS News after attending a recent Biden event in the county.\u00a0 At the same time, Odor warned that Biden is playing catch up with older voters he assumed would win. \"I think he rested on that for awhile and is recognizing that some of this support is starting to go elsewhere.\" \"I was scoping the crowd out and I noticed a few students, but a majority seem a little older,\" educator Heidi Larsen, 58, said in Storm Lake. \"Well, I tell ya, a little bit older crowd but very enthusiastic,\" former coach Ted Bieth, 67, said in Mason City. Even at events geared toward younger voters, like a late morning town hall at Iowa State University, only about 20 hands went up when Biden asked students in the crowd of more than 325 to identify themselves. Then again, retirees are often overrepresented at nearly every candidate's events for a simple reason: They tend to have more time on their hands, especially on weekdays.\u00a0 \"[The students] I suspect are busy with classes, and so, its retired folks like myself who are in the best position to be able to attend,\" former state government lawyer Richard Mull, 67, said, taking advantage of the luxury of time older voters have to devote to political events. This luxury of time also plays well on caucus night when older voters, who have off have fewer constraints than full-time workers or the parents of young children, can spend hours in the rec halls and high school gymnasiums where the caucuses occur.\u00a0 \"They stick and stay,\" Blackhawk County Democrats Chairwoman Vikki Brown told CBS News about older voters. \"They are going to be out there caucusing...when some others may fail to be there.\" After attending a Biden event in Waterloo, Brown said Biden has \"not only a higher ratio of black older voters but also older white voters\" compared to his rivals.\u00a0 \"Don't doubt the Baby Boomers,\" Brown said. While both candidates focus on policies specifically targeted toward seniors, Biden also relies on his old-school, retail-politician charm when courting the elderly. When faced with a question from a woman in his approximate age bracket, it's not unusual for Biden to refer to her as \"young woman\" or \"young lady.\" He also talks about how he, too, can have trouble understanding new technology, and relies on his granddaughters to explain why those Russian \"bots\" are attacking him online.\u00a0 He commiserates by rhetorically asking how his critics can call him both too old and too na\u00efve. \"I thought with age came a little wisdom?\" he says to laughter from supporters, many of whom say they feel defensive of Biden and his age.\u00a0 \"He can't be too old,\" lifelong Democrat Mary Rose Brown told CBS News. \"I'm 94 and I'm still campaigning!\"\u00a0 And Biden's foreign policy credentials are also appealing to older voters, according Dallas County Democratic Chair Bryce Smith, who this weekend endorsed Senator Cory Booker. \"I think our foreign affairs are deeply concerning\u2026especially to older people who lived through the tail-end of World War II and the Cold War and even the beginnings in the Middle East,\" Smith said. When touring rural Iowa, Biden will often criticize President Trump's trade policy, saying that it hurts the state's struggling agricultural sector.\u00a0 Smith, who is 27, said that Biden is also able to connect with voters \"like my grandmother\" by embracing \"the sense of urgency that a lot of the older generation...think we just need someone in [the White House] to stop the bleeding and...let us get back to some normal-ness.\"\u00a0 Alice Krapfl, 88, expressed the same sentiment to CBS News.\u00a0 \"I want my grandchildren to be able to have a nation that we are proud of and we are not going to be too proud with that man who is in [the White House] now.\" Voters in Perry were able to compare Buttigieg and Biden in back-to-back events this past weekend, since they held events in town just hours apart. Five undecided voters told CBS News these two men were their top two choices before the events. After seeing both Biden and Buttigieg, all five said they were going home still undecided.\u00a0 Bo Erickson is a reporter covering the White House for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden defended his civil rights record, after he was targeted by Sen. Kamala Harris in Thursday night's primary debate for his friendliness with segregationist senators and his opposition to federally-imposed busing in the 1970s. Speaking to the Rainbow PUSH Coalition in Chicago, Biden said that he \"heard and I listened to and I respect Senator Harris,\" but that he believed the debate did not offer enough time for them to properly discuss the issue. \"We all know that 30 seconds to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can't do justice to a lifetime committed to civil rights,\" Biden said. \"I want to be absolutely clear about my record and position on racial justice, including busing. I never, never, never, ever opposed voluntary busing.\" \"I did support federal action to address the root causes of segregation in our schools and our communities, including taking on the banks and redlining and trying to change the way in which neighborhoods were segregated,\" Biden said. \"I've always been in favor of using federal authority to overcome state-initiated segregation.\" Biden noted that he was the deciding vote against the 1974 anti-busing Gurney amendment. \"I cast the deciding vote in 1974 against an amendment called the Gurney Amendment, which would have banned the right of the federal courts to be able to use busing as a remedy,\" Biden said. \"And you might guess, in the middle of the most extensive busing order in American history, in my city and my state, it wasn't what you'd call the most popular vote in the country at the time.\" He continued by defending his record supporting civil rights legislation since he joined the Senate. \"I fought my heart out to ensure that Civil Rights, voting rights, equal rights, are enforced everywhere. These rights are not -- are not up to the states to decide. They are federal government's duty to decide,\" Biden said. Biden also emphasized his ties with former President Obama, the first black president, saying that Obama did not get enough credit for his accomplishments while in office. \"My president gets much too little credit for all that he did,\" Biden said. \"He was one of the great presidents of the United States, and I'm tired about hearing what he didn't do.\" On Thursday, Harris pressed Biden on his comments about working with conservative lawmakers who supported segregation based on race, as well as his past stance against busing to desegregate public schools. \"I do not believe you are a racist,\" Harris said, looking straight at Biden Thursday night. \"I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground ... [But] it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this country.\" Harris also noted Biden opposed federal measures to ensure that local jurisdictions used busing to desegregate public schools during the 1970s. She said that was personally painful for her. \"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school everyday, and that little girl was me,\" she said. \"So, I will tell you: on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly.\"\u00a0 Harris' passionate appeal elicited some of the loudest applause of the night. Given a chance to respond, Biden challenged Harris' portrayal of his record on race. \u00a0 \"That's a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did not praise racists,\" he said, touting his support for civil rights and highlighting his work as public defender. In an interview with \"CBS This Morning\" Friday, Harris responded to criticism from Biden's camp that the contentious moment was a \"low blow.\" \"It was about just speaking truth and as I've said many times, I have a great deal of respect for Joe Biden...but he and I disagree on that,\" Harris said.\u00a0 She added, \"My purpose was to really just make sure that in this conversation we are appreciating the impact on real people of policies that have been pushed in the history of our country.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez and Emily Tillett contributed to this report Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

Activists from the Sunrise Movement, a youth climate-change advocacy group, posted video on social media of the confrontation, where Feinstein said, \"I've been doing this for 30 years, I know what I'm doing.\" \"You come in here and say 'it has to be my way or the highway' and I don't respond to that,\" Feinstein told about 15 students at her San Francisco office. \"I've gotten elected, I just ran, I was elected by almost a million-vote plurality, and I know what I'm doing.\" Feinstein told the students she is opposed to the Green New Deal for several reasons, including \"we can't pay for it\" and she doesn't agree with what it says. The Green New Deal, championed by Democrats Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Alexandria Ocasico-Cortez, aims to convert the entire U.S. economy to renewable energy within 12 years, while also sparking a massive burst of job-creation and technological innovation.   When the students told her \"some scientists say we have 12 years to turn this around,\" Feinstein answered \"Well it's not going to get turned around in 10 years.\" This is how @SenFeinstein reacted to children asking her to support the #GreenNewDeal resolution -- with smugness + disrespect.This is a fight for our generation's survival. Her reaction is why young people desperately want new leadership in Congress. pic.twitter.com/0zAkaxruMI An edited clip was posted on Twitter but a much longer exchange was posted on Facebook. In the full version, Feinstein explained why she believes her own climate-change legislation is better than the Green New Deal. At the end, she offers one of the students an internship.\u00a0 \u00a0 When the students told her she has to listen to them because they voted for them, Feinstein challenged one student on her age until she admitted she was 16. \"Well you didn't vote for me,\" Feinstein answered. About 100 people had rallied outside Feinstein's office Friday, including students from Oakland Unified School District, where classes are canceled due to a teacher strike this week.\u00a0 In a statement hours after the clip went viral, Feinstein said she welcomed the \"spirited discussion.\"\u00a0 \"Unfortunately, it was a brief meeting but I want the children to know they were heard loud and clear. I have been and remain committed to doing everything I can to enact real, meaningful climate change legislation,\" Feinstein said. Feinstein's liberal challenger in the 2018 election, Kevin de Le\u1f79n, did not mention Feinstein directly after the video spread across the Internet, but tweeted \"Climate change is real, and we won't survive what's coming unless EVERYONE is part of the conversation.\"\u00a0",

Not so fast: Medicare has another limited open enrollment that runs from Jan. 1 through March 31, 2019, for Medicare Advantage plans. Here's a brief review to help you understand your options. You face a fundamental decision regarding how you receive medical treatment under Medicare: You do have the opportunity to change your mind if you elected an MA plan during the 2018 open enrollment period or if you simply allowed your 2018 MA plan to remain effective for 2019. During the 2019 Medicare Advantage open enrollment period, you can: Your election becomes effective the month after you make the switch. Why would you want to move from one MA plan to another or to original Medicare? Here are a few possible reasons: \"If you're new to an MA plan this year, try it out before March 31,\" recommended Diane Omdahl, president of Sixty-Five Incorporated, an independent Medicare consultancy. That way, you can test whether you like it and still have time to change if you don't.  Note that if you opt out of your MA plan and switch to original Medicare, you may have a challenge purchasing a Medicare Supplement plan. Most states allow insurance companies to require that you satisfy medical underwriting requirements to obtain coverage (insurance companies are prohibited from applying medical underwriting only when you're first eligible to enroll in Medicare at age 65). So if you have a preexisting condition, you may not be able to elect a Medicare Supplement Plan. Here are a few things you can't do during 2019 Medicare Advantage open enrollment: There's a lot to keep track of with Medicare and all its various parts and features.

He criticized not only their campaign strategies but their policies. He spent Tuesday in Arizona \u2014 a state President Trump won in 2016 \u2014 where he said \"you don't often see presidential candidates.\" \"The fact is, President Trump is about the only one who's spending any money here and in some of the other swing states around the country,\" Bloomberg told reporters. \"That's a big problem for our party, and I am determined to change exactly that.\" He sees a chance for Democrats to flip the state if they make it a priority, just as he is. The move to start in Arizona comes as Bloomberg is taking the path less traveled in the presidential race. He will not appear on the ballot in some early-voting states, such as New Hampshire, and he has hinted that he will not compete in other early states like Iowa. Arizona has also been a focus of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC seeking to mobilize Latinos in Arizona and Florida. Bloomberg also doubled down on his opposition to \"Medicare for All\" and a wealth tax. Fellow billionaire Tom Steyer has urged Bloomberg to support a wealth tax, but Bloomberg said other countries have failed to show it can be successful.\u00a0 On health care, Bloomberg called Medicare for All \u2014 which is supported in some form by most of the Democratic candidates \u2014 \"a solution to the problem.\" He said it's better to tweak Obamacare and \"restore some of the cuts that were taken away.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden has a similar stance. \"Medicare for All would destroy our hospital system.

Unlike the single-payer system advocated by Sanders and Warren that would force people to give up their private insurance, Buttigieg's plan would allow people to keep their private insurance\u00a0if they prefer it.\u00a0 The plan showcases Buttigieg's pitch to voters as a candidate willing to take a measured position that speaks to the needs of a Democratic electorate that may be wary of the upending of the U.S. health care system that the progressives in the race argue the country needs.\u00a0 The plan, which the campaign says would cost $1.5 trillion over a decade, is aiming for universal coverage by providing insurance in a variety of ways, depending on an individual's insured status and income: And there would be a \"natural glide-path\" to Medicare for All if the public alternative is more popular that private insurance plans. \"For years, Washington politicians have allowed the pharmaceutical industry, giant insurance companies, and powerful hospital systems to profit off of people when they are at their sickest and most vulnerable,\" Buttigieg said in a statement. \"My 'Medicare for All Who Want It' plan will create a health care system that puts power in the hands of each American.\" Buttigieg is betting that the Medicare for All Who Want It format will force private insurance companies to lower their prices to compete with the public option in his proposal.\u00a0 \"We don't have to command people to abandon their private care, because whether it's Medicare Advantage on the Medicare side or whether it's hard-won union healthcare plans that people have bargained for and fought for, I still think my plan's going to be better,\" Buttigieg said at a recent Spartanburg, South Carolina town hall. \"I'm just going to put that to the test, rather than order people to come under our plans.\" The South Bend mayor has made this point repeatedly. He brought it up in the third presidential debate, arguing that the single-payer health care that Sanders and Warren support deprives Americans of their ability to make decisions about their health care.\u00a0 As he put it, \"I trust the American people to make the right choice for them. Why don't you? The plan, $1.5 trillion over a decade would be paid for, according to the campaign, by cost savings and reforming the corporate tax code so that bigger corporations pay their fair share. In order to make marketplace coverage more affordable, Buttigieg plans to cap premium payments at 8.5% of an individual's income and to link subsidies to higher-level plans. He proposes tightening restrictions on association health care plans and expanding cost-sharing reduction payments.\u00a0 Buttigieg also addresses the high out-of-pocket costs seniors on Medicare have to pay. To lower the costs, Buttigieg calls for a cap on the out-of-pocket Medicare costs, as well as lowering the caps for low-income seniors.  Buttigieg would lower premiums by ensuring that health care providers and hospitals charge no more than twice what Medicare would pay for out-of-network services. He would also end surprise billing by requiring all \"bills related to in-network facilities be billed as in-network.\" \"Hospitals, not patients, should bear the responsibility of verifying that their providers are included in their insurance networks, whether for private plans or public programs,\" the plan states.

            "article_content": "On Monday, Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Kamala Harris expressed her support for eliminating private health insurance under a Medicare for All system, provoking a flurry of criticism from Republicans who have long accused Democrats of wanting to orchestrate a government takeover of the health care system. \"The idea is that everyone gets access to medical care, and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require,\" Harris said Monday during a televised CNN town hall. \"Who of us has not had that situation, where you've got to wait for approval, and the doctor says, well, I don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this? Let's eliminate all of that.\" But her underlying comments also underscored how quickly a once-fringe position is now squarely in the mainstream of the party. Support for a variation of a single-payer-type approach to health care is emerging as a litmus test for the 2020 Democratic candidates, and the debate over the specifics is shaping up to be one of the defining policy battles of the campaign. In 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders' pitch for universal coverage was still considered too far to the left for many in the party, but his embrace of a Medicare for All plan pushed eventual nominee Hillary Clinton to adopt a so-called \"Medicare for More\" approach. Now most of the Democratic contenders in 2020, including Harris, have embraced some form of Sanders' plan. \"The center of gravity within the Democratic Party and general electorate has massively moved in a economic populist direction,\" says Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \"[Harris] actually did every Democrat running on Medicare for All a huge service by being honest and mainstreaming the idea that this is fundamentally about challenging the insurance companies for profiting by denying care.\" In addition to Harris and Sanders, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, all support a single-payer plan. Others, like Sens. Sherrod Brown and Amy Klobuchar, back a modified approach that would lower the age of eligibility for Medicare or institute a public option.\u00a0 The notion that the public option \u2014 in which a government-sponsored insurance plan competes against private plans to lower costs \u2014 is now considered the politically cautious approach shows just how much the ground has shifted. The public option was a major point of contention in the 2008 Democratic primaries and during the ensuing debate over the Affordable Care Act. Not all potential 2020 candidates are moving towards Sanders on the issue. Former Vice President Joe Biden hasn't explicitly endorsed a type of Medicare for All proposal. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told an audience in New Hampshire on Tuesday the U.S. \"could never afford that,\" and that moving away from private insurance \"would bankrupt us for a very long time.\" Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who is considering an independent bid, called Harris' position \"not American.\"\u00a0 Democrats were quick to pounce on Schultz's remark and come to Harris' defense, but her comments at the CNN town hall also exposed potential perils. \"This is a classic case of the bumper sticker preceding the policy paper,\" says Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \"Most Americans worry about the overall health care system but they love their private insurance ... Once you start talking about taking away employer-provided insurance and moving to a system where everyone is forced into some kind of government system ... All hell breaks loose.\" Public polling speaks to both the appeal of and concerns about the Democrats' positions on coverage. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey found 56 percent of Americans, including 23 percent of Republicans, favor a national \"Medicare for All\" system. But support dropped significantly when respondents were asked about specific aspects of a single-payer system, including the elimination of private insurance, higher taxes, changes to the current Medicare system and delays for people seeking care. The 2020 candidates have yet to release formal policy proposals, and there are several ways to achieve universal health coverage, not all of which eliminate private insurance. Alternative proposals in Congress include options to buy into Medicare and Medicaid, for example. Harris' campaign notes she has supported other measures in addition to Medicare for All. But the framing of the debate at the outset of the campaign is an indication of just how ambitious Democrats plan to be on the issue. \"This is a placeholder for the absolute frustration there is for the health care system and how costly it is to navigate,\" says Chris Jennings, who served as a health policy adviser in the Clinton and Obama administrations. \"What they're saying is, 'Let's use Medicare as a way to simplify and makes this more affordable.' And there will be all sorts of different ways.\"  Jennings added he sees \"no appetite for small incremental change, but there is a difference in how aggressive you can be in addressing these issues.\"\u00a0 \"Which is the fastest, best way we can address cost complexity and coverage?\" he said. \"This is the debate we are about to kick off on.\"\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Sharpening their 2020 election message, House Democrats on Thursday pushed through legislation that would empower Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and offer new benefits for seniors. The vote comes as the House Judiciary Committee considers articles of impeachment against the president. The vote along party lines was 230 to 192. Two Republicans supported the bill. Speaker Nancy Pelosi's bill would cap Medicare recipients' out-of-pocket costs for medicines at $2,000 a year. It would use about $360 billion of its projected 10-year savings from lower drug costs to establish Medicare coverage for dental care, hearing, and vision, filling major gaps for seniors. But the legislation has no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate, and the White House has issued a veto threat. Still, Democrats saw a victory in the message their bill sends to voters. \"I think that it is going to be too hot to handle for the Republicans,\" said Pelosi. Republicans have argued that Democrats are more focused on impeachment than putting forward new legislation. Pelosi is claiming bragging rights because her bill would deliver on the promise that President Trump made as a candidate in 2016, when he said he would \"negotiate like crazy\" to lower prescription drug prices for Medicare recipients. It's a pledge that Mr. Trump has backed away from as president. For months, Pelosi's office and the White House had talked privately about Medicare negotiations. But the sides went their own ways partly because administration officials concluded her approach could never win support among congressional Republicans. Mr. Trump now favors a bipartisan compromise in the Senate that would limit drug price increases and cap what seniors pay out-of-pocket, but would not authorize Medicare negotiations. Negotiations are \"the heart of the matter,\" Pelosi insisted. High prescription drug prices consistently register as the public's top health care concern. But it's unclear in a capital divided over Mr. Trump's impeachment that any major legislation will pass before next year's elections. Pelosi's bill \"is a serious proposal but everyone knows that the Senate isn't going to go for it,\" said John Rother, CEO of the National Coalition on Health. \"It is about legislating, but even more it's about establishing a platform that Democrats can run on going into the next election cycle and lays the groundwork for legislative activity in 2021,\" Rother said. His organization is an umbrella group that represents health care industry groups and consumers. The pharmaceutical industry is strongly opposed to the bill. Among the groups backing it is AARP. Medicare's popular prescription drug benefit is delivered through private insurers. Republicans say the government has no business setting prices for medicines. They argue that the hit on the pharmaceutical industry's bottom line will stifle innovation, discouraging investment in the hunt for cures for Alzheimer's and other intractable illnesses. \"Drugs that save lives will not be around,\" said Congressman Greg Walden. \"Innovation goes on the rocks; lives will be lost.\" House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California accused Democrats of putting politics over solutions, \"catering to their progressive base by opening the door to a government takeover of our prescription drug market.\" Republicans point to a major concern about the legislation: that it would result in fewer drugs coming to market. But there's debate about the extent of the expected impact. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates about 3% to 10% fewer new drugs. The White House Council of Economic Advisers says it could be much higher, up to one-third of new medications. Democratic Congressman Bobby Scott, who helped write the Pelosi bill, said Republicans predicting the drug pipeline will dry up are using scare tactics. \"Any drug that's out there, we're going to have access to,\" he said. \"The U.S. would still be the biggest market.\" The bipartisan Senate bill the White House is now backing steers clear of negotiations. It would cap seniors' out-of-pocket costs, at $3,100 a year, and require drugmakers to pay Medicare rebates if companies raise prices above inflation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hasn't said if or when he'll bring it to the floor. Inflation rebates are included in Pelosi's bill as well, so there's considerable overlap. But Pelosi's measure goes further with several unique features, including: Congressional budget experts estimate the price negotiations provisions of Pelosi's bill would save $456 billion over 10 years. After subtracting for new Medicare benefits, that still leaves money for medical research, community health centers, and countering the opioid epidemic. Democrats have named the drug legislation after the late Congressman Elijah Cummings, who early on sought a dialogue with Trump on drug prices. Cummings, as chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, was a target of Mr. Trump outbursts on Twitter. Before leaving Washington next week, Congress must also vote to fund the government and pass the National Defense Authorization Act.",

According to the latest Fox News poll, nearly half of voters want President Trump impeached and removed from office; 4% say he should be impeached but not removed; and 41% oppose impeaching Mr. Trump. But will the impeachment proceedings have any bearing on how Americans will vote next November? Political correspondent Ed O'Keefe heard from voters across the country in recent days about what matters to them in this upcoming election. And the results, like the polls, show a split down the middle. Voters are mostly focused on other issues \u2014 not on impeachment.  In Iowa, O'Keefe asked Suzy Forristall, \"In Washington right now they're consumed by impeachment. What do you think ought to happen on that issue?\" \"I think they're doing the exact right thing,\" Forristal replied. \"I trust Nancy Pelosi, gathering more information.\" In South Carolina, though, John Marcoux said, \"Nancy Pelosi's got a desk full of things that she could be working on. They're taking all their time with the craziness.\" Mississippian Mark McCord said, \"I think it is a bunch of made-up stuff they are trying to impeach Donald Trump. They have no grounds, he has broken no law.\" In Iowa, when asked to define the important issues, Leslie said, \"Climate change is one of the most important issues for me. I think that's certainly an existential issue that affects every single American, every single citizen of the world.\" In Maine, Marie Hurd said, \"Raising the minimum wage, because there are too many people working too many jobs.\" In Iowa Nick Covington said, \"I definitely think education.

There ought to be a place for them to go, a public option.\"  Leslie was asked, \"How closely are you paying attention to this go around, as opposed to maybe years past?\" \"I'm definitely paying more attention to this process than I ever have in the past, because I think it is so incredibly crucial,\" she replied.  In Connecticut Germaine Valentine said, \"I want to hear where both sides are coming from because you can't make an informed decision just listening to one side.\"",

And now that more than 20 of them are running for president, they're starting to stake out their positions on how to overhaul the system.\u00a0 According to\u00a0CBS News polling in July, health care is a dominant issue among Democrats in early voting state, particularly when it comes to out-of-pocket costs. However, Democratic candidates disagree on the best approach to address the issue. One of the most talked about Democratic proposals would establish a new single-payer government-run insurance program as outlined in Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" Act. Sanders' bill would make private insurance supplemental for those who choose to get it, while aiming to provide a basic level of care for all Americans paid for by taxes. A similar bill by the same name has also been introduced in the House. However, other candidates have used the phrase Medicare for All while embracing something different than what Sanders is proposing. And other pieces of legislation and proposals touted by some candidates would stop short of creating a national single-payer health care system.\u00a0 The Choose Medicare Act, for example, establishes public health plans in the individual, small group and large group markets. The Medicare at 50 Act would allow people to buy into the program at age 50 instead of 65, the current age of enrollment. The State Public Option Act would allow residents not already eligible be able to buy into a state Medicaid plan. And Medicare for America would provide a public program for the uninsured, people who purchased insurance on the open market, people on Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP, all while maintaining employer-sponsored insurance.\u00a0 Here's what the candidates have been saying about health care.",

            "article_content": "In many ways, September has been a rough month for Bernie Sanders and his campaign. They have dealt with staff shakeups in New Hampshire and Iowa, and multiple polls in recent weeks have shown the senator's support in early states slipping.\u00a0 But on the trail, Sanders and his supporters still engage in emotional and impassioned dialogues that demonstrate the fierce devotion some have to the Vermont senator.\u00a0 Earlier this week at a \"Medical Debt Town Hall\" in Des Moines, that loyalty was on full display. The senator spoke with a number of voters who shared personal stories of medical-related burdens \u2013 both financial and emotional. \"I was planning to sign up to get a bill to remind me of this horrible time in my life where I lost this pregnancy and lost my fertility,\" said April Birch. \"I was despondent, I was depressed. I was wanting to die at some points.\" Birch told Sanders that she suffered a miscarriage between jobs and coverage plans. She was in and out of the hospital in a one day and left with $40,000 of debt. She eventually applied for state-sponsored Medicare and her bills were paid \"overnight.\" Birch said she would forgo employer-sponsored health care \"without a second thought,\" because of the relief Medicare provided her. \"Out of all the presidential candidates, you're the one that I trust to make this happen,\" she told Sanders. What Sanders is trying to make happen is a two-pronged approach to fundamentally restructure the American health care system through \"Medicare for All\" and his medical debt forgiveness plan. Medicare for All, Sanders' signature proposal, would establish a single-payer government healthcare program and eliminate private insurance, except for cosmetic procedures. The system would be paid for by rebalancing the federal budget. On the trail, Sanders often argues that the average family would pay more in taxes, but ultimately save more money than they are today. Sanders' medical debt forgiveness plan would call for the government pay outstanding medical bills, and cancel the debt from credit scores. It would also rework bankruptcy and debt collections rules. For his supporters, Sanders' policies promise a balm to overwhelming pain. One attendee at Sunday's town hall told Sanders debt collectors entered her son's room while he was being cared for in the ICU. \"They had to call security on me because I lost my mind,\" she said. \"There's no way out for us other than you, Bernie.\" As others shared their stress and agony, audience members wiped tears from their eyes. Sanders at times paced back and forth, shaking his head as he stared at the ground. The senator consoled those who shared. \"You're among friends,\" he told them. The event came about a week after a Reno, Nevada town hall where a veteran with stage-IV Huntington's disease told Sanders he was so overwhelmed with medical debt that he contemplates taking his own life. \"It's heartbreaking. This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world. We should not have people delaying the medical treatment they need, not taking their medicine, going bankrupt.\" Sanders told CBS News Monday. \"It is an outrage, it is cruel, it is barbaric.\" A\u00a02016 Kaiser Family Foundation and New York Times survey\u00a0found that more than 25 percent of Americans struggled to pay a recent medical bill. Last year the health care journal\u00a0Heath Affairs\u00a0found that one in six have unpaid medically-related dues. Fifty-three percent of those bills, according to the report, were $600 or less. In all, they estimated American medical debt totaled $81 billion. Sanders' debt-waving health care platform aims to alleviate financial and physical stress, as does his plan to cancel all student debt and make public universities and HBCU's tuition free. To balance that spending, Sander's introduced an \"Extreme Wealth Tax Plan\" Tuesday morning in Iowa. \"Enough is enough. We are going to take on the billionaire class, substantially reduce wealth inequality in America and stop our democracy from turning into a corrupt oligarchy,\" said Sanders. The plan would tax the ultra-wealthy in eight different brackets. Americans with a net worth between $32-50 million would pay a one percent tax. That progresses by one percent for those with more wealth, capping at an eight percent tax for Americans worth more than $10 billion. He joins HUD Secretary Julian Castro and Senator Elizabeth Warren in calling for a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans. But no other Democratic candidate for president has proposed the cancelling of medical debt. It is that on paper comparison, most notably with Warren, that has been the thorn in the Sanders campaign side. Recent polls have shown Sanders behind and dropping in\u00a0Iowa\u00a0and\u00a0New Hampshire, while others show him\u00a0ahead. But at Sanders events, his supporters show unwavering devotion to him. \"I'm a doctor, I've got a prescription and it's Medicare for All,\" said one medical debt town hall attendee. \"We're leaving here today with another prescription in our pocket. That prescription is you, senator. Eighteen months from now, it's \"Mr. President.\" On the road it's clear that Sanders' appeal burns bright in the eyes of his supporters. His challenge this election is to get that fire to not just burn bright, but burn wide across the country. CBS News reporter covering climate change and energy.",

            "article_content": "Democratic contenders for the 2020 presidential election need to ensure that their health care proposals need to take into account union-negotiated insurance plans, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said on Thursday. The expansion of America's health care system has been one of the major issues differentiating candidates on the campaign trail. While some of the Democratic candidates have called for a single-payer system such as Medicare for All, which would enroll all Americans on a government plan, others have pushed for more modest measures to expand health care coverage without eliminating private insurance plans. The head of the nation's largest labor federation told reporters at a breakfast held by the Christian Science Monitor that \"there is no question that ultimately we need to establish a single-payer system, but there has to be a role for those hard, hard-fought-for, high-quality plans that we've negotiated.\"\u00a0 Trumka said if the United States were to eventually adopt a plan like Medicare for All, it would generate huge savings for employers \u2014 the question is what then happens to those savings. \"What we're saying is our plans, we've negotiated hard and given up wages to get there; there has to be a way for us to recoup that.\" \u00a0 The labor federation president indicated it is still too early for his organization to endorse any candidate, but that when they do, the candidate would have to have a large groundswell of support. \"Any endorsement of a candidate will come from the bottom up from our members to our Executive Council,\" Trumka said. The AFL-CIO Executive Council requires a 70 percent vote for the organization to endorse any candidate. Although he would not speak to any particular candidate, Trumka was encouraged that the 2020 Democratic contenders are all talking about workers' rights and unions \u2014   and meeting with union members across the country. \"That's a big plus,\" Trumka said. \"I think the lesson that Democrats and these candidates particularly have come to understand is unless you talk about the economic issues that effect working people, you are not going to get elected,\" Trumka said. The candidates have made kitchen-table economics the centerpiece of their campaigns, as opposed to during the 2016 election when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton placed defeating Donald Trump above addressing economic issues. Trumka hopes this reprioritization of the economy will drive workers to the voting booth in the next election. Trumka noted that a key factor in President Trump's election victories in the crucial rust belt states Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania was his campaign promise to renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). While he credited Mr. Trump for his willingness to take on \"the worst agreement that ever happened,\" Trumka said \"the proposed replacement still falls short of what we need.\" In order to help facilitate a \"pro-worker\" new NAFTA, Trumka announced he will be leading a delegation of labor leaders to Mexico next week to meet with Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. The delegation, which leaves on Wednesday, will voice to Lopez Obrador the labor movement's concerns over President Trump's revised NAFTA, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). \u00a0 While Trumka feels \u00a0L\u00f3pez Obrador has been a \"friend of the labor movement,\" Mexico \"has yet to demonstrate that it has the resources and the infrastructure to follow through on its promised reforms.\" Mexico needs to show how it will ensure workers' rights to negotiate fair wages, Trumka told reporters.\u00a0 Other enforcement issues Trumka feels Mexico needs to address include dispute settlement mechanisms and stemming the continued flow of trade despite agreement violations. \"We want to get to 'Yes,'\" Trumka said, but if Mexico can't follow through on enforcing labor law reforms, then the new trade agreement is a non-starter. \"At this point I believe it's been pretty clear that without the support of the labor movement in the United States, in Mexico, and in Canada, the new NAFTA will meet the same fate as TPP,\" Trumka said, referencing the defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement. The White House hopes to send legislation to ratify the USMCA to Congress in September following the summer recess. Although the AFL-CIO leader said he has a good working relationship with U.S. trade representative Richard Lighthizer, the official in charge of trade negotiations, Trumka is not in favor of the trade agreement in its current form without enforcement guarantees. \"If the administration insists on an up or down vote right now, we would oppose it, and I think we would be successful in opposing it,\" Trumka said.",

Kamala Harris \u2014 two of the highest-polling candidates in the crowded primary \u2014 took turns criticizing their respective health care plans at the second night of the second Democratic debate. Biden cast Harris' proposal to build a \"Medicare for All\" system with a role for employer-sponsored private insurance as unrealistic, while the California senator denounced the former vice president's plan to add a so-called \"public option\" to the system created by President Obama's Affordable Care Act as insufficient. Biden accused Harris of endorsing different plans and expressed skepticism about her current proposal, which he said would take 10 years to accomplish, cost $3 trillion and lead to people loosing their private employer-based insurance.\u00a0 \"This is the single most important issue facing the public,\" the former Delaware senator said. \"And to be very blunt and to be very straightforward, you can't beat President Trump with double talk on this plan.\" Harris swiftly responded, saying Biden was \"simply inaccurate.\" \"Under our plan, we will ensure that everyone has access to healthcare. Your plan, by contrast, leaves out almost 10 million Americans,\" Harris said, pointing directly at the former vice president. \"So, I think that you should really think about what you're saying, but be reflective and understand that the people of America want access to health care \u2014 and do not want cost to their barrier to getting it.\" After Biden and Harris sparred, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, one of the more progressive candidates on stage Wednesday night, suggested that both Biden and Harris' plans were too timid and would not offer all Americans adequate and affordable health care. \u00a0 \"I don't understand why Democrats on this stage are fear-mongering about universal health care.

I made money on that book,\" Sanders said, adding that there are no \"great revelations\" to be found. Some Democrats have criticized Sanders for not releasing his tax returns. Presidential candidates such as Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, and Amy Klobuchar, along with Gov. Jay Inslee, have all released their returns. Sanders, who is known for railing against the extra wealthy, told\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0on Tuesday that he is a millionaire. \"I wrote a best-selling book,\" he told the Times. \"If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.\" In his interview with O'Keefe, Sanders primarily spoke about his plan to reintroduce his signature \"Medicare for All\" plan, which would expand government health coverage to every American, on Wednesday. Sanders said he disagreed with estimates indicating that the plan would cost tens of trillions of dollars to implement. \"We are spending twice as much per capita as any other nation,\" Sanders said about the current health care system. \"What our system does is get rid of insurance companies and drug companies making billions of dollars in profit every single year.\" Sanders said that Medicare for All would cover \"all basic health needs,\" but not anything cosmetic. \"So basically Blue Cross Blue Shield would be reduced to nose jobs?\" O'Keefe asked. \"Something like that,\" Sanders said.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Amy Klobuchar unveiled a plan on \"CBS This Morning\" Friday to provide a cure and treatment options for some of the most aggressive chronic conditions facing the country's elderly population, including Alzheimer's disease, by 2025. The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate considers the issue to be one that hits close to home; her father has struggled with Alzheimer's. \"One of the things you realize when you have someone in your family -- for me, my dad is 91, thankfully it didn't hit him till later -- but you see them growing more and more distant, not in the heart but in the mind, and you realize sometimes they may not even quite know who you are, and that's a hard moment when that happens,\" Klobuchar said. Klobuchar is not alone in her struggle -- there are currently 14 million people who have someone with Alzheimer's in their family, something the Minnesota senator said the country is \"not really getting ready for.\" \"We're going to see even more and more of it,\" she said. Beyond assisting people with Alzheimer's and other chronic medical conditions, her comprehensive proposal would also call for strengthening Medicare and Social Security, reducing drug prices, creating personal savings accounts to help Americans save for retirement and ensure paid family leave for all. \"It is of course about getting a cure and treatment, that's a lot in this plan, about getting us there by 2025 and investing, but it's also about the caregivers,\" said Klobuchar. She said her proposal would be paid for by imposing a tax on trust funds that are normally untaxed, resulting in an estimated $200 billion. \"If you started putting that at a normal tax rate ... that brings in a lot of money that I think is better spent on the rest of the people in this country that need help with retirement or need help to take care of a family member,\" she said. Her plan also aims to address mental health care for seniors by pushing for suicide prevention campaigns, expansion of access to treatment and increased training for medical professionals to better identify mental health issues at an earlier rate. Meanwhile, as the Trump administration continues its efforts in the courts to strike down the Affordable Care Act, Klobuchar said she'd support a constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to health care for all Americans. \"If we had the political environment where we could pass something like that, that would be good because I see health care as a right and not a privilege,\" she said. For now, the candidate said her focus was on protecting the act, also known as Obamacare, so Americans \"can't get thrown off their insurance\" as well as building upon the existing law in order to bring down the rising costs of prescription drugs and allowing seniors to negotiate Medicare prices. \"If the Trump administration is going to keep trying to take those things away from people we're going to fight back,\" she said. Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kamala Harris said Friday that she does not support eliminating private health insurance, after she and Sen. Bernie Sanders raised their hands in response to a question from debate moderators about whether they would abolish private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan at the Democratic debate Thursday. Harris told \"CBS This Morning\" on Friday that she had misheard the question by debate moderator Lester Holt. Holt had posed the question, \"Many people watching at home have health insurance through their employer. Who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan?\"\u00a0 Harris and Sanders were the only two to raise their hands. The California Democrat said that she had interpreted the question to mean, \"Would you be willing to give up your private insurance?\" She said that her answer was for herself personally, but that she believed private insurance could still supplement \"Medicare for All.\"\u00a0 \"I am supportive of Medicare for All. And under Medicare for All policy, private insurance certainly exist for supplemental coverage,\" Harris told \"CBS This Morning.\" \"But under Medicare for All, in my vision of it, we would actually extend benefits.\" Of the 20 candidates who appeared at the debate this week, only Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren support fully abolishing private health insurance. Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Senator Bernie Sanders' supporters  can be spotted wearing black shirts that read \"Medicare for All.\" At house parties in Iowa, you'll sometimes see \"Harris for President\" hats. And on airplanes bound for Des Moines, you might see travelers with \"Team Pete\" pins and colorful \"Mayor Pete\" T-shirts. In a crowded race for the Democratic presidential nomination,  merchandise can serve as a major source of marketing for presidential hopefuls. And in a primary cycle where, for the first time, making the debate stage also depends on meeting small-donor thresholds, having supporters spend $35 on a hat or just  $4.99 on a set of stickers could go a long way.\u00a0 That's because when it comes to campaign merchandise, candidates do not have to separate purchases made from their online stores or at events from other donations when filing with the Federal Election Commission, so every purchase appears as another small-dollar donation. \"As small-dollar donations become more important to being able to show both local support but then also to technically get into the debate, we look at merch as a massive opportunity to raise funds outside of just begging for dollars via emails,\" said Victor Nguyen-Long, creative director for the progressive group ACRONYM.\u00a0 \"At the end of the day, everybody wants something in return for their money, right? And merch is a simple way to be able to get something tangible.\" With the many ways to capitalize on merchandise in mind, Campaigns  are willing to dish out big bucks to build their brand and rake in more revenue.\u00a0 In the first half of the year, FEC filings show, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign doled out more than $1.2 million for gear; Bernie Sanders' campaign spent more than $900,000  for buttons, stickers, signs and T-shirts; Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign paid more than $500,000 for merchandise orders; and former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign spent more than $150,000 on similar goods despite jumping in the race at the end of April. So what are the candidates putting out? Clicking through hundreds  of items online reveals campaigns are working to make sure they have something for everyone and keep their diehard supporters coming back for more. There's everything from t-shirts and yard signs to fanny packs and pet collars \u2013     even candidate branded calculators. \u00a0 But what sells? For entrepreneur Andrew Yang, merchandise is a major component  of his fundraising strategy. His campaign announced in October that it raised $10 million in the third quarter of the year, with nearly a quarter of it came from merchandise sales. One of Yang's bestsellers is his \"Make America Think Harder\" (MATH) hat. When the  campaign first launched the hats in March, they limited sales to just 500.\u00a0 The hats sold out in 22 minutes. Since then, Yang has sold 32,000 hats, raising about $1.2 million for the campaign or about 8% of all revenues as of mid-October.\u00a0 According to the campaign, there have been several days of six-figure  merchandise sales. When they announced a limited edition MATH hat with gold writing, the store sold 2,000 in just 36 hours, totaling $150,000 in revenue. Now, Yang even has a blue hat emoji in his Twitter handle, and supporters known as his #YangGang are also  adding the emoji to their names on social media to signify their support.\u00a0 \"I took inspiration from street fashion,  with limited editions, exclusivity, collectibles,\" said Yang's Director of Brand & Merchandise Andrew Frawley in a statement provided by the campaign. Other bestsellers for Yang have been a shot glasses,  t-shirts with an image of Yang in high school, and \"Math. Money. Marijuana\" t-shirts, which came about after an analysis of Yang social media posts found tweets about legalizing marijuana performed well. Meanwhile, it's the classics that have been providing consistent  sales for Buttigieg's campaign, like their 2020 navy t-shirt or anything that says \"Boot Edge Edge,\" the correct pronunciation of the South Bend mayor's name. Limited edition gear has also sold well for Buttigieg, who's been rising in recent polls. The campaign  says its one-off \"Eco Tee\" sold out in just six days. After a bee landed on Buttigieg's tie at a September campaign event in Iowa and refused to leave, they came up with a \"Bee Tee\" which was available for less than 18 hours. In the last four days of  September, the campaign sold 2,700 \"Rules of the Road\" t-shirts, which hauled in more than $72,000 in sales. Elizabeth Warren's campaign has been selling  a variety of gear with its slogan \"Dream Big Fight Hard,\" but they've also embraced a theme that's come up on the campaign trail. Warren has pushed a significant number of policy proposals, leading to the slogan \"Warren has a plan for that.\" The  phrase now adorns t-shirts, yard signs, totes, and beer koozies. Another popular Warren motto comes from none other than Republican  Senator Mitch McConnell. \"She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted,\" said the majority leader after a 2017 speech by Warren on the Senate floor was cut short. \"She Persisted\" now adorns t-shirts, bags,  pencils, beer glasses (persist responsibly) and even \"Purr-sist\" cat collars on her campaign website. Joe Biden's campaign is embracing the  candidate's well-known name along with some of his signature looks. According to his campaign, the \"Cup O'Joe\" mug is its bestseller. His shop also pays homage to Biden's affection for aviator sunglasses with images of Biden in his signature shades. The image also embellishes t-shirts, tote bags, and buttons. \"From legacy items like the Cup O'Joe and staples like the  Biden for President classic white tee to newer products like the patriotic Aviator Crewneck and the LGBTQ Pride collection - an issue important to the VP - we've seen a lot of excitement for all things Joe Biden,\" said Jamal Brown, the Biden campaign's national press secretary. Brown also said the campaign recently unveiled a new collection for the fall season, including shirts encouraging early voting. And as Biden takes aim at President Trump, a new phrase is  popping up on apparel. On the campaign trail, the former vice president frequently alleges that Mr. Trump solicited the Ukrainian government for help because he is scared Biden would \"beat him like a drum\" in a general election. His campaign website now sports a series of t-shirts covered  in drums with the phrase. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, often likes to talk  about how he changed the political conversation by bringing his left-wing policies into the mainstream. While his online store displays some traditional campaign gear with his name, it also has shirts, buttons, stickers, and mugs embracing signature  policy proposals, like \"Medicare for All\" and \"College for All.\" His website also brought back a popular phrase from his 2016 presidential bid with \"Feel the Bern\" fanny-packs and car magnets. During the July Democratic debate, Sanders bragged that the Medicare for All proposal now embraced by many of his competitors was his idea. \"I wrote the damn bill,\" he said to applause from supporters.\u00a0 Before that debate even ended, his campaign emailed supporters soliciting donations in exchange for \"I wrote the damn bill\" stickers. Other candidates have also tried to monopolize on standout debate lines. Senator Cory  Booker has \"future president\" merchandise, a reference to Biden calling him that at the July debate. Senator Kamala Harris sells t-shirts with her stand0out line from the June debate: \"That little girl was me.\" But when it comes to branding and merchandise, Mr. Trump has more than just an incumbent's advantage. When Mr. Trump took the stage at a recent rally in Dallas, he was greeted by a sea of supporters in red baseball caps. Those red MAGA hats, which are much more visible at events than t-shirts or pins might be, have been purchased en masse by Trump supporters since the 2016 Republican primaries.\u00a0 FEC records show the Trump campaign in 2015 and 2016 spent  more than $15 million alone at Ace Specialties for campaign merchandise including t-shirts, hats, stickers and yard signs. It spent more than $2.5 million at the company Cali-Fame, which manufactures hats.\u00a0 As he mounts his re-election bid, Mr. Trump's campaign has spent  more than $650,000 on merchandise in the first half of 2019 alone. Items range from hats and t-shirts to packs of recyclable straws embellished with Mr. Trump's name, a reference to the paper straws now used in several municipalities after plastic ones were banned. \u00a0 \"President Trump is a master of communication and branding  and his campaign merchandise is emblematic of that,\" Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told CBS News in a statement.\u00a0 \"Whether it's the over 1 million red MAGA hats sold, plastic straws, or fun one-off t-shirts, the campaign merchandise lets  voters show their support of President Trump and his policies. It gives people a little ownership of the re-election campaign and gives them high quality merchandise in exchange for their donations.\" As far as overall fundraising goes, Mr. Trump's campaign, along with the Republican  National Committee, is currently leading individual Democrats in the race. But when it comes to small-dollar donations, Sanders surpassed the president in the third quarter. The Trump campaign said it received more than 1,056,000 individual donations during that period, while Sanders  received 1,400,000 million individual donations. It's unclear, however, what that translates to when it comes to campaign gear. Eleanor Watson contributed to this report. CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

            "article_content": "JOE BIDEN VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON\u00a0\"If you ever played 'King of the Hill' that's what the debate is to me,\" International Association of Firefighters General President Harold Schaitberger told CBS News. \"Everybody else has to pull the king down off the hill.\"\u00a0 Schaitberger is one of Joe Biden's biggest backers. He's the head of the 318,000 firefighters union who endorsed the former vice president earlier this year. Schaitberger thinks Biden \"needs to be very assertive\" on healthcare to draw a clear contrast between his healthcare plan and those of the competition. After union members\u00a0over the summer expressed concerns\u00a0their negotiated plans would be limited under \"Medicare-for-All\" plans, Schaitberger said some of Biden's rivals have \"come toward Joe Biden's position on this issue\" to protect union-negotiated plans.\u00a0Will Biden highlight this? How will Warren's steady rise in the polls play out on the debate stage with Biden?\u00a0This is their first debate together, a match-up his campaign\u00a0last week\u00a0called an \"irrelevant\" media narrative, since there are eight other candidates on stage. Will the others try to slow Warren down? She undoubtedly received the rowdiest welcome this weekend at New Hampshire Democratic convention, which is just next door to the state she represents. Nonetheless, Schaitberger argues \"the majority of the voting Democratic primary constituents are much more in Joe Biden's lane than the energy and the excitement that is witnessed at some of these rallies or at the convention floor.\" Will Biden's long record on racial issues be questioned again?\u00a0This upcoming debate is at the second-largest HBCU in the country and throughout the summer Biden has maintained his substantial lead with black voters. \"I think his long record on racial issues is what is working for him,\" Schaitberger said. He\u00a0 added, \"I think there's a view that those who want to take a shot in that arena should be careful, as I think it could be viewed as a cheap shot, and it would be counter-productive.\" CORY BOOKER\u00a0 VIA CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN: Booker has been polling in the single digits as he enters the third presidential debate in Houston. A recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll showed that in Iowa and New Hampshire Booker attracted just 2% support among likely voters. Booker has had the resources and staff on the ground in both states earlier in the election cycle. Asked in New Hampshire on Friday about his preparations in the upcoming debate, Booker said he's going to be following the same advice he received before the second debate, which is to \"go out there and be yourself.\" The New Jersey senator argues that the differences among any of the Democrats is \"miniscule\" and that this election isn't about \"having the right policy plans.\" For him, the 2020 election a \"moral moment\" and is urging voters toward bigger change and a \"civic grace.\" \u00a0 The question for him is whether he can make that argument resonate with voters in this third debate. If not, he's likely to remain mired in the low single digits.\u00a0 PETE BUTTIGIEG VIA CAMPAIGN REPORTER JACK TURMAN:\u00a0Seven percent of likely voters in Iowa would pick Buttigieg today, according the CBS News Battleground Tracker poll. And in New Hampshire, Buttigieg garnered eight percent support.\u00a0 On the campaign trail, Buttigieg has been saying that his campaign is entering a new phase. He's ramping up his staffing and recently announced opening 20 campaign offices in 20 days in Iowa and 12 campaign offices in New Hampshire.\u00a0 In a press gaggle in New Hampshire this past weekend, Buttigieg said he and his team feel \"energized\" heading into the debate. \"You can tell in this post-Labor Day phase. We're just at a new level with the campaign,\" Buttigieg said.\u00a0 Buttigieg has delivered solid, if less memorable performances than some of his competitors in the first two debates. The question for him is, will he have a \"moment\" at the debate that will allow the ground game to organize and materialize support?\u00a0 JULIAN CASTRO VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER TIM PERRY\u00a0Castro has continued to expand his campaign and name recognition after two strong debate performances.\u00a0 Since the last debate, Castro has continued to release policy proposals and participate in candidate forums, but has yet to break through to the top tier. \u00a0 Castro campaign spokesman Sawyer Hackett tells CBS News that during this debate Castro plans to make the case to voters that he \"is the candidate that can best bring out the Obama coalition: young, minority and enthusiastic voters in states not typically won by Democrats.\"\u00a0Can Castro use the debate in his home state of Texas to finally catapult him into the upper tier of Democratic candidates? KAMALA HARRIS VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER STEPHANIE RAMIREZ\u00a0This debate is another opportunity for Kamala Harris to introduce herself to voters. With Elizabeth Warren on the debate stage for the first time against Joe Biden, it's not as likely we'll see a Harris-Biden match-up Thursday. Harris takes the stage this week after a\u00a0gaffe\u00a0in New Hampshire last weekend she later apologized for and following a drop in her standing in the latest\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, which also found supporters leaving Harris in favor of Warren and Biden.\u00a0 Harris will be heading into this third debate with new policies to tout, including her climate change and criminal justice reform plans.\u00a0Campaign spokesperson Ian Sams tell CBS News the focus Thursday will be on defeating President Donald Trump as well as \"bringing the country together by defeating him and unifying Americans around solutions to our common challenges.\"\u00a0 Sams added, \"She'll make the connection between his hatred and division and our inability to get things done for the country.\" AMY KLOBUCHAR VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER BO ERICKSON\u00a0At recent events the Minnesota senator has dubbed this third debate the \"playoffs.\"\u00a0While she'll physically be on the far left of the Thursday debate stage, her supporters have questioned to CBS News if it's better to politically use this debate opportunity to strike a blow to the more progressive-left ideas that she thinks are not feasible than continue to articulate the consensus issues she champions?\u00a0Other Klobuchar supporters say that while they like her more moderate stances on some issues, almost all say they like her \"Minnesota nice\" personality. Yet congenial moments have not been highly rewarded in the past two debates \u2013 and if this is playoff season she will need a win of some sort to stay in the game. BETO O'ROURKE VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER TIM PERRY\u00a0Since the last debate, O'Rourke was forced to relaunch his campaign in the wake of the shooting in his hometown of El Paso. O'Rourke has shifted his campaign style and has made attacking President Trump and gun control central issues of his campaign. \u00a0 A campaign spokesperson tells CBS News, \"At the debate, Beto will be communicating the same message he's been bringing to the trail the last few weeks: telling the stories of communities and people that Democrats often count out, taking the fight directly to Donald Trump, calling for bold solutions on gun violence.\" This will include O'Rourke's newfound call for a mandatory buyback of assault weapons.\u00a0 He is still the only 2020 candidate with this position.\u00a0 While O'Rourke struggled in his previous debates and failed to \"get a moment,\" a spokesperson says \"he's not going to engage in stunts and one-liners, or indulge attempts by the moderators to pit candidates against each other for the benefit of good TV. The seriousness of the moment demands more than that.\"\u00a0Will Beto be able to control the conversation on gun control and emerge from Thursday's debate as the candidate with the sharpest and clearest ideas on that particular issue? BERNIE SANDERS VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER CARA KORTE\u00a0He \"wrote the damn bill.\" That was Bernie Sanders' triumphant moment in last month's debate, when he defended his signature issue, Medicare-for-All. The Sanders campaign is hoping that he replicates that moment on Thursday. Sanders' challenge this election is defending his progressive turf and showing voters that he's the greatest champion of the left. Healthcare, climate, workers' rights \u2014 he's got a plan for it all and will be selling it Thursday night. But Sanders' viral line from the last debate came in response to a protesting Tim Ryan. He's not on this stage. Neither is Senator Michael Bennet, nor any other outspoken moderate standing on the outskirts of current polling.\u00a0If Sanders doesn't have a foil on stage, can he create a spark without friction?\u00a0 ELIZABETH WARREN VIA CBS NEWS CAMPAIGN REPORTER ZAK HUDAK\u00a0This debate is a big one for Elizabeth Warren because it's the first time she'll be on the same stage as Joe Biden. And it's happening as polls increasingly show her within striking distance of the former vice president. We saw in the last round that Warren and her rival in the progressive wing of the party, Bernie Sanders, are reluctant to attack one another. But Warren's goal of \"big structural change\" is at odds with Biden's moderate message in a way it isn't with Sanders' progressive one.\u00a0Thursday night will almost certainly illustrate how different Warren and Biden are. ANDREW YANG VIA CBS NEWS POLITICAL UNIT AP SARAH EWALL-WICE\u00a0Entrepreneur Andrew Yang has been one of the surprise undercard candidates to qualify for the debate, but he has a prime podium position on the stage between two candidates more well known to political circles: Senator Kamala Harris and former Texas Representative Beto O'Rourke.\u00a0 On Saturday, Yang told supporters outside the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention that he had been preparing for the event with a mock debate including people playing the roles of the other candidates. He hinted there could be a surprise in store. Will Yang be able to use the debate stage to expand his supporter base, known as the \"Yang Gang,\" or will he be overshadowed by all the other top contenders on one stage? DOWN SOUTH South Carolina Democratic voters continue to be concerned with healthcare, climate change and the economy. Ahead of this week's debate, voters like kindergarten teacher Glenna Broughton, say they hope these topics continue to resurface. \"I want something to make sure that our kids are able to succeed whether it's universal pre-K and also getting them ready for college,\" Broughton told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell. Tim Lewis, an advocate for rural communities, says that current foreign policy has removed the U.S. from the world stage. Any candidate who wants Lewis' vote needs to be able to articulate his or her \"big picture\" for the country. \"I think our president should be able to chew gum and walk at the same time and they should be able to handle and prioritize multiple issues,\" Lewis opined. Nonprofit director Amy Brennan says that she'll be watching and listening for the moral integrity of each candidate. \"I don't need to hear you bashing the candidate next to you for me to feel good about you, I want to hear about you,\" said Brennan. \"Right now we're in a mess and we need somebody who's going to put all the pieces back together.\" IN THE MIDDLE CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar & Adam Brewster\u00a0say they're starting to see more endorsements rolling out in Iowa.\u00a0 On Tuesday, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg unveiled a list of endorsements from 11 elected officials, former elected officials and Democratic activists. That includes former state representative and senator Jean Lloyd-Jones. The endorsement from 90-year-old Lloyd-Jones, a trailblazer for women's rights in the Hawkeye state, was the first Iowa endorsement the Buttigieg campaign publicly announced in a press release.\u00a0 \"He represents a generation far removed from mine, and he sees the world with new eyes,\" Lloyd-Jones said in a statement.\u00a0 Also this week, Senator Amy Klobuchar picked up her third state representative endorsement, from Molly Donahue. Donahue flipped a Republican held state house district in the Cedar Rapids area. Klobuchar and Joe Biden each have endorsements from three state legislators and trail only Senator Cory Booker. Six state legislators have endorsed Booker. PRE-DEBATE POLLING On the eve of the Houston debate, Quinnipiac University released a Democratic primary poll for Texas, notes\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice,\u00a0which shows Joe Biden topping the field with 28% of Democratic voters and independent voters who lean Democratic. Elizabeth Warren was in second place, with 18%, while Bernie Sanders and Texan Beto O'Rourke attracted 12%.\u00a0 Biden's support in the poll has dropped off a little from the 30% he had in June in this poll, and O'Rourke has also dropped 4 percentage points. Warren was the only one of the top contenders whose support has risen since June. She had 11% support in June. Sanders also dropped, compared to the 15% support he attracted in the earlier poll.\u00a0 Univision News also released a poll Tuesday. It showed that a majority of national Hispanic registered voters say they plan to vote for a Democrat, and they favor Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders. CBS News Political Unit associate producer Ellee Watson\u00a0notes Hispanic voters could hold significant sway over the 2020 presidential election\u00a0on a national scale, and that's especially the case in Texas. In 2018, two in five voters in Texas were Hispanic, and the number of Hispanic registered voters grew nearly twice as much as non-Hispanics between 2014 and 2018.\u00a0 The poll released by Univision News was conducted by Latino Decisions and Northstar Opinion and surveyed 1,043 national registered Hispanic voters from August 31 to September 6. The margin of error for the national poll is +/-3 percent.\u00a0 President Trump's approval rating among Latino registered voters stands at 22 percent, and 62 percent of American Hispanics say they are certain to vote for a Democrat in 2020. Of the Democratic candidates, Biden and Sanders lead the pack with 22 and 20 percent favorability respectively. Univision's Poll Director Dr. Sergio Garcia-Rios told reporters on a call that he has seen an increase in support for Senator Elizabeth Warren from 44 percent in June to 53 percent at the end of August. GOP WATCH While top Democratic presidential candidates are all gathered in Houston to debate, the Republican National Committee will be taking part in counterprogramming efforts, says\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. According to an RNC official, chairwoman Ronna McDaniel will be responding to debates with op-eds in English, Spanish and Mandarin. She will also join Trump campaign officials in Houston on Thursday to attend the Latinos for Trump \"Vamos to Victory\" event with about 100 attendees. The RNC will also be monitoring the debate and surrounding commentary to fact check and respond in real time. REPUBLICAN WINS LAST HOUSE SEAT OF 2018 CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro and associate producer Ellee Watson report GOP North Carolina State Senator Dan Bishop won the last 2018 House seat late Tuesday night against Democrat Dan McCready in a high-profile Congressional special election that both national parties were watching closely.\u00a0 The 9th District contains parts of the Charlotte suburbs, which Democrats were eyeing to see if changing populations would affect traditionally red suburbs that voted for Mr. Trump. McCready did see in increase from 2018 in Mecklenberg County, which contains parts of the Charlotte suburbs. However, he did failed to turn out the Democratic vote in more rural counties he won in 2018, such as Richmond and Cumberland county. The special election was a do-over of the November 2018 midterm election which was voided over allegations of ballot fraud.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Since the last debate, the\u00a0three Democratic front-runners\u00a0remain the same, but their current podium order has begun to shift. Senator Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders enter the stage tonight with new political shots and chasers: WARREN\u00a0\u2014 Elizabeth Warren will take the debate stage tonight with more momentum than she's had at any other point in the race so far, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak. She started the day by releasing a campaign finance reform plan that included new promises such as not taking donations over $200 from tech or bank executives, but it focused mostly on measures she's already suggested or promises she's made, like not holding large dollar fundraisers. The plan could be seen as preparation for a counter punch to potential attacks in the debate tonight. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, for example, has been contrasting his \"Medicare for All Who Want It\" plan with Warren's support for Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan. BIDEN\u00a0\u2014 It has been 26 days since the first reports of President Trump's request to a foreign government to investigate Biden and his son, Hunter, says\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson. Biden has hit back hard on the Trump claims of corruption, saying there is \"zero\" evidence of wrongdoing. But only within the last few days have both Biden and his son addressed the central questions of their Ukrainian connections. In an interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Hunter said he regrets taking the job and insists that he will not take foreign jobs if his father wins the presidency. Biden has added to this promise and says his family won't be holding White House jobs or attending executive office meetings. His allies believe these responses have been sufficient to ward off any criticism from other Democrat rivals, saying any such remarks would play in to Mr. Trump's hands. \"What you'll hear tonight from the VP is that first and foremost, we have to keep the focus on Donald Trump's unprecedented abuse of power,\" a Biden adviser told CBS News today. SANDERS\u00a0\u2014 Is it possible that we live in a world where Bernie Sanders' heart attack helps him, wonders\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Cara Korte? The bar is perhaps lower for him than it has been since he announced his candidacy (the first time). The senator has a chance to exceed expectations this evening. Could he do that by questioning Elizabeth Warren and her embrace of capitalism? Or her evasiveness about healthcare plan? Could he, when likely asked, say that his children or the children of his vice president would never be allowed to serve on the board of a foreign energy company? Either way, Sanders must perform tonight. His supporters will be checking to see that he's well. His detractors will be watching even closer. BERNIE SANDERS Bernie Sanders, on Monday's\u00a0Indigenous People's Day, became the fifth candidate, after Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, and Juli\u00e1n Castro, to oppose a proposed military expansion into the Desert National Wildlife Refuge, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin. While some of the\u00a0other White House hopefuls\u00a0have also cited the move's impact on wildlife and public lands, as highlighted by Nevada conservation activists, the Vermont Democrat focused his opposition on the area's cultural significance to tribes in southern Nevada. \"The U.S. Air Force's proposed expansion into the Desert National Wildlife Refuge is another example of the federal government breaking solemn promises and disregarding the sovereign rights of Native communities,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"I stand in solidarity with our Native American brothers and sisters in opposing this failure to protect tribal treaty.\" TOM STEYER Tom Steyer's campaign says he doesn't plan to throw any direct punches tonight in his first debate appearance in Ohio. The billionaire activist sees it as a chance to introduce himself to the American people. Campaign spokesperson Alberto Lammers tells\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0that Steyer \"spent the day in debate prep, meeting volunteers, and had lunch with family before a workout later this afternoon.\"\u00a0 Asked in September about her support for \"Medicare for All,\" Elizabeth Warren insisted at the\u00a0third presidential debate\u00a0that all Americans\u2014even those in rural communities\u2014could still seek treatment at their local hospitals under the universal healthcare plan. \"So let's be clear about this. People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals,\" the Massachusetts Democrat vowed.\u00a0 Ahead of tonight's matchup, Campaign reporters Alex Tin and LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0explore\u00a0how Democratic presidential candidates are debating which proposals are best to tackle the rural hospital crisis that has impacted places like early states Nevada and South Carolina. ON THE $$$ Federal candidates for president, the Senate and the House must file their third quarter fundraising numbers with the Federal Election Commission by the end of the day Tuesday. And while some candidates have already revealed their cash hauls from the months of July through September, the numbers will give a better glimpse of where the candidates stand heading into the end of the year said\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Sarah Ewall-Wice.\u00a0 It was previously\u00a0announced\u00a0that Bernie Sanders raised the most of any Democratic presidential candidate, with $25.3 million raised and more than $33 million cash on hand, while Elizabeth Warren was\u00a0close behind\u00a0with $24.6 million. Now we'll find out what they're spending that cash on and where it's coming from, be it voters in early states or contests that take place at later dates.\u00a0 We'll also get to see how some of the lower-tier candidates are working to stretch their smaller war chests, and if candidates are dolling out more cash than they are raking in. Former federal campaign officials tell CBS News it's OK for presidential candidates to up their spending, but ideally those funds need to go toward expanding ground game efforts at this stage in the race to really make a dent heading into the end of the year. Meanwhile, records are being broken when it comes to the Senate fundraising.\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ellee Watson &\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0report that Republican Senator Lindsey Graham's reelection campaign raised $3.29 million in the third quarter and has almost $8.4 million in the bank, according to a release from his campaign. Graham's team reports that this is the largest amount of money raised in a single quarter by a candidate in South Carolina's history. The previous record was set by Jim DeMint in 2004.\u00a0 Jaime Harrison, one of the Democrats looking to challenge Graham in 2020, posted $2.24 million in the third quarter and has $2.6 million cash on hand. As previously\u00a0reported\u00a0in CBS News 2020 Trail Markers, Harrison's haul beats the record for money raised in a single quarter by a U.S. Senate Democratic Challenger in South Carolina. Harrison set that record himself in the second quarter this year when he raised $1.5 million. GOP DOLLARS The Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee are in\u00a0week three of their \"Stop the Madness\" campaign targeting Democrats for their position on impeachment. The RNC has put up a $2 million television ad buy as well as a $350,000 digital ad buy on Facebook, YouTube, and Hulu to criticize Democrats for focusing on impeachment, reports\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0 According to a Senior Trump Campaign official, the committee and the Trump campaign have received 50,000 new donors in the last few weeks, and Trump Victory has received more than double its usual volunteer sign-ups.\u00a0 On this week's episode of \"Where Did You Get This Number?\",\u00a0CBS News' Director of Elections & Surveys Anthony Salvanto\u00a0takes listeners through the latest CBS News 2020 polls, what the campaigns are doing in Iowa, and how Joe Biden is doing in light of Elizabeth Warren's gains in the polls with\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporters Musadiq Bidar & Bo Erickson.",

            "article_content": "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The federal deficit for the 2019 budget year surged to $984.4 billion, its highest point in seven years, and is widely expected to top the $1 trillion mark in coming years. The 26% surge from the 2018 deficit of $779 billion that the government reported Friday reflected such factors as revenue lost from the 2017 Trump tax cut and a budget deal that added billions in spending for military and domestic programs. Forecasts by the Trump administration and the Congressional Budget Office project that the deficit will top $1 trillion in the current budget year. And the CBO estimates that the deficit will stay above $1 trillion over the next decade. Those projections stand in contrast to President Trump's campaign promises that even with revenue lost initially from his tax cuts, he would be able to eliminate the federal budget deficit with cuts in spending and increased growth generated by the tax cuts. The budget showed that revenue rose 4% in the 2019 budget year, which ended Sept. 30, but that spending surged at twice that rate. Spending increased for defense programs and for the government's big benefit programs for the elderly, Social Security and Medicare. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asserted that Trump's economic program was nevertheless working, with unemployment at its lowest point in nearly 50 years. Mnuchin argued that to put the budget on a sustainable path, Congress must enact proposals \"to cut wasteful and irresponsible spending.\" So far, though, neither party has shown much interest in reducing the soaring deficits. Trump and Republicans seem content with the $1.5 trillion tax cut measure that Congress passed during Trump's first year in office. And Democrats who are running to oppose him in next year's election have proposed their own expensive spending plans, including Medicare for All. While pledging to protect Social Security and other benefit programs, many of the Democratic presidential candidates have said they will roll back Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations to pay for their programs. Against that backdrop, budget deficits are on track to keep rising \u2014 thereby raising the national debt, as a percentage of the economy, to its highest point since the end of World War II. The government did previously run $1 trillion annual deficits from 2009 through 2012, when the Obama administration was spending heavily to combat the effects of the 2008 financial crisis and the worst recession since the 1930s. This time, the deficits are occurring at a dramatically different time: The unemployment rate is historically low, and the economy is in a record 11th year of expansion.",

            "article_content": "Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, one the leading contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, pledged to lower prescription drug prices by half if he captures the nomination and ultimately, the White House.\u00a0 \"If I am elected president, I'm going to cut prescription drug costs in this country by 50 percent so that we are not paying any more than other major countries are paying. Maybe we can do better than that,\" Sanders said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday.\u00a0 Pressed for more details, the self-described Democratic socialist and 2020 presidential candidate did not outline a concrete plan to achieve his latest campaign pledge. Instead, Sanders suggested the U.S. could look to the prescription drug prices in other developed social democracies like Canada, Japan and Germany, and replicate them. He also said the government could \"take a look\" at the patents of pharmaceutical giants.\u00a0 \"The five major companies made 50 billion dollars in profits last year,\" Sanders said. \"They pay their CEOs outrageous compensation packages. If they don't like that, then we'll take a look at their patents.\" Sanders, who leads some of the early polls of Democratic White House hopefuls alongside former Vice President Joe Biden, has touted several other bold proposals on the campaign, including \"Medicare for all\" -- a single-payer health care system. Asked if he, like President Trump, wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Sanders noted his health care plan is profoundly different from what the White House and its Republican allies in Congress envision. \u00a0 \"If Trump gets his way, the cost of health insurance for you will be so high that many people literally will not be able to afford it. Thousands of people will literally die. That's Trump's health insurance plan,\" he said. \"My plan's just a little bit different. I think we should join the rest of the industrialized world. Guarantee health care to all people as a right.\"\u00a0 The president has recently escalated his attacks against the Affordable Care Act and predicted the health care law, which insures millions of Americans, will be \"terminated\" in court. Mr. Trump has asked a group of Republican senators to devise a replacement for the Obama-era law, vowing that his party will come up with \"something that's really spectacular.\" Last week, the Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act, prompting Democrats to launch a media blitz on health care and and the need to protect the coverage of those with pre-existing conditions, an issue they ran on successfully during the 2018 midterm elections.

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg, the South Bend, Indiana mayor and latest Democrat to throw his hat into the 2020 presidential race, says he's got \"more experience in government that the president of the United States\", which he says makes him qualified for the highest office in the land. The 37-year-old, gay Navy veteran told \"CBS This Morning\" that while he might be the youngest person in the race thus far, it's his unconventional background that makes him the best candidate. \"I've got more years of executive experience than the vice president and I have more military experience than anybody who's arrived behind that desk since George H.W. Bush. I get that it's not a conventional background, but I don't think that it's time for conventional backgrounds in Washington right now,\" the mayor said. Buttigieg, who ran unsuccessfully in 2017 to lead the Democratic National Committee, announced\u00a0earlier this month\u00a0that he would be forming an exploratory committee to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination. While the last time a sitting mayor was nominated for president to a major political party was in 1812, his role in local politics, according to Buttigieg, gives him the \"instinct to do the job.\" \"Whether we're talking about the presidency or a job like governor or mayor, there are three parts to it, it's bringing people together, it's implementing good policies and it's capably running an administration,\" he said. \"All of those have been missing right now in Washington.\" He later told CBSN that more mayors deserve a place in the national conversation. \"When you have the executive experience of leading a city of any size, you have a better sense of  the job or any executive leadership role to bring people together, to pass good policies, to competently run an organization or an administration,\" said Buttigieg. The mayor also said he's prepared for any attacks he might face if elected as the country's first openly gay president. \"All I can do is try to do the right thing, come forward with big ideas. [I'm] definitely proud of who I am, I'm proud of my husband and our marriage is one of the most important things, the most important thing in my life,\" he told CBSN. He added, \"I grew up in Indiana and I'm gay so I'm used to dealing with bullies, I've been deployed in a war zone I'm used to dealing with attacks, I think I'll be ready for it.\" As Buttigieg joins a\u00a0chorus of other Democratic hopefuls in the 2020 race, he says his party and politics as a whole have largely ignored the \"experience of the industrial Midwest,\" something he says has come at a \"terrible cost.\" \"Our party has a tendency to lead with the policies, first we got to explain our values and explain why Democrats are committed to freedom to democracy, to security,\" he said. \"That democracy piece has to be fix before anything will go well in this country.\" Buttigieg also called for ending the electoral college process. \"The electoral college needs to go because it's made our society less and less democratic,\" he said. Buttigieg also told CBS that he supports more progressive-leaning Medicare-for-all proposals, saying the idea of universal coverage is \"the norm in most developed countries.\" Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

He told \"CBS This Morning\" on Monday that what his career has shown is that \"when you bring people together...you can get things done that make a real difference.\" Elected to the Senate in 2013 after serving as mayor of Newark, New Jersey for more than 7 years, Booker said that he's had a \"very unique political path\" which has forced him to run toward some of the \"toughest problems\" facing the country.\u00a0 Booker announced his intentions to join the already packed 2020 Democratic presidential race last week with a video urging unity in a divided country.\u00a0 \"We are better when we help each other,\" he said in the official campaign kickoff. \"I believe that we can build a country where no one is forgotten, no one is left behind; where parents can put food on the table; where there are good paying jobs with good benefits in every neighborhood; where our criminal justice system keeps us safe, instead of shuffling more children into cages and coffins; where we see the faces of our leaders on television and feel pride, not shame.\" President Trump told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan that he sees \"no chance\" in a Booker challenge in 2020.\u00a0 Booker, however, says that feeling of being \"underestimated\" in his political career is something\u00a0 \"every American knows about.\" \"I think every American knows about being underestimated, being demeaned or just put down, it's something I faced all my political career in Newark going up against the machine. Look, the history of our country is a history of people underestimating this nation and doing impossible things, so we don't need a president that's going to put down people or divide people. This is really one of those times in American history I think we need a revival of civic grace and bringing people together,\" said Booker.\u00a0 Booker said more than ever, the country is in need of leadership that reminds the American people that there's a \"common pain\" and \"common purpose\" in the country.\u00a0 Those pains, Booker said, include the issue of health care, something he says is \"a right\" that's \"popular on both sides of the aisle.\" \"I've gone across this country...everybody agrees that in the United States of America that we should never have somebody who does not have access to care because they can't afford it,\" said Booker. The senator is just one of the many Democrats who supports a potentially costly \"Medicare For All\" single payer plan that would create a universal coverage system.\u00a0 He added that lawmakers need to now focus on pathways supported by the \"majority of Americans\" that \"massively expand access to health care and lower the costs.\"\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

Kamala Harris will be active on Thanksgiving day, cheering on runners at the annual Des Moines, Iowa Turkey Trot and visiting senior citizens at Corinthian Gardens.\u00a0 Also staying in Des Moines, Amy Klobuchar will be holding a Thanksgiving dinner with family, supporters and media. Joe Biden told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0that he'll be with family for the whole week, ahead of an eight-day bus tour starting next week. Deval Patrick, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Andrew Yang also said they'll be with family on the holiday. CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says Pete Buttigieg plans to go deer hunting the day after Thanksgiving. Asked on Monday by a reporter whether his weapon of choice was a bow or rifle, Buttigieg replied, \"Bow hunting is way past my skill level. Rifle hunting probably is, too, but we're going to do it since it's Thanksgiving.\"\u00a0 Joe Sestak told\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that he'll be spending his post-Thanksgiving Friday putting up Christmas decorations. \"No better day,\" he said. PETE BUTTIGIEG Buttigieg responded to an op-ed in The Root calling the millennial mayor a \"lying m****r******\" for his comments on education in a video interview clip that resurfaced from 2011. In the video, Buttigieg said that children need to \"see evidence\" that pursuing education will come with a \"reward\" and a \"stable life.\" \"There are a lot of kids, especially from the lower income minority neighborhoods, who literally haven't seen it work,\" Buttigieg added in the clip. \"There isn't somebody they know personally who testifies to the value of education.\" The mayor faced fierce backlash online for the comments and according to\u00a0Turman,\u00a0told reporters this morning that he spoke to Michael Harriott, who wrote the op-ed.\u00a0 \"I think that some of the characterization to me personally is unfair. I do understand the concern,\" Buttigieg said. \"What I said in that comment before I became mayor does not reflect the totality of my understanding then, and certainly now, about the obstacles that students of color face in our system today.\" \"I believe I was speaking about the need for mentorship and the need for Career Pathways but the problem is to the extent that, that feels like it's validating a narrative that sometimes blames the victim for the consequences of systemic racism, I understand why he was upset, and I understand the perspective and largely agree,\" Buttigieg added. Separately Buttigieg's campaign says it has bought ad time on urban contemporary radio stations in southern Nevada, with plans to expand the ad buy to local Spanish music and talk stations.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says the South Bend mayor joins a handful of candidates,\u00a0including Bernie Sanders\u00a0and\u00a0Tom Steyer, who have taken their campaigns to black and Hispanic drivetime audiences in the state. KAMALA HARRIS Harris told a group of South Carolina voters Monday that she introduced her mental health plan in the state because the need is great.\u00a0 \"I think we've sadly stigmatized the issue of mental health and so, so many people experience it every day,\" said Harris. \"I know enough to know that almost everyone here has experienced this with someone you know, work with, or love.\"\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0says one of the key points of Harris' plan is to \"focus on vulnerable populations,\" which would include doubling \"U.S. Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs research dollars to address and treat PTSD, military sexual trauma, and traumatic brain injury.\"\u00a0 In 2017, the South Carolina veteran suicide rate was significantly higher than the national suicide rate. Charleston native Stephanie Hammond is an Air Force veteran and says she loved that Harris chose to unveil the plan in her home state. \"I think that that's what's needed,\" said Hammond. \"Being a veteran myself and knowing other veterans that have come back and are dealing with some mental health issues, the unveiling of the plan is welcome in my eyes as a veteran, as well as...for the veterans that I served with, and veterans that are suffering from some mental health illnesses.\" MICHAEL BLOOMBERG In his second day of campaigning, Bloomberg said his path to the presidency begins in Arizona, a state President Trump won by about 4% in 2016.\u00a0 \"Arizona, as you know, is a crucial battleground state, but you don't often see presidential candidates around here. And the fact is, President Trump is about the only one who's spending any money here and in some of the other swing states around the country. And that's a big problem for our party and I am determined to change exactly that,\" he told reporters in Phoenix.\u00a0 Navarro\u00a0says Bloomberg sees a chance for Democrats to flip the state \"if we nominate somebody who makes winning here a top priority.\"\u00a0 The move to start in the southwestern state comes as Bloomberg has hinted that he will not compete in other early states like Iowa and New Hampshire. Arizona has also been a focus of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC, who said they would include Latinos in Arizona and Florida as part of their 2020 voter mobilization. In Phoenix, Bloomberg touted his experience as New York mayor, as well as doubling down on his stances on \"Medicare for All\" and a wealth tax.\u00a0 On the wealth tax, he said other countries that have used it show it does not work. On Medicare for All, Bloomberg said he supports updating Obamacare. \"I don't think Medicare for All is a solution to the problem. The real answer is to take Obamacare and you can tweak it, you can make it somewhat better, you can restore some of the cuts that were taken away,\" he said Tuesday. \"Medicare for All would destroy our hospital system, doctors wouldn't be able to make enough money to pay off their loans\u2026The secret is people want to keep their private plans.\" DEVAL PATRICK Patrick will make his second two-day swing to South Carolina since launching his presidential bid this week. As previously\u00a0reported\u00a0by\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0and\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter\u00a0Nicole Sganga, Patrick is expected to make a play for moderate voters in the first two early primary states. This visit comes on the heels of the\u00a0hiring\u00a0of Columbia, South Carolina-based political operative LaJoia Broughton to run the campaign's operation in the state. Broughton was a South Carolina lobbyist for JUUL Labs before she signed on with Patrick.\u00a0 In a phone interview earlier this month, South Carolina Democratic Party chair Trav Robertson told\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0that it will be interesting to see how Patrick and other newcomers to the Democratic primary race fare. \"I think that it is obvious that [Patrick]\u2014along with Michael Bloomberg think that they have a narrative or a certain viewpoint or some type of ability to add to the field,\" said Robertson. \"This is something that we normally don't see in presidential primaries or nominating processes \u2014 people [getting] in later, rather than sooner, and so it's going to be an interesting next couple of months.\" ANDREW YANG Yang is ramping up his campaign in Nevada, naming Jenny Lehner his new political director in the state. According to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin, Lehner previously served as finance director to the Assembly Democratic Caucus and for Chris Giunchigliani's gubernatorial bid in Nevada. She also\u00a0helps run a nonprofit\u00a0with Giunchigliani, who has since\u00a0endorsed Elizabeth Warren. SOUTH CAROLINA In an interview with CBS affiliate WCSC Monday afternoon, Kamala Harris said of former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's decision to run that she trusts voters to make decisions based on a candidate's record.\u00a0 \"There's been a total of 25 people in the race so hey jump on in, the water's warm,\" joked Harris. \"[I] have faith in the American voter to make decisions not based on how much money somebody has but based on their track record of doing work in service of others and in service of their community.\"\u00a0 Mitchell\u00a0spoke with South Carolina voters to get a sense of how they're reacting to Bloomberg's run. North Charleston resident Martha Welsh, a retired university professor, thinks it's very presumptuous of him. \"I am not sure why he believes he has something to offer that the collective wisdom of the other candidates wouldn't bring.\" \"Even though he's not running in South Carolina, he should also come here and talk to South Carolinians, find out what our issues are, what we're concerned about,\" said Donna Brown Newton, a Charleston County school district employee and chair of the East Cooper Democratic Party.\u00a0 Earlier this month, CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0that Bloomberg apologized for his role in the New York Police Department \"stop and frisk\" policy that led to hundreds of thousands being stopped and searched without warrants and disproportionately targeted black and Latino populations. Welsh, who is also a Northeasterner, said that Bloomberg's apology won't be enough. \"The whole 'stop and frisk' thing, just because you apologize for it now doesn't mean that it wasn't wrong at a different time,\" said Welsh. \"It's sort of like Joe Biden apologizing for Anita Hill. It just doesn't work.\" TEXAS The 2020 strategy for the Republican Party of Texas was recently unveiled \u2014 to Texas Democrats.\u00a0The Dallas Morning News reports\u00a0that a draft of the GOP plan ended up in Democratic emails Monday night, and it includes a list of 12 targeted state house districts and a preliminary digital advertising plan to attack Democrats. Their strategist memo also had a clause about potential decreased GOP turnout due to \"Never Trumpers,\" and a suggestion to prepare to target these voters to still vote for Republicans down ballot, reports\u00a0Navarro. \"Given the polarizing nature of the President, I suspect some Republicans will refuse to turnout during the General Election because they don't want to vote for him, though I don't know that we will know what this universe would look like without us or a stakeholder creating a model. Regardless, I suggest we set up a contingency budget to target these folks with mailers, digital ads, and texts to encourage them to turnout for U.S. Senate, State Senate, State House, and so on,\" a draft obtained by\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0read. The reveal comes as\u00a0Republicans begin to shore up their defenses in Texas. President Trump has held two rallies so far this year, and the Texas GOP has previously released its own voter registration and engagement efforts.\u00a0In a statement, Texas Republicans Chairman James Dickey responded to the story and said that \"it's revealing that the Dallas Morning News reporter thinks that's newsworthy\u2026We at the Republican Party of Texas are working on winning races all across Texas and growing support among both Republican and swing voters.\"\u00a0 A Republican National Committee spokesperson said, \"President Trump enjoys historic support among Republicans. Any assertion to the contrary is simply a fool's errand.\" The strategy outlined in the state party memo also includes hiring four digital field representatives across the state, buying domain names of Democratic candidates to redirect people to \"negative hits,\" and rapid response to be deployed when national Democratic candidates come to Texas. It also says a goal is to showcase diversity within Republican candidates through video releases on social media. \u00a0 Texas Democrats aim\u00a0to flip the state blue across the ballot, especially the state House in 2020. They are currently within nine seats of the majority and are looking to bring that down to eight in January's special election for House District 28.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The Democratic nomination race remains unsettled because many voters are conflicted between what they want and whether they think can win. Some candidates who generate excitement are also seen as risky. Progressive policies are popular but might be too liberal to win swing voters. And while voters say they are satisfied with their current selection of candidates, very few have actually settled on one. So, across the early primary and caucus states through Super Tuesday, voters' top pick continues to swing back and forth between Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, with neither able to break away. Warren, whose support has dipped since last month, is seen by most as exciting; however, many also describe her as risky and worry her policy stances are too liberal to defeat President Trump, a sign that some of the recent critiques leveled at her may have slowed her momentum. Among Warren's backers last month who now pick a different candidate, the bulk of them went to Biden and Pete Buttigieg. Biden, who has regained the edge in both the poll and our delegate model, is described by most as safe but not exciting. Bernie Sanders is holding strong in third place. Buttigieg has climbed into the top tier in Iowa and made big gains in New Hampshire. Iowa now shows a clear top tier defined by Sanders, Biden and now Buttigieg \u2014 whose support in the state has tripled since September and risen seven points since just last month \u2014 and Warren, who was atop the list with Biden last month and has since dropped a bit. In addition to his gains in Iowa and New Hampshire, Buttigieg has picked up support in the aggregate 18-state poll. CBS News recontacts voters for this study, and most of Buttigieg's current supporters reported a different first-choice candidate last month, primarily Warren. In recent weeks, Democratic voters have not grown more confident that their party's eventual nominee will beat Mr. Trump. While most express some confidence, just 26% are very confident, a percentage that has barely budged since the summer. There is concern among some Democrats that Sanders' and Warren's policy stances are too liberal to enable either of them to beat Mr. Trump, although it's voters currently not supporting these candidates who are more likely to hold that view.\u00a0 Overall, fewer think Buttigieg's and Biden's policy positions are too liberal to win. Most say their policy stances are about right for defeating Trump. Along with policy stances, Democratic voters see different traits in different candidates. The poll presented a number of characteristics and asked whether they described each of the leading Democratic candidates. Far more Democratic voters describe Biden as \"safe\" than they do any of the other candidates asked about. At the same time, a third call him \"boring.\" It's not just Biden's backers who call him safe. More than half of Democrats who don't pick Biden as their first choice describe him as safe. Warren and Sanders are viewed as \"risky\" more than the other top-tier candidates. Voters not considering these candidates are inclined to hold this view. Their own backers don't feel they are risky. Most who view Warren and Sanders as risky also feel their policies are too liberal to beat Donald Trump.\u00a0 Whether she's safe or risky may not be the most important consideration for Warren supporters. Only one in five of them describe her as safe, indicating that a safe candidate is perhaps not the priority for them. In contrast, three in four of those backing Biden call him safe. A majority of Democrats \u2014 51% \u2014 describe Warren as \"exciting,\" the highest percentage for any of the candidates tested. Even among those who don't pick her as their first choice, four in 10 call her exciting. When voters are considering a candidate but not picking them as a first choice, it is concern about electability that holds them back. The poll asked voters what Biden, Warren, Sanders and Buttigieg could do to become a first choice among voters who are considering them. The top answer was convincing voters they could defeat Mr. Trump, which outpaced all other reasons tested, such as convincing voters that their policies would work or that they could handle the job of president. Just a third of Democrats in these early states say they have definitely made up their mind about the candidate they are currently backing, so minds may change. Voters' degree of confidence in beating Mr. Trump is related to how settled they are in their candidate choice. Most who are very confident of a Democratic win in the general election say they have definitely made up their minds, while those with less confidence are less likely to be certain of their choice. While there may be some uncertainty, there isn't much desire for more choices. Amid one late entry in the race and the potential for another, roughly eight in 10 Democrats in the early states are satisfied with the current field. Those who are uneasy about the party's prospects next November are more likely to want more choices. If former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg were to enter the race, one in five Democrats say he would be one of the candidates they would consider, but more than twice as many say they would not consider him. A third haven't heard enough about him. Bloomberg gets more consideration from older Democrats, and moderate and conservative ones. Biden and Buttigieg backers are more likely to consider him than Warren or Sanders supporters. Interviews for the poll were completed before former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced his presidential bid. Buttigieg's recent gains in Iowa have essentially transformed the contest into a four-way race. Many Iowa Democrats see Buttigieg as exciting and down-to-earth. Just a quarter describe him as risky, but a similar proportion call him safe. Warren is also viewed by four in 10 voters as exciting, but more view both her and Sanders as risky. As with the other leading candidates, the question of whether he can beat Mr. Trump is the main reason voters who are considering Buttigieg say they aren't picking him as their first choice.\u00a0\u00a0Buttigieg has been spending a lot of time and money in the state, and that may be paying off. He now leads among two groups of Iowa Democrats Warren led among last month: those paying a lot of attention to the 2020 candidates and college graduates. Buttigieg and Biden are the top choice among older Iowa Democrats, while Sanders maintains his advantage with younger voters.\u00a0 Warren is the top second choice across the early states and in Iowa, a state where a voter's second choice has important implications. (If a voter's first-choice candidate doesn't have enough support to be viable, they can choose to align with another candidate.) A plurality of Sanders and Buttigieg voters pick Warren second. On the other hand, current Biden voters in Iowa are more likely to pick Buttigieg or Sanders second than Warren. Warren continues to lead in the Granite State, followed by Biden and Sanders. Buttigieg is still in fourth place, but his support has increased by nine points since last month. He has improved with different types of voters \u2014 both men and women, as well as liberals and moderates alike. Biden has opened up a lead among likely Democratic voters in Nevada, giving him a 10-point advantage over Sanders. Back in September, Sanders held a razor-thin lead over Biden in the state, but support for the Vermont senator has declined slightly, while support for Biden and Warren has risen, dropping Sanders into second place and two points ahead of Warren. Biden retains a commanding double-digit lead over Warren and Sanders in South Carolina, where he continues to secure the support of nearly half of Democratic likely voters. A majority of black Democrats are supporting Biden, and one in three white Democrats pick him first as well. Biden is the top choice in the state regardless of voters' self-described ideology, and while Sanders has a strong lead among voters under 30, Biden leads among all other age groups. \u00a0 Beneath the top tier, Buttigieg has passed Kamala Harris for fourth place in both South Carolina and Nevada, but with less than 10% of the vote, he trails the top three candidates significantly and falls short of the 15% threshold to earn delegates. Buttigieg's rise is particularly striking among older voters. Since September, support for Buttigieg among voters 65 and older rose from 6% to 18% in Nevada and from 4% to 11% in South Carolina. One of the top issues being debated in the Democratic campaign is Medicare for All and how to pay for it. Support for this type of health program has dipped some from earlier this fall: 50% of early-state Democrats now favor it, down from 57% in September. The percentages opposing such a program and saying it depends on the costs and details have both inched up. Nearly two-thirds say that when they are comparing candidates' health care plans they are mainly listening for details about how candidates would pay for them. Far fewer say that they are listening for larger policy goals and the details can come later. Democrats who are not currently in favor of Medicare for All are more eager for details on how candidates would pay for their plans, compared to Medicare for All proponents. More than four in 10 Warren and Sanders supporters say they are listening for larger policy goals on health care and the details can wait, compared to just 27% of Biden supporters who say that \u2013 more of them are looking for details. This CBS News survey was conducted by YouGov between November 6 and 13, 2019. A representative sample of 18,710 registered voters was selected in 18 states expected to hold early primaries and caucuses (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia). This sample includes 8,866 self-identi\ufb01ed Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents. This sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the American Community Survey, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, as well as 2016 presidential vote.

On this week's episode of the \"Where Did You Get This Number?\" podcast, host Anthony Salvanto talks with CBS News 2020 campaign reporter Adam Brewster about the challenges Iowa farmers face and how the Democratic candidates are connecting with residents of the state more broadly.\u00a0 Historic flooding and other extreme conditions linked to climate change have cost U.S. farmers over $7 billion in lost revenue this year.\u00a0 However, the main obstacle for farmers to adopt more sustainable practices are economic incentives. Some of the practices, such as planting cover crops in the winter to protect soil, would take years to yield profit.\u00a0 \"Every penny they spend is something that they have to know that they can see an investment on,\" Brewster said. \"And so providing some of these incentives and payments for these environmental practices, the idea is you can get more farmers involved in fighting climate change.\" Brewster cited former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg as candidates who have set up the most local campaign offices around Iowa ahead of the caucuses February 3.\u00a0 Buttigieg in particular has been rising in the Iowa polls, despite surveys that show voters are not overwhelmingly in favor of a younger candidate or a Washington outsider. \"One of the things you often hear is that some people say [Buttigieg] is just a breath of fresh air,\" Brewster said. \"People walk away being very impressed typically with how Mayor Pete Buttigieg handles those questions thrown at him\" at Iowa events. Brewster said Buttigieg, the youngest Democratic candidate in the 2020 field, has consistently drawn large crowds at his events, and voters have been impressed with Buttigieg's emphasis on his faith. \"Iowa is a heavily Christian state, and there are people here \u2014 Democrats here who I've heard say, 'We have felt forgotten,'\" Brewster said, adding that many Iowa Democrats have been \"longing\" for a candidate who speaks openly to them about faith.\u00a0 Brewster is interested in Bernie Sanders' upcoming trip to Iowa with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for several climate conversations and town halls in Council Bluffs, Des Moines and Coralville. \"[Bernie] has a lot of people here who still really support him,\" Brewster said. \"It'll be interesting to see how much he can build that out.\" Subscribe to\u00a0\"Where Did You Get This Number?\"\u00a0and download the latest episode to learn more about the rural vote in Iowa, how Buttigieg has increased his support in the state, the role of faith in the 2020 race, and differing perspectives on health care.

            "article_content": "Currently, it's a pretty good national economy, which could make it a little more challenging for Democrats vying to keep President Trump from winning a second term. Job growth is strong, and the economy has been growing for a record 121 consecutive months. But does the Democratic base \u2014 a diverse coalition of affluent liberals and more\u00a0 working-class voters \u2014 see it the same way?\u00a0 CBS News measured how Democratic voters feel about the economy and about their party's presidential candidates and found real differences that seem to correspond with voters' level of financial duress. Moreover, when it comes to the economy, there is often a disconnect between national conditions and what people are feeling at the local level. We divided Democrats and independents who lean Democratic into two groups, based on how concerned they feel about their month-to-month financial obligations.\u00a0 The three biggest areas of concern among lower-income Democrats are saving and buying extras, paying medical bills, and paying debts. Among Democrats in states with early primaries or caucuses, 44% are concerned about all three of these issues. For the purposes of this analysis, we will call this group \"concerned.\" The other 56% of Democrats, who are more financially secure we'll call \"comfortable.\" This group may be confident about some of these financial issues and uneasy about others.\u00a0 This simplified grouping allows us to broadly map the economic contours in the party. The data come from the CBS News/YouGov Battleground Tracker poll of the 18 earliest states in the Democratic presidential nominating process. The concerned are not feeling the benefits of the national economy to the same extent as the comfortable. They feel differently about their local economy, as well as how they have fared in the last few years.\u00a0 Just 59% of the concerned rate their state's economy positively, compared to 76% of the comfortable. When rating the economy, the concerned are more likely to think about their own pocketbooks: 42% say their own personal finances come to mind first, versus 30% of the comfortable, who are relatively more likely to think about the unemployment rate and stock market.\u00a0 When asked about the availability of good jobs where they live, compared to three years ago, 37% of the concerned say there are fewer now, compared to only 21% of the comfortable. Across groups, about half say it's \"about the same\" as three years ago. When asked whether they personally are better or worse off than three years ago, 42% of the concerned say worse, while most of the comfortable report being about the same. When it comes to the 2020 presidential candidates, the concerned are more likely than the comfortable to name Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders as their top choice. Among the concerned, 27% name Biden and 20% pick Sanders (compared to 23% and 12%, respectively, among the comfortable).\u00a0 However, Biden's support has dropped about seven points since last month among the concerned, with three in 10 of his supporters from June now naming a different candidate as their top pick. Kamala Harris is the main beneficiary of these voters who have changed their minds, though she polls similarly among the concerned and comfortable. The top choices among the latter are Elizabeth Warren (24%) and Biden (23%). These groups also differ on the issues they are prioritizing in the upcoming election, as well as on certain policies. While both groups rate health care as a very important issue, the concerned are more likely than the comfortable to say that jobs and wages, as well as income inequality, are very important. The concerned are also less likely than the comfortable to identify as liberals (58% vs. 65%).\u00a0 There are areas of policy agreement, such as supporting \"Medicare-for-All,\" but areas of difference concern public college tuition: six in 10 of the comfortable are in favor of making public colleges cheaper for students but not free, while only a third say it should be completely free. The concerned, on the other hand, are evenly split between these options. There are some clear differences between these two groups in terms of demographics. The comfortable are more likely to be white (64%) than the concerned group, which is racially diverse (51% white, 23% black, and 19% Hispanic).\u00a0 The comfortable are also somewhat older, and more likely to be college graduates (48%) than the concerned (32%).\u00a0 And unsurprisingly, there are differences by income. The concerned mostly report annual family incomes that are under $50,000 \u2014 well below the U.S. household median \u2014 while the comfortable tend to make more, with 30% reporting family incomes of $100,000 or more. Six in ten of the comfortable tell us they have invested in the stock market, while fewer than four in 10 are among the concerned. This CBS News survey was conducted by YouGov between July 9 and July 18, 2019. A representative sample of 18,550 registered voters was selected in 18 states expected to hold early primaries and caucuses (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia).

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders came up short in his 2016 bid for the Democratic nomination, but his robust support and enthusiasm surrounding his candidacy surprised many. Will he be able to regain that momentum and build on that support this time around? Sanders faces a far different political landscape in 2020 than he did in 2016 -- it's a more competitive field that may exceed a dozen candidates, a far cry from 2016, when his only other competitors for the Democratic nomination were Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley. Here's a look at which types of Democratic primary voters went strong for Sanders in 2016 and who he might need to make inroads with in 2020. Some of Sanders' biggest supporters in 2016 were young voters. Voters under age 30 overwhelmingly backed him over Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries. In states were exit polls were conducted, Sanders beat Clinton among young voters in all of them except two \u2013 Alabama and Mississippi. This was largely due to the significant number of African American voters in those states, a group Clinton excelled with (more on this later).  This year, there are fresher faces seeking the Democratic nomination. Might young people gravitate toward a newcomer like contender Beto O'Rourke? O'Rourke came up short in his run for Senate in Texas, but he won 71 percent of voters under age 30. His share of the youth vote was 16 points higher than Hillary Clinton got in Texas in 2016. The field also includes other newer and younger contenders that may appeal to young voters. Sen. Senders identifies as an independent and he performed well with independent voters in the 2016 Democratic primaries, winning them by a margin of nearly two-to-one over Clinton. High turnout among independents was an important factor in states that Sanders won. Sanders didn't win any primaries where independents made up less than 22 percent of the electorate, according to exit polls.  In 2016, Sanders also appealed to white voters without a college degree who voted in Democratic primaries and caucuses, winning 53 percent of these voters based on exit polls. \u00a0More of these voters were looking for a candidate who cared about their needs and problems rather than one with the right experience, which helped boost Sanders. Whites with a college degree prioritized experience over empathy. There is another potential candidate who may appeal to this group of voters --- former Vice President Joe Biden -- who has yet to enter the race. Biden could be seen has having both the experience and empathy that some Democratic primary voters may be looking for.  The senator from Vermont had less traction with some other key voter groups and one of those was women. Fifty-eight percent of Democratic primary voters in 2016 were women, a larger share of the electorate than in a general election. Sanders won the support of just about 37 percent of women, according to exit polls. He won the women's vote in just four states where exit polls were conducted and one of those was his home state of Vermont. Sanders did do well with women voters under age 30, however. Sanders did not have a lot of success with African-American voters. He won less than a quarter of their support in the 2016 primaries, losing the black vote to Hillary Clinton in every state where exit polls were conducted. Most of Sanders' victories were in states where blacks made up a relatively smaller percentage of the electorate.  Women and black voters are key constituencies of the electorate. The 2018 elections put a record number of women in Congress and the body is the most racially and ethnically diverse ever. Some Democratic primary voters may be looking to continue that trend and nominate a different kind of candidate. The 2020 field includes a number of women and at least two African American contenders. While Sanders enjoyed strong backing from independents in the 2016 primaries, he had less support among the party faithful \u2013 self-identified Democrats - who made up three-quarters of the Democratic primary electorate. \u00a0Clinton beat Sanders by roughly 30 points among this group. Democrats voting in the 2016 primaries were older (as were Clinton's supporters) than the independents who did. Democrats valued experience in their candidate most (a plus for Clinton), while independents said honesty was most important (a plus for Sanders).  Even though Sanders ran to the left of Clinton, he did not dominate among the liberal faction of Democratic primary voters. He only narrowly beat Clinton among those who called themselves \"very liberal\", suggesting that the race was not just about ideological differences but also anti-Clinton sentiment among Sanders supporters. During the 2016 primary season, CBS News national polls found that while most Clinton voters had a favorable view of Sanders, his backers had a net negative view of Clinton. According to exit polls in 11 states where the question was asked, seven in 10 Sanders voters did not think Clinton was honest and trustworthy. While Sanders enjoyed strong backing from independents in the 2016 primaries, he had less support among the party faithful \u2013 self-identified Democrats - who made up three-quarters of the Democratic primary electorate. \u00a0Clinton beat Sanders by roughly 30 points among this group. Democrats voting in the 2016 primaries were older (as were Clinton's supporters) than the independents who did. Democrats valued experience in their candidate most (a plus for Clinton), while independents said honesty was most important (a plus for Sanders).  This time around, Sanders won't be running against Hillary Clinton or one \"establishment\" candidate but in a more crowded and diverse field. With Sanders' key campaign issues like \"Medicare for all\" and income inequality now being embraced by many Democratic voters and presidential candidates, will Sanders be able to attract more voters or will voters turn to a newer face of the \"revolution\"?",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina that aired Sunday, August 25, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee South Carolina senior Senator Lindsey Graham. Senator, good to have you here.\u00a0 SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you. That was fun.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I- I want to know what you think about what Larry just described there. He said the president does have the authority to block private investment in China. You said the other day you don't-- SEN. GRAHAM: Well I don't- I don't-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --think he does.\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: -- know how the statute works. I think he can levy tariffs on countries that he- that- that are creating a national security threat to us. Maybe he can, you know, do something about exporting to countries that he believes are national security danger. I don't know. But if you start getting into that, it's a global economy. The one thing- I love Larry Kudlow. It's a global economy. I'm glad American companies are in China doing business because there's a lot of customers. What I don't like is they close off markets to the American business community in China. They require you to have a Chinese business partner when you do business in China and they steal all of your stuff. Every Democrat and every Republican of note has said China cheats. The Democrats for years have been claiming that China should be stood up to. Now Trump is and we just got to accept the pain that comes with standing up to China. How do you get China to change without creating some pain on them and us? I don't know.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: How much pain should people of South Carolina be prepared for? GRAHAM: Some. Consumer prices on commodities are gonna go up. We're now that part in the trade war where you feel price increases at Walmart. The president has backed off because he's worried about the Christmas shopping season. I'd tell you, Mr. President, listen, you got more bullets than they do. They sell us a lot more stuff than we sell them and the goal is get them to change their behavior. The Chinese government, the Chinese army and the Chinese business community are one in the same. They're very mercantile. You don't have these disputes among democracies, but the Chinese Communist Party runs everything in China. Until they feel the pain, they're not going to stop. They- they need to change their intellectual property theft practices. They need to open up their markets to us. They need to become a reliable trading partner rather than a mercantile system that cheats everybody out of market share. MARGARET BRENNAN: And they- a lot of people, as you say, support the president in that China hasn't agreed to do those things-- SEN. GRAHAM: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: -- up to this point-- SEN. GRAHAM: And they never will until they pay a heavier price.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you think possibly not until after the election-- SEN. GRAHAM: I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --of 2020? SEN. GRAHAM: --they're trying to wait Trump out. I think they've made a calculation that our elections are right around the corner. They can play this game to 2020. If Trump keeps piling on, I don't know if they can make it that long because the supply chain is beginning to move. The more expensive it create- you to produce products in China, the more likely you are to relocate the supply chain which would be a death blow to the Chinese economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's been happening for- for some time but do you, because South Carolina has so many auto plants in particular-- SEN. GRAHAM: Steel and aluminum tariffs hurt us a lot. But, you know, the steel and aluminum business has a chance of coming back. China produced more steel in one year than the entire world consumed. That's an unfair trade practice. They should be in the WTO as a developed nation not a developing nation. Everybody- I had a bill with Chuck Schumer seven or eight years ago to label China a currency manipulator and to put a 27 and a half percent tariff on every product that benefited from currency manipulation. Bush would never do it. Obama would never do it. Trump did it. So to my Democratic colleagues, he's doing the things you've been calling for all these years. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the threat of tariffs and this dispute with the E.U. that could really impact the automakers? SEN. GRAHAM: I think tariffs are tools. When you look at the world tariff regime, 67 percent of all the tariffs in the world disadvantage America. There's a higher tariff on American products in the country in which we do business with. India's the worst. I've been introduced a bill that allows the American president to charge the same as the country we're doing business with changes- charges. So like in India. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SEN. GRAHAM: They have a 100 percent tariff on a lot of our products. Either we increase tariffs on Indian products or we all go to zero. The goal is to go to zero. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a report out this week from the Congressional Budget Office. They raised the estimate, the budget deficit, to now one trillion dollars for 2020. SEN. GRAHAM: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: As a Republican, do you still believe deficits matter? SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, deficits matter, but they're driven by entitlement spending. I don't believe defense spending is the problem with the deficit. I don't believe-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of the tax cuts-- SEN. GRAHAM: --discretionary, domestic- I don't believe the tax cuts-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --also were unpaid for. SEN. GRAHAM: I think the tax cuts are going to pay for themself, I believe that. I think an infrastructure bill would probably pay for itself. You'll never get deficits in order and out of debt and to reform Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Afghanistan.\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you have been tracking these peace talks that-- SEN. GRAHAM: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the Trump administration is holding with the Taliban. There were two American service people killed in Afghanistan this week. More than 2,400 Americans have been killed on that battlefield over-- SEN. GRAHAM: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the past 18 years. Virtually every single Democrat running for president says they're going to bring the troops home.\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's exact- exactly what President Trump is saying.\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I have no-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are all of them? SEN. GRAHAM: Well I think they're all wrong. I think in one day, we lost three thousand Americans because we took our eye off the ball in Afghanistan. Almost three thousand Americans died because we ignored Afghanistan. To Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, read the intelligence assessment by our Intelligence Committee as to what would happen to our homeland if we pulled out of Afghanistan tomorrow. Mr. President, if you don't have a counterterrorism force left behind, even if you gotta deal with the Taliban, which I doubt but you might, they don't have the capability or will to protect the American homeland. Every national security adviser to this president unanimously believes we need a robust counterterrorism force to make sure that ISIS and al-Qaeda do not regenerate in Afghanistan to hit the American homeland.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you concerned the president's not listening-- SEN. GRAHAM: I am concerned-- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- to all of those advisors? SEN. GRAHAM: --that the president, in his desire to get out, is going to make the same mistake that President Obama did in Iraq. I don't want you to be like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. I want you to take good, sound military advice. Mr. President, lowering the cost of this war is a noble endeavor. We've lost 14 soldiers this year. God bless them all, but they're an insurance policy against another 9/11. They act as a virtual wall against ISIS and al-Qaeda. You may get a peace deal with the Taliban, but you'll never get a peace deal with al-Qaeda or- and ISIS. They have an intent to strike America. They just don't have the capability yet. If we leave and outsource our national security to the Taliban that they're gonna take care of al-Qaeda and ISIS, that would be a disastrous decision. And when you're on the stage with Bernie, Elizabeth, or Biden I wish you'd look them in the eye and say, \"Unlike you, I'm gonna listen to my commanders. Unlike you, I'm not gonna expose the American homeland to another 9/11 because of politics.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: What is that number-- SEN. GRAHAM: The number-- MARGARET BRENNAN: of forces?\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM:\u00a0 --is gonna be around eighty-six hundred. To go below that I think would be really risky. So I'm going to introduce legislation requiring the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State to certify to the Congress that to go below eighty-six hundred does not create a- an additional national security risk of the homeland. ISIS-K which is the Afghan version of ISIS and al-Qaeda is alive and well. And it's our American soldiers, our intel community have the capability to protect the homeland. And if you've got to deal with the Taliban, 80 percent of the people in Afghanistan reject the Taliban. I hope it's an honorable deal. I hope we don't throw the women back in the soccer stadiums to be shot and killed for sport. I think you might get the Taliban to the- to the table, but you'll never get ISIS and Al-Qaeda to the table. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the one year anniversary of your good friend John McCain's passing. His widow Cindy McCain has called for acts of civility to try to remember him. Is that possible anymore? Has the rhetoric just gotten so rough and tumble that-- SEN. GRAHAM: It's a rough and tumble-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --that's a past age? SEN. GRAHAM: It's a rough and tumble America, but America's always been pretty rough and tumble. John was a rough and tumble guy, but he had the ability to- to stop the fight and get results. What's missing is his desire to get results. I don't care what language you use, I want to produce results. What do I miss most about John McCain? That steady, understanding of the world. If he were alive today he would be saying exactly what I'm saying about Afghanistan. I know we're all tired of being over there. I know it's been costly in blood and treasure, but there is no way to leave Afghanistan in my view honorably and safely without having a counterterrorism force with intel capability to protect the American homeland. John McCain never sold false peace. He never sold the illusion of peace. So, Cindy McCain has taken over his job for the family. Nobody was ever better taking care of in illness than Cindy provided care to John. She's doing a great job on her own and- and human trafficking, and to the four boys and three daughters, they're doing- doing great. They miss their dad. I miss him, but my job is to carry on and help this president where I can and I will. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Senator. We'll be right back.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, who told CBS News lawmakers are choosing to \"endorse mass murder\" by failing to pass federal gun safety legislation.\u00a0 CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ: What do you think the difference is here in the U.S., in your opinion as one of the staunchest advocates for gun control in Congress, that prevents this kind of quick policy change to be enacted in the wake of the horrible mass shootings we've had here? Is it the culture in America? The 2nd Amendment? The gun lobby? Or our polarized politics? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY: I'll just caveat my comments by saying I can't really speak on a comparative basis because I really don't know much about New Zealand politics. So, I can talk to you about our politics. Listen, the unique feature of the American gun debate is the power of the industry and the lobby. They are a component of the Republican Party in the United States. And even as their position on gun laws becomes more and more unpopular, Republicans in the United States can't break the habit of almost universally supporting the position of the gun industry.You know, that is part of the reason of why Republicans got their brains beat in in 2018. You just can't win suburban districts in this country any longer if you don't support things like universal background checks. But, you know, that relationship between the Republican Party and the NRA is a really important one to Republicans \u2014 and a really hard relationship to break. MONTOYA-GALVEZ: But senator, you've worked on this issue for years. Is it discouraging to see that you still can't get anything passed here federally, while in the wake of a horrible massacre in New Zealand, in six days, the prime minister announces a national ban on military-style semiautomatic weapons and large magazines? Is that discouraging? \u00a0 MURPHY: Well, listen: It's not just discouraging \u2014 it's heartbreaking. This is one of those life or death issues. By not keeping these dangerous military-style weapons off the streets, we're choosing to endorse mass murder. I mean, I know that sounds harsh, but I believe it. These are copycat killers in the United States. It's not a coincidence that they all use a variant of the same weapon. You know, in Sandy Hook, Adam Lanza studied the kind of weapons and the kind of gear that other mass killers had used. And they all used the AR-15. Nobody, no hunter needs an AR-15. Nobody needs a semiautomatic rifle of that capacity to guard their home. But killers need those guns, because that's how they shoot as many people as possible. And New Zealand is another example of that. Now, we're different than New Zealand. We're not a parliamentary system. Our founding fathers created a government in which change is purposely difficult. So, you know, I don't expect the United States to be able to enact change in the way that a parliamentary government could. But we've had plenty of time to wise up to the consequence of our weak gun laws.\u00a0 MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So, what is the way forward for proponents of gun measures like yourself in face of this seemingly elusive goal? MURPHY: \u00a0Yeah. I mean, we just have to continue to build and build political power so that we continue to get stronger than the gun lobby. We are stronger than the gun lobby today. That's why we won all these elections in 2018. That's why there are 18 less NRA A-rated Members of Congress than there were before 2018. We're just going to have to continue to get stronger and stronger so that people can't get elected to Congress unless they support common sense measures, like universal background checks and restrictions on military-style weapons. I mean, it's not like we haven't convinced the public. The public supports us on assault weapons and on background checks. It's only that our political, that our electoral process hasn't caught up.\u00a0 MONTOYA-GALVEZ: So, you're confident that there will be a time in American politics when the same kind of change that is taking place in New Zealand can happen here? MURPHY: I mean, I'm completely confident that we are going to change our gun laws to reflect where the American public really is. First thing that is going to happen is we're going to pass universal backgrounds checks. And so, I believe eventually, we will get rid of these dangerous military-style semiautomatic weapons. But the first change we'll make is to amend our background check laws.\u00a0 MONTOYA-GALVEZ: And lastly senator, so I can let you go. What do you think about the way Democrats running for the presidential nomination have engaged with this issue? I mean, have they engaged and addressed gun control enough, in your opinion?\u00a0 MURPHY: This a litmus test issue for the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party isn't going to nominate anybody who doesn't support banning assault weapons and passing universal background checks. I hope that we nominate a champion, not just an advocate.I'm going to be pushing for presidential candidates that claim this will be a priority for them when they get elected.\u00a0 MONTOYA-GALVEZ: Because we've seen them talk in depth about the Green New Deal or Medicare for all, or now recently abolishing the Electoral College, that proposal, but there hasn't been a lot of talk about gun control. Is that concerning? MURPHY: Well, that's not true. That's what people have covered. So, all these candidates are talking changing our nation's gun laws \u2014 it's just not what's being covered in the news.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News. Based in Washington, he covers immigration policy and politics.",

            "article_content": "Socialism used to be a dirty word in American politics, but in today's Democratic Party, you'd hardly know it. One of the top contenders for the party's presidential nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, is a self-described democratic socialist. And the breakout star of the current Congress, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, ran on a democratic socialist platform to defeat top House Democrat Joe Crowley in 2018. But it isn't just lawmakers who have embraced the label. Young Americans, particularly those born after the end of the Cold War, say they want the U.S. to become more socialist. A recent Harvard Caps/Harris poll of 1,792 registered voters obtained by The Hill found 56 percent of 18 to 24-year-olds favor a \"mostly socialist\" system. The same is true of 48 percent of those aged 25 to 34. One Gallup poll last year even found Democrats prefer socialism to capitalism. President Trump and his allies, however, are betting that most voters still aren't ready to see a socialist in the White House. In recent months, Mr. Trump has repeatedly insisted that a Democratic win in 2020 would put America on the road to socialism, a tactic that's become more noticeable during the administration's ongoing standoff with Venezuela's authoritarian socialist government. So, why is the idea of socialism so appealing now? And, three decades after the Soviet Union's collapse, what does socialism even mean?  Socialism was likely first used in a political context by followers of the 19th-century British social reformer Robert Owen. Traditionally, it's associated with the concept that the \"means of production\" should be both owned and operated by the state, although the 20th century saw the emergence of many divergent strands of socialism that often competed with each other. \"There are many different kinds of socialism,\" Michael Kazin, a history professor at Georgetown University who is an expert in U.S. politics and social movements in the 19th and 20th centuries, and who describes himself as a democratic socialist, told CBS News. \"That's part of the reason why it's easy for the president to attack Democrats by linking them to Venezuela, which of course is not a socialism that anybody that I know of in the United States wants to emulate.\" \"But the original meaning of it is a society -- that's where it comes from -- which is socialized so that everybody benefits from it and one that is democratically governed by everybody in the society,\" Kazin said. \"It's a utopian notion originally.\" Socialism came to be heavily associated with the work of 19th century German economist Karl Marx and the emergence of labor unions. By the turn of the 20th century, socialist parties were represented in several European parliaments. And after Russia's October Revolution 1918, the first \"socialist state\" was established: the Soviet Union, which hewed to the idea of the state owning the means of production. Unlike most of the rest of the world, the U.S. has never had a major socialist party. But it still always had its supporters, including a number of celebrities, trade unionists, and prominent intellectuals. \"This is not the first time that socialism has had a high profile in America. I mean 100 years ago, a little less than 100 years ago in the 1908-1918 or so period, you know there were many more socialists in America than there are now,\" including Hellen Keller and Charlie Chaplin,\" Kazin said.  From the beginning, American socialists fought over which form of socialism was the genuine article. Many of them originally embraced Soviet communism, although that became an increasingly marginal opinion among socialists as the Cold War began. Others remained socialists but were critical of the Soviet model and other examples of similarly repressive forms of socialism in places like China and Cuba, which led to the emergence of groups like the Democratic Socialists of America in the 1980s.  Kazin said the socialism most Americans are embracing is what Europeans would call social democracy, a view associated with mainstream parties like the Labour Party in the U.K. and the SPD in Germany. This version, Kazin said, advocates \"a much larger welfare state where everyone is pretty much guaranteed a place to live, a job, or at least good benefits if they can't find a job, health care that they can afford, which is subsidized by the government.\" After decades on the fringes of American political discourse, the Democratic Socialists of America is enjoying a surge in membership and interest. Although still small compared to other political interest groups, it's ballooned from 7,000 to some 50,000 members since the 2016 election, according to organizers. Ocasio-Cortez is a member, as is fellow first-term Rep. Rashida Tlaib. Chris Riddiough, a founding member of the Democratic Socialists of America who now serves as a DSA National Political Committee member, said DSA strives to represent a \"big tent\" of socialism. But at its core, she says, socialism entails a belief that the American economy treats people unfairly and must be put on a new course. \"In DSA we define our politics as a big tent of socialism,\" Riddiough said. \"And that means our view is that there is not a correct line on socialism. But in general, we believe that it encompasses the idea of economic and political and civil democracy so that people have the resources they need to make it in the world. So we support things like Medicare for All, some of the recent child-care proposals, college tuition breaks, things like that. And we believe that the economy in particular over the last 20, 30 years or so has become increasingly undemocratic.\" Most self-described socialists in the U.S. today don't want a government-run economy but an \"economy where the government has a larger role to play in guaranteeing the basic necessities of life,\" Kazin said.  His point echoes arguments made by Sanders when he ran for president in 2016. When asked what his kind of socialism looks like in practice, the Vermont senator would point to Denmark and other Nordic countries, not Cuba or Venezuela. Comparing the autocratic socialism of underdeveloped countries to the kind that exists in wealthy democracies, Kazin argues, is like \"comparing apples and coconuts.\" The human rights issues countries like Cuba and Venezuela are clearly problematic.\u00a0 But Joshua Muravchik, a fellow with the World Affairs Institute who authored \"Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism,\" said that the European democracies that Kazin and Sanders point to as models \"aren't socialist and they actually pulled back from socialism, and Sweden has a quite robust private sector.\" \"The point is that democratic socialists or social democrats were successful to a degree in creating what is usually called a 'welfare state,' which we also have in the U.S\u2026but they achieved this only by abandoning socialism,\" Muravchik, a former socialist turned neoconservative and critic of the system, said.  \"If you want to say that Denmark and Iceland have a 'version of socialism,' then you have to say that every democracy in the world does, too, because they all have one degree or another of welfare state. If they have a version of socialism, they also all have capitalism. Every democracy has a 'mixed economy.'\" Regardless of how the term is defined, it's clear that Americans have become more open to the idea of socialism. This is particularly true since the Great Recession and Sanders' 2016 campaign for president, which drove conversations about socialist ideas into the mainstream. \"I think Bernie Sanders entering the race in 2015 made it possible to talk about socialism and a lot of the policies that he was putting forward, and I think his entry into the race now also helps shape the debate,\" Riddiough said.  Today, even Democratic presidential candidates who eschew the socialist label \u2013 such as Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren \u2013 have embraced policies championed by Sanders, such as expanding Medicare coverage to all Americans regardless of age. Such progressive policies \u2014 and socialism in general \u2014 are something the Republican National Committee will focus on in its messaging as the 2020 presidential cycle progresses. Mr. Trump already highlighted socialism in his State of the Union address, and socialism was a key theme in many speeches at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) last week.\u00a0 \"The debate between capitalism and socialism will take center stage in 2020,\" RNC spokesman Steve Guest told CBS News. \"The RNC will continue to spotlight all of the good news that is happening in our country thanks to President Trump's free-market approach. And, we will make sure Americans are fully aware of the Democrat 2020 candidates efforts to make their radical, far-left socialist policies the mainstream in today's Democrat Party.\"\u00a0 Perhaps the greatest divide in the approaching Democratic primaries will be deciding just how far left the party is willing to go. Polling indicates that the majority of Democratic voters want an electable candidate first and foremost, which may make them wary of socialist-endorsed proposals necessitating big tax hikes. Sanders' Medicare for All plan would cost an astronomical $32.6 trillion, according to one study by the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently questioned how the nation would pay for Medicare for All, although proponents of the idea argue it would control costs in the long run. \"Thirty trillion dollars. Now, how do you pay for that?\" Pelosi asked in a recent interview with Rolling Stone.  The Green New Deal proposal, a plan to transform the economy to combat climate change and dramatically expand the welfare state, would also cost tens of trillions of dollars. Top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett recently estimated the plan would shave 10 to 15 points off U.S. GDP if implemented. And although the Green New Deal is championed by lawmakers like Ocasio-Cortez, most top Democrats have been skittish about embracing it in full. \"The 'Green New Deal' is a joke,\" Muravchik said. \"If enacted we would get one year into it, and it would be repealed because it would be so disruptive to the economy.\" Medicare for All and other social democratic priorities, such as free college, would be \"harmful but less catastrophic, except for my grandchildren and your children who would be left to try to pay down the debt,\" Muravchik added.  Still, in a sign that the Democratic Party has moved decidedly left in recent years, some economic issues are likely to become a \"litmus test\" in the Democratic nomination, Kazin said. And Riddiough argues that while nothing is more important than defeating Mr. Trump in 2020, Democrats should not assume that a hard-left candidate couldn't win in the general election. \"I do think that's a concern,\" Riddiough said of Democrats choosing someone electable in the general election. \"But I don't think it's a question of being too far left. It's more a question of, which candidate is going to be able to win over voters with their ideas?\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Asked in September about her support for \"Medicare for All,\" Elizabeth Warren insisted at the\u00a0third presidential debate\u00a0that all Americans\u2014even those in rural communities\u2014could still seek treatment at their local hospitals under the universal healthcare plan. \"So let's be clear about this. People will have access to all of their doctors, all of their nurses, their community hospitals, their rural hospitals,\" the Massachusetts Democrat vowed. A Pew Research Study\u00a0published\u00a0last year, showed that \"getting to a hospital is a longer trip\u2014both in distance and time\u2014for people in rural areas.\" The University of North Carolina\u00a0has tracked\u00a0some 160 rural hospital closures nationwide since 2005, including in Nevada, South Carolina, and Ohio, the host of Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate. Across the country, in fact, at least 99 rural hospitals have shut down since 2010.\u00a0 After the Nye County Regional Medical Center was shuttered without warning\u00a0in 2015, Nevadans in towns like Tonopah were left hundreds of miles from the nearest hospital.\u00a0 \"They shut the doors and that was it,\" Elaine Minges, a Tonopah resident, recalled earlier this year.\u00a0 Minges' husband, Curt, suffered from a serious complication from diabetes some time later. The situation required prompt medical attention, but with the local hospital closed, none was to be found.\u00a0 \"That particular night, the helicopter was 45 minutes out before they could get to the airport, and in that time, he went into cardiac arrest,\" Elaine Minges said. When Fairfield Memorial Hospital in South Carolina\u00a0closed\u00a0last year, residents in parts of Fairfield County were left with a 45-minute drive from their nearest hospital.\u00a0 \"It doesn't matter what kind of health condition you have, whether it's a stroke, or a heart attack, or a car accident,\" health care consultant Anton Gunn told CBS News. \"It's hard for any community, particularly in a rural community like that to survive.\"\u00a0 Gunn, who also worked for the Department of Health and Human Services and helped implement the Affordable Care Act, says that prevention is the pertinent to any substantive public health conversation.\u00a0 \"I've known plenty of people who've had coverage for years and still have died sicker and quicker than they should have because we haven't focused on a prevention framework,\" said Gunn. \"It's not just looking at providing people insurance coverage but how do we help people to live healthy in their homes [and] in their communities.\" In the final years of Nye County's hospital,\u00a0an investigation\u00a0by The Dallas Morning News found records of mismanagement and regulatory neglect. Behind rural hospital closures in South Carolina, local experts cite failing industry, diminishing populations, and poverty as some of the key factors. But experts and candidates diverge on whether universal healthcare proposals\u2014from Bernie Sanders' proposed Medicare for All, which would eliminate most private insurance in favor of a government-run system, to more modest efforts like giving Americans the option of choosing publicly-funded insurance \u2014 could drive America's remaining rural hospitals into the red. \"Until there's more details on these Medicare for All proposals, it's hard to say how that would impact,\" says Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association (NRHA). Though the NRHA\u00a0has not joined\u00a0other industry groups in lobbying against Medicare for All, Morgan is skeptical of the current single-payer proposals. \"If they pushed it forward just as it currently is, no I can't imagine how that would work and I can't imagine you wouldn't see more rural hospitals closing,\" says Morgan, adding that \"the key\" for rural hospitals is determining Medicare's reimbursement rates. One study, funded by industry critics of Medicare for All,\u00a0warned in August\u00a0that a public option risked shuttering 55 percent of rural hospitals even if only a portion of patients fled \"higher-paying commercial plans.\"\u00a0 This possible risk to rural hospitals has been highlighted by candidates like John Delaney and Joe Biden. \"Under the Biden Plan, which preserves individuals' ability to choose private insurance, these hospitals won't be threatened by having to get by on low Medicare reimbursement rates for all,\" the former vice president's\u00a0campaign argues.\u00a0 But several candidates, from Medicare for All proponents like Elizabeth Warren to public option boosters like Pete Buttigieg, have also explicitly vowed to increase reimbursement rates for rural hospitals.\u00a0 They have also rallied behind creating new designations for rural hospitals with enhanced Medicare reimbursement. \"Rural emergency medical centers\" or \"community outpatient hospitals,\" could allow for rural healthcare facilities to transition into more advanced \"urgent care\" facilities, while stopping short of full-fledged hospitals. In a House hearing earlier this year, a Congressional Budget Office researcher estimated rural hospitals could benefit from a single-payer system.\u00a0 \"Many rural hospitals are in, they're called critical access hospitals, and they receive higher payments than would be otherwise provided under Medicare,\" Jessica Banthin\u00a0testified in May. \"They often treat a lot of public pay patients, as well as patients who are uninsured. It is possible under a single-payer that some of those rural hospitals would be better off.\" Medicare for All proponents argue that savings from\u00a0a reduced administrative burden\u00a0and a revenue boost from\u00a0a surge of patients\u00a0could also buoy rural healthcare.\u00a0A health assessment\u00a0commissioned this year in Nevada found that even insured patients avoided seeking care, concerned with cost or confused with what services their plan covered. \"For starters, you're dealing with really low volume,\" Dr. John Packham, an associate dean researching rural healthcare at the University of Nevada Reno, told CBS News. \"Some of the hospitals that I work with, literally have two or three inpatients a day but you nonetheless have to staff it for nursing 24/7. You have to have lab and radiology available.\" But both Packham and Morgan agree that some rural communities may never have the volume of patients to sustain full-fledged hospitals. \"As a nation, we're paying these rural hospitals for volume and they're just never going to have volume,\" said Morgan. \"We need to start paying them to keep their communities healthy.\" Of the\u00a0twelve Democratic candidates\u00a0on the debate stage Tuesday in Ohio, at least six of the presidential hopefuls \u2014    \u00a0Joe Biden,\u00a0Pete Buttigieg,\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro,\u00a0Amy Klobuchar,\u00a0Bernie Sanders, and\u00a0Elizabeth Warren\u00a0\u2014     have outlined specific written plans to tackle health outcomes for rural patients. To address rural America's\u00a0shortage of healthcare workers, most candidates have pledged to subsidize and incentivize medical professionals through programs like\u00a0the National Health Service Corps\u00a0and the\u00a0Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. Both Klobuchar and Buttigieg's plans also explicitly call to expand the\u00a0\"Conrad 30\" program, which allows immigrant doctors practicing in underserved areas to remain in the country. And nearly every candidate has floated ideas to invest and expand \"telehealth\" options or \"telemedicine,\" essentially doctor's appointments\u00a0via video conference. Biden would expand the\u00a0U.S. Department of Agriculture's grant funding\u00a0to emphasize telehealth \"for mental health and specialty care.\" Buttigieg calls for doubling funding to the Federal Communications Commission's \"Rural Health Care Program\" subsidies.\u00a0 Kellye McKenzie, a South Carolina-based public health practitioner, says that it's important for candidates to explore the power of telehealth because of the impact it can have on rural communities in places like schools.\u00a0 \"You can't talk about rural health in 2019 and not talk about what a game-changer telehealth would be in the conversation,\" said McKenzie. \"Mental health issues are huge and the reality that these services aren't in schools however could be through telehealth, to me is incredibly exciting.\" Warren's plan promises to set aside a $25 billion \"capital fund\" for improving care in these communities, listing possible projects like building a new \"Rural Health Clinic\" or \"improving transportation to the nearest hospital.\"\u00a0 CBS News spoke with multiple experts who cited that transportation and other social economic factors are vital components of a prevention-focused community framework that is pertinent to any healthcare discussion.\u00a0 Biden is the only candidate to specifically endorse the NRHA-backed \"Save Rural Hospitals Act\" in his platform, though some ideas from the measure appear in many of the candidates' plans. And Buttigieg calls for the passage of the \"Rural MOMS Act\" in his plan, which would direct funding towards maternal health in rural communities. But for Russell Pillers, a consultant working in Nye County in the wake of the hospital closure and a self-described conservative, even proposals he favors like telemedicine are far from the \"silver bullet\" to Tonopah's healthcare crisis. \"You're trying to be really creative and we're nibbling around the edge of the main issues to try to find any way we can make some progress,\" Pillers tells CBS News. \"But the big issues to me is really that relationship between an insurance company, in-network providers, out-of-network providers, and patients.\" \"At the core of this, not to be too hyperbolic here, people are dying. To me that puts politics out the window.\"\u00a0 Tim Perry contributed reporting to this story.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Howard Dean's job leading the Democrats' new voter data sharing initiative precludes him from publicly picking a favorite among the ever growing group of presidential contenders. But the one-time presidential candidate and former chairman of the Democratic National Committee is cautioning his party against nominating \"two white guys.\" \"I like young candidates,\" Dean said in an interview with CBS News. \"Our base in our party is women people of color and young people under 35 or 40. They vote overwhelmingly for Democrats. We have to get them to turn out. So I think you want to see really different Democratic Party.\" Dean continued: \"I would be shocked if you saw two white guys at the top of our ticket this time because in the last two elections in 2017, 2018 the people who won look like the American people and we have to keep doing that.\" In his new role, Dean will be tasked with streamlining Democrats' data collection, a significant initiative that ends the longstanding friction between the state and national parties over control and access to voter information. It also enables Democrats to try and catch up with Republicans, who have had a similar system in place for some time.\u00a0 However, Dean said the party is not yet ready to prevent massive cyber breaches like the hack of the DNC and the release of the committee's emails during the 2016 campaign. \"I can guarantee you we're not ready, and we better get ready. Now we've learned some very bitter lessons because of being hacked in 2016. So we're better off than we were. But the hacking war, especially with the Russians, is going to get worse and worse.\" \"They're going to up their capabilities and we're going to have to up ours,\" Dean said. \"But that's something I'm taking really, really seriously as we move down this.\" Democrats currently have one of the largest and most diverse fields in recent history. There are at least 10 contenders who have officially launched presidential campaigns or exploratory committees, including including six women, two African Americans, a Latino, and a gay millennial veteran. The diversity of the field has raised questions about the viability of the 76-year-old Joe Biden. The former vice president said this week he is in the final stages of deciding about a presidential bid, and his family is supportive of another run.  And last week, 77-year-old Sen. Bernie Sanders announced his second presidential campaign, raising an astounding $10 million in his first week. Dean called the grassroots fundraising prowess of his fellow Vermonter \"extraordinary,\" but said Sanders could face \"a harder time this year because there's so many more candidates, there's a different kind of race.\" Dean also pushed back on accusations the presidential candidates are moving too far to the left, but also said the contenders need to come up with better answers to questions about Medicare for All and the Green New Deal. \"I think candidates have to get a little better with their answers,\" Dean said. \"The Green New Deal is not a plan, it is a proposal... There's a four page plan. We need to be committed to the ideals of the Green New Deal. We're going to have an argument later about just exactly how you get there.\" \"This is not a matter of moving the party to the left, it's about making America strong again so everybody can participate,\" Dean said. \"So you are going to see Medicaid for a Medicare for All. Now, there's different ways of doing Medicare for All and smart ways of doing it. You're going to see a better way to get college. There's lots of ways to do 'free college' and people are going to debate how you're going to do it, but they're not going to debate whether you should do it or not.\" Dean dismissed the notion of whether Democrats could be vulnerable to President Trump and Republicans pointing to such policies to paint the party as \"socialists.\"  \"Look, if socialist means we ought to have Medicare for All, everybody should have health insurance in the country, I'm a socialist \u2014 and nobody ever accused me of that ... because I'm concerned about money.\" \"This country is upside down with the worst leadership probably in the history of the country,\" Dean said. \"And we've got to do better, and we will do that but we will not do it better by attacking Donald Trump all the time. Let him attack himself, he does that well. Let us talk about what we're going to do to make the country a better place.\" Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "A majority of freshman Democrats who won House districts held by Republicans in 2018 now support an impeachment inquiry, spurred by the whistleblower complaint about President Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president. As of Thursday afternoon,\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0counts that 35 of the 43 freshman Democrats who flipped districts in last year's midterm elections had expressed support for an impeachment inquiry or believe the president's actions rise to the level of impeachable offenses if the whistleblower's claims prove to be true. It's a notable shift, as most of these freshmen had tight elections in 2018 and were previously tight-lipped on impeachment, partly out of concern for their own re-election efforts. In\u00a0interviews\u00a0with CBS News, some of these lawmakers acknowledged the political risk their actions could have in their reelections. Representative Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer who sits on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said \"every day is a political risk,\" but called the whistleblower complaint \"deeply troubling\" and a threat to the integrity of future elections. Representative Elissa Slotkin of Michigan: \"I understand that there may be political risk, but I can't be basing decisions of integrity based on that.\" Vaughn Derderian is Democratic county chair of Oakland County, which is within Slotkin's district. To him, impeachment doesn't add that much more of a challenge. \"If you were already planning on a hard election, if you were planning for an election to be an 8 to a 9 on difficulty scale, how much can impeachment add to that? Nine to 9.5? That's not too much.\" Republicans are hoping the impeachment shift could boomerang and hurt House Democrats in 2020. The National Republican Congressional Committee issued press releases criticizing each new member who took a stance on impeachment, and chairman Tom Emmer said in a statement that \"backing impeachment will cost the Democrats their majority in 2020.\" Republican Party of Texas spokesman Sam Pohl said it could hurt two freshmen in Texas, Representatives Colin Allred and Lizzie Fletcher. \"They've become more focused on that than they are on solving tough issues facing Texas,\" Pohl told\u00a0Navarro. \"I think they're stuck between a rock and a hard place \u2014 far left folks saying, 'Hey we need impeachment. We need it now.' But if these polling results are accurate, a majority of folks don't want it.\" Spanberger won by 2 points in Virginia's 7th Congressional District, one that Trump won by over 6 points. She currently has two Republican challengers filed, though she has close to a million-dollar lead.\u00a0 \"In a district like mine, everything's risky, right?\" Spanberger said. \"Everybody disagrees with me, everybody agrees with me. It's a mix. So this is an issue of duty, this is an issue of constitutional responsibility.\" ELIZABETH WARREN Senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday offered a rare critique of Senator Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" bill, for which Warren is a co-sponsor, CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak reports. \"What we've got in Medicare for All is a framework, and it doesn't have the details,\" Warren in Keene, New Hampshire, told a man with multiple sclerosis who worried aloud about losing coverage during the transition to Medicare for All.\u00a0 Sanders senior adviser Warren Gunnels fired back Thursday. \"#MedicareForAll isn't a framework. It's a 100-page bill. There have been 2 white papers released on how to finance it & a 200-page study from UMass showing our financing options more than cover the expense,\"\u00a0he tweeted.\u00a0 The issue of health care is a potential weakness for Warren, who despite being known for her laundry list of plans and proposals, has backed Sanders' plan without releasing one of her own. But her \"framework\" comment on Wednesday showed that she may be willing to break from Sanders in the future when it comes to Medicare for All implementation.\u00a0 CORY BOOKER While campaigning in Goffstown, New Hampshire, Senator Cory Booker said his campaign put out a fundraising all-call because, \"we got to a point where we saw candidates that were raising multiples of what we were raising. They had 100% name recognition, and we were not going to be able to stay in competition with them.\"\u00a0 CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says the New Jersey lawmaker implored Granite State voters to pitch in, noting if he does not hit his $1.7 million fundraising goal by end of quarter filing deadline Monday, \"I am likely not going to be in this race.\" As of 9 a.m. this morning, the campaign raised over $1.1 million dollars, according to a spokesperson.\u00a0 NEVADA Pete Buttigieg's campaign\u00a0announced Thursday\u00a0that it would base two members of its national staff in Las Vegas: Travis Brock, national caucus director, and Juan Carlos Perez, national Latinx engagement director. The South Bend mayor's Nevada team has also grown, naming a new senior adviser, Martin Fitzgerald, deputy political director Katie Davis and communications director Olivia Bercow. Though still far smaller than Nevada's largest campaign teams,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says Sanders expects to have nearly 70 people on payroll in the \"first in the West\" caucus state by the end of the month, ahead of Warren's total of \"more 50 paid staff.\" Buttigieg has also recently ramped up, totaling 35 paid staff in the state. CALIFORNIA Tin\u00a0says the National Union of Healthcare Workers\u00a0split its endorsement\u00a0Thursday between Warren and Sanders, after majorities of its 15,000 California members voiced support for both candidates. Under state director Nicole DeMont, the Warren campaign's sole paid California staffer, the Massachusetts senator surged to a lead in\u00a0a Berkeley IGS poll\u00a0this week at 29% among Golden State Democrats, peeling off likely voters from Kamala Harris, Buttigieg and Biden.\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE Former House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, who retired last year, is running for Congress once again,\u00a0reports\u00a0Navarro. The California Republican announced Thursday he will campaign for the House seat currently occupied by Duncan Hunter, a GOP congressman who faces federal charges over alleged misuse of campaign funds. Issa had launched an exploratory committee in late August, during which he said he received more than 2,400 letters and checks averaging $82 asking him to run.\u00a0 \"In politics, when thousands respond to 'I'm looking at this ... I'm exploring it,' you pay attention,\" he said at his press conference in El Lujan, California. Hunter's trial was originally slated for September 10 but was moved to January 14, 2020 \u2014 less than two months before California's multi-step primary, in which the two candidates who receive the most votes, regardless of party, are chosen to face off in the general election.\u00a0 Issa shied away from discussing Hunter's charges, and said he mainly just wanted to keep the seat red. Hunter had consistently won the district by wide margins but faced a close reelection in 2018. Issa himself also faced a tight race in 2016, which he said was a factor in his retirement announcement before the 2018 midterms and his former district, California's 49th, was flipped by Democrat Mike Levin in 2018. Another Republican challenger, Carl DeMaio, said he is staying in the race and\u00a0has raised over $900,000\u00a0within the first 25 days of their campaign.\u00a0 Campa-Najjar, the leading Democratic contender for the seat, blasted Issa, who was once the wealthiest member of Congress.\u00a0 \"It's pretty obvious what's happening here. We currently have a congressman who is facing a criminal trial and completely unfit to serve, so a bunch of other politicians \u2014 including those who don't even live here \u2014 see it as an opportunity to advance their own careers,\" he said in a statement.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi pushed back against claims by President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress that the Democratic Party is embracing socialism, saying the leftist economic model is not viable for the U.S. \"I do reject socialism as an economic system,\" Pelosi said in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired Sunday. \"If people have that view, that's their view. That is not the view of the Democratic Party.\" The most powerful woman in American politics said Republicans have employed an \"ongoing theme\" of trying to incorrectly paint Democrats as fringe socialists for decades. Pelosi cited opposition by some Republicans to more government involvement in health care before the passage of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which created the Medicare and Medicaid programs for Americans aged 65 or older, people with disabilities and low-income families.\u00a0 \"When Medicare was done by the Congress at the time, under Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan said, 'Medicare will lead us to a socialist dictatorship,'\" she said, referring to comments made by President Reagan in 1961, when he warned about the perils of \"socialized medicine\" before running for elected office.\u00a0 House Democrats' resounding victory in the November midterm elections, which allowed Pelosi to retake the speaker's gavel after nearly a decade, also brought new, outspoken progressive lawmakers to Congress, including some self-described democratic socialists like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib.\u00a0 During the new congressional session, the party's progressive wing has pushed for bold proposals like the \"Green New Deal,\" a sweeping plan to overhaul the American economy to mitigate climate change, and \"Medicare for All,\" which would convert health care in the U.S. into a single-payer system. The president and Republicans have cited these proposals to accuse the entire Democratic Party of endorsing fringe, far-left agendas. To warn about the pitfalls of the socialist governance he claims Democrats now advocate for, the president has also\u00a0highlighted the socio-economic crisis in Venezuela, which is ruled by a leftist, but increasingly authoritarian government. Asked if there are major rifts between the moderate and more progressive factions of her party, Pelosi minimized the ideological disagreement among House Democrats. She said all members of her caucus, regardless of their position on the political spectrum, understand the importance of holding \"the center\" of American politics. \"By and large, whatever orientation they came to Congress with, they know that we have to hold the center. That we have to be go down the mainstream,\" she said. Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News. Based in Washington, he covers immigration policy and politics.",

            "article_content": "Fresh off what he and his allies saw as a major victory in the conclusion of the special counsel investigation, President Trump surprised his party this week by embracing a politically perilous subject: health care. \"We're gonna be the party of great health care,\" President Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday, a day after his Justice Department sided with a district court's judgment that the Affordable Care Act should be overturned. \"Obamacare doesn't work, it's too expensive...It's a disaster for our people.\" Democrats greeted Trump's declaration with glee, having won their House majority largely by campaigning on the issue of health care. Republicans, meanwhile, were left scratching their heads, wondering why the president would bring up a sore subject when he had better news to tout. \"I just don't understand how many times we have to play this game to finally learn the lessons. We have seen how this turns out, and it ain't pretty for us,\" one Republican strategist who worked on midterm elections told CBS News. \"The strategy needs to be keeping the focus on Democrats...not on us.\" The GOP's failed attempt to repeal Obamacare in 2017 had a galvanizing effect among Democrats. CBS News exit\u00a0polling\u00a0from the 2018 midterms found health care to be the top issue for voters in an election where Democrats picked up 40 House seats. And 54 percent of midterm voters disapproved of the president.\u00a0 \"I feel comfortable saying that I speak for almost, if not all, Republican senators when I say that this is the last thing they want to discuss,\" said one senior Republican leadership aide. \"Whoever planted this idea in the president's head should be drawn and quartered.\"\u00a0 The issue of health care is again center stage for Democrats as their 2020 presidential primary ramps up. Most candidates have embraced some form of universal health care, and many support Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan. Republicans see an opportunity to exploit that support, painting Democrats as advocating for socialized medicine. \"The Democrats have an offer \u2014 Medicare for All \u2014 which takes away all private insurance for individuals,\" said House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, though not all Democratic candidates support eliminating private insurance. \"The Republicans believe in pre-existing conditions. We believe in lowering the cost and that's what we are working on.\"\u00a0 But the Department of Justice's decision to support nixing Obamacare, which prohibits people with pre-existing conditions from being denied health insurance, makes it difficult for Republicans to make that case.\u00a0 \"I think politically it's not smart,\" said New York Republican Rep. Tom Reed. \"But more substantively, we should be finding areas where we can fix healthcare, and not continue this division of [repealing] Obamacare with no hardcore proposal as to what we're going to do about the millions of folks that are potentially adversely impacted.\" Reed said that while overturning the law could potentially give Republicans leverage to craft their own alternative, \"it's going to cause chaos...why put millions of Americans in harm's way because you want to create a political environment to legislate?\" Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who voted against her party's repeal effort in 2017, said that if the administration is opposed to Obamacare, \"the answer is for the administration to work with Congress and present a plan to replace and fix the law, not to, through the courts, seek to invalidate it altogether.\" While Republicans largely oppose Obamacare on its merits, they have not been able to coalesce around an alternative when they controlled both chambers of Congress and the White House. In a divided government, the task is infinitely more difficult. And Republicans lack a central figure to effectively make the case to the public. \"There is no Bernie Sanders of free market health care in the Republican Party...there's no Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,\" said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"I would be thrilled if the Republican Party just tried to compete on the issue of health care,\" Cannon said, arguing that the administration has been effective on conservative policy, such as expanding short term health care plans. Still, Cannon said he's skeptical of the administration's new approach.\u00a0 \"Republicans could have mounted a highly effective counter attack on health care in 2018. Democrats have fumbled the ball and Republicans are just looking at it lying on the 50 yard line.\"\u00a0 CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan contributed reporting to this story.\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "\"What a night. I loved it.\"\u00a0 That's how former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper began his final remarks as Tuesday's Democratic debate came to a close. The spirited contest, which lasted roughly as long as a blockbuster summer film, saw 10 candidates spar over everything from health care to nuclear weapons. Here are the central takeaways from the first night of the second round of the primary debates.\u00a0 Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, the two leading progressives in the Democratic field, did not come to blows Tuesday night. Instead they fended off, one after another, a series of critiques and criticisms from the likes of Hickenlooper, Rep. Tim Ryan, and former Rep. John Delaney.\u00a0 Sanders and Warren, situated at the center of the stage, were the two highest-polling candidates featured on Tuesday. Neither one attacked the other, despite the fact that they are both competing for voters at the left end of the Democratic spectrum. And given that there are still 23 other candidates competing for the Democratic nomination, perhaps they didn't need to.\u00a0 The attacks on Warren and Sanders came early, particularly in the animated discussion over \"Medicare for All\" that dominated the first half of the debate. The two progressives both favor a version of government-run health care that would essentially eliminate private health insurance altogether, an idea that didn't sit well with the other candidates on stage.\u00a0 The first volleys came during the opening remarks. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, the only new face at Tuesday's debate, criticized what he called \"wish-list economics,\" a thinly veiled shot at the big, expensive proposals offered up by Warren and Sanders. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar similarly knocked candidates who make \"a lot of promises\" but can't deliver. Delaney, a former health care executive, later made mention of what he called the \"fairytale economics\" underpinning progressive plans.\u00a0 But if the applause in Detroit's Fox Theatre was any indication, there are plenty of Democratic voters who want to buy what Warren and Sanders are selling. Or rather not selling: The \"democratic socialist\" from Vermont and the self-proclaimed capitalist from Massachusetts were unconditional in their assertion that health care is a human right and \u2014 in Sanders' words \u2014 \"not a business.\" So the de facto truce between Sanders and Warren lasted another night as other, lower-polling candidates tried to attack them both. Recent CBS News polling indicates that both candidates remain in the top tier of Democratic hopefuls, and as Tuesday's debate came to a close, there was no indication that either was about to fall by the wayside.\u00a0 If there is one issue that divides the Democratic field, it's health care. Warren and Sanders remain unequivocal in their belief that a government-run, single-payer system that exists in many other industrialized countries must be attempted in the U.S. The rest of Tuesday night's candidates, meanwhile, say that what they want is politically foolish, fiscally unworkable, or both.\u00a0 \"Folks, we have a choice,\" Delaney said in his opening remarks. \"We can go down the road that Sen. Sanders and Sen. Warren want to take us with bad policies like Medicare for all, free everything and impossible prices that will turn off independent voters and get Trump re-elected.\" Delaney went on to say that embracing Medicare for All would represent the kind of hard-left turn that doomed progressive Democratic candidates like George McGovern, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis. Hickenlooper insisted that the 40 Democratic House candidates who flipped districts last November did so by by eschewing \"the policies of our frontrunners in center stage.\" Ryan, who represents a Rust Belt seat in Ohio, said that union workers would balk at surrendering their health care plans in favor government-run system.\u00a0 Even Marianne Williamson and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who both endeavored to place themselves between the moderates and the progressives, suggested that Medicare for All would be a bridge too far for Democrats, at least within the time frame proposed by Warren and Sanders.\u00a0 None of these criticisms were new to Warren and Sanders, however, because this is really a very old debate in Democratic politics. Rep. John Dingell first proposed a plan similar to Medicare for All on the floor of the House in 1955. Sen. Ted Kennedy first introduced his version of national health insurance in 1971. And the two late liberal stalwarts teamed up in 2006 to introduce a Medicare for All plan in Congress that, again, went nowhere.\u00a0 Sanders had an eye to that history Tuesday night when he argued that sweeping changes can be implemented quickly.\u00a0 \"[I]nterestingly enough, today is the anniversary of Medicare \u2014 54 years ago, under Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic Congress, they started the program. After one year, 19 million elderly people in it. Please don't tell me that in a four-year period we cannot go from 65 to 55 to 45 to 35. This is not radical. This is what virtually every other country on Earth does,\" he said.\u00a0 But of course, the most prominent Medicare-for-All skeptic in Democratic politics was not on stage Tuesday night.\u00a0 \"We are the Democrats,\" says Sen. Elizabeth Warren, \"We are not about trying to take away health care from anyone. That's what the Republicans are trying to do.\" #DemDebate https://t.co/GM9LbJo6bV pic.twitter.com/nEhWcDyLWh Despite a lackluster performance in the first Democratic debate, Joe Biden is still the front runner. He leads in nearly every early state and national poll and enjoys universal name recognition among voters. President Trump predicted Tuesday that he would be the eventual Democratic nominee. Yet his name was not uttered once during Tuesday's debate, which lasted over two and a half hours.\u00a0 Biden's absence served as a reminder that he continues to own the center lane in the presidential primary. The other relative moderates \u2014 Hickenlooper, Delaney, Ryan, Bullock \u2014 all looked to take up the mantle of the middle, and all struggled to land punches on Warren and Sanders.\u00a0 It was a lopsided contest from the start. Warren and Sanders are both leading contenders for the Democratic nomination, while the centrists on stage remain mired in the low single digits. But it also allowed Warren and Sanders to fine-tune their messaging against the former vice president.\u00a0 \"You know, I don't understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the United States just to talk about what we really can't do and shouldn't fight for,\" Warren said to applause as she sparred with Delaney over environmental policy.\u00a0 And should Warren ever get the chance to face Biden on a debate stage, expect her to say the same thing to him.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Senator Elizabeth Warren is for the first time being treated as a front-runner in the Democratic primary. Seven of her 11 opponents on the debate stage last night directly criticized her, focusing largely on what rival campaigns have said are her greatest weaknesses: her lack of clarity on the nuts and bolts of Medicare for All and the difficulty of accomplishing her plans.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says the exchanges showed that Warren has vulnerabilities to her political right and left, but they also often left former Vice President Joe Biden far in the background throughout much of the debate. Warren took the hardest hits of her campaign so far, but the policies she champions, Medicare for All and her signature wealth tax, dominated portions of the three-hour debate.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN Speaking to reporters on Thursday in Ohio, Joe Biden calmly fielded questions about last night's debate and tried to draw a clear contrast between himself and Warren.\u00a0 Biden said for a person known for her plans, Warren had none for the most important issue in this election \u2013 health care.\u00a0 Then, when asked whether he was concerned about the fact that Warren's campaign has more cash on hand, Biden appeared to take a swipe at the Massachusetts senator saying, \"We did not start off by dropping ten million dollars from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from into a race,\" a hint at the use of Warren's Senate coffers in the current race. (Biden helped raise funds for her last Senate campaign). Biden added, \"We are doing fine. Our fundraising is building, we've raised a lot of money online. And we've raised money offline as well, so we feel confident we are going to be ready.\"\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0pressed the former vice president on whether he had any regrets about not approaching his son, Hunter, after learning through press reports about his Ukrainian job to which Biden said, \"No, I don't.\" Biden then pivoted to the topic of President Trump's tax returns, saying, \"Mr. President, release your tax returns or shut up.\"\u00a0 Biden noted\u00a0 that even President Nixon had released his tax returns.\u00a0 Biden has rarely talked about tax returns on the campaign trail in the past, but now this seems to be his go-to topic when asked questions about his son's foreign jobs. PETE BUTTIGIEG South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign raised over $1 million from thousands of donors in the past 24 hours since Tuesday's debate, according to senior campaign adviser Lis Smith. In a separate tweet, Smith said the campaign has now over 600,000 unique donors.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0notes Buttigieg's campaign said that the campaign had over 580,000 unique donors at the end of the third quarter, which ended on September 30. ON THE MONEY As Democratic presidential candidates head into the final quarter of the year, the majority of them have been spending more money than they were taking in. A look at the third quarter Federal Election Commission filings by\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0found only Senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised more funds than they spent during the months of July through September.\u00a0 At the same time, only those three Democratic candidates, along with Senator Kamala Harris, finished the quarter with more than $10 million cash on hand. According to the filings, Sanders had $33.7 million, Buttigieg had $23.4 million, Warren had $18.7 million and Harris had $10.5 million. Despite his frontrunner status, former Vice President Joe Biden had less than $9 million cash on hand and a burn rate of 110% at the end of September. That's less than $3 million more cash on hand than Andrew Yang had. Julian Castro, John Delaney, Tim Ryan and Wayne Messam had less than $1 million on hand as of September 30. CAST YOUR VOTE Ahead of the 2020 presidential election, a group of election law experts and presidential campaign veterans are launching the \"Voter Protection Corps,\" an initiative designed to combat voter suppression. The team of election-law attorneys, political strategists, technology experts and former campaign aides plans to develop a state-by-state playbook aimed at increasing voter protections particularly among students, communities of color, low income and disabled populations.\u00a0 \"Election integrity is more than essential to our democracy \u2014 it is a core American value,\" U.S. Representative Lauren Underwood (Illinois-14) and Voter Protection Corps Advisory Board member said in a statement to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"I am proud to support the efforts of Voter Protection Corps to advance reforms that restore trust in our process and ensure that each and every American can fully participate in our democracy.\" The Voter Protection Corps will be headed up by Quentin Palfrey, 2018 Democratic nominee for Massachusetts lieutenant governor and Ohio voter protection director for the 2008 Obama campaign. Melanie Gleason and Gretchen Bennet will serve as Voter Protection Corps' chief of staff & advocacy director and Voter Protection director, respectively. The Advisory Board is comprised of U.S. lawmakers and government officials past and present, including: U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger, Aneesh Chopra, State Representative Caroline Simmons, Charles Baker III, U.S. Representative Jim McGovern, U.S. Representative Josh Gottheimer, U.S. Representative Lauren Underwood, Michael Steed, U.S. Representative Mikie Sherrill, and U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva.",

            "article_content": "Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper laid into Sen. Bernie Sanders, a rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, while speaking at a National Press Club event in Washington, D.C. on Thursday.\u00a0 Hickenlooper's criticism of Sanders comes a day after the Vermont senator gave a speech at George Washington University defending what he calls \"democratic socialism.\" Hickenlooper has been a vocal critic of socialism on the trail, an approach that has irked some left-leaning audiences.\u00a0 \"I have great respect for Sen. Sanders. He's provided clarity and urgency around the major issues for working families in America,\" said Hickenlooper on Thursday. \"But I fundamentally disagree that we should do away with the democratic, regulated capitalism that has guided this country for over 200 years.\" Hickenlooper then turned his attention to the rest of crowded 2020 field. \"This position is shared by many of my Democratic colleagues, but for some reason, our party has been reluctant to express its opposition to democratic socialism,\" Hickenlooper said. \"In fact, the Democratic field has not only failed to oppose Sen. Sanders' agenda, they've actually rushed to embrace it.\"\u202f\u202f\u00a0 Sanders, a former mayor of Burlington, has long identified as a democratic socialist. In his speech Thursday, Sanders attempted to link his views to those of President Franklin Roosevelt, saying that \"we must take up the unfinished business of the New Deal and carry it to completion.\" \"We must recognize that in the 21st century, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, economic rights are human rights,\" he said. \"That is what I mean by democratic socialism.\" Sanders routinely polls toward the top of the Democratic primary field. A Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday found him in second place behind former Vice President Joe Biden, with 19 percent support to Biden's 30 percent.\u00a0 Hickenlooper, meanwhile, tends to trail well behind the frontrunners for the Democratic nomination. When asked Thursday about his anemic polling, Hickenlooper answered that voters are not yet playing close attention to the race.\u00a0 Many of Sanders' proposals have been embraced by other Democratic candidates. For example, his signature Medicare for All legislation, which would expand government-funded health care to all Americans, is cosponsored in the Senate by Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker.\u00a0 Hickenlooper, however, says that many of the proposals championed by Sanders and other Democratic candidates, including Medicare for All and the \"Green New Deal,\" are not realistic. Instead, Hickenlooper says he believes in partnerships between the public and private sectors to implement progressive goals, such as how Colorado increased access to long-acting reversible contraception with the help of nonprofits and private philanthropy.\u00a0 \"Medicare for All does not take on fee for service, the major driver of healthcare costs,\" Hickenlooper said Thursday.\u00a0 \"The Green New Deal guarantees every American a federal job \u2013 virtually guaranteeing it will never make it through Congress.\u202f Free college proposals massively raise taxes \u2014 while doing nothing to address economic opportunity for the two-thirds of Americans who will never graduate with a four-year degree.\"\u202f\u202f\u202f\u202f Hickenlooper, however, did say that \"American capitalism\" should be \"reformed as it has many times over our country's history \u2014 from Teddy Roosevelt's trust-busting to Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal.\"\u00a0 \"American capitalism must be reformed, but we will not solve our problems by endlessly expanding government or by demonizing the private sector,\" he said later in the speech.\u00a0",

Several times during his remarks, which could have been easily confused for a campaign rally, Biden alluded to a potential run, telling the crowd \"we're ready to take anybody on.\" Biden, thanking the crowd their enthusiasm and energy, told them to \"save it a little longer, I may need it in a few weeks.\" \"Be careful what you wish for,\" he added while laughing as the crowd applauded. Biden is reportedly very close to making a final decision about a run, and new polling indicates that the former vice president now leads among 2020 Democratic candidates in Iowa without even making his campaign official. According to multiple people familiar with his planning, a formal kickoff for\u00a0Biden's run is expected by mid-April.\u00a0 Biden's comments to the group come a day after his\u00a0fellow Delawarian, Sen.

Biden appealed to the crowd of workers, slamming attempts to end collective bargaining for public workers. \"I don't see any reason why you should be denied the right to collective bargaining. Who the hell are these guys?...Why are we even having this argument?\" said Biden.\u00a0 He later blasted Mr. Trump's recent budget proposals, criticized sweeping cuts to Medicare and Medicaid programs and \"excessive\" tax breaks for the wealthy.\u00a0 \"Did you see the budget that was just introduced? It cuts $845 billion...in Medicare and $240 billion in Medicaid. Why? Because of a tax cut for the super wealthy that created a deficit of $1.9 trillion and now they've got to make somebody pay for it.\" \"Trading medicare and medicaid for tax breaks...how's that going to help the people in this room?\" Biden questioned.\u00a0 The former vice president ended his speech, urging those assembled to \"remember what makes this nation so special.\" \"America is an idea, an idea that goes back to our founding,\" said Biden. \"There's no reason why we can't own the 21st century the rest of the world needs us to lead.\" Upon leaving the stage to a room of loud applause, Biden shouted: \"It's time to get up, remember who the hell we are.\" Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

I am sorry for the harm I have caused. I have listened, and I have learned a lot,\" she said at the Frank LaMere Native American Presidential Forum in Sioux City, Iowa.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says the issue has tormented Warren since before she announced her candidacy, and it resurfaced last week when President Donald Trump brought back his \"Pocahontas\" nickname for her. Although the Cherokee Nation said Warren had apologized for the DNA test last year, she had not done so publicly before Monday. KAMALA HARRIS On Monday, Harris faced criticism over comments she made about Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" plan at a fundraiser over the weekend. A transcript provided to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0says Harris told donors, \"I support Medicare for All, but as you may have noticed, over the course of the many months, I've not been comfortable with Bernie's plan, the Medicare for all plan.\"\u00a0 The California senator went on to say, \"I've been listening to people, and people do want to \u2014 to your point \u2014 they don't want to not have a private option.\"\u00a0 RNC Communications Director Michael Ahrens\u00a0tweeted Monday afternoon, \"Who does she think she's fooling?\" Ahrens included a video clip showing Harris speaking at the Vermont senator's single-payer bill introduction in 2017. Harris is expected to visit California for another round of high-dollar fundraisers this week, including one on Thursday in Los Angeles hosted by actress Jessica Alba.

The president himself endorsed Bishop at a Greenville rally in July, and Donald Trump Jr. is also scheduled to attend fundraisers on August 28 for Bishop and Dr. Gregory Murphy, a GOP candidate for NC-03's special election.\u00a0 The high-profile special election in NC-09, which was called after ballot fraud was found in 2018, and NC-03's election both take place Sept. 10. Millions in ad money has been pouring in from both sides, with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee making its latest ad buy on Friday. CAROLINA ON MY MIND State Lt. Gov. Dan Forest, a Republican, officially launched his 2020 campaign for governor on Saturday. He's aiming to unseat incumbent Democratic Governor Roy Cooper, who was first elected governor in 2016.\u00a0 At his campaign rally, Forest vowed to travel to every county and said he would refuse to \"engage in divisive, negative campaigning or character assassination.\" A Forest campaign aide told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0the promise applies to both the primary and general elections. \u00a0 \"I think the rationale is, Dan has looked out over past couple of years and has seen the name-calling and nasty campaigning that doesn't try to compete on a better vision or better ideas but rather who can tear down their opponent\u2026that's not the kind of person he wants to be,\" the aide said. Forest's main primary challenger so far is state representative Holly Grange.\u00a0 ON THE $$$ Kamala Harris spent the weekend attending a series of high-dollar fundraising events in Martha's Vineyard and the Hamptons, where she reportedly raked in $1 million across multiple events.\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0said on Friday, Harris attended a fundraiser hosted by filmmaker Spike Lee at his home in Martha's Vineyard.\u00a0 On Sunday, Harris hit several fundraisers in the Hamptons, including one with about 150 attendees at the Water Mill home of MWWPR CEO Michael Kempner. Tickets started at $1,000. She also attended a Hamptons fundraiser described as a family event at the home of Jonathan Henes, who is a partner at Kirkland & Ellis.

South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is slated to fundraise in the Hamptons over Labor Day weekend. Former Vice President Joe Biden was also fundraising over the weekend in Cape Code where he attended two a fundraisers including one at the home of Beacon Capital Partners CEO Alan Leventhal.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Manchester, N.H.\u00a0\u2014 When independent Sen. Bernie Sanders returns to New Hampshire as a second-time presidential candidate, it's likely he'll receive a chilly reception. Three  years after the Granite State delivered Sanders his first primary win over Hillary Clinton \u2014 by a 23-point margin \u2014 many of the Democratic voters here now think his moment has come and gone. His presidential campaign comes as the Democratic Party is pushing for younger, more diverse candidates, and many in the already sizable field champion progressive ideas like Medicare for All that Sanders has held for years. While many New Hampshire voters told CBS News it's too early to choose a favorite candidate, it's apparently not too early to reject candidates like Sanders or even former Vice President Joe Biden, a sentiment frequently distilled into a cry for \"no more old white men.\" \"I  think the time for old white men has gone for the moment,\" Ellen Barnett, 71, told CBS News at an event for Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. \"Amen!\"  The woman standing next to her shouted in agreement. \"I  don't even take them as serious candidates, actually,\" Barnett added. \"I  think [Sanders] should take a step back and support the next wave of politicians,\" Kara Lamarche, 44, said. \"Enough is enough. I think it's time for him to retire.\" New Hampshire progressive talk radio host and former gubernatorial candidate Arnie Arnesen, who claims to be one of the most vocal Sanders supporters in 2016, had hoped he would stay out of the fray in order to protect his brand. \"Some of us get to open doors and others get to walk through them,\" Arnesen said. A run now, according to Arneson, \"almost looks like he cares more about Bernie than about us.\"\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Even older white Democratic male party leaders in the state are moving on. State Rep. Skip Cleaver of Nashua, 74, said he is actively embracing more diverse candidates, and former U.S. Amb. George Bruno, a  veteran campaign luminary here, said he has an age cap for the next Democratic nominee: 70. Christian  Conti, 24, a 2016 Sanders supporter said it was just not his age on paper but also his energy, a quality President Trump, 72, is fond of mocking when he believes Democrats are \"low energy.\"  \"Trump  has this high energy somehow, he is go-go-go and gets things done and is up all night and somehow never tired, and some people think he is on speed or something,\" Conti said. \"But, you know, Bernie is just old.\"  Sanders  would be 79 years old at his inauguration should he win, and he is keenly aware of his ageist critics.  \"When  we look at people whether they're old or they're young, you gotta look at the totality of the person,\" Sanders told \"CBS This Morning\" earlier on Tuesday. \"I  was a cross-country runner, a long distance runner when I was a kid, and I've been running hard, in a sense, since then,\" Sanders said. \u00a0 \"I  supported Bernie wholeheartedly in 2016 ... but I think he needs to make more room for people who are women and people of color to talk about their own experience that is more powerful than what he is able to do,\" another former Sanders supporter Linds Jakows,  28, told CBS News. Sen.  Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., mentioned Sanders twice on Friday during an event in Somersworth, first citing their recently introduced bill to \"blow the cap\" on Social Security and then later, said her and Sanders are the only two who support a \"transaction  tax\" on Wall Street. Several  supporters of Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's presidential candidacy recalled her decision to quit her post at the Democratic National Committee in 2015 so she could officially endorse Sanders.  Now,  after a town hall in North Hampton, Gabbard wouldn't say if she fully welcomed Sanders into the race, though she was asked three times. \"Bernie  Sanders is his own man and he is going to make his own decision,\" Gabbard said.  Other  candidates who campaigned in New Hampshire this week are excited about touting progressive issues that Sanders has advocated for years. One of those proposals is Medicare for All. New Jersey Democrat\u00a0Sen. Cory Booker\u00a0and Sen. Kamala Harris, of California, mentioned the policy this weekend while campaigning in New Hampshire, and crowds responded enthusiastically.  \"You  may recall that in 2016 many of the ideas that I talks about \u2014 Medicare for all, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, making public colleges and universities tuition-free ... All of those ideas and many more are now part of the political mainstream,\" Sanders  told CBS This Morning. Asked  if the other candidates are copying him, Sanders replied, \"Well, I don't want to say that.\" He then smiled and added, \"I think most people would say that.\" Bo Erickson is a reporter covering the White House for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "\"Where Did You Get This Number?\" is a podcast going inside the 2020 presidential campaigns, with analysis from CBS News campaign embeds, polls and other stories from the 2020 race.\u00a0Subscribe today!\u00a0\u00a0 South Carolina, the fourth state on the 2020 primary schedule, presents a unique challenge for the 2020 Democratic candidates.\u00a0 They are addressing a more racially and politically diverse electorate, with South Carolina being the first primary state with a majority African American Democratic constituency. Voters in South Carolina are also more socially conservative than in the other early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada. On this week's episode of \"Where Did You Get This Number?\", host Anthony Salvanto and CBS News 2020 campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell explore how the 2020 candidates are campaigning in the Palmetto State in light of former Vice President Joe Biden's consistent lead in the polls there. Specifically, what voting blocs and coalitions are they courting to boost their support in the state? Biden has held a lead in South Carolina among African-American voters and a third of white voters since the outset of the race, according to the latest CBS News Battleground Tracker poll. \"I think all of [the candidates] can agree that Biden has a strong hold on the African-American voting bloc here, especially with older African-Americans,\" Mitchell said. She specifically highlighted African-American women, many of whom tell her they have felt forgotten and neglected despite their contributions. \"We want to feel like the candidate that we help elect is going to remember us and not just mention us \u2014 and not just say, you know, 'job well done,' but actually consider our thoughts and opinions at the table,\" said Mitchell, relaying the sentiments of the founder of Black Women Vote 2020. The religious base is another crucial demographic for the 2020 candidates, which \"can make or break a campaign,\" according to Mitchell. \"So you see candidates on Sundays, when they're in the state, they go to church, they give remarks, they stay after, they hug people, they shake hands,\" Mitchell said. South Carolina is also the first primary state where the 2020 candidates are encountering the more conservative wing of the Democratic Party. Mitchell pointed to California Democratic Senator and\u00a0former candidate Kamala Harris discussing her \"Medicare for All\" plan at a town hall in Goose Creek, South Carolina. \"She almost made it seem like her plan is more realistic without using the word,\" said Mitchell, specifically alluding to Harris emphasizing an option for voters to keep their current health care plan. \"There are ways that you have to package a message for voters here that don't come off to 'oh, I'm giving everything to everyone for free.'\" Subscribe to\u00a0\"Where Did You Get This Number?\"\u00a0and listen to the latest episode to hear more about the 2020 candidates' efforts to reach a variety of voters, as well as stories about, and conversations with, everyday South Carolinians.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign is rolling out a new digital advertisement in Iowa focused on health care, which he continues to make a signature issue of his candidacy.\u00a0 \"When it comes to family, it's being there that counts,\" the narrator says. \"Because every moment matters. And every family deserves to have good healthcare from day one. So let's build on Obamacare and finish the job.\" The 15-second ad, called \"Family,\" is running on YouTube. It is part of the campaign's six-figure advertising campaign on television and digital platforms in Iowa.\u00a0 Here's the ad that was released Tuesday morning: According to data from the media tracking firm Advertising Analytics, Biden's campaign has spent $686,573 on television advertisements in the Hawkeye State. The Biden campaign says \"Family\" is designed to complement the health care message in other television and digital advertisements by hitting voters multiple times a day. While the ad will reach voters across Iowa, the campaign says it will specifically focus on new parents, and it will target voters who are engaging with products designed for newborns.\u00a0 Most of the advertisement features home pictures and videos, which the campaign gathered from supporters. It shows families spending time together and newborn babies in the hospital before closing with a shot of Biden hugging former President Obama. Biden has been the frontrunner in the Democratic primary since entering the race. In the most recent CBS News Battleground Tracker poll, 29% of registered Iowa voters who are Democrats said Biden is their top choice for the nomination, followed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders with 26% and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren with 17%.\u00a0 Health care is the top issue for Democrats in Iowa, with 89% saying the issue is \"very important,\" according to a July CBS News poll. In that poll, 66% of Iowa Democrats said they preferred a national health insurance plan that competes with private insurance, while 34% preferred eliminating private insurance.\u00a0 Biden has drawn sharp contrasts with Sanders and Warren on healthcare by saying that Democrats should build on the Affordable Care Act rather than pushing for a \"Medicare for All\" system that eliminates private insurance.\u00a0 \"I know that the senator says she's for Bernie, well, I'm for Barack,\" Biden said during the third Democratic debate, referring to Warren and Sanders' shared stance on Medicare for All. \"I think the Obamacare worked. I think the way \u2014 we add to it, replace everything that's been cut, add a public option, guarantee that everyone will be able to have affordable insurance.\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "In a new emotional appeal to Iowa caucus voters, former Vice President Joe Biden is putting the fight for access to adequate health care at the top of his to do list, telling supporters that safeguarding the Obama-era Affordable Care Act \"is personal to me.\" The minute-long spot dubbed \"personal\" opens with images of Biden being sworn into the U.S. Senate next to the hospital bed of his young sons back in 1972 after the car crash that killed their mother and baby sister. Then, Biden goes on to talk about his son Beau Biden's terminal cancer diagnosis. The younger Biden ended up losing his life to brain cancer in 2015, at the age of 46. Before he died, he asked his father to promise to stay in politics, Biden later said.\u00a0 \"The fact of the matter is health care is personal to me. Obamacare is personal to me. When I see the president try to tear it down \u2014 and others propose to replace it and start over \u2014 that's personal to me too,\" Biden says in the ad.\u00a0 Biden has vowed to build upon the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2014 one of the central pillars to the Obama administration. He is proposing the addition of a \"public option\" to the health care law to allow Americans to buy into a Medicare-like system that resembles what is available to those who are at least 65 years old. The fate of the law, however, faces legal jeopardy as the Trump administration wages a legal battle to dismantle it in the courts.\u00a0 \"We are reaching Iowans on the airwaves and online to create a surround-sound message about protecting and expanding their access to health care,\" said Greg Schultz, campaign manager.\u00a0 This message of the ad mirrors Biden's criticism on the trail about his Democratic rivals' desire to scrap the law and start over with a single-payer \"Medicare for All\" policy, something Biden has slammed as \"unrealistic.\"\u00a0 It is the second ad for Biden in Iowa as part of a \"high six-figure\" ad buy according to the Biden campaign. The campaign intends to roll out complimentary digital ads in the state each showcasing key parts of Biden's plan to protect and build on the health care law. According to media intelligence firm Advertising Analytics, the Biden campaign has booked about $339,000 in ad time on broadcast and cable in Iowa over the next two weeks.

            "article_content": "Des Moines, Iowa \u2014 As a seemingly endless parade of Democratic presidential candidates filtered through the Iowa State Fair this past weekend they were faced with many choices: Which fried foods should be eaten in front of the camera? Whose hands must be shaken? What's the best way to win over this narrow yet deeply important slice of the the party's electorate?\u00a0   But with two dozen candidates competing for their vote, the Democratic faithful at the fair were also struggling with an abundance of options.\u00a0   CBS News interviewed 100 Democratic voters here who say they are likely to participate in the February 2020 caucus to find out whose candidacy is connecting with Iowans as of now. And the most popular answer was TBD.\u00a0   A plurality of Democrats \u2014 40 in total \u2014 said they were not yet settled on a candidate. As summer came to a close, however, nearly every Democrat said they were starting to give the field a closer look.\u00a0   \"It's kind of hard to figure out who I want to support because there's so many candidates,\" Alicia Elliott, a 40-year-old Des Moines server, said. \"One of the reasons I'm at the fair today is actually because there's a lot of Democratic candidates and I want to hear what they're saying.\"   \"It's too hard to make a decision,\" Frank Gale, 74, said. \"I'm not too sure why a few candidates threw their name in the first place 'cause I think they really had no chance of going anywhere.\"   .@JoeBiden has been at the Iowa Fair for 10 mins and he is already getting ice cream: pic.twitter.com/2KqRNbraDh Other Iowans came to the fair with their favorite presidential hopeful in mind. Former Vice President Joe Biden led the class with 23 Democrats saying they would like to see him take on President Donald Trump next year.    Some Biden backers cited his time as vice president as reason enough to support him. Anna Jackson-Morris, 66, summed up her support as \"ride or die Biden\" because \"President Obama trusted him, therefore I trust him.\"    Others say pragmatism is pushing them towards Biden.   \"I'm interesting because my favorite candidate is not who I am gonna vote for,\" Ellen Pirro, 70, said as she sat knitting with her local wool spinning guild. \"At the moment it seems to be Biden and if that's the case I will definitely vote for him because I want Trump beaten more than a particular candidate.\"   But Pirro said her second choice is Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who 13 others at the fair said was their top choice.    Married couple Marla Johnson, 61, and Marla Rigby, 66, from Prairie City, Iowa, said even though they are not innately familiar with the details of Warren's plans, they know she has them and trust her as \"knowledgeable.\" Similarly, a group of bandana-clad Des Moines University medical students agreed and said her focus on student loans could benefit the debt-saddled future doctors.\u00a0   Nine Democrats said they favor Sen. Bernie Sanders because they say he led the way on several progressive policies. Emmanuel Hidalgo-Wohelen, 20, credited the senator for popularizing Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and opposition to the U.S.-backed, Saudi-led war in Yemen. Sanders' supporters were also adamant that he has the guts to see through his agenda despite opposition from corporate interests.\u00a0   Five Democrats said they were backing Sen. Kamala Harris, while another four said they were backin Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Both Harris and Buttigieg were also frequently mentioned as second-choice alternatives, as was Sen. Cory Booker.   .@KamalaHarris tries pork chop on a stick: \u201cOh my God. I really, like it\u2019s so good\u201d #IowaStateFair #IACaucus pic.twitter.com/GrsLutXPjR Three Democrats said they are supporting businessman Tom Steyer after watching his television ads in Iowa. One Democrat is backing Gov. Jay Inslee for his climate-centered campaign.\u00a0   Another is supporting former Rep. John Delaney after watching his second debate performance when he criticized the idea of replacing private insurance with a taxpayer-funded alternative. And a truck driver told CBS News he was supporting Rep. Tim Ryan because of the congressman's emphasis on protecting factory jobs.\u00a0   No other Democratic presidential candidates were mentioned by voters as their current top choice but these hot days of fair political pageantry is only an early snapshot of who voters may ultimately support.    John Edwards was leading Democratic Iowa caucus polling at state fair time in August 2007 by five points, but would eventually lose to Barack Obama. \u00a0In August 2015, Hillary Clinton's 19-point lead over Sanders crumbled into a 0.3% win for her on caucus day.\u00a0   \u00a0\"It's a big snowballing effect that happens here over the next few months,\" Iowa Democratic Party Chair Troy Price told CBS News. \"There isn't one point where everyone will have made up their mind and honestly given the nature of the field right now I don't know if there will be a point where it locks in.\"   The latest Iowa caucus poll by Monmouth University indicates similar candidate popularity as these fair interviews with Biden and Warren amassing the most support.\u00a0   A large majority of Democrats interviewed said they are worried about the future of the economy in Iowa. Democrats indicated while the economy may be working for them personally, the trade war with China is threatening the state's agriculture sector.\u00a0   \"For the country, there is a lot of wealth on the coasts but it's not here,\" Andy Argenbright, 52, said. \"It's really weird here because you have a lot of people in the small towns that are making almost nothing but then you come to Des Moines and the salaries are two to three times more.\"    Others believe the impact from the tariffs will come to bear in the future.   \"Right now the economy is good but I think we have some warning signs here,\" Robert Head, 80, a farmer who rents his land, said. \"We're actually paying for these tariffs \u2014\u00a0not China.\"   Asked to rate the economy on a scale of 1 to 10, with higher numbers meaning more strength, the Democrats CBS News interviewed gave it a 5.4 on average.\u00a0   Fixing the holes in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, was the preferred plan among the undecided Democrats interviewed on how to best increase healthcare access. Many endorsed a \"public option\" and were able to talk in specifics on how allowing them to buy into a Medicare-like program could help both their families' well-being and wallets.\u00a0   \"Guys, be careful that you don't fall on your heads here. Your health insurance probably doesn't cover that.\" -@BernieSanders jokes with reporters as we walk backwards and sideways through yesterday's #IowaStateFair pic.twitter.com/r1r4KIqSlH Alternatively, a handful of undecided voters also spoke favorably about a single-payer healthcare system like Medicare for All.   While visiting the horse barn with their two young sons, Christi and Jenniffer Bethards-Welch, who are both undecided but are leaning toward supporting Harris or Sanders, said they hoped the as the caucus creeps closer the candidates' healthcare plans become more clear.   \"We are adoptive parents and we deal with a lot with medical issues and learning disabilities that are not covered by private insurance that we struggle to get help with,\" Christi said while admitting private insurance right now is a \"great thing to keep.\"   \"But I do love the idea of Medicare for all,\" she added.    Other healthcare issues like mental health funding and high prescription drug prices were also overwhelmingly mentioned as a problem affecting the lives of the Democrats interviewed. Jackie Osam, 39, complained that there were too many candidates in the race, but that she's leaning toward Sanders for his tough talk against pharmaceutical companies.   In dozens of additional interviews with Republicans at the fair, only one woman explicitly voiced her displeasure with President Trump, while still insisting she would \"never\" vote for a Democrat.    When asked about their feelings toward the Democrats, one word in particular kept coming up: socialism.\u00a0   \"They are all disguised socialism,\" Dave Dickey, 72, said.

In a remote part of southeast Iowa, beside a boulder with a plaque that reads \"oldest road in Iowa,\" sits a worn-down building that once housed the ancestors of Montana Governor and 2020 presidential candidate Steve Bullock. \"If I don't get pictures for my mom, I am in trouble,\" Bullock told CBS News, as he walked up to the house with his second cousins, Barbra Smith and Walter Walz. The Lowell Store, owned by Bullock's great-great-grandfather for several decades, also served as a post office for the town and as a\u00a0 home for the family. Bullock was visibly energized, even on blistering afternoon, as he took in the family lore from his relatives while walking around what is now 1st Street in Lowell, Iowa. Read the story here. OUT WEST:\u00a0The Nevada Rural Democratic Caucus is preparing for \"good turnout\" this Sunday at their second \"virtual meet 'n greet\" of the cycle, with Kamala Harris, Jay Inslee, Amy Klobuchar, and Beto O'Rourke. \"In most areas we have the technology to literally bring the candidates right into our homes, our offices, our libraries, and our community centers,\" Kimi Cole, chair of the Rural Nevada Democratic Caucus, tells\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin.\u00a0 First tried in 2018, the group hopes their experience in Nevada could be a model for boosting rural engagement across the Democratic Party. \"I've spoken with leaders around the country that feel like many rural areas could benefit,\" adds Cole.",

            "article_content": "\"What I really don't like is people who aren't practical,\" John Delaney says as he drives to Guthrie County, a rural section of Iowa that President Trump won overwhelmingly in 2016.\u00a0 He's venting about proposals like \"Medicare for All\" and free college that have been embraced by many of his competitors. Without mentioning specific politicians, Delaney -- sitting behind the wheel of the Dodge Ram pickup once owned by his late father -- goes on to say that \"big goals have gotten a bad name\" because candidates who put up \"pie in the sky ideas\" want to get \"attention.\" A former Maryland congressman, Delaney was the first Democrat to enter the presidential race back in 2017. Since then, he's been on an almost non-stop tour of Iowa, visiting all 99 counties in the state as he tries to stand out in a party that's moved sharply to the left.\u00a0 When it comes to healthcare, Delaney says he would prefer to have \"a conversation\" that starts from scratch, but adds that this is not possible because a sixth of the American economy is built on the healthcare industry. At campaign stops, Delaney calls for a new public health option with a tax credit for those who want to buy private health insurance instead. He labels calls to eliminate the private insurance industry \"a terrible idea\" and \"disastrous politics.\" Delaney knows something about the subject, having made his fortune starting and then selling health care companies. He has at least $3 million dollars still invested in the private health care industry, according to his financial disclosure forms. As he checks his side mirror for traffic, Delaney takes off his sunglasses and warns that Democrats will not get elected if they push Medicare for All. He argues that government-run health insurance doesn't reimburse providers at the same rate as the private industry, which he says would force hospitals, especially in rural areas, to close down. \"I know that a lot of the people say, well, trust us, we'll have such a better government program. I mean, you know, that sounds like Trump, right? It will be 'beautiful.'\" Delaney says his favorite word in the English language is \"Grace,\" which happens to also be the name of his daughter. He calls himself \"an active Roman Catholic,\" adding that he gets his \"social justice values\" from his Church, and that Democrats \"should talk about\" how faith informs their outlook.\u00a0 He says that while the separation of church and state is \"incredibly important,\" the Democrats who keep bringing it up can be misinterpreted. \"I think sometimes in defense of that, which I will absolutely always defend, we come off as not having a faith when that is actually not true.\" A few minutes later, Delaney accidentally drops his sunglasses under the seat. He doesn't pick them up, keeping his eyes on the road to avoid losing his train of thought. \"I don't think a four-year college degree is a basic human right,\" Delaney says, wondering aloud whether higher education should even take that long to complete. \"This notion that everyone's got to go to college, I just think, in many ways has doomed a whole generation of young Americans.\" Delaney, who became the youngest-ever C.E.O of a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange at age 33, questions if \"most colleges are actually delivering value to their students,\" and emphasizes that instead \"you need skills.\" \"We can't allow there to be this incredible inflation in higher education. There is going to be an endless flow of student loans,\" Delaney says, adding that the government takeover of student lending has deepened the crisis. \"A lot of the curriculum has to reorientate itself to be teaching things that allow people to get jobs more easily.\" By the end of this month, Delaney will have spent two years of campaigning for a job that won't be easy to get. He says he didn't expect the field, which now includes 24 other candidates, to be this crowded. On this hot, humid Saturday, with the air conditioner cranked up to keep the car cool, Delaney says he \"always\" tells the truth, and that friends call him a good leader because he's \"very good at getting people behind a goal.\" One thing he says he wants to accomplish as president is to make use of \"American exceptionalism\" and technological innovation to tackle climate change. He begins by calling the premise of the Green New Deal \"absolutely impossible,\" but says the energy and excitement created by the proposal is to be applauded.\u00a0 \"The notion that in 12 years we could actually transition this enormous economy of ours off fossil fuels is just a fairy tale,\" Delaney says. \"There is not enough alternative energy sources to power the U.S. economy in the next 12 years but I think we can get there by 2050.\" Delaney says he wants American companies and innovators focused on the task of battery storage and transmission and as well creation of technologies that can directly capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. He says that the U.S taking the lead on this path will bring other countries like China and India, both major polluters, to the table. \u00a0 \"It is very hard for the United States to say, 'let me tell you what we've been doing for the last 100 years. We've been emitting greenhouse gases like crazy for 100 years and creating a dominant economy. Now that you're starting to get in the game economically, we're like no, no, no, you can't do any of that stuff.'\" Delaney says he's added over 10,000 miles on his dad's truck since January. Yet despite all that time on the road, he continually polls toward the bottom of the Democratic field. So what inspires him to keep going?\u00a0 \"So many Americans are just struggling and they just, you know, remain optimistic about the country,\" he says. \"And I think that's an incredibly positive thing for us as a nation.\" CBS News reporter covering the intersection between politics and tech.",

It's an effort to smear me.\" But McConnell said he was fine with another nickname \u2014 \"Grim Reaper.\" \"You know, I can laugh about things like the Grim Reaper, but calling me Moscow Mitch is over the top,\" he said. McConnell gave the \"Grim Reaper\" nickname to himself, when he said earlier this year that he would kill progressive proposals like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All in the Senate.\u00a0 \"If I'm still the majority leader of the Senate after next year, none of those things are going to pass the Senate,\" McConnell said at a Kentucky event in April. \"They won't even be voted on. So think of me as the Grim Reaper: the guy who is going to make sure that socialism doesn't land on the president's desk.\" \"Moscow Mitch,\" meanwhile, was first used by MSNBC host Joe Scarborough to mock McConnell for thwarting election security efforts. Since then, protesters have chanted it in McConnell's home state, Ben Folds wrote a song about it and even House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently called him \"Moscow Mitch.\" The \"Moscow Mitch\" moniker has clearly gotten under McConnell's skin, as he decried it during a Senate floor address in July, when he also called it \"McCarthyism.\"\u00a0 McConnell over the summer blocked two House-approved measures to protect elections, despite warnings that Russia intends to meddle in the 2020 race. One bill would have set aside $775 million for state election security and require paper ballot to avoid digital disruptions. Another would have required candidates, their family and campaign staff to tell federal authorities if they are offered help from a foreign government \u2014 something President Trump said he'd be ready to accept. Weeks before the 2016 election, McConnell refused to join a bipartisan statement warning about Russia's election interference after he had been briefed on it.\u00a0 Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation determined that the Russian government coordinated a massive cyber campaign to meddle in the 2016 election and support the Trump campaign. Mueller said in congressional testimony that Russia was attacking the 2020 election \"as we sit here.\"",

I remember during the tax bill, people were agonizing over whether one part of the tax bill was permanent or not, I said, 'look the only way the tax bill is permanent depends on the next election.' The next election because people have different views about taxes in the two parties and approach it differently when they get in power. \"What can't be undone is a lifetime appointment to a young man or woman who believes in the quaint notion that the job of a judge is to follow the law,\" McConnell said. \"That's the important thing we've done for the country, which cannot be undone.\"\u00a0 It's a reversal of his position during former President Obama's presidency. When Antonin Scalia died in February 2016, McConnell refused to have a hearing on Mr. Obama's nominee Merrick Garland. Republicans had the majority in the Senate, and he said he wanted to wait until after the presidential election. The seat was left vacant until April 2017, when President Trump nominated conservative justice Neil Gorsuch. McConnell has previously suggested he would not hold up a nominee again in an election year. He told Fox News last year that in 2020, Republicans will hold both the White House and the Senate, but said \"we'll see if there is a vacancy.\"\u00a0 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, tweeted on Tuesday that McConnell is a \"hypocrite.\" McConnell also said that if he is still the Senate Majority Leader after the 2020 election, regardless of who wins the presidency, two of the biggest campaign points for Democrats will not pass. \"The Green New Deal and Medicare for All are not passing. Period,\" McConnell said.\u00a0 McConnell's comments were first reported by CNN.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, a nine-term legislator who gained notoriety for his unsuccessful leadership challenge against Nancy Pelosi, launched a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination Thursday, joining one of the\u00a0largest primary fields in U.S. history.\u00a0 Here's everything you need to know about the latest candidate to enter the crowded and diverse Democratic primary race:\u00a0 Ryan was born and raised in northeastern Ohio in 1973. He played football in high school and was recruited to play for Youngstown State University. Because of a knee injury, however, he transferred to Bowling Green State University, near Toledo. After graduating from college, Ryan earned a J.D. from the University of New Hampshire and worked in the office of longtime Ohio Congressman James Traficant, who was expelled from the House after being convicted of numerous counts of tax evasion, bribery and racketeering. At age 26, Ryan was elected to Ohio's state senate. When his old boss Traficant became embroiled in scandal, Ryan ran an underdog campaign to fill his seat and won. At 29, he was the youngest member of Congress when he was sworn in 2003. Although he has served eight terms in the House, Ryan gained notoriety following Mr. Trump's election in November 2016. Citing Democrats' loss of Midwestern states during the election -- as well as the lack of youth in the party's leadership -- Ryan launched an unsuccessful bid to replace Nancy Pelosi, then House Minority Leader. After Democrats retook control of the House during the 2018 November midterm elections, the Ohio lawmaker again called for someone to replace Pelosi. Ryan, however, ultimately backed her bid to reclaim the speaker's gavel.\u00a0 Ryan has not staked out a clear ideological agenda during his 15 years in Congress. He is not a member of any of the major Democratic caucuses in the House, like the pro-business New Democrat Coalition or the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He once earned an \"A\" rating from the National Rife Association (NRA) and has broken with his party to support fracking measures favored by Republicans. But Ryan has also been supportive of progressive proposals like \"Medicare for all.\" Ryan's tenure in Congress has largely been scandal-free, but his repeated challenges to Pelosi's leadership may alienate some Democratic primary voters. Although Ryan has been a fierce critic of the president, Mr. Trump has not yet tweeted about the Ohio congressman. Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

The news brings age back to the forefront of the campaign. The three top-polling Democratic candidates are all in their 70s \u2013 Elizabeth Warren is 70, Joe Biden is 76 and Sanders is 78. President Trump is 73. According to recent CBS News battleground polling, the majority of Democrats in early voting states said that age is not a concern. Sanders has kept a robust campaign schedule, even playing ball on Iowa's \"Field of Dreams.\" He shrugs off the age question when asked. Will this incident have a lasting effect on potential supporters? The senator is usually tireless. Just last week he covered 7 states in 6 days. But might Sanders' make headlines today for the wrong reasons? In the meantime, while Sanders recovers, his campaign is using the incident to fundraise and promote his big campaign message of Medicare for All. JOE BIDEN Joe Biden on Wednesday continued to combat accusations from President Trump that he and his family had inappropriate connections to the Ukraine while he was vice president, saying repeatedly there is \"zero\" evidence to support Mr. Trump's claims, reports\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson. Biden and his campaign for more than two weeks now have continued to stress that the real focus needs to be on Trump's ask for Ukraine to help investigate Biden, in an apparent effort to hurt Biden's presidential bid. Mr. Trump's call to the Ukrainian president shocked Biden, he said, calling it \"way beyond anything that I quite frankly thought he would do.\" Shortly after Biden spoke in Las Vegas at a gun violence forum, the president was back on Twitter tweeting a Nickelback music video directing his followers to examine a photo of Biden, his son Hunter, and a man identified as a Ukrainian gas executive on a golf course. The president apparently hopes to use this photograph as evidence that Biden knows more about his son's foreign business dealings than he is letting on. Several former Obama-Biden administration officials have told CBS News they personally at the time did not think it was a good idea for Hunter Biden to join the Burisma energy board in Ukraine. However, they also did not feel comfortable raising the issue with the vice president due to potential blow back for getting involved in familial matters. These officials also say that they do not believe Biden would have used his position to benefit his family. PETE BUTTIGIEG South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign has hired Casey Clemmons as Deputy State Director in Iowa, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Jack Turman.

Clemmons is also an alum of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, where he served on the Iowa caucus and general election organizing teams, and former President Obama's re-election campaign. \"I'm proud to work for a fellow Midwesterner and pragmatic progressive who will bring a necessary calmness and new generation of American leadership to the White House,\" Clemmons said in a statement.\u00a0 AMY KLOBUCHAR Senator Amy Klobuchar is launching a TV ad in Iowa today, which will begin airing ahead of an upcoming visit to the Hawkeye State.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Musadiq Bidar\u00a0says the 30-second ad, called \"All of Us,\" features Klobuchar on the debate stage saying, \"I don't want to be the president for half of America, I want to be the president for all of America.\" Klobuchar, reaching out to those feeling stuck in the middle of political extremes, says in the ad, \"You've got a home with me.\" According to a CBS News count, Klobuchar has held nearly 90 campaign events in Iowa over a span of more than 30 days since launching her campaign in February.\u00a0 BETO O'ROURKE On the heels of conflicting reports about the Trump administration striking a deal to increase ethanol production, former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke's campaign announced an endorsement from farmer and former U.S. Department of Agriculture official Doug Thompson, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster. \"Beto O'Rourke is the right choice to lead us out of Trump's mess; from his commitment to trade that benefits American producers, growers and workers, to his steadfast support of the Renewable Fuels Standard. I'm proud to stand behind Beto O'Rourke for President,\" Thompson said in a statement.\u00a0 TOM STEYER Businessman Tom Steyer says he's glad to see Democrats moving forward with an impeachment inquiry but said that he doesn't believe they're being forceful enough, says\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0 \"I still think they don't have courage of their convictions,\" Steyer said in a conversation with reporters over breakfast Wednesday morning. \"They should be being more aggressive.\"\u00a0 Steyer has been pushing for impeachment since he launched the group Need To Impeach two years ago. He said the Mueller report was \"damning,\" but added that it's good that the Democrats are focusing now on President Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. \"The good thing about Ukraine is it's a simple story that people can latch on to and I think that's really good. So, I do think that's what we should be talking about,\" Steyer said.\u00a0 Later this month, Steyer will make his first appearance on the debate stage, where said he plans to present himself as a \"different candidate\" from his opponents. In recent trips to Iowa, Steyer has appeared to be tripped up by some questions during campaign events, including one about robocalls last month and another ethanol waivers that the Trump administration granted back in August. He had to ask the questioner to explain the ethanol waivers to him during an event in Council Bluffs Tuesday night.\u00a0 Steyer, however, dismissed concerns about whether he'll be prepared to answer questions that may surprise him on the debate stage.\u00a0 \"There's certainly things I don't know,\" Steyer said. \"Under those circumstances the question is can you put that into context, in a framework of how you think without coming to a firm conclusion without all the facts.\"\u00a0 ANDREW YANG Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang announced Wednesday his campaign raised $10 million in the third quarter of 2019, more than tripling what he raised last quarter, reports\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ben Mitchell. According to the campaign, Yang will go into the end of 2019 with $6.3 million on hand, a total he raised largely with the help of small-dollar donors.\u00a0 The campaign says the average donation to Yang is about $30.18, and more than 99% of all online donations were under $200. Yang teased the number on Monday after a rally in Los Angeles, saying the fundraising haul would demonstrate that his campaign is \"one of the only true growth stories in 2020.\" \"Whereas some of the other campaigns that we look at, they're plateauing or in some cases contracting. And we're growing by multiples,\" Yang told reporters. The news comes as the Yang campaign expands its presence in Iowa and New Hampshire. Yang opened two new offices in Iowa in September and is hiring more full-time staff in both of the early states. RULES, RULES, RULES The deadline for GOP State Parties to submit their delegate selection plans to the Republican National Committee was yesterday. The plans detail how each state will choose delegates to the 2020 convention. Ahead of the deadline, five states had already decided to cancel their nominating processes for 2020. An RNC official told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ellee Watson\u00a0that all 56 states and territories have submitted plans on time and all have been accepted. AD WARS According to Advertising Analytics, the RNC placed a $2.08 million ad buy on broadcast from October 2 \u2013 October 8 in the Cedar Rapids, Davenport, Des Moines, Detroit, Lansing, Minneapolis, Las Vegas, Albany, Wilkes Barre-Scranton, Norfolk, and Richmond markets. This ad buy is part of the RNC's larger \"Stop the Madness\" media campaign, according to\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ellee Watson. The media campaign goes after more than 60 Democrats on impeachment. BRAVO! BRAVO! Last week, President Trump and his allies announced a combined $10 million ad campaign attacking Joe Biden on Ukraine and defending himself from the impeachment inquiry. Sources tell\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ben Mitchell\u00a0that part of that buy includes $800,000 for next week's Sunday Night Football broadcast, which last week\u00a0reportedly\u00a0captured an audience of more than 24 million viewers. Also part of the buy is a $70,000 national spot on Bravo - a move that is likely designed to capture suburban women, a demographic the Trump campaign needs to hold on to in 2020. The Trump ad blitz extends to social media, where the campaign spent close to $2.6 million on digital advertisements last week, according to publicly available data from Facebook and Google. When asked about the ad buy, the Trump campaign had no comment. EARLY STATES New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner has officially set the filing period for presidential candidates ahead of the 2020 primary. A tradition in \"first-in-the-nation\" politics, the filing period will begin on Wednesday, October 30, 2019 and continue until Friday, November 15, 2019. Presidential candidates are required to submit declarations of candidacy in person, in a ceremonial photo-op taking place in Concord's State Capitol. \"This is a 100 year tradition,\" Secretary Gardner told\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Nicole Sganga.\u00a0 The 2020 presidential primary marks the 100th anniversary of New Hampshire voting first, a ritual that predates Iowa's \"first in the nation\" caucus. Next up, Gardner will officially set the date of the New Hampshire primary, which has tentatively been slated for February 11, 2020. \u00a0\"In the 1996 primary, I didn't set the date until December 21. That's the latest,\" Gardner recalled, speaking about the primary date. New Hampshire's Secretary of State consistently notes New Hampshire state law allows him to set the primary date for some time in 2019. TEXAS SHAKEUP Former GOP U.S. Representative Pete Sessions will announce his comeback campaign on Thursday, though in a different Texas district. McLeenan County Republican Party Chairman Jon R. Ker confirmed to\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that Sessions is launching his campaign for the state's 17th district tomorrow in their headquarters. The seat became open after Congressman Bill Flores announced\u00a0last month that this term would be his last.\u00a0Ker emphasized that the McLeenan County hosting Sessions' event is not an endorsement and that they \"are simply providing him the venue.\" Sessions served more than 20 years in Texas' 32nd district in the Dallas area but was ousted in 2018 by Democrat Collin Allred. Flores has served the 17th district in central Texas since 2010 and has won each re-election by at least 18 points. Flores told\u00a0Navarro\u00a0that since his retirement announcement, he's been holding workshops with potential TX-17 candidates and leaders. When Flores heard about the potential run from Sessions, whom he called a friend, he gauged 50 to 60 community and political leaders about it and got mainly negative feedback. He said he wished Sessions reached out so he could share that feedback, but he has yet to do so.\u00a0 \"People responded and said, look, we are blessed in this district with a number of really high quality leaders that live here, they work here, they raise their families here and they serve us already,\" he said. \"Texas 17 is not Dallas. There is a world of difference between this district and a Dallas district. My dad was in the Air Force, and I was born at the Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, but that doesn't mean that I'm entitled to go run up there to run for Congress in the State of Wyoming.\" LOUISIANA GUBERNATORIAL RACE Louisiana's \"jungle\" primary for the gubernatorial race is in less than 10 days, and President Trump has jumped in via Tweet. Eddie Rispone and Ralph Abraham, the two leading GOP candidates, are both hoping to cut into the votes of Democrat Incumbent Governor John Bel Edwards and cause a runoff.\u00a0 Mr. Trump Tweeted three times about the race in the past day, and called for state Republicans to vote for either Rispone or Abraham\u00a0\"(both Great).\"\u00a0Trump\u00a0Tweeted, \"Early voting has started. Your 2nd Amendment, and much else, is at stake.\" As of Tuesday morning,\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says a total of 164,834 votes were cast according to the Louisiana Secretary of State Office. Democrats currently hold a 1 percent lead over Republicans.\u00a0 Edwards is the only Democratic governor in the South, and campaign spokesman Eric Holl said in a statement that Edwards has a \"good working relationship with Trump.\"\u00a0 \"It's no surprise that the President is voicing support for members of his own political party,\" Holl said in a statement.\u00a0 Rispone and Abraham have been airing\u00a0attack\u00a0ads\u00a0against each other recently, hoping to capture more of the state's GOP vote. As both have done throughout the race, a Rispone Spokesman drew parallels between his candidate and President Trump. \"We welcome President Trump's involvement and are thankful for the endorsement,\" Rispone Communications Director Anthony Ramirez told\u00a0Navarro.\u00a0\"Eddie often says he wants to do for Louisiana what Donald Trump has done for America: create jobs and grow our economy.\"",

            "article_content": "As we wait for the third presidential debate to get underway in Houston, look\u00a0here\u00a0for a reminder of what to expect from each of the democratic candidates tonight. JOE BIDEN:\u00a0At a background briefing ahead of the debate tonight, Biden campaign senior officials said the former VP has a \"target on his back\" and is prepared to fend off attacks on President Obama and his legacy, reports CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson. These officials said the country needs \"more than just plans\u2014we need action, we need progress.\" The senior officials said we can expect to hear Biden to forcefully talk about his healthcare plan of embracing a public option and how it doesn't cost as much Medicare for All. The officials also said they expect foreign policy to be rousing debate discussion, too. One senior Biden campaign official also said we may \"hear him reject the premise that [his] ideas are incremental.\" The official said there is a \"false dichotomy\" narrative that there are \"liberal revolutionaries\" and those who want incremental change on multiple issues. The campaign also continued to pushback on criticism that his verbal slip ups are cause for concern. When asked about a recent article which quoted anonymous Biden officials complaining that younger reporters are focusing too much on his gaffes, one senior Biden campaign official replied that Biden is \"young at heart.\" KAMALA HARRIS:\u00a0Close allies of the California senator say the location of tonight's third presidential debate may give the 2020 candidate a unique edge over her opponents. The event is scheduled to take place at a historically black university \u2013 Texas Southern University \u2013 and of the 20 contenders vying for the Democratic nomination, Harris is the only candidate who graduated from an HBCU.\u00a0 Harris is also a member of the nation's oldest black Greek-lettered sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha. Ahead of tonight's debate,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporters LaCrai Mitchell & Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0explored\u00a0how Harris' HBCU experience shaped her and what her affiliations to HBCUs and black Greek-lettered sororities and fraternities could mean for her presidential run.\u00a0 TOM STEYER:\u00a0On Thursday morning, the House Judiciary Committee took a step toward the possible impeachment of President Trump despite internal party divisions on the future of the inquiry. This afternoon in Iowa City, Iowa, Tom Steyer, the founder of Need to Impeach and 2020 Presidential Candidate said \"the House Judiciary Committee has the right to do this regardless of what the House democratic leadership says.\"\u00a0 Steyer called President Trump a \"criminal\" and the \"the most corrupt\" president in American history. He added that \"instead of trying to figure out how it is going to work out, why don't we stand up for the values of America, for the American constitution, for the American people, isn't that what is important?\" In addition, Steyer told reporters in Iowa Thursday afternoon that he will probably watch highlights of the third Democratic primary debate in Houston. Steyer has qualified for the 4th debate next month but is facing criticism from fellow Democrats competing for the nomination because of the money he's spent on advertisements.\u00a0 Last month in a fundraising email, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro said \"I'm fighting for a spot against billionaires like Tom Steyer -- who just spent $10 million of his own money to fast-track his way onto that stage.\" On Monday, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said in a press release that the debate rules \"have allowed a billionaire to bankroll his way onto the debate stage, while Governors and Senators with decades of public service experience have been forced out of the race.\"\u00a0 According to Advertising Analytics, Steyer has spent nearly $12 million in broadcast and digital ads across the country. He's spent more than $3 million in Iowa alone. Responding to the criticism, Steyer told\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Musadiq Bidar, \"I've been here for about eight weeks, there are people who have been here two years.\" Steyer added that \"the question is do you have a message that reverberates and resonates with Democratic voters and from what I can tell, mine actually does.\" OUT WEST:\u00a0Three campaigns confirm to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin\u00a0that they'll be bringing a Nevadan to Thursday's debate in Houston: Cory Booker (who's taking Nevada Young Democrats President Lynnette Hull), Kamala Harris (state Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui), and Juli\u00e1n Castro (DNC Committeewoman Allison Stephens). Other prominent Nevadans have attended past debates, from state Attorney General Aaron Ford (at Cory Booker's invitation) to state Sen. Yvanna Cancela (at Joe Biden's invitation). IOWA:\u00a0Kamala Harris' campaign announced endorsements from 100 \"Blue Wave Women\" across Iowa. This is a group of women who became engaged in politics after the 2016 election and helped elect a record number of women lawmakers into office in Iowa in 2018, as well as Reps. Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne, reports\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster.\u00a0 This is part the Harris campaign's strategy to engage grassroots support and find volunteers willing to put in significant work to help Harris in Iowa. \"It meant so much for me to have that support amongst women when I was running, but what's most important is that they did not stop. So many of them started during my race, that was their thing, their introduction to this space called politics where they figured out where their niche was in politics,\" said Harris' Iowa Campaign Chair Deidre DeJear, who ran for Iowa secretary of state in 2018, in an\u00a0interview\u00a0with Iowa Starting Line.\u00a0 \"It's important that we are allowing people to sit at the table, and we're allowing them by inviting them to the process. That's so critical.\" CAROLINA GREEN:\u00a0Sen. Thom Tillis' reelection campaign announced on Thursday a $2.2 million ad campaign beginning next week on cable television, broadcast television, and radio across North Carolina for the 2020 election. The ad campaign is starting so early in part because Tillis is facing a primary challenge from Raleigh Businessman Garland Tucker. Tillis' 2014 race was the most expensive Senate race in history until the race between Beto O'Rourke and Senator Ted Cruz. If the spending in North Carolina's ninth district is any indicator of how expensive it will be to campaign in North Carolina, then the 2020 campaign for Tillis' seat could set records again, according to\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Ellee Watson.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "article_content": "While former special counsel Robert Mueller was on Capitol Hill testifying about his high-profile report, some 2020 Democratic presidential candidates were 500 miles away in Detroit, voicing their belief that the report holds enough to begin impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\u00a0 CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0says Sens. Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren all pointed to obstruction of justice as the basis for impeachment, and Warren ramped it up a bit by saying the Senate should vote on it, regardless of who's in the majority. \"Whether it would pass Senate or not\u2026this is a moment of history, and every single person of Congress should be called on to vote, and to live with that for the rest of their lives,\" she said at the NAACP convention. \"I think there are impeachable offenses and I think the president should be tried for it,\" Biden\u00a0said\u00a0outside an event in Dearborn, Michigan, reports\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson. Biden also sent mixed messages on his takeaways from the testimony, as he said Mueller laid out \"plenty of reasons\" why the president could be charged after he leaves office.\u00a0 \"I understood that he was pretty clear saying that \u2013 at least I think it was 4 or 5 occasions the president engaged in activity that he could be tried after he left office,\" he said. But later on, when asked if a Biden administration would prosecute Mr. Trump, he called that hypothetical \"premature\" and added he's \"not one of these guys\u2014'lock him up!' or 'send him home!' or that type of thing.\" Read the full remarks\u00a0here.\u00a0 South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg pointed to the Republican-controlled Senate as a reason for pause on impeachment, and said he's instead focused on beating Trump at the ballot box -- a mission Booker echoed as well during his speech. \"What we ultimately must be prepared to do should Congress fail -- remember the power of the people is greater than the people in power. And we need to be ready to beat Donald Trump soundly in the 2020 elections and that's why I'm running for president,\" Booker said. CBS' latest count has 15 of the 25 candidates explicitly calling for impeachment proceedings.\u00a0 \u00a0 BIDEN V. BOOKER:\u00a0A week before the second Democratic debate, both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Cory Booker are back to bashing each other\u2014just as they did in the lead up to the first Democratic debate in June. Here's a timeline of the latest back-and-forth from\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporters Jack Turman & Bo Erickson: Tuesday AM:\u00a0Biden\u00a0releases his 10-page comprehensive criminal justice reform plan\u00a0with several points addressing legislation he once supported in the \"tough on crime\" era of the 90s. Tuesday PM:\u00a0Booker apparently\u00a0subtweets\u00a0Biden with \"It's not enough to tell us what you're going to do for our communities, show us what you've done for the last 40 years.\" Wednesday AM:\u00a0Booker doubles-down and tells reporters at NAACP convention: \"I'm disappointed that it's taken Joe Biden years and years until he was running for president to actually say he made a mistake\u2026 so I'm disappointed it's taken him so long to own up to that and now he's unveiled his crime bill.\"\u00a0WATCH Wednesday PM:\u00a0Biden defends his record and says \"Cory knows that's not true.\" He then said Booker \"objected to federal interference\" when the Obama Administration's Justice Deaprtment intervened with Newark's police department practices. \"If he wants to go back and talk about records, I'm happy to do that,\" Biden added.\u00a0WATCH Our take:\u00a0Days before the first debate, Biden was calling for Booker to apologize for his criticism over remarks related to working with segregationists in Congress. After Sen. Kamala Harris' confrontation over the remarks at the debate, Biden is now confronted again with racially-tinged criticism\u2014and is no longer asking for an apology. Instead, his campaign is projecting a\u00a0possible offense strategy\u00a0on the debate stage next week when he, Booker and Harris will all be on the same stage.\u00a0 GOV. JOHN DELANEY:\u00a0Before joining Iowa's RAGBRAI bicycle ride, on Wednesday, former Rep. John Delaney said in an interview with\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0that if Democrats nominate \"a candidate who's one of those candidates running on upheaval of the entire U.S. economy, and with a fundamental kind of anti-business, anti-private sector platform, I think we lose to Donald Trump and I think we lose big.\" Delaney, who has long criticized Medicare for All plans that eliminate private insurance, will be on the debate stage with two proponents of that policy next week: Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Delaney said \"when you create anxiety with the American people about their private health insurance, how do you actually think you're going to beat Donald Trump?\" Delaney again denied an Axios report from last week that some senior staffers asked him to get out of the race by mid-August, saying it was a \"great mystery\" where the report came from. When asked about how a candidate can continue if they're not on the debate stage in September, Delaney said \"I think candidates realistically have to be on the third or the fourth [stage]. They may not have to be on the third, but they have to be on the fourth.\" Delaney went on to say it creates \"more headwinds\" if a candidate isn't on those debate stages.\u00a0 BETO O'ROURKE: CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry\u00a0was the first to\u00a0report\u00a0former Rep. Beto O'Rourke's Education Equity plan, which was released ahead of 2020 candidate's appearance at the NAACP National Convention today in Detroit. The plan includes a $500 billion Permanent Fund for Equity and Excellence as an effort to close the funding gap between predominately white and non-white school districts. The plan also lays out details to end racial disparities in school disciplinary measures, provide student debt relief for educators and invest in the teacher pipeline to increase diversity within the teaching profession. GOV. BILL WELD:\u00a0Weld, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination against Mr. Trump, took the stage with 2020 Democrats in Detroit on Wednesday. He was the last speaker to address the NAACP Convention. \"I'm already running against Donald Trump in the Republican primaries,\" said Weld to audience applause. He called the President a \"raging racist.\" When asked whether he had watched the Mueller hearings, Weld answered, \"Well, I almost didn't need to watch Bob this morning. Bob was my deputy in the Justice Department. I've known him forever. I read every word of the Mueller report,\" something he normally mentions in interviews along the trail. DOWN SOUTH:\u00a0Former special counsel Robert Mueller concluded his congressional testimony this afternoon, in what one South Carolina voter described as an \"underwhelming\" showcase of the investigation findings. Throughout the day, GOP leadership in the Palmetto state made it clear that their big takeaway from today's hearings was \"no collusion.\"\u00a0 \"The $40 Million Mueller investigation proved what we already knew to be true: No Obstruction. No Collusion,\"\u00a0tweeted\u00a0the SCGOP. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham went a step further and\u00a0tweeted\u00a0that it was \"dangerous and ridiculous\" for Mueller to have changed the job of a prosecutor from proving someone \"guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\" to \"not being able to exonerate someone accused of a crime.\" On the state level,\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0asked S.C. state Rep. Marvin Pendarvis whether Mueller's testimony would impact his constituents in Charleston and Dorchester counties. Pendarvis maintained that while today's hearings probably wouldn't affect voters' day-to-day lives, fair elections in our country impact all Americans\u2014his constituents included. \u00a0\"As an overarching principle it's important to make sure we have fair elections,\" said Pendarvis. \"We want to show no one is above the law and we have to protect fairness in our democratic process.\" IN THE HOUSE:\u00a0Michigan Republican Rep. Paul Mitchell announced he will not seek re-election in 2020, due to wanting more family time and exhaustion with today's political rhetoric. Mitchell was one of the first Republican Congress members to split with President Donald Trump after his racist Tweets aimed at the \"squad,\" four progressive congresswomen of color. \u00a0 About a day after Trump's initial Tweets, Mitchell said in a\u00a0Tweet\u00a0to the President, \"We must be better than comments like these. I share the political frustrations with some members of the other party, but these comments are beneath leaders.\" In his emotive remarks on the House floor Wednesday he said, \"It appears to me that rhetoric overwhelms policy, and politics consumes much of the oxygen in this city, the time has come to make a difference for my family - to focus on my time and energy upon them - their needs and goals.\" Mitchell won this eastern region of Michigan in 2018 by more than 25 points and Trump won by more than 30 points in 2016 \u2013 signs that Republicans aren't too worried about keeping the open seat red. National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Michael McAdams told\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0\"this a solidly Republican seat and we will keep it that way.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Houston \u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren will go head-to-head Thursday for the first time on the debate stage in this presidential primary. The match-up will provide the clearest example yet of competing directions for the party. Since the previous two debates have divided the field in half over two nights, Warren and Biden have not yet appeared alongside each other. But with only 10 candidates qualifying for Thursday's debate, the two candidates will finally share a spotlight and get the chance to draw contrast in front of millions of potential primary voters. The third debate comes as the new CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0poll\u00a0finds Warren gaining ground, absorbing support previously given to other lower-tier candidates, while Biden maintains his lead. The survey also shows a split within the party about what the Democrats' 2020 message should be: 60% say it should be more progressive than the Obama administration while 40% say it should be about returning the country to how things were before the Trump presidency. That divide is shown through the campaigns of Warren, whose \"dream big, fight hard\" campaign slogan argues for structural change and Biden, who has been campaigning on the Obama legacy and characterizing the election as a battle for the soul of the country. Their differences involve key policy issues \u2014 Warren backs Medicare for All while Biden supports expanding on Obamacare \u2014 and campaign decisions, Warren rejects fundraisers while Biden is courting big donors.\u00a0 Despite building anticipation, neither candidate has hinted whether they'll throw the first political punch.\u00a0 \"I'm just going to be me. And she'll be her and let people make their judgements. I have great respect for her,\" Biden told a group of reporters during a recent campaign stop in South Carolina.\u00a0 When asked by CBS News if she was preparing differently to stand center stage with Biden, Warren also demurred. \"Not really,\" she replied. \"For me, it's one more chance to talk about what's broken in this country, my plans for fixing it, and how I'm building a grassroots movement to get it done.\" But they have a history of going head-to-head. The pair had been sparring publicly since Biden was a member of the Senate and Warren was a Harvard law professor. In 2002, Warren called out the then-Senator from Delaware in a New York Times op-ed over bankruptcy legislation being debated in Congress. They later butted heads over the same issue at a 2005 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. \"At a time when the biggest financial institutions in this country were trying to put the squeeze on millions of hard working families who were in bankruptcy because of medical problems, job losses, divorce and death in the family, there was no body to stand up for them, I got in that fight because of, they just didn't have anyone, and Joe Biden was on the side of credit card companies,\" Warren said in April 2019 after Biden announced his presidential bid. The Biden campaign insisted that sharing the stage with Warren for the first time is \"irrelevant.\" \"They aren't going to be the only two people\" on the debate stage, a senior campaign advisor told reporters. \"The way we approach the debate is to use the opportunity to talk directly to the audience at home...We don't hear from voters that we are looking for someone at some point on the ideological spectrum.\" Meanwhile, other candidates who have seen their stars rise and fall are looking towards the debate for a boost. \"It's an opportunity to winnow down a little bit. We know the nominee will emerge from that group,\" South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg told reporters.\u00a0 Senator Kamala Harris' big moment in the first debate, when she challenged Biden on his support for federally mandated busing, set high expectations for the second debate. However, Harris struggled in the second debate, and that showed in the polls afterward.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"I do not rise and fall with the polls, and I think it's really important to know you've got to be steady. You've got to work hard,\" Harris told CBS News when asked how she is preparing for the debate. \"I feel it to be my number one commitment to earn the vote of everyone and I do not expect that it will be given. It has to be earned. And I'm going to work hard to do that.\"\u00a0 According to attendees at a Friday meeting in New York City, Harris media adviser Jim Margolis told the room of supporters and donors in that Harris' moment at the first debate essentially set hard to match expectations for the second debate. They're now hoping expectations are where they should be for the third debate.\u00a0 \"I think it's an opportunity to have the stage winnow down a little bit,\" Buttigieg said recently when asked about the pressure to stand out. But he also emphasized it will still be a crowded stage with all 10 candidates at the podium. \"Look I've advanced past the first 20 or so candidates I needed to overtake. Now we've got some bigger hills to climb. That's what the next six months or so are for,\" he added.\u00a0For the candidates who didn't make the third debate stage, they're focusing on boots-on-the-ground retail campaigning in an effort to get their messages out in early states. At the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard said she still sees a path forward despite not appearing in Houston. \"Continuing to reach out to voters through every means possible, every platform possible,\" she said of her plans. \"We have a very strong volunteer driven people powered campaign. We're spending as much time as possible out on the ground and doing exactly that.\" \"This is about retail politics, Iowa is about retail politics. South Carolina is about retail politics,\" said Congressman Tim Ryan of how he'll compensate for not making the cut. At the same time, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is giving himself to October.\u00a0 \"My goal is to get into October. We have until October 1. I'm going to do everything I know how to get into them,\" he said in New Hampshire. \"And then on October 1, depending on where things stand, I'll make a decision.\"",

            "article_content": "Manchester, New Hampshire \u2014\u00a0Bernie Sanders' campaign manager Faiz Shakir says victory in New Hampshire is \"absolutely critical\" to the campaign's efforts to capture the Democratic nomination, telling CBS News the campaign will be ramping up its presence in the Granite State in the coming months. \"I don't like the phraseology of 'must-win New Hampshire,' but it is critical,\" Shakir said. \"And we are going to invest in this state and are investing in the state to do everything in our power to win it.\" The campaign has been late in building out a ground organization in New Hampshire, lagging behind Senator Elizabeth Warren's operation. But in a wide-ranging interview here, Shakir said that has been by design, with the campaign planning \"for the long haul.\" \"We could afford, over a period of time, to allow a lesser investment and then increase that investment over time,\" Shakir said. \"So by the end of this, I promise you, if we aren't the candidate with the most staff and most volunteers, I will be stunned.\" Sanders has spent eight days campaigning in New Hampshire, half as much time invested by Warren, who has spent 16 days in the state. But Shakir said Sanders is already familiar to primary voters here, having won the 2016 primary over Hillary Clinton by more than 20 points. Other candidates have had to spend time introducing themselves, Shakir said. \"And so they were here more. If you looked at some of our early visits, in March and April, we were in places like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,\" he said. Shakir said the campaign has instead focused on pitching an \"electability message\" in general election swing states. \"In order to defeat Donald Trump, you have to carry those states. And he has a unique appeal in those states. We got criticized for it, but we did spend some time trying to make the case for electability.\" \"There'll be two questions that resolve this race,\" he said. \"One, who is best to defeat Donald Trump? And two, who do you trust to make the change happen that you so desperately want? I think when people order those two questions, rank the candidates, we'll be fine.\" The goal of the Sanders' campaign, Shakir said, is to find \"unlikely\" voters \u2014 Uber drivers, postal workers, employees of Walmart and McDonald's \u2014 and turn them into \"likely\" voters. \"That is the thrust. That is the vision. That is the strategy,\" he said. A Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll in early August of likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire found Joe Biden in the lead at 21%, followed by Sanders with 17% and Warren at 14%. About 20% of respondents said they were undecided.  But Shakir argued the voters the Sanders campaign is targeting are not represented in public polling data. \"I don't think many of them would identify themselves as likely voters right now, and therefore wouldn't get through a voter screen on a poll right now \u2014 I mean, they wouldn't identify themselves as likely voters,\" he said. Asked why Sanders has not targeted Warren, perhaps his chief progressive rival, Shakir laughed.\u00a0 \"Well, specifically about Elizabeth, I mean, they have been friends. And when I say friends, truly legitimate friends who like and respect each other,\" he said. \"If he were not running for president or she were not running for president, I guarantee you they would be soliciting advice about how to win from each other.\" Shakir, who played second base at Harvard, offered an analogy: \"Your best friend is up to bat. I'm pitching. Do I want to hit them in the head with the pitch? No, I want to play my best. I want to perform. I don't want it to come at his or her cost. I want to win on my own merits.\" The campaign manager did not hold back in his critique of cable news, repeating earlier criticisms of the media articulated on the stump time and time again by Sanders himself. \"We have more horse-racing, nonsense coverage because national media and Facebook is taking over,\" he said. \"But I think that the data point that bothers me most, and I think bothers the senator most, is when you have a media that tends to look at everything in the left-right spectrum. You're not doing justice to him.\" Shakir listed cable news networks, but stopped short of calling out specific journalists or commentators.\u00a0 \"Look at that roster of people. How many of them literally hate Bernie Sanders?\" he asked. \"How do you have so many people out there who believe in 'Medicare for All,' and yet, you go on the turn on the TV and you got a health care executive on? Oh, there's Goldman Sachs' CEO on there. Oh, there's some traditional Democratic pundit who hates Bernie Sanders on there, talking about health care, who thinks Medicare for All is a terrible idea and will be terrible for the Democratic Party.\" Asked if he felt this narrative of unfair media treatment in some way helped the senator, Shakir shook his head. \"This isn't the game though, right? I think that often gets lost in some of the media coverage. Like, 'Oh, it was really smart of Bernie Sanders pick a fight with the media because that worked for Donald Trump.' Nonsense!\"\u00a0 He continued: \"I mean, we did an analysis of The Washington Post and how they cover labor. You don't have labor reporters. You know, he rolls out things that affect labor and it's always covered through the lens of the horse race. 'How will this affect you politically?' I'm like, how about, how will it affect people? How will it affect actual people's lives? Can we write a story about that before we jump there?\" The first Muslim presidential campaign manager, Shakir cited his interactions with voters in mosques around the country as evidence of the potential to expand the primary electorate. \"I traverse this place as the first Muslim campaign manager,\" Shakir said. \"There are oftentimes pockets of Muslims. I go to some mosques I see. I ask, 'Have you voted before?' They say, 'No, I have voted before.' I say, 'Are you thinking about voting?' 'Yes, I'm thinking about voting.' And so then I ask them, 'When are you going to vote?' They say, 'In November of 2020.' I'm like, 'Nope, too late. You missed the most important vote. You gotta vote in the primary.'\" Speaking about the current president, Shakir said, \"One of the reasons he won was because he campaigned as a fake Bernie Sanders. He said, 'I'm going to drain the swamp. I'm going to go cut fair trade deals. I'm going to take on Goldman Sachs. I'm going to be a champion for the working class.'\"\u00a0 Shakir paused.\u00a0 \"America, he's a liar. He's a pathological liar. He betrayed you all. And in order to defeat him, I believe you need credibility. You have to be real. Bernie Sanders is in the best position to do that.\" CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

            "article_content": "Just a week after announcing his departure from the packed field of Democratic presidential primary contenders, former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper announced that he's now running for Senate, aiming to unseat Republican Senator Cory Gardner. He released a\u00a0video\u00a0to announce his Senate campaign early Thursday.\u00a0 \"I've always said Washington was a lousy place for for a guy like me who wants to get things done, but this is no time to walk away from the table,\" said Hickenlooper as he lined up a shot at a billiards table inside a bar, a nod to his past as a Colorado brewery entrepreneur.\u00a0 \"I know changing Washington is hard, but I want to give it a shot. I'm not done fighting for the people of Colorado.\" Hickenlooper mentioned the possibility of a Senate bid in a video last week announcing the end of his presidential campaign. In that video, he said, \"I've heard from so many Coloradans who want me to run for the United States Senate. They remind me how much is at stake for our country and our state.\" Colorado is one of the top targets for Democrats in their effort to flip the Senate in 2020, and several polls\u00a0(here\u00a0and\u00a0here)\u00a0have found that Hickenlooper would field the most serious challenge to Gardner. Already, 11 Democratic candidates are running in the primary and will have to decide whether to rally behind Hickenlooper's bid. One of the Democratic candidates, state Senator Angela Williams, has signaled she will not. She released a statement on the day Hickenlooper ended his presidential bid saying, \"He has a lot to explain to Colorado voters. This won't be a coronation.\" The former speaker of the Colorado House, Andrew Romanoff, whose campaign has raised over $1 million this year, told CBS News that Colorado needs a leader who will fight for a Green New Deal and \"Medicare for All.\" He did not mention Hickenlooper by name, but as a presidential candidate Hickenlooper\u00a0opposed both ideas. According to Federal Election Commission rules, Hickenlooper can transfer the cash he raised in his presidential bid to his Senate campaign. Hickenlooper reported $1.15 million in receipts during the second quarter and ended June with just over $830,000 cash on hand. Two candidates already in the race (Mike Johnston\u00a0and\u00a0\"Dan For Colorado\") each posted over $1 million in receipts in the second quarter. Republicans meanwhile painted Hickenlooper's Senate challenge to Gardner as a \"desperate\" attempt at redemption after dropping out of the 2020 race.\u00a0 \"This crowded Senate field has been in a race to the left and Hickenlooper's quixotic presidential bid did not do him any favors in proving he can compete in any race in 2020,\" said NRSC spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez.   Hickenlooper followed an unusual route into politics, beginning his professional life as a geologist with Buckhorn Petroleum in the 1980s. But the oil bust in the mid-'80s cost him his job in 1986. There were no jobs to be had in the oil industry, so Hickenlooper went into the brewpub business, opening the Wynkoop Brewing Co. The brewery was a success, and it\u00a0made him a millionaire. Hickenlooper was the second governor or former governor to announce a Democratic presidential bid, following Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Inslee also dropped out of the 2020 presidential race and is rumored to be seeking a third term as Washington's governor.\u00a0 Hickenlooper formally launched his bid on Gardner's 45th birthday.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the Pentagon.",

            "article_content": "As the Trump administration continues to roll back key safeguards for the LGBTQ community, from adequate access to health care to their ability to serve in the military, transgender Americans are increasingly nervous about being deprived of their rights to live freely. The National Center for Trans Equality Action Fund (NCTE) has identified over 30 discriminatory practices against trans people that the administration has implemented or tried to impose since President Trump took office. As a result, NCTE considers the 2020 election \"by far the most important election in our life time\" for the LGBTQ community.\u00a0 \"We have a very specific type of president who many of us feel like is intentionally trying to destroy our society as it is. There are so many ways in which the Trump administration and the fed government will not support trans citizens and we see that in all his rollbacks and policies,\" said NCTE Action Fund executive director Mara Keisling. In candidate interviews shared with CBS News, a number of the 2020 Democratic presidential contenders addressed NCTE through its new \"TransForm the White House Forum\" to make their cases to the trans community on how they'd protect trans rights.\u00a0 \"It's important for trans people to hear directly from the candidates themselves, what the candidates are thinking around a certain cluster of issues,\" Keisling said.\u00a0 The forum, which includes a series of sit-down interviews with the candidates and will continue throughout the 2020 campaign cycle, focuses on educating and opening up conversation for a motivated set of voters who are often excluded from campaign agendas.\u00a0 So far, here's what the candidates are saying about issues that matter most to trans people: During his administration, President Trump has been stripping the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of provisions that expanded anti-discrimination protections for transgender individuals, making it more difficult for transgender people to find adequate and compassionate medical care.\u00a0 For instance, the Health and Human Services Department announced a\u00a0new \"Conscience Rule\"\u00a0in May that would allow health care workers, doctors, hospitals and health insurance companies that receive federal funding to refuse to provide medical procedures on moral or religious grounds. Critics fear that the rule could be used to deny medical care entirely to LGBTQ patients, for anything from a sore throat to reproductive health. The rule would change a 2016 rule that banned discrimination on the basis of sex and against transgender people by health care providers receiving federal funding. Keisling said that all the candidates were \"extremely aware\" of the issue and \"seemed committed to see trans people were protected.\" Sen. Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, called the new regulation \"unacceptable.\"\u00a0 \"The discrimination from insurance companies to discrimination from employers who want to use religious exceptions and deny people fundamental basic healthcare is unacceptable to me,\" said Booker. \u00a0\"It shows you how much further we have to go to stop the backsliding of this administration, but more importantly to advance and gained ground until we have equal health care access for all.\" \u00a0 New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told the group she would aim to protect trans kids \"as if they were my own,\" and that starts with protecting and expanding their health care needs.\u00a0 \"I want other Democrats to be put on notice that these are issues they need to lead on. And that's why we introduced the most comprehensive platform for LGBTQ+ Americans, taking on the issues of health care, safety and security, anti-discrimination, banning conversion therapy, allowing an 'X' gender marker for anyone, for birth certificates, for driver's license,\" she said.\u00a0 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, who has built his campaign on his signature \"Medicare for All\" proposal, touted his bona fides on trans issues. \"Quite early on I was a supporter of the LGBT community. It is also a record and an agenda that speaks, not that just to the trans community, but to the American people.\"  Transgender people are often targeted in acts of violence or abuse because of their gender identity or presentation. And sometimes that comes at the hands of the law enforcement authorities entrusted with their safety. As a result, many trans individuals are reluctant to rely on them for help. According to NCTE's 2015 US Transgender Survey, a majority (57%) of transgender people are afraid to go to the police when they need it. Booker, a Newark native, said he would build upon former President Obama's efforts to standardize guidelines for \"21st century policing\" to address poor relations between police and the trans community. \"I would want to do more than that, to start focusing and pulling together folks who make recommendations when it comes to the LGBTQ community in general and policing and then start to look at federal prisons,\" Booker said.\u00a0 The senator pointed out that the trans community \"is being disproportionately targeted with heinous acts of violence.\" He said he would counter the Trump administration's removal of trans protections by the Justice Department and would provide appropriate training for police officers.\u00a0 \"I will be a president that is a very aggressive in calling out these issues and putting forward the best of who we are to stop this kind of targeting, harassment, violence and murder,\" Booker said.\u00a0 Sanders vowed to fight discrimination \"in all of its forms.\"\u00a0 \"I know that the trans community has been \u2014 in sometimes very violent and deadly ways \u2014 been a victim of that hatred,\" Sanders said. \"So we will provide all of the legal protection that we possibly can to protect the trans community and to protect anybody else who was being subjected to hate crimes and bullying.\" He said his administration would provide financial resources and legal help to police departments around the country \"to make them very sensitive to this issue.\"\u00a0 While light on detail, Gillibrand said in order to address the overwhelming amount of violence toward LGBTQ Americans, \"we can raise up those stories so more people can have compassion, can have empathy and can understand that this is a human right that has to be protected.\" \"That's what the presidency is about. Changing the conversation in a country when it needs to change and bringing people along with you,\" Gillibrand said.\u00a0 An estimated 134,000 American veterans are transgender, and over 15,000 trans people are serving in military today. While support for transgender veterans has improved, trans military members still face barriers on the front lines, since the Trump administration's controversial policy of\u00a0stopping transgender troops\u00a0from serving openly in the military went into effect earlier this year.\u00a0 The Pentagon has blocked the use of miltary or homeland security resources to fund sex reassignment surgical procedures, and transgender servicemembers face challenges in obtaining service and medical records that do not reveal they're transgender. Sen. Gillibrand, an ardent supporter of Americans in military service, slammed the president's Pentagon policies and his own lack of military service. \"A man who has never served has told men and women that their service is not worthy, based on their gender identity. I can't think of a more discriminatory, outrageous statement,\" she told NCTE. Gillibrand, an early supporter of repealing the Clinton-era \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" (DADT) policy barring LBGTQ service members from openly serving, tried to separate herself from the field by pointing to her work on bipartisan legislation to help the trans community.\u00a0 \"I created the climate where there was no room to be against our LGBTQ+ service members by talking about their bravery, talking about their commitment, talking about the fact that more than a thousand were being lost in mission critical areas because of the discriminatory policy. The fact that they'd lost 10% of our foreign language speakers because of DADT. And so I'll apply the same strategy of changing the climate of the conversation,\" said Gillibrand.\u00a0 Find more interviews from NCTE Action Fund's new initiative here Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential hopefuls are running in a crowded, 24-way race. In order to differentiate themselves, candidates must manufacture, or hope for, solitary moments in the sun.\u00a0 One way to do so is to participate in nationally televised town halls. Multiple cable networks have offered candidates this chance, including CNN, MSNBC and Fox News; however, only one has turned participation into a political statement. Earlier this month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u00a0publicly declined\u00a0an invitation to join a Fox town hall. She then went one step further,\u00a0tweeting\u00a0her boycott of Fox News, claiming the network, \"is a hate-for-profit racket that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracy theorists.\" Warren, in attempt to separate Fox News viewers from its journalists,\u00a0said\u00a0that she's \"running a campaign to reach all Americans\" and that the network is welcome to have representation at her events on the road. However, not participating in a Fox News town hall means the candidate is walking away from potentially addressing millions of viewers. The network consistency is the\u00a0highest rated\u00a0of all cable competitors, and attracts a healthy number of independents, who can vote in crucial Democratic contests like the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries.\u00a0 A\u00a02018 Suffolk University poll\u00a0showed Fox News had the highest number of independent viewers compared to any other cable network, while a 2014 Pew study indicated that roughly a third of its viewers were independents.\u00a0 Tad Devine, the chief strategist for Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign, questioned whether Warren's pass was the right move. But Devine has also acknowledged that the senator must find a way to distinguish herself, especially from fellow progressive Sanders. \"She's a classic example of competing for Bernie Sanders' space,\" Devine told CBS News. \"[Rejecting Fox] could make daylight between [Warren] and Bernie.\" The first, and perhaps most successful, Democrat to participate in a Fox News town hall was Sanders. Not only did his appearance have the highest viewership of his opponents -- the most watched candidate town hall on any network thus far this cycle \u2013 but it produced a positive viral moment. When discussing Sanders' signature Medicare-For-All pledge, co-moderator Bret Baier asked the audience how many would be willing to lose their private insurance in order to adopt the government-funded system. While there's no telling how many of Fox's viewers raised their hands, a number of arms in the live studio audience sprouted into the air amid loud cheers.\u00a0 Since Sanders, two other Democratic hopefuls have participated: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Notably, Buttigieg also created a moment that popped when he on-air chastised rhetoric from Fox News hosts, specifically calling out Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham. While Warren is the only candidate to have announced a boycott of the network, Sen. Kamala Harris \u2013 who has never given Fox a sit-down interview as a senator \u2013 also\u00a0rejected\u00a0the request to appear in a town hall forum earlier this month. \u00a0 \u00a0 Completely abstaining from the network is even a notion the Democratic National Committee, which chose to keep Fox News from hosting a primary debate, disagrees. In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for the DNC said, \"While we don't believe Fox is equipped to be a partner for a 2020 debate because of concerns of fairness at the highest levels within their organization, we believe that we must reach all voters and that means having Democrats appear on Fox in order to engage their audience. That is why you have seen Chair Tom Perez, DNC officers and staff regularly appear on Fox.\" Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who will take the Fox News stage Sunday evening, has a similar view. \"A president must have the courage to meet people where they are and make their case about issues from healthcare to climate change and gun violence prevention,\" Gillibrand told CBS News in a statement. \"Millions of Americans watch Fox and I want to make the case to them that I can improve their lives far better than President Trump.\" Former Housing and Urban Development Sec. Julian Castro will be the fifth Democratic candidate to appear later this month. All potential participants will hope for moments that gain traction, like the ones Sanders and Buttigieg created. More broadly than message, at this stage in the campaign candidates ought to be focused on sheer total of media impressions, according to Terry Sullivan, Marco Rubio's 2016 campaign manager and co-founder of Firehouse Strategies. \"As Trump showed all of us, the more earned media you can get the better you will do. It doesn't matter if it's even bad.\" Dr. Lauren Feldman studies partisan media practices and strategy as an Associate Professor at Rutgers' Department of Journalism & Media Studies School of Communication and Information. She said in a field where everyone is vying for the spotlight, Warren's decision to steer clear of Fox News was a way to get attention. However, Feldman also points out that Democrats appearing on Fox News \"are not only getting an hour devoted exclusively to them on a largely viewed news network, they're also going to get more coverage for that particular type of town hall because it is unconventional. They are making a statement by appearing on Fox.\" Sullivan said that that statement is ultimately a smart one to make.\u00a0 \"Not a lot of Dem primary voters are watching Fox News. But at the same time there sure as hell are a lot of general election swing voters who do,\" Sullivan said. Condemning Fox News is, \"a very smart two dimensional political play. It's also a very stupid three dimensional play.\" CBS News reporter covering climate change and energy.",

            "article_content": "This year has seen over 20 Democrats lining up to challenge President Trump in 2020. Mr. Trump did not win the popular vote in 2016, and his approval ratings have hovered around 40 percent during his two years in office. But Mr. Trump is not a weak candidate, and the Democrat who challenges him will face significant challenges inherent in running against an incumbent president. CBS News' Ed O'Keefe joined CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast to discuss the 2020 political landscape. O'Keefe noted that in 2016, Mr. Trump ended up winning several states that used to be failsafes for Democrats -- Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan -- by very narrow margins. O'Keefe said the \"existential debate\" for the Democrats now was to choose whether to focus on the states that they had narrowly lost, or the toss-ups that might be up for grabs, like Texas and Georgia. \"I actually think ultimately they're going to have a more brutal argument over that than they are over the finer points of Medicare or environmental policy,\" O'Keefe said about the Democrats. \"Because it becomes an argument over which subgroups of American voters, basically, do we want to focus on more: white, blue-collar, distressed, feeling left behind voters in the industrial midwest or north; or, ascendant black, Latino, Asian, young people who have moved from the north or California into places like Arizona, Georgia, Texas, North Carolina,\" O'Keefe continued. One major challenge the eventual Democratic candidate will face is challenging a president who has the momentum of incumbency. Fifteen of the last 20 incumbent presidents have been re-elected. \"That is why you've seen the RNC (Republican National Committee) over the last year or so, and they're intensifying those efforts now, running around the country shoring up all those little details about built-in support for the president out of concern that perhaps this one isn't as structurally advantaged as his predecessor,\" O'Keefe said. Despite Mr. Trump's weaknesses, Democrats watching the campaign are wary. \"Democrats are terrified of him and convinced he can win,\" O'Keefe said about Mr. Trump. The strength of the economy could also help Mr. Trump in the election. \"Unquestionably, the economy is in great shape. Either he's responsible for that, or at least he's responsible for not causing a huge demise,\" O'Keefe said.

            "article_content": "While Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, is still in the exploratory phase of the already jam-packed 2020 Democratic presidential primary race, she says that she's the \"best candidate\" to take on President Trump and fully expects to run against the sitting president next year. She told \"CBS This Morning\" that she can take on the Republican while reaching out to every American \"no matter where you live.\" \"So the truth is, I am the best candidate to run against President Trump because I can bring this country back together. I can not only inspire the base on progressive issues that I'm running on like actually passing a Green New Deal, Medicare for all \u2013 health care is a right, not a privilege \u2013 but also being able to reach out to those red and purple voters to be heard and to have them come to the table and be represented,\" Gillibrand said on Monday.\u00a0 The Democrat was confident she could gain support from her Republican colleagues on issues like the environment and health care in a highly partisan Congress. She cited her past work passing the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act to assist first responders with the support of conservative members and her 2-to-1 run in a Republican district in upstate New York.\u00a0 \"You have to find common ground, you have to be able to reach across the aisle, listen, find out where you agree and build from there,\" she added.\u00a0 Gillibrand announced she is forming an exploratory committee to run for president during an appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" back in January.\u00a0 The 52-year-old is one of the most active and outspoken critics of Mr. Trump and she earned acclaim from party activists when she began voting against all of the president's Cabinet and senior government nominees in early 2017. Asked why she hasn't committed to a full 2020 campaign yet, Gillibrand told CBS that she's taking the time to travel around the country to talk to people about what's on their minds. \"What's happening in this country is devastating. President Trump has created such divisions, such darkness, such hate, and we need someone who can restore what has been lost, that moral integrity, that leadership in the world and I'm running because as a mom of young kids, I really think we need a president that will fight for other people's children, their communities, their families in the same way you would fight for your own,\" she said.\u00a0 Gillibrand said despite mounting pressure to investigate the president and threats of impeachment, she predicted that she would face off against Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. The Democrat said in the meantime, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and possible ties between the Trump campaign and the Russian government needs to be completed. \"We have hearings in the House of Representatives that will create transparency and accountability on issues of collusion, on issues of obstruction, on issues of fraud and election fraud, those are the types of issues the American people want clarity on,\" said Gillibrand.\u00a0 Gillibrand, however, would not say if she would vote to support impeachment proceedings of the president, saying \"that's an issue for the House to decide.\"\u00a0 \"They will decide what the facts are and reveal it to us and then if they do do impeachment proceedings then it comes to the senate and then you are in charge of basically holding a trial,\" she said.

            "article_content": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn't old enough to run for president. But the freshman congresswoman from New York introduced a Green New Deal resolution on Thursday that is already emerging as a key policy test for 2020 Democratic candidates. \"Our first step is to define the problem and define the scope of the solution,\" Ocasio-Cortez told reporters during a Thursday afternoon  press conference for her newly-introduced proposal, which was quickly backed by Democratic presidential hopefuls Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker. \"Small, incremental policy solutions are not enough.\" Several contenders vying for the Democatic nomination have expressed support for the underlying principles of the sweeping resolution to combat climate change, and activist groups energized by the November midterm election wins have been pressuring candidates to sign on as co-sponsors. \"We are going to be pressuring all the 2020 contenders, especially the senators, to co-sponsor the bill,\" Stephen O'Hanlon, a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement, a climate change group that staged a high-profile sit-in in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office in November which Ocasio-Cortez attended, told CBS News. \"It will make clear who is just using it as a buzzword and who is taking it seriously.\" Progressive activists are \"extremely supportive of the Green New Deal and think of it as the gold standard plan on climate, and expect their presidential candidates to be treating it as such,\" said Chad Bolt, associate policy director of Indivisible, a grassroots resistance group. Bolt says the environment ranks among the top three issues for its members. The resolution introduced by Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat, is broad and light on specifics, and seen more as a roadmap for overhauling the economy than a concrete piece of legislation. The resolution includes plans to decarbonize the economy, reduce greenhouse gases, make sure low-income and minority communities benefit, create a federal jobs guarantee, provide universal health care and make investments in infrastructure. The Green New Deal proposal is named after President Franklin Roosevelt's sweeping \"New Deal\" economic and labor reforms during the Great Depression. It's aimed a transforming the American economy by ending its dependence on fossil fuels, investing heavily in renewable energy like solar and wind and sparking large-scale job-creation. Some proposals have set the goal to converting the entire U.S. economy to renewable energy within 12 years and eliminating the carbon footprint by 2030. The lack of specifics could present opportunities and liabilities for presidential candidates. On one hand, it becomes a kind of \"catch-all\" way to talk about the environment, jobs and economic fairness, issues at the forefront of the party's primary. But on the other, it could put candidates in a difficult position when pressed on the costs and impact on certain jobs and industries. The debate over Medicare-for-All has already shown the kinds of risks and rewards candidates face. Republicans have branded the proposal as a costly fringe policy goal, and many centrist Democrats have not backed the initiative. Pelosi referred to it Thursday morning as a \"suggestion\" and the \"green dream.\"\u00a0 \"It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,\" Pelosi told Politico in an interview. \"The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?\" Later in the morning, Pelosi said she had not seen the proposal. \"I do know its enthusiastic and I welcome all the enthusiasm that is out there,\" she told reporters during her weekly press conference. Pelosi also named the nine Democratic members of the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis \u2014 and notably left Ocasio-Cortez off the list. The New York Democrat said Pelosi offered her a spot, but she declined it because she wanted to focus on the \"legislative\" side of climate policy. Despite some hesitation within the party, the Democratic base sees the proposal as a way for its leaders to capitalize on their new power in Washington. Read the resolution here: \u00a0 In a statement to CBS News on Tuesday, Congressman Ra\u00fal Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, confirmed that he will be supporting the resolution, after initially being reluctant to back it. \"The Green New Deal will put the health and well-being of our communities first,\" Grijalva said. Its aspirational goals will help our country combat climate change through clean and renewable energy, create millions of new jobs in the process, and safeguard our environment for generations to come.\" Most of the Democratic presidential candidates have also broadly endorsed the idea behind the Green New Deal. Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who's mulling a presidential bid, said the issue should be an integral part of his party's agenda going forward. On CBSN's \"Red and Blue,\" Merkley outlined what he believes should be the key components of a comprehensive Green New Deal. \u00a0 \"The core objectives are some things such as let's drive a fast transition from fossil fuel, carbon transmission creating energy sources to renewable energy so that we save our planet. Second principle is, let's create tens of millions of jobs as we renovate our energy economy,\" he said Tuesday. \u00a0\"A third principle \u2014 a just transition for fossil fuel workers so that no one is left behind and so we show respect and gratitude for all the work they've done to power economy is the decades past.\" Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "A California law that makes it harder for companies to treat workers  as independent contractors takes effect January 1. Ahead of that date, small  businesses in and outside the state are rethinking their staffing. The law puts tough restrictions on who can be independent contractors  or freelancers rather than employees. Supporters say it addresses  inequities created by the growth of the gig economy, including the  employment practices of ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft that  use contractors. Company owners with independent contractors must now  decide whether to hire them as employees or look for help in other  states. Another alternative: Asking these workers to start their own  businesses, a setup the law allows. Although the law affects companies of all sizes and out-of-state   businesses that use California contractors, it likely will have a   greater impact on the many small businesses that have hired independent   contractors because of limited staffing budgets. Tamara Ellison  has used independent contractors in both her  consulting and  construction businesses. She's expecting to hire five of  her consulting  contractors as employees to bring her company into  compliance with the  law. But she's also thinking she may have to limit  the services she  offers because not all her hires will have all the  skills she needs for  all her clients. She may also have to raise her  prices, a worrisome  proposition. \"Little companies just trying to start out won't be  able to afford  our services,\" said Ellison, whose Ontario,  California-based company  bears her name. Ellison won't need to hire her construction contractors; they're  subcontractors, a classification that complies with the new law. The law approved by the California legislature in September codifies a  2018 ruling by the state's Supreme Court that said workers  misclassified as independent contractors lose rights and protections  including a minimum wage, workers' compensation and unemployment  compensation. The ruling came in a lawsuit brought against the delivery  company Dynamex; workers around the country have complained that  services like Uber and Lyft have misclassified them as well. The law is being challenged in state courts, and companies including  Uber and Lyft are campaigning for a referendum on the 2020 election  ballot on whether they should be exempt from the law. And employment law  attorneys expect the state legislature to add to the list of professions the  law already excludes. Independent contractors and freelancers have long been a sore point  for federal and state officials who contend that many of these workers  are doing work that employees do. When employers classify workers as  independent contractors, they avoid taxes including the 6.2% of salary  and wages companies must pay for Social Security and the 1.45% they must  pay for Medicare. Employers must also pay for workers' compensation and  unemployment and disability insurance and often their health insurance and retirement benefits. For many small business owners, especially those who do a variety of  projects requiring different types of expertise, contractors provide  more flexibility. Webconsuls, a digital marketing agency with offices in  California and Tennessee, bases its hiring decision on the work it has  and whether projects are long term or short term. \"We may need a developer who specializes in a specific language to  help us build one website,\" managing partner John McGhee said. \"If we  don't anticipate having to use that language again in the near future,  we'll hire a contractor to build the website.\" The layoffs companies were forced to make during and after the Great  Recession encouraged many small business owners to choose independent  contractors over employees. Contractors often cost less \u2014 they don't get  health insurance, 401(k) contributions and other benefits \u2014 and owners  don't have to let people go and pay severance when business slows. The new law allows workers to be classified as independent  contractors only if companies don't have the right to control their work  and how it is done. A number of factors go into making that  determination, including how closely the worker is supervised \u2014 for  example, who sets their hours. The work being done must not be part of  the company's regular business, and the worker's occupation must be  distinct from the company's; in other words, a graphic designer cannot  be an independent contractor for a graphic design firm. There are exemptions for professionals like doctors, lawyers,  architects and insurance brokers, but they must have the freedom to set  their own hours, negotiate their own fees and exercise their own  judgment as they do their jobs. Workers like graphic artists, freelance  writers and travel agents can also be exempt if they have similar  autonomy. And people who work in barber shops, hair and nail salons and  spas can have exemptions, but they have to set their own rates and  hours, choose their own clients and be paid directly by the clients. Marisa Vallbona has transitioned a contractor who has worked for her  in California into an employee, and is being more selective about the  work she takes on in the state. Vallbona, who recently moved the  headquarters of her public relations firm, CIM, to Houston from  California, is now using only Texas-based contractors. \"I don't work with freelancers in California anymore because of the gig economy problems,\" she said. Other companies inside and out of California may follow  suit. The increase in remote working over the past two decades has made  it easier for companies to find workers anywhere. Companies that don't comply with the law face the possibility of  penalties running into the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars,  said Nannina Angioni, an employment law attorney with Kaedian LLP in Los  Angeles. She's warning clients that the law expands the ability of  local officials, and not just state tax officials, to enforce the law  starting July 1. Moreover, she says the law can lead to lawsuits brought by workers. Some owners may believe it's OK to use independent contractors or  freelancers because some workers like being part of the gig economy,  said Michael Boro, a consultant with PwC whose expertise is in workplace  issues. \"These people don't want to be employees\" is the position owners may  take, Boro said. But, he warned, they need to follow the law, not  workers' wishes.",

            "article_content": "CBS News will be\u00a0co-hosting a debate\u00a0next year in Charleston, South Carolina with the Congressional Black Caucus Institute on February 25, 2020, at The Gaillard Center. Twitter is also a partner.\u00a0 CBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice\u00a0says the debate is one of four announced by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Thursday to take place in early caucus or primary states next year. Here are the others announced Thursday: The DNC plans to announce the qualifications to participate, criteria and moderators for all four debates at a future date. The scheduled debates come as it looks more likely five of the Democratic presidential candidates who are also sitting senators could be jurors in a Senate impeachment trial of President Trump early next year in Washington, D.C.\u00a0 DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa acknowledged the potential scheduling conflict Thursday afternoon,\u00a0tweeting\u00a0about the debates, \"And if a conflict with an impeachment trial is unavoidable, the DNC will evaluate its options and work with all the candidates to accommodate them.\" Meanwhile, a CBS News analysis finds that seven candidates will get to take the stage in the final Democratic presidential debate of 2019, the smallest group of candidates of any of the six debates held this year. This comes just before the Thursday deadline to qualify with both the donor threshold and polling.\u00a0 Candidates who have qualified are Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren and Andrew Yang.\u00a0 According to CBS News analysis, each met the necessary 200,000 unique donor threshold and had 4% polling in four qualified polls or 6% polling in two qualified state polls. The DNC will officially confirm participants following the deadline, but as the window closes no other candidates were close to meeting the qualifications.\u00a0 Tulsi Gabbard met the donor threshold and was shy one poll but said she would not attend the debate either way. Cory Booker and Julian Castro both met the donor threshold but had not met the polling requirement. In an email to supporters, Castro claimed he didn't need the debate stage to see differences between the candidates. Booker also sent out an email saying even if he's not on the stage, he'll be on the road next week to share his vision and hear directly from voters. \u00a0The debate will take place December 19 in Los Angeles and will be co-hosted by PBS NewsHour and Politico. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG According to a doctor from John's Hopkins Hospital, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is \"a 77-year-old man in outstanding health.\"\u00a0 In a letter obtained by\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry, Dr. Stephen D. Sisson says Bloomberg is \"in great physical shape,\" and says \"his diet and health habits are excellent.\"\u00a0 Bloomberg is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and donates to the university regularly.\u00a0 According to the New York Times Bloomberg has donated more than $3.35 billion to the university.\u00a0 CORY BOOKER On a call with reporters this morning, Senator Cory Booker's campaign manager said the team believes Booker can still capture the Democratic nomination even if he's not on the December debate stage.\u00a0 \"We still see a path to victory in the Democratic nomination that does not include the December debate stage as a requirement,\" Booker campaign manager Addisu Demissie said.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0says Booker will be coming to Iowa the day of the debate, though he has not qualified to appear onstage.\u00a0 The Iowa trip will be a multi-day open press bus tour. Demissie said the campaign is making a $500,000 digital and television advertising buy in Iowa. A super PAC has launched television ads supporting Booker in Iowa, but the campaign itself has not bought television advertising time in the state. Demissie also said the campaign has raised more than $3 million since the November debate. He added that the campaign wants Booker to be in Iowa as much as possible and plans to return soon after Christmas. Booker's campaign rolled out 23 new endorsements from Iowa elected officials and activists Thursday.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says the list includes Johnson County Supervisor Royceann Porter, who was the first African-American woman to hold county-wide office in Johnson County. She endorsed Booker during his visit to Iowa on Saturday. \u00a0 \"He was always someone I would endorse. And now he's doing well here in Iowa,\" Porter told the\u00a0Iowa Press Citizen.\u00a0 Booker was also endorsed at that event by Iowa Mental Health Advocacy founders Scott and Leslie Carpenter. He now has more than 100 endorsements from elected officials and activists in Iowa.\u00a0 JULIAN CASTRO Juli\u00e1n Castro announced a slew of new endorsements this week, including four new backers in Nevada.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says among them is\u00a0state Assemblywoman Selena Torres, a Las Vegas-area middle school teacher who's been invited to a number of events by different campaigns hoping to win her over. The endorsements come as Castro touts being the first presidential candidate to sign the \"Teachers 2020 pledge,\" an education platform from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. ELIZABETH WARREN Elizabeth Warren delivered a speech Thursday that drew a contrast with each of her leading Democratic rivals.\u00a0 \"We know how big the problems are and right now no one is proposing kinds of solutions that address those problems,\" she told reporters after the New Hampshire event.\u00a0 The appearance had been billed as a speech about how Warren's plans all address corruption and economic reform, but she also used the opportunity to delineate the differences between her campaign and the other presidential contenders, more so than in any other campaign event she's held up to this point. Warren only used opponent Michael Bloomberg's name as she spoke about the failure of other candidates to embrace the kind of \"big structural change\" she calls for. Her sharpest attack against an opponent was aimed at Pete Buttigieg. The two have been clashing regularly over the past month. \"We know that another calls the people who raise a quarter million dollars for him his 'National Investors Circle,' and he offers them regular phone calls and special access,\" Warren said. Meanwhile, Warren said she isn't \"counting on Republican politicians having an epiphany and suddenly supporting the kinds of tax increases on the rich or big business accountability,\" a clear critique of former Vice President Joe Biden, who has said he thinks congressional Republicans would work with him. Warren also included a rare moment of political moderation, a veiled contrast between herself and progressive rival Bernie Sanders. \"Will I have a magic wand to enact my full agenda,\" she asked. \"Of course not. No president does. I know we will have to compromise,\" she said. Warren also hired Anne Wakabayashi as a strategist in Pennsylvania today, a campaign spokesperson said, making her the first Democratic candidate to hire in the state this cycle. The campaign plans to open a field office in Philadelphia in the coming weeks. WHAT'S COOKING? The Culinary Union wrapped up three days of questioning of the presidential candidates this week, their last such events of the year, asking Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Joe Biden each a version of the same question: How would their healthcare plan impact their treasured, hard-fought Culinary health fund?\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says Warren earned applause Monday\u00a0for her answer, praising their healthcare facilities as \"something I want to see replicated all around America.\" Despite an\u00a0enthusiastic reception\u00a0on Tuesday, Sanders\u00a0faced some shouts\u00a0of \"union healthcare\" and \"how do we pay for it\" as he explained his single-payer approach. And Biden on Wednesday was quick to\u00a0assure the labor group\u00a0\"you're going to get to keep it with me,\" lambasting \"friends of mine\" for their Medicare for All plans.\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE Just after the House passage of a bill aiming to lower prescription drug costs, the House Democratic campaign arm announced a digital ad buy about health care in competitive districts. Its string of Facebook ads is running in 42 districts where the party's\u00a0\"Frontline\"\u00a0\u2014 or most vulnerable members \u2014 are based, as well as in 26 Republican districts.\u00a0 The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's modest five-figure digital ad buy is its first set of advertisements in battleground districts since the impeachment process began, after millions has been spent by GOP groups on anti-impeachment ads to pressure Democratic voters. The DCCC's advertising is keeping its distance from impeachment and embracing healthcare, which it says is the foremost issue on the minds of voters. Each of the spots\u00a0highlights\u00a0Thursday's passage of the drug cost bill, named for the late Congressman Elijah Cummings, or\u00a0criticizes specific Republicans for voting against it.\u00a0 \"I have to tell you I have a very big district, 7,000 square miles. And what I hear most often \u2014 it's not impeachment, it's not what's on the front page of the Washington Post. It's what are you going to do about the cost of our prescription drugs? And this bill is an answer to my constituents,\" freshman Democrat Kim Schrier of Washington said Thursday morning.\u00a0 Meanwhile, Republicans have been using impeachment as the crux of their advertisement messaging. The American Action Network (AAN) has been one of the biggest spenders and said the group has dropped over $8.5 million for advertisements and specifically, $2 million on digital ads. Their ads\u00a0target 30 Democrats\u00a0in swing-state seats, all in districts President Trump won in 2016.\u00a0 Read more here.",

            "article_content": "International consulting firm McKinsey & Company\u00a0will allow\u00a0South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg to disclose the identity of his clients when he worked at the firm from 2007-2010, the company said Monday. A spokesperson for McKinsey said in a statement that while confidentiality agreements are fundamental to building trust with their clients, the firm recognizes \"the unique circumstances presented by a presidential campaign.\" \u00a0 The spokesperson added, \"After receiving permission from the relevant clients, we have informed Mayor Buttigieg that he may disclose the identity of the clients he served while at McKinsey from 2007 to 2010.\"\u00a0 Lis Smith, senior communications adviser for Buttigieg's presidential campaign, tweeted that the campaign would be releasing a list of Buttigieg's clients \"soon.\" She wrote, \"In this instance, @PeteButtigieg is being transparent about his private sector work AND keeping his word- two things you will never hear said about our current President.\" On Friday, Buttigieg called on his former employer to waive his nondisclosure agreement after facing criticism for not discussing his clients while working at the firm, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. \u00a0 \"I am today reiterating my request that McKinsey release me from this agreement, and I again make clear that I authorize them to release the full list of clients I was assigned to serve,\" Buttigieg said in a statement on Friday.\u00a0 Buttigieg also provided descriptions of the projects he worked on and a timeline of his work at the firm. McKinsey confirmed that the\u00a0client list\u00a0that the mayor described in his statement on Friday is accurate. However, any further disclosure by Buttigieg about his clients mustn't reveal \"confidential, proprietary or classified information obtained during the course of that work, or violate any security clearance,\" the McKinsey spokesperson said. PETE BUTTIGIEG Buttigieg's campaign manager Mike Schmuhl also\u00a0announced\u00a0Monday that the campaign would be opening its closed-door fundraisers to press and releasing the names of bundlers. The move comes as the mayor was facing pressure from some of his Democratic competitors.\u00a0 \"In a continued commitment to transparency, we are announcing today that our campaign will open fundraisers to reporters, and will release the names of people raising money for our campaign,\" Schmuhl said in a statement. \"Fundraising events with Pete will be open to press\u00a0beginning tomorrow, and a list of people raising money for the campaign will be released within the week.\"\u00a0 Turman\u00a0says Buttigieg and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren have been critical of each other on transparency issues. Buttigieg has called on Warren to release her tax returns from her work in the private sector. And Warren has criticized the mayor for holding closed-door fundraisers and has called on Buttigieg to open them to press.\u00a0 \"The mayor should be releasing who's on his finance committee, who are the bundlers who are raising big money for him, who he's give titles to and made promises to,\" Warren said at an event in Boston last week. \"He should open up the doors so the press can follow the promises he's making in these big dollar fundraisers.\"\u00a0 TRUMP CAMPAIGN President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Pennsylvania on Tuesday to participate in \"Keep America Great\" campaign events, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0Pence will meet with veterans in Rochester, Pennsylvania before joining Mr. Trump for a campaign rally on the other side of the state in Hershey. This will be the campaign's second rally in Pennsylvania this year and the first one since impeachment began. Mr. Trump won the state by less than 1% in 2016 against Hillary Clinton. NEVADA Elizabeth Warren is touring the Culinary Union's health center\u00a0in Las Vegas today, the first of three candidates \u2014 Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Joe Biden \u2014 who this week will survey their facilities\u00a0before answering questions\u00a0from members of the influential Nevada labor group. Michael Lighty, a key surrogate for Sanders on health policy, discussed the\u00a0union's public skepticism\u00a0of \"Medicare for All\" as he campaigned over the weekend in Nevada.\u00a0 \"You're right. We've got to prove to you that this is better than what you have. And it is,\"\u00a0Lighty said, telling\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0after the event that the labor group's facilities would continue under their single payer proposal. Also in Nevada \u2013 the state's Democratic Party has\u00a0released new details\u00a0of the mobile app that will assist caucus sites with tabulating Nevadans' early vote and Caucus Day preferences. The software is among the new reforms the party\u00a0has rolled out\u00a0for the coming year's caucus, which is expected to run the party more than 2.2 million dollars. The party declined to identify on the record the vendor developing the application or how much it will cost Nevada Democrats. SOUTH CAROLINA The nonprofit FairVote in partnership with YouGov has released a\u00a0poll\u00a0showing that Joe Biden continues to lead the Democratic presidential primary pack in South Carolina. A new poll of 400 likely Democratic voters in the state show that 40% voted Biden as the\u00a0ranked-choice\u00a0winner of the current candidates in the race.\u00a0 The second choice was Bernie Sanders with nearly 15% of the vote. Buttigieg experienced a slight jump since the organization's September\u00a0poll, which now shows Buttigieg coming in at third place just under Sanders with nearly 12%. In the state where as much as 60% of the Democratic electorate is projected to be comprised of African-American voters, Biden holds a commanding 39-point lead among black voters with more than half choosing him as their first ranked choice. By contrast, Buttigieg continued to poll low amongst this group and garnered just over 1% in the latest FairVote/YouGov poll.\u00a0 In an interview with\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0last week, Buttigieg\u00a0said\u00a0his team knows the importance of engaging communities of color and that more resources and time are being dedicated to ensure that this voting bloc is engaged. According to the organization's website, the FairVote/YouGov poll \"builds on\" the national poll the group commissioned in September in an effort \"to help demonstrate the value of ranked choice polls in crowded fields.\"\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE Pierce Bush, grandson of late President George H.W. Bush, announced on Monday that he would run for Texas' 22nd Congressional District on Monday, an open seat after Representative Pete Olson announced his retirement in July. He joins a crowded Republican primary with a familiar name.\u00a0 Former President George W. Bush, who also served as governor of Texas, is his uncle. His father Neil Bush is a well-known businessman and investor and his cousin George P. Bush is the Texas land commissioner.\u00a0His announcement video\u00a0talked about \"losing a generation\" to socialism, following similar messaging by House Republicans.\u00a0 \"We all know that socialism has failed everywhere and everyone. It's time for new leaders to stand for conservatism that empowers all Americans, placing individuals above governments and ensuring that we all have the freedom to achieve success in life,\" he said in a\u00a0Twitter video. A Republican party of Texas official confirmed to\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0that it has received Bush's filing. According to the\u00a0Texas Secretary of State office, nine other candidates have filed for the Houston area seat.\u00a0 Bush's competitors include Republican candidates like Kathleen Wall, who spent $6 million for a 2018 race in Texas' 2nd District, and county judge Greg Hill.\u00a0 Representative Olson had one of his tightest wins in 2018 against Democrat Sri Preston Kulkarni.\u00a0 Districts like this add to the case that Texas has\u00a0grown more politically competitive\u00a0for 2020, due to continually shifting demographics and tight 2018 races. Democrats are predicting the GOP primary in TX-22 will be highly competitive and expensive. The district was already a target for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\u00a0 \"Republicans in Texas' 22nd District are crawling over each other to race to the right and define themselves by their allegiance to President Donald Trump and their party's reckless agenda in Washington. Now they'll have to choose the mixture of toxic issues they embrace: health care repeal, a tax handout to the wealthiest Americans while working Texans get the shaft, or absolute fealty to a reckless and out-of-control president,\" said DCCC spokesman Avery Jaffe.\u00a0 Also in House news, the Winning for Women PAC launched a six-figure\u00a0ad\u00a0buy using the stalled passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada-Agreement (USMCA) to target six vulnerable House Democrats in agricultural districts.\u00a0Navarro\u00a0says all but one of these Democrats are in districts Trump won in 2016. The ads feature USMCA numbers specific to the targeted district, and then display their office number. The ads mirror a similar approach by other Republican outside groups who have been running ads targeting House Democrats since the impeachment inquiry began.\u00a0 \"Americans are tired of political, partisan games,\" WFW Executive Director Rebecca Schuller said in a statement. \"Our lawmakers need to do what they were elected to do, and pass the USMCA on behalf of America's workers, farmers, and families.\" VOTER PROTECTION The Democratic Governors Association announced a new program with Stacey Abrams' Fair Fight organization, geared at beefing up voter protection and access ahead of 2020's census and 2021's redistricting. The initiative,\u00a0\"Every State, Every Vote,\" is looking to pool the resources and efforts of Democratic governors to combat voter suppression and bolster voter registration tactics like automatic or same-day registration.\u00a0 During a morning call with reporters,\u00a0Navarro\u00a0says incoming DGA chairman New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said the partnership with Abrams, a former Democratic gubernatorial candidate in a tight 2018 race in Georgia, is a \"big deal.\" In a statement, Murphy said, \"Democratic governors can be the strongest check against Republican efforts to suppress the right to vote and the strongest advocate for a progressive agenda that expands it.\" The collaboration comes in preparation of 2021 redistricting and builds upon the DGA's \"Unrig The Map\" effort. It also calls for independent commissions for map drawing, something that was requested in\u00a0North Carolina's gerrymandering case\u00a0this month but fell short.\u00a0 \"The only way we can stop Republican attempts to hijack our democracy is to make every voice count. Will you stand with me and pledge to elect Democratic governors and secure fair maps?,\" Abrams said in the initiative's launch video.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration this week announced a proposal to import prescription medication from Canada in an effort to address high drug prices \u2014 a perennial problem for American consumers. Yet while they applaud the policy's goal, experts say the plan to allow foreign drug imports is unlikely to significantly lower costs in the U.S. \"In theory, we do see that there is broad support for this idea because people in the U.S. pay more for drugs than people in other countries, so the logic seems to follow that you could get lower costs if you get drugs manufactured in other countries,\" said Juliette Cubanski, associate director of Medicare policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Yet political and practical barriers suggest \"that the promise might not meet up with the reality of the proposal,\" she said.\u00a0 The proposal offers two pathways to drug imports from Canada. One would allow U.S. states to import drugs from Canada through wholesalers and pharmacies. Under the second scenario, manufacturers themselves could import lower-cost drugs from foreign markets. Other experts agree that the proposal won't likely produce savings for consumers.\u00a0 \"I would say we are not particularly optimistic this will result in meaningful savings to consumers,\" said Doug Hirsch, CEO of Good Rx, a company that helps Americans find savings on prescription medication.\u00a0 \"The headline sounds good, but there is no clear way for Canadian drugs to get to the U.S.,\" he said.\u00a0 The plan, he said, would be the equivalent of a hospital applying bandages to the arm of a patient suffering from a headache.\u00a0 So why aren't the proposals productive solutions to high drug prices in the U.S.? For one, the parties on which it depends are not obligated to participate.\u00a0 The Canadian government has the ability to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies and as a result, the country pays less than Americans for the same types of drugs. Canada has already said it won't supply the U.S. with drugs, citing its own limited supply. More demand \u2014 from consumers in the U.S. \u2014 would drive up prices for Canadians. \"There is no reason why Canada will allow the U.S. to do this. They don't want to give up or jeopardize their lower prices by allowing the U.S. to import them, so Canada might try to limit pharmaceuticals or wholesalers from doing this,\" said Washington University law professor Rachel Sachs.\u00a0 Cubanski agrees that \"there are more downsides than upsides for the Canadian market\" and Canada's non-participation would sideline the proposal.\u00a0 \"Trying to get more drugs from another country that buys drugs more cheaply is not a shortcut,\" said Erin Fox,\u00a0adjunct associate professor of pharmacotherapy at the University of Utah. \u00a0 Neither are the pharmaceutical companies incentivized to sell a greater supply of drugs at a lower price than that at which they're currently sold \u2014 and purchased. Drug companies, on whose cooperation the plan also depends, have long opposed similar proposals to import lower-cost drugs to the U.S.\u00a0 \"I don't see wholehearted support from the industry for importation, whether it be through the first proposed rule pathway or through the second. I think this is an opportunity that may not be all it seems to be in terms of really delivering savings for patients,\" Cubanski said.\u00a0 Costs associated with states adhering to Federal Drug Administration guidelines around drug safety are also likely to offset any potential savings to consumers.\u00a0 \"There is a very complex system around drug safety. It is not something to be blown off. It's really complicated, and it's interesting that the bill didn't even acknowledge that,\" Hirsch of Good RX said.\u00a0 In other words, consumers shouldn't expect to go to the pharmacy and see lower prices anytime soon.\u00a0 \"This is not something the administration can reasonably point to and say by the 2020 elections patients will be able to obtain cheaper drugs through this program. That is not the timeline this is happening on,\" Sachs said.\u00a0 The U.S. prohibits biologic drugs, including insulin, from being imported, meaning that the proposal would not result in savings for diabetic patients who depend on the drug to maintain their blood sugar levels. Generic versions of name brand drugs \u2014 on which many Americans rely \u2014 would not qualify either. Roughly 90% of the 4 billion prescriptions filled annually in the U.S. are for generic drugs, according to Good RX. \"So immediately, 90% of the audience is not seeing savings. This is not a panacea for the cost of health care in this country,\" Hirsch said.\u00a0 Megan O'Reilly, VP of AARP Government Affairs, Federal Health and Family acknowledged the exclusions but suggested that importing drugs from Canada \"could produce real savings for older Americans who take certain drugs.\" \u00a0",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration on Wednesday took a step forward in its plan to allow Americans to safely and legally access\u00a0lower-priced prescription drugs from abroad. Health officials unveiled a proposed rule that would allow states to import many brand name drugs from Canada, with federal oversight. A second draft plan would let pharmaceutical companies seek approval to import their own drugs, from any country. It's unclear whether either idea will affect patients' costs ahead of the 2020 election, but the Trump administration has advanced beyond its predecessors in trying to set up a supervised system for importing drugs. Medicines cost less in other advanced countries because the governments take an active role in setting prices. \"A new pathway for importation can move us to a more open and competitive market,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said. \"We will not take steps that would put patients or our drug supply at risk,\" he added. The steps taken Wednesday follow the outline of an announcement by the White House in July. President Trump frequently criticizes drug companies over high prices, and lawmakers in both parties agree on this. A government report showed that prices for pharmacy drugs fell by 1% last year, for the first time in 45 years. But the decline was driven by lower generic drug prices while the cost of brand name drugs continued to rise, although more slowly. The cost of medicines remains one of the top health care worries for Americans, and a recent Gallup-West Health poll found that 66% of adults believe the Trump administration has made little or no progress on the issue. The acrimonious politics of impeachment are dimming prospects for major drug pricing legislation in Congress. The pharmaceutical industry has successfully opposed drug importation for years, arguing that the safety of medicines purchased from other countries can't be guaranteed. The Trump administration is following a two-part strategy. A proposed regulation issued Wednesday would set up a system for states to import brand name medicines from Canada, working with pharmacies and wholesalers. Pills would mainly be covered under the plan. Insulin, biologic drugs, narcotics and certain other medications would be excluded, at least initially. The second part of the plan is draft legal guidance to drug companies outlining steps they can follow to import their own drugs. That could potentially allow for the importation of a broader range of medications, and from any country, Azar said. The government has no estimates of how much money consumers might be able to save, partly because it's unclear how many states would pursue drug importation from Canada. Florida has strong interest in the idea, along with a handful of other states. It's \"undefinable for the purposes of cost projection at this point,\" Azar said. On Capitol Hill, the House and the Senate are pursuing different strategies to cut drug costs. There's considerable overlap between the plans, but there are also sharp differences. A bipartisan bill in the Senate and House-passed legislation from Speaker Nancy Pelosi would cap what Medicare recipients pay out of pocket for medicines and penalize drug companies that raise their prices above the inflation rate. But Pelosi would go much further,\u00a0authorizing Medicare to negotiate drug prices and plowing back the savings to provide seniors with new dental, hearing and vision coverage. With congressional Republicans set against Medicare negotiations, the White House has issued a veto threat on Pelosi's bill, even though as a candidate Mr. Trump supported the idea in 2016.",

            "article_content": "Go to an Andrew Yang campaign event and he'll tell you that, should he be elected president, he'll have the federal government give you $1,000 a month, $12,000 a year, no questions asked. In reality, it might not be that simple.\u00a0 Yang's signature policy proposal, the \"Freedom Dividend,\" is a plan to provide what's called a universal basic income (UBI) of $1,000 a month to every American after they turn 18. But his policy asks Americans who already receive certain types of government assistance to forgo their benefits in order to receive cash payments. That particular requirement has raised eyebrows as Yang continues to inch up in the polls, drawing increased scrutiny from the media and voters in the process.\u00a0 At an event in New Hampshire last month, Yang explained the Freedom Dividend's trade-off to a supporter who asked for clarification. \"The freedom dividend stacks on top of Social Security, it stacks on top of anything healthcare related, such as Medicare. It stacks on top of housing assistance,\" Yang replied. \"The things it does not stack on top of are essentially cash and cash like benefits. So this is SNAP, heating oil, other programs that are essentially trying to put cash in your hands to manage an expense.\" Yang has also said repeatedly that the Freedom Dividend would not touch existing benefit programs, and if someone on one of the \"cash like\" programs receives more from that arrangement than his Freedom Dividend they would not be required to switch to UBI. Still, he thinks most people would prefer the dividend. \"The vast majority of the recipients on those programs are getting less than $1,000. They're getting around $500 or $600. And it's restricted. And if you talk to them they live in fear of losing those benefits at any moment, because they are almost always reporting requirements, case managers and administration involved that they're afraid if they don't report or fill out the right form that they're going to lose it,\" Yang told reporters in September.\u00a0 The trade-off is a key part of how a Yang administration would pay for a UBI. As Yang tells it, the government would take the money it saves from people opting out of certain programs and reinvest it into the Freedom Dividend. The campaign also says the broader impact the dividend will have on American society is factored into the price tag. \"Overall,  the cost of the Freedom Dividend will be offset by new revenue, fiscal savings, and economic growth. Areas where we'll see fiscal savings include the reduction of healthcare costs, lower incarceration rates, reduced homelessness, and bureaucratic downsizing.  Additionally, the Freedom Dividend will boost GDP, increase consumer spending, create jobs, and lead to more tax revenue,\" says S.Y. Lee, national press secretary for the Yang campaign.\u00a0   The plan would also be funded through a 10% value added tax (VAT) \u2014 which taxes the value added to a consumer product from the point of origin to the point of sale \u2014 as well as new taxes on financial transactions, carbon emissions, tech companies and disruptive technologies like automation. Yang says the policy is non-partisan and non-ideological, and insists that in a hypothetical Yang administration it would be an easy sell to lawmakers. \"Everyone knows I'm going to have won on the Freedom Dividend,\" Yang told a crowd of supporters in New Hampshire in October. Yang says Democrats will fall in line with their newly elected executive. His plan does seek to tackle the growing inequality gap in the United States and would tangentially have an impact on issues like climate change by taxing carbon.\u00a0 At the same time, Yang says Republicans will also find a lot to like about universal basic income. \"What conservatives don't like is bureaucracies making everyone's decisions for them. They like economic freedom and independence and autonomy on the part of people,\" Yang said. Instead of finding a happy medium between right- and left-wing visions of a UBI, Yang's policy is meeting resistance from UBI advocates from across the political spectrum. \"I think he doesn't necessarily make all the tough decisions that need to be made,\" said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute.\u00a0 Tanner believes a UBI is a preferable alternative to the current welfare system for many of the same reasons as Yang, such as eliminating bureaucracy and disincentives to work. But, he says, he has not found a way to make the numbers add up and takes issue with the Freedom Dividend's funding mechanisms. \"He tries to go a little halfway on this. He wants to cancel out some programs but some programs he'll keep. The net result is this ends up costing a great deal of money - and then he has a number of tax increases to pay for it,\" Tanner said, adding the whole program could cost roughly $3 trillion. For context, the current federal budget is around $4 trillion. The Yang campaign points out that a country with a  GDP close to  $21 trillion has \"the capacity to pay for the Freedom  Dividend,\" but Tanner disagrees.  \"In the end, you can't redistribute wealth that doesn't exist,\" Tanner said UBI advocates on the left, however, think that that wealth does exist. \"We have this money. People are receiving it just because they own stuff, not because they're working,\" says Matt Bruenig, president of the People's Policy Project, a left-wing think tank.\u00a0 Bruenig advocates for universal dividend from the \"socialist angle\" as a redistributive tool. He believes it can be paid for by applying \"focused\" taxes on the capital income of the richest Americans to provide revenue for a common fund. He points out that the\u00a0adjusted net national income\u00a0is more than $16 trillion.  \"About 30 percent of the income that's paid out every year goes to people who own assets, receive stock dividends, earn interest, et cetera. There are a small sliver of people who receive this income, relatively speaking,\" says Bruenig. \"You'd have to take 60 or 70 percent of it, and maybe you'll never get there, but even if you get part of the way there, I'm not a believer in an all-or-nothing '$1,000 a month.\" Like Tanner, Bruenig thinks Yang's plan is not fully developed due to its approach to existing benefit programs. But unlike Tanner, Bruenig believes a UBI should be additive, not a replacement for the welfare state. He also believes Yang's criteria for what programs would stack with his Freedom Dividend, and which ones would not, is not clear or consistent enough. \"What about the earned income tax credit? What about the child tax credit?\" Bruenig says. \"These are refundable credits so you can get them in excess of your tax liability. You might only have $500 in liability but you can get $3,000 in EITC. You're not getting your money back. That's just a straight transfer. It's like food stamps or anything else, it's just administered through the IRS.\" Most UBI plans look to supplement someone's income regardless of whether they work or collect government benefits. In this regard, Yang's plan somewhat more closely resembles the \"negative income tax\" proposed by the right-wing economist Milton Friedman, who looked to replace welfare with a UBI.\u00a0 Others on the left are sympathetic to Yang's plan and agree that the problems it seeks to solve \u2014 such as stagnant wages \u2014 need to be addressed, but that key parts of Yang's plan are deal breakers. \"The people with the lowest income, who need this the most, are not actually going to benefit from it,\" says J.W. Mason, a fellow at the left-leaning Roosevelt Institute.\u00a0 \"It's basically saying the grant will be bigger for higher income folks.\" Mason agrees that some of Yang's requirements would be destructive to people trying to improve their financial situation because it would reduce overall spending on social insurance programs. He also calls the VAT regressive in that it would impose a new tax on everyone regardless of income.\u00a0 \"A 10% VAT for people lower down the income ladder who spend pretty much everything they earn, that's basically a new 10% tax. If you're really getting $12,000 a year, you're probably coming out ahead on balance but you're getting less of a gain than people who save more of their income,\" Mason says. The Yang campaign says the VAT would not apply to \"staples\" like clothes and scaled against luxury goods. The campaign also argues that the boost in consumer spending would offset the VAT's impact. \"While  a VAT by itself might be regressive, a VAT and Freedom Dividend implemented together is progressive,\" says Lee.\u00a0 \"With the VAT helping to finance the Freedom Dividend,  it effectively constitutes a raise or boost in spending power for the bottom 94 percent of Americans. $1,000 a month that goes straight into the hands of low-income Americans will go a lot further than those in higher income brackets.\"   But Mason argues a new tax model is completely unnecessary. \"There's a lot of cost to that kind of tax because it discourages production and employment,\" Mason says. \"We've got a national income tax that actually works pretty well. We just need to stop cutting it for rich people and raise it. We have the whole machinery set up to do that.\" Mason also thinks that the Freedom Dividend itself, like the VAT that funds it, is not entirely necessary. \u00a0 \"There's a lot of things government does well that we need more of in this country, like education, heath care and transportation,\" Mason says, adding, \"It's not clear if you're going to be spending a lot of public money why you would want to just write people checks as opposed to have government do the sort of things that only government can do.\" Some experts also say Yang's narrow emphasis on what amounts to a modest monthly stipend is inadequate given the nation's broader economic challenges, such as\u00a0reversing mounting inequality\u00a0and boosting worker wages.\u00a0 But the Yang campaign argues UBI is an essential part of the solution. \"There  is no silver bullet to the economic challenges we face. However, the Freedom Dividend is a big step in the right direction to ensure every American has a floor upon which to build from,\" says Lee.  \"We need to move to the next stage of capitalism, a human-centered capitalism, where the market serves us instead of the other way around.\" While knocked by some experts, Yang's Freedom Dividend remains central to his growing appeal. Although\u00a0still struggling in the polls, the New York entrepreneur recently raised $10 million for his campaign, outpacing many of his rivals for the Democratic nomination. He also continues to qualify for the Democratic presidential debates, unlike some seasoned lawmakers, including Colorado Senator Michael Bennet and Montana Governor Steve Bullock.\u00a0 Most political observers agree that the chances of Yang winning the Democratic nomination are still very small. But regardless of his electoral chances, it's clear that his UBI proposal resonates with some Americans, and it's helped him cultivate a fiercely devoted fan base. Analysts may balk at the wisdom or feasibility of his Freedom Dividend, but for the time being, Yang has succeeded in giving what was a relatively obscure idea a place on the political stage. Moderators at the fourth Democratic Presidential Debate brought up universal basic income during a discussion about ways to support struggling workers, asking candidates like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker to debate its merits. The idea even received outright support from Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro. \"Our economy functions much better when we have money to spend, where we can participate in the market, where businesses are responsive to us,\" Yang\u00a0recently told CBS Sunday Morning.\u00a0 \"We'll start more businesses. We'll be able to change jobs more easily. So, the money doesn't disappear in our hands. It creates a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up.\"",

Recent polls show Biden with a\u00a0commanding lead in the state, ahead of Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.\u00a0 While the backing will not lend Biden the political muscle of Nevada's\u00a0coveted labor groups\u00a0or\u00a0activists, who have yet to endorse, Titus says she is already organizing events in\u00a0her majority-minority district\u00a0to help grow Biden's support in a key battleground: the urban core of Las Vegas. \"I represent the most ethnically diverse district in the state and there's a large Hispanic population here, mostly from Central America and Mexico. If I thought there was any problem, or my constituents did, with your record in that community, I wouldn't be endorsing you,\" Titus said of Biden on the call. Titus has championed liberal causes during her time in the House,\u00a0eagerly embracing\u00a0Nevada's marijuana legalization, becoming the first of the state's congressional delegation\u00a0to call for impeachment, and cosponsoring\u00a0Medicare for All legislation.\u00a0 \"I'm a proud progressive,\" Titus told CBS News later Monday, asked about the apparent gap between her positions and\u00a0the former vice president. \"When the vice president talks about the public option, I support that. And I see that as the first step towards getting to universal coverage. He's done it before, so I think he has more success in moving us down that line than the other candidates,\" added Titus. Many of Nevada's most prominent Democrats \u2014 including former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and both of the state's current senators \u2014 have pledged not to pick favorites before February 22nd.\u00a0 Of the state's congressional delegation, only Representative Steven Horsford\u00a0has expressed openness\u00a0to making an endorsement ahead of the caucuses.\u00a0 Titus, who endorsed Hillary Clinton before both the state's 2008 and 2016 caucuses,\u00a0had speculated\u00a0as early as last year that she might endorse the former vice president. However, Titus claims she had yet to make up her mind earlier this month when she introduced both Biden and Sanders at events in her district. \"After the last debate and the poll numbers that went up after the last debate, and just thinking it through, I decided that there's no point in waiting any longer. He's the right person at the right time,\" the congresswoman said. CBS News reporter covering public health and the pandemic.",

And neither of those, it seems to me, seizes the moment to pull the nation together.\" Patrick, 63, said on \"CBS This Morning\" in June, that it would be hard to \"break though\" the field of Democrats \"without being a celebrity or sensationalist.\" However, on Thursday, he said \"you can't know if you can break through if you don't get out there and try.\" Making his announcement less than three months before the Iowa caucus, he said his life experiences help him relate to struggling Americans today. \"The anger and anxiety that I hear about and I read about and I see and I witness and listen to in all kind of corners of the country today is familiar to me for the same reasons, having grown up on the South Side of Chicago, the sense that the economy just kind of gets up and kicks you to the curb,\" he said.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \"I've been waiting for a moment like this my whole life,\" he said. \"I don't mean a moment to run for president but a moment when the appetite for big ideas is big enough for the size of the challenges we face in America.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When pressed about his stance on certain issues, Patrick said he doesn't support Medicare For All \"in the terms we've been talking about,\" but supports a public health care option. He said he supports eliminating or vastly reducing student debt, and he thinks taxes should increase for \"the most prosperous and the most fortunate\" citizens. \"I think a wealth tax is \u2014 makes a lot of sense directionally. My idea would be a much, much simpler tax system for everyone where we eliminate all or most of the deductions and we smooth out and simplify the system we have,\" he said. Patrick said he spoke with former President Barack Obama prior to his announcement and both agree that \"we need to reach for the best of America.\" \"Not just the best of our party and not just the best of our supporters, but the best of America,\" Patrick said. \"And that's going to come from a whole lot of people who have checked out and have felt, I think, rightly left out and left back. And what we want to do is bring them back in.\" Patrick has been a CBS News political contributor since September, but in light of his decision, he will no longer serve in that role. Patrick served as Massachusetts governor from 2007 to 2015 and was the U.S. assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division under former President Bill Clinton. He also has held corporate roles, including his most recent position as a managing director at Bain Capital, a private equity firm.",

Cummings said during an appearance on \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" that she and Cummings had discussed her candidacy prior to his death on October 17, at the age of 68. \"I believe very strongly that I have the background and the focus and the commitment and the ability to take the reins and to make a good run for this seat,\" Cummings said. \"I fought right alongside Elijah for the last 12 years and we knew each other another 10 years before that... He wanted me to continue this fight and I'm going to continue this fight and run the race and prayerfully win.\" The news follows Cummings' decision to resign as the chair of the Maryland Democratic Party,\u00a0CBS Baltimore reports. \"I've had a track record of working on issues like social security and Medicare ... I've been working hard in the trenches at every level of government to advance policies that help working families,\" she added. \"And so I am prepared, and I am ready to roll up my sleeves and address what Baltimore needs.\"\u00a0 Elijah Cummings represented the 7th Congressional District in Maryland, which includes Baltimore. Three Republicans and eight Democrats have already filed paperwork indicating their plans to run for the seat. Cummings is expected to formally announce her candidacy at her home Tuesday morning. Elijah Cummings' career spanned decades in Maryland politics. The son of a sharecropper, he rose through the ranks of the Maryland House of Delegates before winning his congressional seat in a special election in 1996. Cummings continued his rise through Congress in the decades that followed, and was an early supporter of Barack Obama's presidential bid in 2008. Cummings was known for advocating for the struggles and needs of inner-city residents. He was a firm believer in some much-debated approaches to help the poor and addicted, including needle exchange programs as a way to reduce the spread of AIDS. Cummings was very popular in his district, where he was a key member of the community.",

            "article_content": "The day after the fourth Democratic presidential debate, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet slammed what he called the \"idiotic\" Democratic National Committee rules that kept him out of last night's contest.\u00a0 \"One of my frustrations about watching people on that debate last night is there are some people on that debate stage polling below me right now,\" Bennet told approximately two dozen voters at an event in New Hampshire.\u00a0 \"They came into the race and they were polling at like 12%. Now they're at zero, one or two percent,\" he added. \"And they're still up there because of the idiotic DNC rules, which makes them seem more viable than I am, but I'm not sure they are. And I'm totally unconvinced that they have a better chance at beating Donald Trump than I do.\" Bennet did not qualify for last night's debate, because he met neither the polling nor the fundraising thresholds.\u00a0 The senator said he has \"thoughts\" about which other candidates might be able to defeat President Trump \u2014 although when asked for specific names, he declined to comment.\u00a0 Bennet did tell CBS News that there were multiple topics missing from last night's showcase, including a detailed discussion of health care. \"What was missing was Elizabeth Warren's explanation for how she's going to pay for 'Medicare for All,'\" he said. \"She's got every plan on the earth but the main plan, which would cost $33 trillion.\" Bennet is the first to admit he's not a \"barn burner\" when it comes to stump speeches. When he met with Barack Obama before launching his presidential bid, Bennet said, the president offered some advice.\u00a0 \"One thing he said was, 'Michael this thing is a circus. You've got to learn to perform in the circus.'\" Bennet recalled, adding \"And I do think there are better circus performers than I.\" But in January 2019, the Colorado senator went viral for targeting his colleague Senator Ted Cruz in a fiery Senate speech centered on 2013's partial government shutdown.\u00a0 That speech, Bennet told voters, demonstrates his ability to take on the current administration and perform when it matters. \"If you watch the speech with Cruz on the floor, I think it will give you a sense of my capabilities to push back on someone who needs to be pushed back on,\" Bennet said. \"Because he's a treasonous mf,\" he added of President Trump. \u00a0 Bennet's face flushed as he recognized the camera in the corner of the room. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I didn't realize, I didn't realize. Can you\u2014\" The senator cut the air with his palm, as though to cancel what he had just said. But the Senator's fiery stump continued. He didn't pull any punches, even when it came to members of his own party. The former superintendent of Denver school district listed his former responsibilities, which included managing a billion-dollar budget. \"For reference, that's about three times the budget of South Bend, Indiana,\" he said, while the audience chuckled. \"I was just picking a place,\" Bennet quipped with a smile. Bennet also reiterated that he regretted missing last night's debate. \"Ninety-nine percent of what people care about is, 'can we beat Donald Trump?'\" he said. \"And that's why I regret so much that I didn't qualify for the debate stage. I got into this thing late.\" To make up for lost time, Bennet said he's \"just going to do town hall after town hall after town hall, answering people's questions. I don't have the money to do anything else. And I enjoy doing it.\" The senator added that he would quit running if he felt he had no chance at securing the nomination. \"I'm not going to stand here and say it's a 50% chance. I don't think anybody's got that big a chance,\" Bennet said. \"I think the field is very fluid. I think the leading candidates have different weaknesses. Some of that may get revealed over time.\" According to the latest CBS News survey of 16,500 registered voters, Bennet holds steady at 1%, with 4% of likely Democratic voters considering the candidate. Bennet earned 0% of support from respondents in New Hampshire.\u00a0 Bennet raised $2.1 million in the third quarter, with $1.8 million cash on hand. He contended Wednesday that he holds the fourth lowest burn rate \u2014 total money spent divided by total money raised \u2014 of any candidate.\u00a0 But according to a CBS News tally, Bennet has the tenth lowest burn rate, behind candidates including Andrew Yang, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders.\u00a0 Currently, Bennet said he is \"spending a bunch of money on Iowa television right now to try and drive up my numbers there.\" He argued his team is creating a \"catcher's mitt\" in New Hampshire, should he break out of Iowa on top.\u00a0 If he falls short in the \"first in the nation\" states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Bennet admitted that his path will become murkier. \"If I don't do well in Iowa or New Hampshire,\" he said, \"it's going to be hard for me to continue on.\" CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

            "article_content": "Almost 70 million retirees will see a 1.6% cost-of-living increase from Social Security in 2020, an uptick with potential political consequences in an election year when Democrats are pushing for more protection from inflation. The increase amounts to $24 a month for the average retired worker, according to estimates released Thursday by the Social Security Administration. With the adjustment, the estimated average monthly Social Security payment for a retired worker will be $1,503 a month starting in January. Following a significant boost this year, the cost-of-living adjustment for 2020 reverts to its pattern of moderate gains. But seniors and advocates complain that the inflation yardstick used to determine the annual adjustment doesn't adequately reflect their costs, mainly for health care. The adjustment affects household budgets for about 1 in 5 Americans and that includes Social Security recipients, disabled veterans and federal retirees. The criticism of the adjustment formula has been taken up by Democratic presidential candidates and congressional Democrats.\u00a0 \"Most of the discussion about Social Security is about how can we promise more rather than how can we keep the promises we're already making,\" said conservative retirement policy expert Charles Blahous, a former public trustee of Social Security. Social Security is financed by a 12.4 percent tax on wages, with half paid by workers and the other half paid by employers. Next year, the maximum amount of earnings subject to the Social Security tax will increase from $132,900 to $137,700.  About 177 million workers pay Social Security taxes. Most private pensions do not provide a COLA, but Social Security has featured inflation protection since 1975. Beneficiaries also gain from compounding since COLAs become part of their underlying benefit, the base for future cost-of-living increases. Joe Schiavone, who retired from flooring sales and lives on Florida's Space Coast, said it feels like he's not keeping up. \"My biggest concern is that your money is buying less and less,\" said Schiavone, who's in his early 80s. \"The figure that they use for the rise in the cost of living to me is very erroneous.\" Schiavone points to increased health care premiums and copays, along with other kinds of insurance costs, as the main culprits. He expects that part of his adjustment for 2020 will be eaten up by an increase in Medicare's \"Part B\" premium for outpatient care, which hasn't been announced yet. Democrats are working to convince older people they have their backs on Social Security. Voters age 65 and older went 53% for Donald Trump and 44% for Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. Now, Democrats are aiming to recapture older voters. Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are proposing to use a measure of inflation that reflects expenses for households headed by a person 62 or older. The leading Social Security overhaul plan in Congress from Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., would also switch to the new measure. Richard Johnson of the Urban Institute think tank said the measure Social Security uses reflects workers, not retirees.\u00a0 \"If the goal is to maintain seniors' living standards, then the cost-of-living adjustment is going to fall short if it doesn't measure seniors' spending,\" he said. But former program trustee Blahous said even the current inflation measure is too generous, because it doesn't take into account that when prices go up, many people look for cheaper goods.\u00a0",

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she felt compelled to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary because it was the \"most authentic decision to let people know how I feel.\" The rising progressive star spoke to CBS News' Nikole Killion in an interview before the rally in Queens, New York, on Saturday where Ocasio-Cortez formally endorsed Sanders.  Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged that it was early to make an endorsement in the primary process, but she said her support was not motivated by political strategy. Saturday's rally is Sanders' first campaign event since returning to the trail after suffering from a heart attack\u00a0October 2.\u00a0  \"Some folks try to make these decisions by making political calculations and looking at political strategy but I think for me... it's coming from an authentic place,\" Ocasio-Cortez told Killion. She also reflected on her meteoric rise to politics, from a bartender to one of the best-known Democrats in the House.  \"Last February, I was waitressing at a restaurant in downtown Manhattan and I didn't have health insurance and I wasn't being paid a living wage, and I was facing sexual harassment at work,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"To think now that I'm on the other side of this as a member of Congress and understanding the pressures there are on inside to conform and to have seen them and experienced them firsthand \u2014 it's astounded me, frankly, that the senator has been there fighting for me long before I got to the halls of Congress and fighting for people like me.\"  Ocasio-Cortez was an organizer in Sanders' 2016 primary campaign. Sanders told Killion that it was \"very significant\" to have Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement, given her rising profile in the Democratic Party.  \"It's very significant. Alexandria has been a political phenomenon. It is hard to believe that she has been in office less than one year and yet she has helped transform politics in America,\" Sanders said. Since entering office, Ocasio-Cortez has pushed for policies like \"Medicare for All\" and the Green New Deal.  \"She has been an inspiration to millions of working people and young people throughout this country and her addition to this campaign is very, very significant. We're delighted to have her on board,\" Sanders said.  Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

Sanders' campaign said more than 25,000 attended the rally, making it the largest rally so far for a Democrat in the 2020 campaign.\u00a0 Ocasio-Cortez was a 26-year-old organizer for Sanders' unlikely presidential campaign in 2016. A few years later, she's a freshman congresswoman who has rapidly become a progressive star, and Sanders can hardly be considered an underdog in the primary race. One thing, however, has not changed: Ocasio-Cortez's support for Sanders' presidential aspirations. Saturday's rally intended to showcase Sanders' robust return to campaigning after the 78-year-old suffered a heart attack earlier this month. It is also proof that Ocasio-Cortez believes Sanders' vision is the right one for the country.\u00a0 In her speech endorsing Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez recalled her days working as a bartender, and said that Sanders' progressive policies inspired her to recognize her \"inherent value as a human being.\" \"It wasn't until I heard of a man by the name of\u00a0 Bernie Sanders that I began to question and assert and recognize my inherent value as a human being that deserves health care, housing, education, and a living wage,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. Ocasio-Cortez later posted a video on Twitter announcing her endorsement.\u00a0 Today I am endorsing Senator @BernieSanders for president.In the end, we must come together to defeat Donald Trump. We should do so knowing he is a symptom of a larger problem - and our greatest hope is a multiracial, working class movement in the United States of America. pic.twitter.com/9fiTS7FTX9 Although Sanders has consistently out-raised other candidates \u2014 his campaign received over $25 million in the third quarter \u2014 he is not considered the frontrunner. His polling numbers have remained consistently high, but has not achieved the kind of momentum seen with Senator Elizabeth Warren.\u00a0 Warren's numbers have exceeded those of former Vice President Joe Biden in recent polls. Warren and Biden are generally considered co-frontrunners, a position solidified by the Democratic debate on Tuesday. Warren and Sanders share several policy positions, including Warren's support for Medicare for All, a policy popularized by Sanders in the 2016 campaign. With Ocasio-Cortez's endorsement, Sanders intends to signal to progressives in the Democratic Party that he, not Warren, is the right person to represent the left in the Democratic primary. Sanders has also been endorsed by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, another freshman congresswoman and rising progressive star in the Democratic Party.

Bennet, who has not qualified for the next Democratic primary debate, spoke to CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett for this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast. \"It's my guarantee,\" Bennet said. \"How does that sound?\" Bennet, a self-described \"pragmatic idealist,\" criticized his fellow candidates who are running to the left, saying that ideas such as \"Medicare for Al\"l could put off moderate voters. \"Donald Trump could get another term as president. And that's not just bad for the Democratic Party \u2014 that's terrible for America,\" Bennet said. Bennet also responded to a question about the whistleblower complaint alleging that President Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Joe Biden and his son. He called Mr. Trump a \"grifter\" and accused him of \"extorting\" Ukraine. \"I think he feels completely unconstrained by the rule of law,\" said Bennet. \"The president takes the view that whatever he can get away with is what's appropriate.\" Bennet spoke with Garrett on Tuesday, a few hours before Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the launch of a formal impeachment inquiry. It was also recorded before the White House released a summary of the call with Zelensky, before the whistleblower complaint was made public, and before acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House and Senate Intelligence Committees about the complaint. When asked by Garrett whether he supported opening a formal impeachment inquiry into the president, Bennet said he hasn't decided yet. \"I haven't made up my mind on anything. I'd like to see the report,\" Bennet said, referring to the complaint. Bennet told MSNBC later on Tuesday evening that the House was \"right\" to open an impeachment inquiry. Bennet also hit back at Mr. Trump for calling Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, corrupt. \"He's a grifter,\" Bennet said. \"This is his pattern of approaching things like this, and it's to obscure the truth, to lie about it, and then to point in another direction.\" For more of Major's conversation with Michael Bennet, download \"The Takeout\" podcast on\u00a0\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0GooglePlay,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher.

            "article_content": "In the post-debate spin room after the third Demcoratic debate, CBS News' Ed O'Keefe pressed Juli\u00e1n Castro on his line of attack against Joe Biden, perhaps the most memorable exchange of the night. Castro accused Biden of contradicting himself and wondered whether the former vice president's memory was failing him in what appeared to many to be an attack on Biden's age. \"Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\u00a0 I mean, I can't believe that you said two minutes ago that they had to buy in and now you're saying they don't have to buy in,\" Castro said to Biden. \"You're forgetting that.\"\u00a0 On stage, Pete Buttigieg scolded Castro, saying, \"This reminds everybody of what they cannot stand about Washington. \"That's called an election, Pete,\" Castro retorted. O'Keefe pointed out that some of Castro's rivals' campaigns called his attack \"disqualifying\" and a \"low blow.\"\u00a0 \"This wasn't about personalities. This was about a difference in health care policy,\" Castro argued. He explained that the debate in Detroit, Kamala Harris had said Biden's health care plan would leave 10 million people uncovered. Castro asserted that media fact checkers agreed. \"This was a conversation about why he's denying saying that you would have to 'buy in,\"' Castro said. \"If you lose your job, you would automatically 'buy in\"' and \"not everybody can buy into a plan,\" he told O'Keefe.\u00a0 Castro reiterated that his approach would cover more people because they'd be automatically covered, and he said Biden's approach \u2014 \"buying in\" \u2014 means the former vice president's plan would leave 10 million people uncovered because many would not be able to afford to buy insurance. That's why, Castro said, it was \"really important for me to zero in on that.\"\u00a0 So, as he remembered it, \"When [Biden] denied saying 'buy in,' I said, 'Didn't you just say \"buy in\" \u2014 like two minutes ago?\"' O'Keefe pulled up the transcript of the debate on his phone and read it to Castro: \"He does say here that anyone who can't afford it gets automatically enrolled in the Medicare-type option we have.\" Then later on, O'Keefe noted, Biden said that if you lose your insurance from your employer you could automatically \"buy into this.\" \"That's right \u2013 he said you would have to buy into it,\" Castro said.\u00a0 \"I said, 'You just said you would have to buy into it, and because of that, it leaves people uncovered.' He said, 'I didn't say buy in.' I said, 'Yes, you did say \"buy in,\" you just said that, did you forget you said that?' So this was a conversation about why he's saying he's denying saying you would have to buy in. That is factual, that is not something that wasn't grounded in fact.\"\u00a0 When O'Keefe noted that other candidates who'd attacked Biden -- Eric Swalwell and Kirsten Gillibrand are two examples -- are no longer running, Castro remarked, \"That's what a debate is for.\"\u00a0 \"So I would say to Democrats out there, when we go up against Donald Trump in October of 2020 on the debate stage, look, you'd better come ready to prove your point,\" Castro said. \"I'm always ready to prove my point. I did it in a respectful way, I did it about healthcare policy, but I proved my point. And if I'm on that debate stage against Donald Trump, I'm going to get the better of Donald Trump, too. \"",

            "article_content": "More than 11,000 attendees showed up for burgers and face time with 17 presidential candidates at the Democratic Polk County Steak Fry in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday. Although 18 Democratic candidates were initially expected to attend, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio dropped out\u00a0of the presidential race on Friday morning. Organizers grilled 10,500 steaks for attendees on Saturday, along with 1,000 vegan burgers. There is only one vegan candidate in the presidential race: Senator Cory Booker. Former Congressman Beto O'Rourke kicked off the speeches by talking about his mandatory gun buyback plan, saying he won't let \"PACs, NRA, or even fellow Democrats tell us what is and what is not possible.\" He led the crowd in a chant of \"hell yes,\" his signature comment from the third debate as he walked off stage. Senator Kamala Harris, whose campaign announced this week will focus heavily on Iowa, opened by joking, \"I don't know if you guys heard, but I'm planning on moving\" to the state. She said she has a \"winning strategy that addresses challenges that wake people up in the middle of the night.\" McDonald's workers joined her at her pre-steak fry rally.\u00a0 Despite the dire news from Booker's campaign earlier Saturday that he would have to drop out of the race if he didn't raise $1.7 million by the end of September, the New Jersey senator gave an impassioned speech that focused on rising above hatred. He touched on his family's history in Iowa, health care and beating President Trump. He ended his speech with the call, \"We will rise!\" Former Vice President Joe Biden did not mention reports that Mr. Trump repeatedly tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his son, Hunter. This interaction with Zelensky may be the subject of a\u00a0whistleblower report\u00a0to the inspector general of the intelligence community that the Trump administration has refused to provide to Congress.\u00a0 South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who notably lobbed public jabs at O'Rourke and Senator Elizabeth Warren earlier this week, said the Democrats \"can't get caught up in purity tests.\" He got one of the largest receptions from the crowd. But later, at another Iowa event, the audience chanted \"Medicare for all\" while Buttigieg tried to tout his \"Medicare for all who want it\" plan, which he introduced this week. Grace Segers and Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "CBSN DOTCOM CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice reported on the Biden campaign's claim that the Trump campaign is trying to poach its online donors. In a fundraising email sent to supporters Thursday, the Biden campaign pointed out that if someone types \"donate Joe Biden\" into a Google search, the first link to appear is one that directs them to donate to Donald J. Trump for President. Here's her report. The Nevada caucuses, which are the third presidential Democratic nominating contest, are less than six months away, and Democratic presidential candidates are ramping up efforts to court a mammoth Las Vegas labor union that has played an important role in the caucus outcome in the past. CBS News campaign reporter Alexander Tin reported on the fight for the support of the influential Culinary Union, which played a key role in the 2008 campaign.\u00a0 PETE BUTTIGIEG South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg\u00a0released a plan\u00a0to expand mental health services and to combat addiction Friday morning, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Nicole Sganga and Jack Turman. The policy sets the goal to prevent one million \"deaths of despair,\" which includes deaths due to drugs, alcohol and suicide, by 2028.\u00a0 Buttigieg's plan also aims to provide mental health care and addiction treatment to at least 75% people who need care or treatment by the end of Buttigieg's first term in office and to break the stigma associated with mental illness and addiction.\u00a0 \"We need to make it as normal and as okay to talk about mental health issues as it is to talk about physical health issues,\" Buttigieg told\u00a0Sganga\u00a0in an interview in New Hampshire.\u00a0 The plan earned the praise from Andy Slavitt, who was the Acting Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from 2015-2017.\u00a0 \"With a declining life expectancy and evidence of addiction and despair affecting so many communities, Pete's plan is hopeful, specific, and comprehensive,\" Slavitt said in an email statement. \"He turns the page ahead of the current national debate (how to cover more people) and to one of the biggest holes that we have \u2014 our deeply underfunded, under resourced mental health care system.\" TULSI GABBARD Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's campaign released a memorandum calling for transparency in the Democratic National Committee's debate requirements, says\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. The memo says that decisions on debate qualifications \"should not be made in secret by party bosses.\"\u00a0 Gabbard added, \"For the sake of democracy, those decisions must be made openly, with clear and consistent standards and a sufficient window of opportunity for candidates to demonstrate genuine grassroots momentum and enthusiasm.\"\u00a0 To qualify for fall presidential debates, candidates need to meet the 130,000 unique donor requirement and receive at least 2% in four DNC-approved polls. Gabbard has met the donor threshold and has received 2% in two DNC-approved polls. KAMALA HARRIS The campaign's South Carolina spokesperson confirmed Erika Alexander, known as \"Maxine\" on the 1990s sitcom \"Living Single,\" will be joining the Harris campaign for a happy hour chat on LGBTQ equality.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0says the chat is one of two events the Harris campaign is participating in on Friday and Saturday as part of the 14th Annual South Carolina Black Pride Week.\u00a0 Harris herself is not expected to be in South Carolina, but her husband Doug Emhoff will be. Emhoff is expected to make an appearance at Clemson University to help kick off the campaign's organizing efforts on college campuses across the Palmetto State. The senator will be in neighboring North Carolina this weekend.\u00a0 DOWN SOUTH In one of the first stops of the \"Open for Business\" tour\u00a0launched\u00a0by the RNC and Trump Victory operation, South Carolina business owners met with congressional, state, and local leaders to discuss the economy.\u00a0 CBS News Campaign Reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0notes the state's unemployment rate has been on a\u00a0downward trend\u00a0since 2011. Today it's around 3.5%, and small business owner Scott Maxwell says it's in large part because the economy under President Trump is working.\u00a0 \"For the first time in my adult life I've actually received a reduced tax break and tax incentives\u2026I was able to buy more equipment and hire more people,\" said Maxwell. \"Small business owners like myself [are] typically all in \u2014 win or fail \u2014 and we're the people in America that really need those breaks because if I can build one more house\u2026it impacts so many people.\"\u00a0 OUT WEST A number of candidates were in California today for remarks at the DNC's Summer Meeting in San Francisco. But according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin, only a handful of candidates \u2013 Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 are campaigning at public events, in addition to their stop at the party cattle call.\u00a0 With its move this cycle up to Super Tuesday, some Californians could cast ballots in their massive primary as early as\u00a0February. But despite some massive turnouts at events for some of the top-polling candidates in the California, few campaigns have yet to make serious investments in organizing the Golden State beyond hiring a handful of staffers. TOUGH TALK While the Democratic National Committee is holding its summer meeting in San Francisco, several presidential candidates took time there to criticize the DNC over its fall debate requirements which could keep the majority of contenders off the debate stage in September, says\u00a0CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice.\u00a0 \"The DNC process is stifling debate at a time when we need it most,\" Senator Michael Bennet told the room with DNC Chairman Tom Perez sitting right behind him. \"If we wanted to be the party that excluded people, we'd be Republicans.\"\u00a0 After leaving the podium he went on the slam the time constraints, arguing they limit real debate on issues. Bennet has yet to meet the fall debate requirements.\u00a0 Congressman Seth Moulton, who announced he's dropping out of the race today, also slammed the DNC rules that kept him of the debate stage for both rounds of debates so far. Moulton said there are a lot of important perspectives being left out because of the system the DNC set up.\u00a0 Marianne Williamson, when asked, said there was too much mystery around the polling for her taste. Candidates have until August 28 to reach the 130,000 donor threshold and 2% in four qualifying polls to take part in the next debate in Houston. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0",

            "article_content": "John Hickenlooper\u00a0announced Thursday that he is ending his bid for the presidency.\u00a0 In a three-minute video posted to YouTube, the former Colorado governor said that while he had enjoyed campaigning for the presidency, it was was now time to bow out. He also teased a possible run for U.S. Senate against Republican incumbent Cory Gardner.\u00a0 \"I've heard from so many Coloradans who want me to run for the United States Senate. They remind me how much is at stake for our country and our state. I intend to give that some serious thought,\" Hickenlooper said in the video. Numerous national Democrats have encouraged Hickenlooper for months to end his longshot race for the presidency and run against Gardner instead.\u00a0 Hickenlooper, 67, a onetime Denver mayor and businessman and geologist by training, served as Colorado governor from 2011 to 2019. He has repeatedly said along the campaign trail, \"I'm the only candidate in this race who's actually achieved the big, progressive things politicians in Washington are talking about.\" \u00a0 Colorado is one of the top targets in Democrats' efforts to flip the Senate in this next election. The party needs to pick up three seats if President Trump loses reelection and four if he wins. Republicans are defending 22 out of the 34 seats on the map for the cycle. Only two of the 22 seats are in states Hillary Clinton won in 2016: Colorado and Maine.\u00a0 Hickenlooper launched his presidential campaign\u00a0five months ago. A relative moderate, Hickenlooper struggled to have a breakout moment on the campaign trail, but has sparred repeatedly with Bernie Sanders over positions some of the Vermont senator's progressive proposals, such as \"Medicare for All.\"\u00a0 In July, six senior staffers left Hickenlooper's campaign. He also struggled to raise the money necessary to make him competitive in the crowded Democratic presidential field.\u00a0 Hickenlooper has said that he did not thing running for the Senate was his \"calling,\" but had hedged on the issue in recent days. Eleven Democrats are already running in the Colorado primary, although a number of polls indicate that Hickenlooper could mount the most serious challenge to Gardner.\u00a0 Ed O'Keefe contributed reporting.\u00a0",

The lineup was revealed during a drawing of names Thursday night.\u00a0 The announcement comes one day after the Democratic National Committee announced the 20 presidential candidates who qualified the second debate.\u00a0Here's what it looks like. FROM THE CANDIDATES KAMALA HARRIS Kamala Harris' campaign announced a five-day bus tour across Iowa from Sioux City to Davenport August 8-12. It will include stops at the Iowa State Fair and the Wing Ding in Clear Lake on August 9.\u00a0 Her campaign says it has seen momentum in Iowa and is using the tour to capitalize and build on that. The tour will also kick off the next phase of the campaign, with longer swings and more stops after the second debate in Detroit later this month.\u00a0 \"Over the last several months, the momentum around Kamala has grown exponentially, and we are super excited about folks coming on board to join our team, to be volunteers, and to be Kamala Captains,\" Kamala Harris Iowa campaign chair Deidre DeJear said in a statement to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. \"This five-day bus tour stint is going to be a phenomenal opportunity for her to meet even more Iowans, both in rural and urban parts of the state.\" Meanwhile\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Stephanie Ramirez\u00a0writes today that Sen. Kamala Harris is laughing off critics who say that she's struggled to articulate a clear health care policy. When asked about the confusion surrounding her stance on the issue in an interview with CNN on Wednesday, the 2020 presidential candidate chuckled, saying, \"There's a lot that you're building into this question that's not accurate.\" But despite that assertion, Harris has had to clarify her stance on \"Medicare for All\" several times since the start of the year. Stephanie has a rundown of what Harris has said about her support for expanding government-run healthcare and how she would pay for it.\u00a0 AMY KLOBUCHAR Amy Klobuchar announced a whopping nine New Hampshire state endorsements today.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says new Granite State backers include executive councilor Debora Pignatelli (Nashua), Former Ambassador Jim Smith (Salem), Former New Hampshire Attorney General Joe Foster (Nashua), Fmr. Representative Ricia McMahon (Sutton), Fmr. chief of staff to Governor Jeanne Shaheen and Governor John Lynch Rich Siegel, community leader Helen Honorow, Attorney Michael Atkins, community advocate Jim Callahan and business executive Tom Silvia.\u00a0 \"We are honored to welcome this group of esteemed individuals to Senator Klobuchar's team,\" Scott Merrick, New Hampshire state director, said in a statement. \"They are all proven leaders in both their professional lines of work, and communities in which they reside, and we are grateful for their support of our growing campaign. STATELY COVERAGE IN THE MIDDLE Today, a group of 10 Iowa organizations sent a\u00a0joint letter\u00a0to the state's congressional delegation urging it to ensure continued funding for two healthcare programs: the Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) program and Federally Qualified Healthcare Centers (FQHCs) by supporting\u00a0the CHIME Act, reports\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar.\u00a0The Medicaid DSH program provides support to Iowa hospitals that serve a high number of Medicaid beneficiaries and uninsured patients, while FQHCs are community clinics that serve patients even if they don't have the ability to pay.\u00a0 The letter asks Congress to delay scheduled cuts to the DSH program, adding up to more than $6.5 million in cuts to Iowa hospitals. The group also asks for extended funding for FQHCs. Among the signatories to the letter is Progress Iowa, which held its Corn Feed event last weekend, where 10 presidential candidates gave remarks. The Des Moines Register also released the\u00a0schedule\u00a0for its Political Soap Box at the Iowa State Fair, according to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. Candidates will each get 20 minutes to make their case to Iowans at the annual summer event while people fill up on pork chops, corn, and fried foods of all varieties. Joe Biden and Steve Bullock kick things off on August 8, the first day of the fair.\u00a0 JUST FOR FUN CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman\u00a0notes that\u00a0eleven Democratic presidential candidates submitted their favorite movies to\u00a0E! News. Harris said her favorite movie is\u00a0My Cousin Vinny, and Julian Castro revealed his favorite is\u00a0The Breakfast Club. Pete Buttigieg listed a few movies, including\u00a0The Godfather,\u00a0Arrival\u00a0and\u00a0Dr. Strangelove. Seth Moulton and Cory Booker said they favor\u00a0Star Wars.

            "article_content": "Two years after young progressive Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez shook the national Democratic Party by defeating former New York Rep. Joe Crowley in a primary, several longtime New York City area representatives are facing primary challenges \u2014 and being the establishment candidate may not be enough to see them through. Reps. Eliot Engel, Jerry Nadler and Nita Lowey are three New York metropolitan area candidates facing primary challenges in 2020. Jamaal Bowman, a Bronx middle school principal and one of three candidates challenging the 16-term Engel, has been endorsed by Justice Democrats, the group that helped propel Ocasio-Cortez to power. Nadler, the powerful chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is also facing three primary challengers, including former state official Lindsey Boylan, who raised over a quarter of a million dollars in the second quarter of 2019. Mondaire Jones, a 32-year-old who worked in the Obama Justice Department, is challenging Lowey, the chair of the House Appropriations Committee. Jones supports many ideas that have been championed by Ocasio-Cortez, like Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage and the Green New Deal. Jones also supports the cancellation of student debt. \"We need a fighter in Washington and we have not had that, especially in recent years,\" Jones told CBS News in an interview. Lowey, who is 82, has been in office for over 25 years. \"I don't think Nita has been fighting nearly enough for this district,\" Jones continued, adding that he didn't believe Lowey could relate to the struggles exhibited by many of the lower income residents in her district as one of the wealthier members of the House. Jones said that he was \"encouraged by the overwhelming show of support\" for his campaign, which he launched last week. \"People like to see folks who have a story like mine,\" Jones said, saying that he had never been in politics before, but wanted to come back to his community and advocate for it in Congress. Ocasio-Cortez was not the only young, progressive primary candidate challenging a longtime establishment representative in 2018. Adem Bunkeddeko nearly unseated Rep. Yvette Clarke a few districts over in Brooklyn, and Suraj Patel launched a credible challenge to Manhattan and Queens Rep. Carolyn Maloney. It's unclear if Bunkeddeko and Patel will run again in 2020, but their near-victories may also have inspired new candidates to consider primary challenges. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the fourth highest ranking Democrat in the House, is also a potential target for a primary challenge. Politico reported last year that Ocasio-Cortez was eyeing Jeffries as a target for a primary challenge. Jeffries is considered to be a potential future speaker of the House \u2014 as was Crowley. New York Rep. Gregory Meeks may also face as a primary challenge. The wave of insurgent progressive challengers in New York City crested with Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, a young queer Latina woman who ran for Queens District Attorney against establishment candidate Melinda Katz, who had the support of Jeffries and Meeks. It is still unclear whether Cab\u00e1n or Katz won the election, and recounts are underway. Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Here's what you need to know in politics this week... THE WATER'S EDGE Via Bo Erickson:\u00a0Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign accused President Trump of \"coddling\" dictators in his meetings with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, Russian President\u00a0Vladimir Putin\u00a0and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan while overseas. \"President Trump's coddling of dictators at the expense of American national security and interests is one of the most dangerous ways he's diminishing us on the world stage and subverting our values as a nation,\" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement to CBS News.\u00a0 The president held a\u00a0last-minute meeting\u00a0with Kim in the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea on Sunday, becoming the first sitting president to set foot on North Korean soil. His meeting with Kim came after the G20 summit in Japan, where he met with Putin and Erdogan. Read the full story here.\u00a0 MONEYBALL: HERE COME THE 2ND QUARTER FILINGS Via Sarah Ewall-Wice:\u00a0Sunday is the final day before the FEC's second quarter closes, and presidential candidates are making last-ditch efforts to raise funds before midnight. For some presidential hopefuls, this will be their first quarterly filing since launching their campaigns; for others, the filing will indicate whether they've been able to maintain or build momentum since the first quarter of 2019.\u00a0 Nearly every candidate has been blasting out fundraising emails and social media posts throughout the weekend in order to raise cash. And one thing clearly on the minds of a number of campaigns is the 130,000 donors needed to qualify for the Democratic debate in September.\u00a0 Last week, the first round of debates gave several Democratic presidential candidates a boost towards their second quarter fundraising goals. Kamala Harris, in particular, raised over $2 million online and brought in 30,000 new donors in the 24 hours after her debate performance. Cory Booker, Julian Castro and Jay Inslee also touted increases in donations after the debates.\u00a0 By CBS News' count, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke have all surpassed the 130,000 donor mark. On Friday, Andrew Yang announced he met the qualification as well. Meanwhile, Booker, Amy Klobuchar, John Hickenlooper and Julian Castro have all sent out fundraising emails this week alone saying how they are still working towards the goal.\u00a0 Meanwhile, some candidates -- including Sanders and Warren -- are noting that they're not attending big-dollar fundraisers ahead of the quarter closing. That's in contrast with candidates like Biden, who spent Friday and Saturday at fundraisers on the West Coast. According to the pool, tickets for the events cost as much as $2800 per person to attend. Buttigieg, Booker and Harris have also attended big-dollar events in recent weeks.\u00a0 Some candidates are likely to release their cash totals in the coming days, but every presidential hopeful has a July 15th FEC filing deadline. At that time, we'll all find out who has raked in big bucks -- and who is going to have to start pinching pennies heading into the late summer and early fall.\u00a0 DE BLASIO: MEDICARE FOR ALL MUST COVER SEX REASSIGNMENT\u00a0 Via Zak Hudak: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the New York Pride March on Sunday that Medicare for All should cover sex reassignment surgery. \"We have to respect everyone's medical needs,\" he said. It's a commitment that sets de Blasio apart on the Democratic primary hot bottom issue of single-payer healthcare.\u00a0 The mayor also said that as president he would restore benefits to veterans forced to leave the military because of their sexual orientation.\u00a0 THE DEMOCRATS DATA SHIFT Via Eleanor Watson: At the Democratic National Committee's Executive Committee meeting in Pittsburgh over the weekend, Chief Technology Officer Nell Thomas and Deputy Chief Technology Officer Kat Atwater told members they are in a sprint to transfer the DNC's data warehouse from the previous system -- called Vertica -- to Google BigQuery by mid-July. Thomas said that Google BigQuery will be able to support thousands of campaigns without going down, which was a problem in previous cycles.

            "article_content": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders offered a full-throated defense of democratic socialism in a speech in Washington on Wednesday, invoking the legacy of President Franklin D. Roosevelt to call for a \"21st Century Bill of Rights.\" \"Over 80 years ago Franklin Delano Roosevelt helped create a government that made transformative progress in protecting the needs of working families,\" Sanders told the crowd at George Washington University. \"Today, in the second decade of the 21st century, we must take up the unfinished business of the New Deal and carry it to completion.\" Sanders said his vision of democratic socialism requires \"the moral conviction to choose a different path, a higher path, a path of compassion, justice and love.\" \"We must recognize that in the 21st century, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, economic rights are human rights,\" he said. \"That is what I mean by democratic socialism.\" Many of Sanders' proposals, including Medicare for all, free public college and a $15 minimum wage, fall under the umbrella of democratic socialism. Those policies were the centerpieces of Sanders' 2016 campaign \u2014 he gave a similar\u00a0speech\u00a0in November 2015 defending democratic socialism. Since his previous run for president, \"socialism\" has increased in popularity. A 2018\u00a0Gallup\u00a0poll found that 37% of Americans viewed socialism favorably, an increase of two percentage points from 2016. Conversely, 47% of Democrats viewed capitalism positively, down from 56% in 2016. And while socialism was significantly less popular than capitalism and free enterprise, it was the only one of those three that increased in popularity nationally between 2016 and 2018. Adding more wind to Sanders' sails, earlier this week a\u00a0Harris\u00a0poll found that 55% of women between the ages of 18 and 54 would prefer to live in a socialist country over a capitalist country. But Mr. Trump has wielded the label as a weapon, often\u00a0linking\u00a0Democrats to socialism on Twitter and to the press. Sanders addressed that criticism directly in Wednesday's speech. \"While President Trump and his fellow oligarchs attack us for our support of democratic socialism, they don't really oppose all forms of socialism,\" Sanders said. \"They may hate democratic socialism because it benefits working people, but they absolutely love corporate socialism that enriches Trump and other billionaires.\" Sanders said the president \"believes in corporate socialism for the rich and powerful. I believe in a democratic socialism that works for the working families of this country.\" The Vermont independent said his 21st Century Bill of Rights would establish that every American, regardless of income, has a right to a job with a living wage, health care, education, affordable housing, a clean environment and a secure retirement. While Sanders embraced the term on Wednesday in Washington, he has seldom directly referenced it on the campaign trail. He made no mention of democratic socialism in his campaign kickoff remarks in March, nor in his campaign announcement video. Last month, at a senior citizens\u00a0town hall\u00a0in Henderson, Nevada, a woman wished for Sanders to be more direct. \"Please stress that socialism is not communism. That's very, very important that you stress that,\" she said. The senator replied, \"Thank you. I will, as a matter of fact.\" Some of Sanders' challengers rivals for the nomination explicitly reject his embrace of the democratic socialist label. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney told CBS News that Sanders is being \"intellectually dishonest\" pitching democratic socialism. \"I'm a full-throated capitalist,\" Delaney said. \"What the United States of America is, is a free market economy. Where capitalism is able to work its magic, which is to innovate and create jobs.\" Earlier this month, former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper was raucously booed at the California Democratic Party State Convention after saying, \"Socialism is not the answer.\" Four days later, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, himself a candidate, defended Hickenlooper. \"If John would have said that speech here [on Wall Street] he probably would have gotten a big cheer from these capitalists here,\" Bennet told the news Cheddar. \"It's different from San Francisco.\" \"There's a Twitter universe out there that has move extremely far left. I think that is different from the base of the party,\" Bennet said. Neither Hickenlooper, Bennet nor Delaney have surpassed 1% support in any national poll this year. While Sanders' defense of democratic socialism clearly distinguishes himself from moderates running \u2014 including front-runner Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 it too gives the senator a chance to stake his claim on progressive turf that will be threatened by candidates like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has recently enjoyed a bump in polling. CBS News reporter covering climate change and energy.",

            "article_content": "Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet is the latest Democratic contender to enter the packed field of 2020 hopefuls, announcing on \"CBS This Morning\" on Thursday that he's running for president.\u00a0 \"My plan is to run for president,\" Bennet told \"CBS This Morning\" co-anchor John Dickerson. \"I think this country faces two enormous challenges, one is a lack of economic mobility and opportunity for most Americans and the other is the need to restore integrity to our government.\" Bennet, 54, overcame a bout with prostate cancer earlier this year. He was diagnosed in April and quickly underwent surgery, which his office said was \"completely successful\" and would require no further treatment. He told CBS his diagnosis was \"very clarifying\", saying he was disappointed at the possibility of never being able to run. \u00a0 \"That gave me a chance to think about whether I really wanted to run or not,\" he said. While he faces an uphill fundraising battle with his delayed entry into the already jam-packed field, Bennet is optimistic about his political future. \"I wouldn't do it if I didn't think I had a chance to win,\" Bennet, the 22nd Democrat to enter the race, told The Colorado Independent shortly after his diagnosis. \"I think, like everyone else does, it's a long shot. But I think everyone in the field is a long shot.\" Asked about the packed field of challengers he now faces, Bennet told CBS that it's \"phenomenal we have an array of candidates that we have\" calling it a \"competition of ideas.\" \"The Democratic party doesn't stand for very much at the national level with respect to what the American people think,\" argued Bennet. \"A process like this is long overdue in the Democratic party.\" In a nearly 4-minute long campaign video released Thursday morning titled \"7,591 words\" (a nod to the word count of the U.S. Constitution) Bennet makes the case that \"politics and governing aren't the same thing.\" \"When campaigning never stops, governing never begins,\" he adds.\u00a0 Bennet acknlowedged in his campaign appeal that while he may lack in national name recognition \"because I don't go on cable news everyday\", he came to Washington because he wants to \"pay attention to what would help the people who sent me there make their lives better.\" \"So you may not know me, but over the years I've learned a lot about what Americans struggle with.\" The senator refers to himself as a \"pragmatic idealist\", looking to herald in a \"new era of progress\" for Washington. He told Dickerson that he has a \"tendency to tell the truth\" to his constituents in Colorado and now wants \"the chance to do that with the American people.\"\u00a0 Considered a relatively moderate Democrat, Bennet has represented Colorado in the U.S. Senate since 2009. Before entering politics, he spent seven years in the private sector where served as director of the Anschutz Investment Company. It was there that he managed the consolidation of three major movie chains into the Regal Entertainment Group. In 2003, Bennet became the chief of staff to then-Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination. He left Hickenlooper's office in 2005 to become superintendent of the Denver Public School system, where he helped pass a merit pay system for teachers. He was later appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by Ken Salazar in 2009 and promptly re-elected the following year. In a departure from his fellow Democratic contenders, Bennet, who supports creating a public option for health care while making private insurances available on Obamacare marketplaces, noted in his campaign rollout video that the answer to the nation's health care woes does cannot be found in far-left policies like Medicare-for-All.\u00a0 \"I don't think 180 million Americans want to give up the insurance they already have through their work or their union,\" said Bennet.\u00a0 Bennet was born in New Dehli while his father served as an aide to the U.S. Ambassador to India. His father then went on to take posts in the Carter and Clinton administrations, while his grandfather was an adviser to Franklin Roosevelt.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders, considered to be one of the frontrunners early in the Democratic presidential primary race, raised $18.2 million in campaign donations in the first quarter Tuesday. According to campaign manager Faiz Shakir, this $18.2 million was raised with almost 900,000 individual donations, from\u00a0525,000 contributors. The average donation was $20, and 99.5% of the donations were $100 or less. Shakir said that a majority of the donors are under 39 years old. Shakir said that the Sanders has campaign has $28 million in cash on hand. Sanders' announcement comes the day after California Sen. Kamala Harris announced that her campaign raised $12 million in the first quarter. Sanders reported $6 million in fundraising in the first 24 hours of the campaign. The independent senator from Vermont has so far maintained a wide base of support, a holdover from his unsuccessful run in the 2016 Democratic primary. Although he lost that race by 3 million votes, Sanders has had a major influence on progressive politics in recent years. Several Sanders ideas considered to be on the fringe in 2016, like making Medicare-for-All the law, have since been adopted by some in the mainstream of the Democratic Party, including several presidential candidates. His influence extends beyond the Senate: a Sanders acolyte in the House, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is one of the rising stars in the party. Few candidates have announced their first-quarter fundraising totals yet. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg announced $7 million raised Monday morning from over 158,000 donors. His campaign said that 64 percent of the total donations came from contributions of $200 or less. Harris announced that the $12 million raised in the first quarter came from over 218,000 individual donors, and that 98 percent of the donations were under $100.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries\u00a0of New York that aired Sunday, March 24, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. He's the fourth ranking democrat in the House leadership and joins us this morning from New York City. Congressman welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" No one has seen the details of this report yet. What is it that you were actually looking to get and hear from the attorney general today? What can we expect? REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, the American people deserve to know the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. This is a serious national security investigation. Seventeen different intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered with our election, attacked our democracy, in order to try and artificially place Donald Trump at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. That's a very serious thing. Which is why, as House Democrats, we are saying that the Department of Justice should release the entire report, as well as, the underlying documentation. We don't want to see simply crib notes. We don't want to see an outline. We don't want to see an executive summary. We need to see everything so that the American people can draw conclusions on their own. MARGARET BRENNAN: But redactions, declassifications, I mean this is confidential information. You'd have to go to court. This is going to take some time. REP. JEFFRIES: Well, we certainly understand that to the extent there are sources and methods that need to be protected, those type of redactions are appropriate. But beyond that, we think that in the interest of full disclosure and complete transparency, the American people paid for this report. They deserve to get an understanding of the conclusions that were drawn. Four hundred and twenty members of Congress voted for public disclosure. Zero members of Congress in the House voted against it. The American people overwhelmingly have said more than 80 percent, Democrats, Republicans and independents, that the report should be disclosed. That's what we expect. MARGARET BRENNAN: Should we expect the attorney general and the special counsel to face questioning in front of your committee? In front of the television cameras? REP. JEFFRIES: Well, I think that certainly is a possibility. But let's take the first step in terms of the full disclosure of the report and the underlying documentation. The American people deserve to know whether Donald Trump is either A) A legitimate president B) A Russian asset C) The functional equivalent of an organized crime boss or D) Just a useful idiot who happens to have been victimized by the greatest collection of coincidences in the history of the republic. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman-- REP. JEFFRIES: Let's see what-- MARGARET BRENNAN: -- it sounds like you've come to your own conclusions. REP. JEFFRIES: That's a question. I haven't drawn a conclusion. What I'm saying is that this is a serious-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, said it is very clear the president obstructed justice. He said that before the report even came out or was concluded. Republicans are going to look at this and just say you are making a case for impeachment regardless of what is presented to you by the attorney general. REP. JEFFRIES: We've been very clear, Democrats didn't run on impeachment. We didn't win the House of Representatives back on impeachment. We are not focused on impeachment. Actually we're focused on executing are for the people agenda. We want to lower healthcare costs for everyday Americans. That's what we promised, that's what we're working on. We want to enact the real infrastructure plan. We have a trillion dollar plan, it would invest and create at least 16 million good paying jobs. We want to fix our crumbling bridges, roads, and tunnels and airports and mass transportation system. And we also want to bring our democracy to life. That's why we passed H.R. 1. That is our focus, Margaret. That will continue to be our focus moving forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actually predicting that legislation is going to get through in the next two years and not just be eaten up by all the political arguments around this report and the investigations that are ongoing in the House? REP. JEFFRIES: I certainly believe that that is possible. We are going to try to do everything we can to try and find common ground. We're going to lead by example and try to move for-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What actually gets done? REP. JEFFRIES: Well one, we're gonna work to try to drive down the high cost of lifesaving prescription drugs. We believe that the federal government should have the power, perhaps through Medicare, to use its bulk price purchasing ability to negotiate lower drug prices on behalf of the American people. MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0How are you going-- REP. JEFFRIES: The president hasn't got-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --to work- sorry, go ahead. How are you going to work with the president on doing that though when some members of your caucus have already been calling for his impeachment going back to two years prior? REP. JEFFRIES: Well, Nancy Pelosi has been very clear about impeachment and I share her view, and so do the overwhelming majority of the House Democratic Caucus. We are not going to proceed unless the case is compelling, the evidence is overwhelming, and most importantly public sentiment around impeachment is bipartisan. So, we are going to keep our focus on things like lifesaving prescription drugs and reducing its high price and we believe the president has come to Congress, spoke to the nation during the State of the Union address and said he agrees, we should try to work together to get that done. He has also indicated that he agrees with democrats that we should try to fix our crumbling infrastructure and we're going to try to get that accomplished as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright, Congressman, we will watch and see what happens on all those predictions. Interesting to hear some optimism there. We will be right back.",

            "article_content": "Manchester, N.H. \u2014\u00a0Thousands of New Hampshire Democrats began the  search this weekend for their next president, or so they hoped. Balancing  the thunderous 2018 midterm Democratic wins with the still-painful 2016 presidential election, voters were treated to the busiest weekend of Democratic presidential campaigning in recent memory with seven contenders crossing the state within  the last four days, according to New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley. CBS  News spoke with dozens of Democratic voters across 13 campaign events and heard voters overwhelmingly call for seismic change in both candidates and vision. In  his first trip to the Granite State since announcing his candidacy at the beginning of February, Sen. Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, held seven campaign events, the most of any candidate of the weekend. Interested voters packed like friendly sardines into homes and offices where several times the combined body heat  of the attendees fogged windows as Booker wiped sweat from his bald head, which he regularly used for self-deprecating jokes. Booker's  usual 20-minute stump speech is centered on inspiring a \"revival of grace\" and often references the struggles of the civil rights movement. Booker  believes his message of love and hope will be enough to beat President Trump, who Booker rarely \u2014 if ever \u2014 mentions. Most  attendees, like Karolina Bodner, 72, who took copious notes as she stood behind Booker, appreciated this upbeat oratorical approach. \"His  whole thing is we will serve ourselves and the country better if we stand for\u2014not just what we are against,\" she said. Others  disagreed. \"To  me it sounded a little weak,\" said State Rep. Wendy Thomas after hearing Booker's message. \"I'm not saying that we have to hate them. I'm not saying that we have to destroy them, I'm saying we have to get rid of them. We can love them later.\" Thomas  may find other Democratic candidates' messaging more appealing.\u00a0 Meanwhile,\u00a0Sen.  Kamala Harris, D-California, literally took her message to church as around 1,000 people flooded the pews of the South Street church in Portsmouth like it was Christmas Eve mass. Harris said Democrats must talk about \"hard truths\" like gun violence, a lack of concern about educating other people's kids, and the lives of immigrants in this country but also  that these ideas need to be \"prosecuted\" via a public debate. As  Harris outlined these \"hard truths,\" her Democratic congregation on Presidents Day regularly rose to their feet to cheer. By the end of her event, Harris had converted many Democrats into believers.  Yet,  some yearned for a more emotional message, especially those who had previously attended Booker's more intimate events. \"I  really liked Harris' talk, but it felt more performative,\" said Marcos Del Hierro, 37, comparing the event to Booker's which he attended the day before.  Harris  showed her go-with-the-flow attitude as she waded into the snowy outdoors to address the hundreds of people who were not able to get into her event.  \"It's  amazing!\" Harris reacted as she stepped back inside. wow: HUNDREDS of ppl standing outside in the snow in NH and @KamalaHarris goes outside to greet them before her event: pic.twitter.com/Svi0HADZan Beyond  stump speeches, candidates differentiated themselves with new policy positions. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, received progressive credit by endorsing a third federal gender identity marker for Americans who identify as non-binary when asked about a similar statewide bill. Booker, meanwhile, took this question, twice, and said  he would research.

Says this is one of the reasons she is running for President. pic.twitter.com/Vc4laVtZQc Harris also\u00a0 endorsed another progressive idea, a name change for Columbus Day to Indigenous People's Day. Booker also was asked and said he would find out more. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, was also in the state and took a centrist stance on two now-popular issues at a CNN televised town hall: Medicare for All she said is a \"possibility in the future\" and underscored that she wanted a more at-the-ready solution  for health. \"No.  I am not for free four-year college for all,\" was another definitive assessment of a progressive Democratic idea. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg said in an interview with CBS News his staff last week was managing his expectations for turnout at his New Hampshire events due in part to the large number of candidates campaigning nearby.   But turnout exceeded Buttigieg's expectations and showed up in the hundreds to hear his commitment to \"freedom,\" which he defined as not just idealist but freedom for women's reproduction rights, freedom from crushing loan debt, and access to affordable healthcare.  Voters also mentioned another freedom on display: Marriage. Buttigieg said he introduced his husband at the start of the remarks because his \"marriage is the most important thing in my life\" and he wanted voters to see that. \u00a0 The  clearest contrast between the candidates came from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, whose platform centers on an anti-war agenda. While the other campaign events were filled with applause, around 150 attendees at her Sunday town hall sat mostly in silence,  seemingly entranced by the serious issues of nuclear war she was forecasting. One  moment of Gabbard-loving applause was significantly different. The first question, came from a man who said, \"I really admire that you met with [Syrian dictator Bashar al] Assad.\" Gabbard controversially met with Assad in secret in June 2017.\u00a0 More  than half of the attendees, many while wearing Hawaii leis, erupted with clapping joy.

            "article_content": "Newly announced Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has raised $6 million since his campaign launched Tuesday morning, and $5.9 million in the first 24 hours, Sanders' campaign tells CBS News' Jenna Gibson.\u00a0 The Vermont senator's campaign raised $1 million from people in all 50 states in less than four hours after Sanders announced his bid. Sanders, appearing on \"CBS This Morning,\" said he intends to win the Democratic nomination this time around. Sanders, now 77, lost to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race for the Democratic nomination.\u00a0 \"We're gonna win,\" Sanders told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host John Dickerson.\u00a0 Sanders' initial fundraising haul appears to put him ahead of his competition. Last month, California's Sen. Kamala Harris raised roughly $1.5 million in the first 24 hours from all 50 states, which raised eyebrows at the time. Sanders, who has described himself as a democratic socialist, said it's \"absolutely imperative\" that Democrats defeat Mr. Trump in 2020.\u00a0 \"It is absolutely imperative that Donald Trump be defeated, because I think it is unacceptable and un-American, to be frank with you, that we have a president who is a pathological liar,\" Sanders said on \"CBS This Morning.\"\u00a0 Sanders is pushing policies including Medicare for All and college for all, issues that are sure to come up in Democratic primary debates.\u00a0 Sanders joins an already crowded field that includes Harris, Sens. Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Rep. Julian Castro, and others. Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",
