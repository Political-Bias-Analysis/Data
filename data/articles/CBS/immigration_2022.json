            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Arizona gubernatorial candidates Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, and Kari Lake, a Republican, discussed Sunday on \"Face the Nation\" the top issues facing voters in the state one month ahead of Election Day, making their pitch for why they should serve as Arizona's chief executive in one of the most closely watched races this cycle. A\u00a0CBS News poll of likely voters published Wednesday found Hobbs and Lake deadlocked at 49%. Among registered voters in Arizona, Lake, however, trails Hobbs by nine points on how she handles herself personally. Hobbs, who serves as Arizona's secretary of state, declined an invitation to debate Lake, who has embraced former President Donald Trump's false claims the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\u00a0 Hobbs told \"Face the Nation\" during an interview Sunday she has \"no desire to be a part of the spectacle\" surrounding her Republican gubernatorial opponent and accused Lake of creating a \"circus\" that does not benefit Arizona voters. \"At this point in the race with 30 days to go, our schedule in terms of forums is pretty much set. And I'm really happy with where we are in the plans we have to continue talking directly to the voters of Arizona,\" she said. But Lake, who will participate in a one-on-one interview Wednesday, said she has agreed to participate in \"any and all\" debates with Hobbs. \"I would love it if she would show up because I think there's a lot of important issues that the people of Arizona need to hear about,\"\u00a0 she said. Both Lake and Hobbs appeared on \"Face the Nation\" for back-to-back interviews, during which they discussed the top issues facing voters. Here's what they had to say. Lake has proposed Arizona join a compact with other like-minded states to carry out immigration enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border and said that she has spoken with other governors who have pledged to help Arizona. \"Article 4, Section 4 calls for the federal government to protect us from invasion, and under Joe Biden's lack of leadership, we just aren't seeing that,\" she told \"Face the Nation.\" \"And we have an invasion at our border, the cartels, these narco-terrorist groups have operational control. And they're using Arizona to smuggle people, to traffic children and to traffic the most dangerous drug we've ever seen, fentanyl. And so we're going to invoke our Article One, Section 10, basically, authority to take care of our own border and protect our own border.\" Lake told \"Face the Nation\" that a failure of immigration policy by the Biden administration has led to a surge of fentanyl coming across the southern border, impacting not only people in Arizona but across the country as the drugs flow to other states. \"We're not going to back down and let our people be overrun with drugs, watch our children die,\" she said. \"We can't keep having this happen. We're losing our young generation. So I hope that Joe Biden doesn't fight us because then it would really look like he is on the side of the cartels. And I don't think he wants the people to think that.\" Hobbs, meanwhile, said Arizona has born the brunt of the failures of U.S. immigration policies, but she told \"Face the Nation\" that there has been \"bad\" immigration policy for decades. \"Trump has centered his whole immigration policy around finishing the wall and it's not done. But Biden does need to step up immigration and border security. Absolutely,\" she said. \"Arizona is bearing the brunt of illegal drug trafficking, gun trafficking and smuggling. And we do need more border security. It's not going to get done by declaring an invasion at the border or dismantling the F.B.I., which is another thing that my opponent has called for.\" Hobbs criticized Lake's plan, saying her positions are \"empty rhetoric.\" \"She's not offering real solutions. When she talked about invoking the constitutional authority of the state, she's talking about declaring an invasion at our southern border,\" she said. \"That would do absolutely nothing to increase border security, but it would bring untold levels of chaos into our state. It's not a real solution.\" The CBS News poll found the 60% of Arizona voters believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and abortion is a top issue for Democratic voters in the state, though it does not rank as high among all voters when compared to the economy, inflation or immigration. Lake told \"Face the Nation\"\u00a0 that she would \"follow the law\" on limits to abortion in Arizona, which currently prohibits the procedure after 15 weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0 \"We need to draw the line somewhere. I am going to be the executive of the state, the chief executive officer, and I will follow the law,\" she said. \"The law right now as it stands is Gov. Ducey's law at 15 weeks, so we'll follow the law.\" Lake said supports giving women choices when confronted with an unplanned pregnancy and argued that when women go to abortion clinics, \"they're only given one choice.\" \"I will uphold the law, whatever that law is. And I want to see to it that we've save more lives,\" she said. Hobs said on \"Face the Nation\" that she does not support Arizona's 15-week abortion ban and accused Lake of \"entirely misconstruing\" her position on abortion. \"Under a Kari Lake administration, we would have government-mandated forced births that risk women's lives. And her position is the one that's extreme,\" Hobbs said. \"It's out of touch with where the majority of Arizonans are who support access to safe and legal abortion. And under her administration, women would not be safe.\" Hobbs said abortion is a \"very personal decision that belongs between a woman and her doctor.\"\u00a0 \"The government and politicians don't belong in that decision, we need to let doctors perform the care that they are trained and take an oath to- to perform,\" she said. The economy and inflation are top issues for likely voters in Arizona, according to the CBS News poll, and voters most concerned about immigration and the economy favor the Republican candidate. Hobbs said she and her husband know acutely the struggles Arizona families face amid high consumer prices, having raised their family \"through financial ups and downs.\" \"We have a comprehensive plan to address the rising costs that Arizonans are facing right now that will put money back in their pockets,\" she said. \"We cut taxes on all kinds of everyday items like over the counter medication, school supplies, diapers, feminine hygiene products, we provide a state level child tax credit, and tax credits for people who want to go back to work in higher paying jobs to get career and technical education.\" Arizona was among the states key to President Biden's 2020 presidential win, and he became the first Democrat to win the state since 1996. The results of the presidential election in Arizona were certified, and reaffirmed through a hand recount and review commissioned by Republicans in the state. Lake, who has repeated Trump's baseless claims the 2020 election was rife with voter fraud, said Sunday that there are \"major problems\" with the state's election system. \"We can't speak out against our own elections,\" she said. \"All I'm asking for is the ability to speak out when our government does something wrong. We should be able to speak out against it.\" Lake said there has to be \"honesty\" restored in elections. Unsupported claims about the integrity of elections has led to threats against election workers, and last week, a 64-year-old Iowa man was arrested after he was accused of threatening to kill Maricopa County Supervisor Clint Hickman.\u00a0 Asked whether she supports federal and state prosecution of people who threaten election workers, Lake said \"anyone who threatens anyone's life should be detained and questioned.\" \"I think we need to get back to where we have free speech and we shouldn't be threatening people, and I hope that they arrest that man and detain him,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "Guns.\u00a0Abortion. Immigration. Texas' closely-watched gubernatorial race hit the final stretch Friday night at the first \u2014  and likely only \u2014 debate between incumbent Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, and Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke, as the candidates sparred on some of the biggest issues facing votes in the state. While recent polls have shown O'Rourke trailing Abbott by around 7 points, this still could be the closest Texas governor's race in years. Abbott won in 2014 by over 20 points, and in 2018 by over 13 points.\u00a0 Abbott and O'Rourke have not squared off in person since the day after the Uvalde school shooting, when O'Rourke confronted Abbott during a press conference. O'Rourke has continued to hammer Abbott for his response to the shooting, even holding a press conference ahead of the debate with the families of shooting victims. In the one-hour debate, Abbott was asked about his comments at that press conference the day after the Uvalde shooting, which left 19 students and two teachers dead. In those comments, he said the shooting \"could have been worse,\" and he praised the law enforcement response. Since then, leaked video from the shooting has shown that officers waited in the hallway for 73 minutes to enter, and, at times, the screams of children could be heard.\u00a0 A report from a special legislative committee found that 376 officers responded to the shooting, and the delay in confronting the gunman was the result of \"systemic failures and egregiously poor decision making.\" Abbott has since said he was \"misled\" by \"everyone in that room that provided me with the information about what law enforcement did.\" \"What that comment was based upon was information by law enforcement about all the children in all the other classrooms that they evacuated during the time the shooter was on the campus,\" Abbott said. \"What they did not tell me at the time, however, was that there were dozens, if not more, of other law enforcement that were hanging around in the hallway for over an hour without engaging in the Columbine protocol, and going in and immediately removing that shooter, which is what they were supposed to do. And because they failed to do that, there does need to be accountability, not just for Pete Arredondo, but also for local law enforcement.\"\u00a0 O'Rourke, meanwhile, has countered that there needs to be accountability for Abbott, and has called for him to convene a special session of the state legislature to enact stricter gun laws. Abbott has said those laws would be challenged in court as unconstitutional.\u00a0 O'Rourke garnered national headlines in 2019 when, while running for president, he said at a debate \"hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15s.\" He has appeared to walk back those statements, and on Friday, he said he was \"for making sure we make progress.\" \"Those families I was just with from Uvalde want us to take action,\" O'Rourke said. \"This is the common ground. I've listened to Republicans and Democrats alike on this \u2013 we can agree on this much: Raise the age to 21, red flag law and universal background check.\"\u00a0 Friday's debate was hosted by Nexstar and held at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley in Edinburg, a crucial region for both candidates. There was no audience. Given the location, it was not surprising that immigration was the first question in the debate. Abbott has tried to keep immigration front and center in this race, as he has garnered national headlines for busing migrants to Washington, D.C., New York and Chicago. While the busing has drawn some criticism nationally \u2013 especially from Democrats \u2013 a UT/Texas Politics Project poll from September found that 80% of Texas Republicans, and 52% of state voters overall, supported the program.\u00a0 Abbott defended the program on Friday night, and said that New York City Mayor Eric Adams never reached out to his office, although Adams has said that he has. O'Rourke called the busing a \"political stunt.\"\u00a0 O'Rourke slammed Abbott's \"Operation Lone Star,\" which has involved deploying the National Guard to patrol the border, and has cost the state $4 billion. Abbott touted the program, although he said that, ideally, he would spend \"zero dollars\" on Operation Lone Star, and blamed President Joe Biden's immigration policies.\u00a0 O'Rourke, who is from El Paso, has not shied away from discussing immigration, but he has tried to center the race on abortion, gun laws, and the 2021 blackout.\u00a0 In 2021, before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Abbott signed a law that banned abortion after six weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest. After the Supreme Court decision, a trigger law banning abortion went into effect.\u00a0 Abbott has said the state would provide Plan B for victims of rape or incest, which he doubled down on on Friday night, saying Plan B should be \"readily available\" for them. But advocates told the Texas Tribune earlier this month that Plan B often isn't widely available, with one calling it \"fairy tale thinking.\"\u00a0 O'Rourke said Friday that this election is a referendum on \"reproductive freedom,\" and he told Texans that \"if you care about that, you need to come out and vote.\" 52% of likely voters said they would change Texas' abortion laws to make the procedure more accessible, according to a Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation/KVUE poll.\u00a0 Abbott, when asked if he has moved further to the right since taking office, said he never personally supported abortion.\u00a0 \"Let's look at the issues you brought up,\" Abbott said. \"And that is as, for one, as a Catholic, my wife and I have been pro-life our entire lives. So much so, that it became even stronger when we adopted our daughter. On the day she was born, I was the very first person to hold her after she was born. And I've seen firsthand the power that adoption can have.\" O'Rourke, meanwhile, was asked about his recent unsuccessful runs for Senate in 2018 and president in 2020, and whether he is running out of a call for public service or personal ambition. O'Rourke answered that it's an \"honor\" to \"have the opportunity to serve others.\" Prior to\u00a0 debate, a focus group told Nexstar that 40% supported Abbott, 27% backed O'Rourke, and 33% were undecided. After the debate, 50% supported O'Rourke, 43% supported Abbott, and 7% were undecided.\u00a0 This is the only debate Abbott has agreed to, while O'Rourke has accepted several other invitations. Ahead of the debate, O'Rourke accused Abbott of nixing the live audience, although Abbott's campaign told the Houston Chronicle that the debate conditions had been agreed upon beforehand \u2013 without an audience.\u00a0 Early voting in the state begins on Oct. 24. In September 2021, the GOP-led legislature passed an election bill that cut down on early voting hours and instituted new ID requirements for mail-in ballots. This last change in particular led to a higher ballot rejection rate in the March primary elections, with more than 24,000 votes that went uncounted.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "\n Eight states will hold primary and runoff elections Tuesday, which will be the first electoral reactions since the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last Friday.\u00a0 Tuesday's races include a gubernatorial primary with over $136 million spent on advertisements thus far, several contentious U.S. House primaries and a race to be the top elections official in Colorado that includes a Republican candidate that allegedly committed a breach of the state's voting machines.\u00a0 Of the states holding races on Tuesday, the issue of abortion access and which party determines that may be most vulnerable to change in Colorado. Democrats in the state have recently passed a law that codifies abortion rights.\u00a0 Colorado is in a unique position, since many of the surrounding states either had trigger laws or had more restrictive abortion laws proposed, such as Wyoming, Utah, Nebraska, Arizona and Oklahoma and, farther\u00a0away, Texas. Incumbent Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is not facing a primary challenger, but there are two Republicans running to take him on in November. Former Parker, Colorado, Mayor Greg Lopez and businesswoman Heidi Ganahl have both said in the wake of the Dobbs decision that they are opposed to abortions in most circumstances. Ganahl told Colorado Public Radio in June that she opposes the new law that protects abortion access. In the GOP primary to take on Democratic incumbent Sen. Michael Bennet, there is a clear difference between the two Republican candidates on abortion. Businessman Joe O'Dea doesn't believe in an abortion ban, and said he doesn't think the government should be involved in that decision, according to an interview with Colorado Public Radio. \"That's not a decision that I think I should make for someone else. I'm going to stay where I'm at. I'm not going to budge. It's important to me,\" he said.\u00a0 His main opponent, State Rep. Ron Hanks, opposes abortion and said he does not support any exceptions.\u00a0 While he has made other issues like immigration and energy the forefront of his campaign, Hanks has former President Donald Trump's stance that the 2020 election was \"stolen\" and has pushed for legislation that would eliminate mail-in voting and early voting. Hanks has declined to say whether he will accept the results of the primary election. \"We obviously have to see what we have to see here,\" Hank said during a primary debate earlier this month. He was also outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, but has told CBS News he did not go inside. \"It was very ill-advised for anyone to go into the Capitol,\" Hanks said at the primary debate. \"I wouldn't go up the stairs to the steps.\" The \"Democratic Colorado\" group has been the highest spenders in the primary, with $4.2 million spent focused on Hanks for the primary, according to data from AdImpact.\u00a0 Hanks has also sued Colorado Secretary of State Jen Griswold to initiate a third-party \"audit\" of the 2020 election in Colorado. President Biden won the state by just over 13 points.\u00a0 Griswold, a Democrat, has three Republicans vying to take her on in November. One is Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who was indicted on 10 counts in relation to an investigation into elections equipment tampering. She has pleaded not guilty. Peters believes the 2020 election was stolen and told the Colorado Sun, \"This is a personal opinion based on the evidence that I have seen and gone through and based on what I know from our reports. I do believe there may have been enough fraud that it turned the election.\" Businessman Mike O'Donnell has not been clear on if he believes Mr. Biden was legitimately elected, but has said the focus should be on elections this year and after. Another Republican candidate, Pam Anderson, has said she believes the 2020 results were valid. Illinois' race for governor has turned into a race between billionaires, as well as another example of Democrats attempting to boost a further-right opponent to help their chances in November.\u00a0 Aurora Mayor Richard Irvin was seen as a formidable general election candidate against incumbent Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker when he jumped into the race. The mayor of the state's second-most populated city, Aurora, Illinois, he is a notable Black Republican in the state and was bankrolled with over $50 million from GOP megadonor Ken Griffin.\u00a0 But then even more money got involved. Richard Uiline, owner of the Uline shipping company and a pro-Trump donor, backed state Sen. Darren Bailey, a further right legislator who sued Pritzker over his stay-at-home orders in the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, with over $9 million dollars. Trump backed Bailey at a rally Saturday in central Illinois.\u00a0 Pritzker's campaign and the Democratic Governors Association has spent over $37 million on ads, while the DGA has spent over $24 million, according to data from AdImpact. Pritzker, whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain, has also cut a check of at least $90 million for his campaign.\u00a0 The ads have looked to boost Bailey as \"too conservative,\" a potential appeal to the base of Republican primary voters and a sign they believe Pritzker has a better chance against him in the general election.\u00a0 One of the ads by the DGA that ran from May 13 to June 22 highlighted how Bailey \"proudly embraces the Trump agenda\" by \"fighting for gun owners and the unborn.\" Another attacks Irvin's record as a defense lawyer and says he has put \"violent criminals back on the street,\" a similar line used by Republicans against Democrats in ads about crime.\u00a0 Irvin, whose campaign has spent $43.7 million on ads, has shied away from talking about red meat topics for Republicans such as Trump, as well as what he'd do as governor about abortion. His campaign has instead taken a general election messaging approach and has focused on addressing crime, particularly in Chicago, and cutting taxes. A poll by the Chicago Sun-Times/WBEZ\u00a0showed Irvin down 15 points in the Republican primary to Bailey. This poll was released before Bailey received Trump's endorsement.\u00a0 \"I've made a promise to President Trump that in 2024, Illinois will roll the red carpet out for him because Illinois will be ready for President Trump,\" Bailey said at the rally.\u00a0 Other Republican candidates running include venture capitalist Jesse Sullivan, businessman Gary Rabine, former state Sen. Paul Schimpf and attorney Max Solomon. Pritzker is facing one Democratic challenger in veteran Beverly Miles.\u00a0 As a result of redistricting, and an aggressive gerrymander by state Democratic legislators, Illinois has two incumbent vs. incumbent Congressional primaries. Rep. Rodney Davis, an establishment Republican who previously represented a more politically competitive district, was drawn into a ruby red seat in the sprawling 15th District in central Illinois. He has been in a combative primary with Rep. Mary Miller, a firebrand conservative serving her first term in Congress. Trump has endorsed Miller and backed her at Saturday's rally with Bailey. During that rally, Miller said the Supreme Court's overturning Roe v. Wade is a \"historic victory for white life.\" Her campaign has said she misread prepared remarks and meant to say \"right to life.\" On Sunday, Davis' campaign said the gaffe is \"just another part in a disturbing pattern of behavior she's displayed since coming to Congress.\" His campaign had previously highlighted Miller's speech in January 2021 where she praised Adolf Hitler when talking about education. \"If we win a few elections, we're still going to be losing, unless we win the hearts and minds of our children. This is the battle. Hitler was right on one thing: He said, 'Whoever has the youth, has the future.' Our children are being propagandized,\" she said at a \"Moms for America\" rally in Washington, D.C. She has apologized and said she is \"passionately pro-Israel.\" Davis, who was an Illinois co-chair of Trump's 2020 campaign and had been an ally of the former president in a tough district, voted to create a bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack.\u00a0 This is different from the current select committee investigating Jan. 6, which only has just two Republicans \u2014 Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger. Miller and allies have used that vote against him in ads and on the campaign trail.\u00a0 Davis' campaign and allies have focused on his record, particularly his work on Trump's 2017 tax bill, and have ratcheted up highlighting Davis' stances on abortion and immigration to appeal to Republican voters. But Republican operatives in the state and in Washington see Miller as the frontrunner in the race against Davis, who has been in Congress since 2013, in part due to the new district lines and the hyper-partisan nature of primary voters. Miller has also benefited from outside spending from two allied groups that have blanketed the airwaves and have tied Davis to Democrats. The Club for Growth Action PAC and the Conservative Outsider PAC are the top spenders in the race with a combined $4.6 million spent on ads against Davis.\u00a0 Another primary to watch in Illinois is the Democratic primary in the 6th District between Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman. The two have only represented a portion of the newly drawn 6th District, which leans Democratic by about eight points according to Dave's Redistricting App.\u00a0 Newman has looked to portray herself as the more progressive option but has been dogged by a report from the Office of Congressional Ethics, which alleged there was \"substantial reason to believe\" she inappropriately offered a potential 2020 primary opponent a position in her Congressional office if he dropped out.\u00a0 Newman has denied any wrongdoing. The Democratic Majority for Israel group, which has ties to the pro-Israel American Israel Public Affairs Committee, has been running an ad highlighting the report in the closing weeks.\u00a0 Casten's daughter died earlier this month, which resulted in ads from both campaigns being temporarily pulled. Casten had previously represented a battleground House district and has highlighted his experience running in tight races. In Illinois' 7th District, progressive gun violence prevention activist Kina Collins is looking to upset longtime Democratic incumbent Danny Davis. Collins lost to Davis handily in 2020, but has upped her fundraising this cycle. She has been backed by the progressive Justice Democrats group and argues that Chicago's problems with gun violence require a new approach. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden has also waded into this race in the 11th hour, endorsing Davis over the weekend. This is his second notable House endorsement during a primary, his first one for Rep. Kurt Schrader in Oregon's 5th District proved unsuccessful as Schrader lost to progressive Jamie McLeod-Skinner.\u00a0 The Democratic and Republican primaries in Illinois' 17th District are also worth watching. The district, formerly held by retiring Democratic Rep. and former chair of the House Democrat Campaign arm Cheri Bustos, is considered a toss up race in November.\u00a0 Republican Rep. Lee Zeldin of eastern Long Island and Andrew Giuliani, son of former New York City Mayor and former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, are the top candidates in the GOP primary for New York governor. Zeldin, elected to Congress in 2014, had been endorsed by the state's Republican party and is the lead fundraiser in the primary. He launched his campaign to run against Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, before Cuomo resigned in Aug. 2019 and his lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, took over. A pro-life, pro-gun Republican, Zeldin supported Trump during his 2016 run, had been a vocal critic of Trump's impeachment in 2019 and had objected to the certification of the electoral results in Pennsylvania after the Jan. 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0 He had attacked other candidates at a Newsmax debate for being \"never-Trumpers\" but said he's his \"own man\" when asked where he falls on the political spectrum between former Vice President Mike Pence, who has backed Zeldin, and Trump, who has not endorsed anyone.\u00a0 Andrew Giuliani only has a fraction of what Zeldin has raised and has never held office before, but held a fundraiser on Trump's golf course in New Jersey and led Zeldin among Republicans in a June Siena College poll.\u00a0 His father campaigned for him in the closing weeks of the race, as well as throughout the House Jan. 6 committee hearings, during which Rudy Giuliani's name was often brought up as part of the effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Andrew Giuliani and his father held an event on Friday with Doug Mastriano, a state senator and Republican nominee for governor in Pennsylvania who has also made baseless claims that the 2020 election was \"stolen.\"\u00a0 \"The other side wants to distract us about Jan. 6, or they want to distract us about COVID, or they want to distract us about Roe v. Wade. Meanwhile people in this area, and my part of the state across the border here, struggle to make ends meet,\" Mastriano said, flanked by Andrew and Rudy Giuliani.\u00a0 Other Republican candidates are Westchester County Executive and 2014 gubernatorial nominee Rob Astorino and businessman Harry Wilson.\u00a0 All candidates have made crime in New York City, inflation and political corruption staples of their argument to be the first Republican governor of the Empire State since George Pataki in 2006.\u00a0 The winner will have an uphill battle to take on Hochul, the frontrunner in the Democratic primary.\u00a0 Incumbent Gov. Hochul has two primary challengers on her right in Rep. Tom Suozzi of Long Island and her left in New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams. Both had originally announced they were running against Cuomo.\u00a0 A fundraising powerhouse, Hochul has raised more than $30 million for her campaign and has spent more than $14 million on advertising, the most out of any candidate according to data from AdImpact. Hochul's pitch to voters has focused on her tenure as governor thus far, as well as on her support for gun control reform in the wake of the mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, her hometown.\u00a0 Williams has focused on the housing crisis and has said Hochul has not gone far enough on issues like climate change or gun violence.\u00a0 Suozzi has criticized Hochul's past \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association and has made crime and more strict sentencing laws a centerpoint of his campaign. Suozzi has also pointed to the Hochul's first pick for lieutenant governor, Brian Benjamin, who resigned after being indicted in a campaign finance scheme.\u00a0 Democratic Rep. Antonio Delgado is the incumbent candidate in the race for lieutenant governor, after Hochul picked him to replace Benjamin. But he has two challengers already in the race, with former Brooklyn Deputy Borough President and New York City Councilor Diana Reyna and progressive Ana Maria Archila.\u00a0 Delgado won a competitive race in 2018 to flip New York's 19th District from red to blue and has only held the lieutenant governors' seat since May 25.\u00a0 Archila has been backed by Delgado's former colleague in the House, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and is Williams' running mate. Ocasio-Cortez invited Archila as her state of the union guest in 2019 after Archila went viral for confronting then-Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh.\u00a0 If elected, she'd become New York's first Latina and openly LGBTQ candidate to hold statewide office. Archila has been backed by groups and politicians that have endorsed Hochul, and said during a debate she would not \"be a lieutenant governor who is quietly in the background smiling and cutting ribbons.\" In contrast, Delgado portrayed a more symbiotic relationship between the two officeholders.\u00a0 \"You try to have disagreements in a way where the objective is to put your best foot forward for your shared objectives and goals. And what is the shared objective and goals of the administration? It's to better the state,\" Delgado said in the debate. The winner will face Republican Alison Esposito, Zeldin's running mate and a former New York City Police Department Deputy Inspector.\u00a0 In the state's 3rd District, rightwing controversial Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert is being challenged by state Sen. Don Coram. Due to Colorado's primary system where independent voters receive ballots for both parties, that block of voters could be key to whether Boebert survives her challenge. According to data from Colorado's Secretary of State, close to 43% of the voters in this district identify as unaffiliated. Coram, a typical Republican candidate on most issues, has made a direct appeal to that group and tried to draw a contrast with the more controversial Boebert. \"I don't tweet 10 times a day. I didn't try to get on TV,\" he said in his campaign launch video. \"Call me boring if you want, but tweets and somebody trying to get famous does not feed our families.\" Boebert has remained the top fundraiser in the race with over $5 million raised and more than $2 million cash on hand.\u00a0 Three Democrats are running to take on Boebert or Coram in November: Aspen, Colorado city councilman Adam Frisch, community organizer and proressive Soledad Sandoval Tafoya and engineer Alex Walker.\u00a0 Due to its population growth, Colorado added a new 8th Congressional District in the Denver suburbs. The seat was drawn to be a political toss-up, though only one Democrat is running: Yadira Caraveo, a pediatrician.\u00a0 Four Republicans are running to claim the new seat: veteran Tyler Allcorn, state Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, mayor of Thornton, Colorado, Jan Kulmann and Lori Saine, a Weld County commissioner.\u00a0 Kulmann is the lead fundraiser of the group, though Saine has taken notable stances on abortion (she sponsored a bill that would make it illegal in all circumstances) and is the only candidate of the four that has not said if she believes Biden's election win in 2020 was legitimate.\u00a0 Colorado's 7th District, left open by Democratic Rep. Ed Perlmutter, will also be competitive in November. Democratic state Sen. Brittany Pettersen is unopposed, while three other Republicans are looking to flip the seat in November: veteran Erik Aadland, economist Tim Reichert and Laurel Imer, a former county campaign chair for Trump in 2016. Mississippi has three Republicans in runoff elections on the ballot Tuesday, with two involving Republican incumbents. Rep. Michael Guest of Mississippi's 3rd District voted to create the\u00a0 bipartisan commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attacks. This commission is different from the current iteration of the Jan. 6 commission that is currently investigating the attacks.\u00a0 His vote has been the main crux of his challenge on the right from former Navy fighter pilot Michael Cassidy.\u00a0 Cassidy received the most votes on primary night, with 47.5% of the vote compared to Guest's 46.9%. The House GOP-backed Congressional Leadership Fund has come in for reinforcements for Guest, spending over $472,000 on ads. Rep. Steven Palazzo of Mississippi's 4th District is in a runoff with sheriff Mike Ezell. Palazzo was the subject of a report by the Office of Congressional Ethics that found he had likely misspent his campaign funds for his own personal use. Palazzo has pushed back and called those allegations false. Oklahoma has both of their Senate seats on the ballot this year, after longtime Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe announced his retirement. The open seat left by Inhofe has attracted more than 13 Republicans to file their candidacies, including Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma's 2nd District. Meanwhile, former Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn, who flipped an Oklahoma City-area seat from red to blue in 2018 before losing it in 2020, is the only Democrat running to fill Inhofe's seat.\u00a0 Incumbent Republican Sen. James Lankford is also up for re-election this year. He has two Republican challengers and six potential Democratic nominees in the fall, but has a clear fundraising advantage over the field with $6 million raised thus far. South Carolina Democrats will cement their nominee this November in the runoff between state Rep. Krystle Matthews and Catherine Fleming Bruce. The winner will face off against Republican incumbent Sen. Tim Scott, who has raised a massive $33 million so far this cycle and has $24 million cash on hand. Voters in Nebraska's 1st District will choose between Republican Rep. Mike Flood and Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks in a special election to fill former Republican Rep. Jeff Fortenberry's seat. Flood is expected to win the special election and serve the rest of Fortenberry's term.\u00a0 Fortenberry resigned in March after being convicted of lying to federal authorities about an illegal campaign donation from a foreign national. He will be sentenced on Tuesday, according to KOLN.\u00a0 Musadiq Bidar contributed reporting. Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "When thousands of Haitian migrants converged underneath a Texas bridge last September, the images of their plight, broadcast across the world, depicted the dire humanitarian consequences of a historic migration wave at the U.S. southern border. But the events in Del Rio, Texas, last fall also illustrated the complicated, and often contradictory, trajectory of U.S. immigration and border policy during President Biden's first year in office. Republicans, who have accused Mr. Biden of encouraging unlawful migration through changes in policy and rhetoric, portrayed the administration as too lenient, criticizing the release of some migrants who were allowed to stay in the U.S. to have court hearings before an immigration judge. While many were released into the U.S., others met a starkly different fate. Using a pandemic order enacted by former President Donald Trump, the Biden administration launched an unprecedented deportation blitz to Haiti, expelling thousands, including women and children, in just a few weeks. In its first year, Mr. Biden's administration made dozens of high-profile and little-noticed changes to the U.S. immigration system, many of them reversals of Trump-era restrictions. But the Biden administration also continued some policies instituted by Mr. Trump. A task force created by Mr. Biden has reunited 118 migrant children with families who were separated near the southern border during the Trump administration. It has also identified an additional 370 children who are set to be reunited with their families. But following Republican criticism, the Biden administration also ended court negotiations over financial compensation for these families. In an interview, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the administration's priorities in 2022 include reforming immigration detention, reducing massive immigration application backlogs, reshaping the asylum process and expanding naturalization efforts for eligible permanent residents. \"We accomplished a lot in this past year. We certainly have plans to do a lot more \u2014 and we will do it,\" Mayorkas, a child of Cuban refugees, told CBS News on Wednesday. 2021 saw both unusual and predictable developments in immigration policy. Last summer, following the Afghan government's sudden collapse, the Biden administration quickly staged the evacuation and resettlement of tens of thousands of at-risk Afghans, a vast operation that continues to this day. Meanwhile, a long-shot bid by the White House and slim Democratic majorities in Congress to offer legal protections to many of the country's estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants crumbled after three separate plans to bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold were rejected by the chamber's parliamentarian. Arrivals of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border last year defied historic patterns, rising to unprecedented levels in the hot summer months. Migrant apprehensions climbed to 1.7 million, a record, in fiscal year 2021, but they also reflected an unusually high rate of adults attempting to cross the border multiple times. A year in, the Biden administration's border strategy has divided the president's appointees and frustrated critics on the right and left, who hurl accusations of lax immigration enforcement and outrage over the continuation of some Trump-era restrictions. Pili Tobar, the White House deputy communications director, said Republicans' criticism is rooted in \"politics of fear,\" indicating the administration wants to highlight the \"progress\" Mr. Biden has made on immigration policy. \"We don't think that this is the third rail of politics, or that this is an area to shy away from,\" Tobar said. \"On the contrary, we think the American people want this to be an issue that gets resolved.\" But the political blowback over the border has been so intense it has overshadowed key reforms and campaign promises that Mr. Biden fulfilled in other parts of the sprawling immigration system. \"According to our tracking, in its first year, the Biden administration took about 300 administrative actions on immigration,\" said Jessica Bolter, an analyst for the Migration Policy Institute. \"This probably will be surprising to a lot of people because of how much the border dominated public discourse around Biden's first year.\" The main U.S. border policy during Mr. Biden's presidency has been an emergency rule put in place in March 2020 by the Trump administration. Known as Title 42, it allows U.S. border agents to quickly expel migrants to Mexico or their home country without screening them for asylum. Despite criticism from advocates, the Biden administration has defended the expulsions in federal court, arguing they are needed to curb the spread of the coronavirus inside detention sites. Officials have enforced Title 42 longer under Mr. Biden than under the Trump administration, carrying out over 1 million expulsions, most of them of single adult migrants, in 11 months, government figures show. During just over nine months under Mr. Trump, roughly 400,000 expulsions were carried out. The Biden administration has, however, refrained from expelling migrant children who enter U.S. custody without their parents. Instead, unaccompanied children from Central America are being transferred to government shelters. The administration has also applied Title 42 to a smaller percentage of families than the Trump administration, partly because Mexican officials have refused to accept Central American families with young children. However, the number of families encountered in 2021 increased by 1,200% from 2020. There have been notable border policy changes under Mr. Biden. The State Department voided agreements that would have allowed the U.S. to re-route migrants seeking refuge to Central America, and the Justice Department reversed Trump-era rules that disqualified victims of gang and domestic violence from asylum. Hours after taking office, Mr. Biden stopped border wall construction, though some barrier gaps are now being closed. The Justice Department also set up a program to expedite the immigration court cases of families who are not expelled under Title 42. During Mr. Biden's first week in office, Republican officials in Texas sued his administration over the decision to halt most interior deportations for 100 days. The lawsuit, which blocked the deportation moratorium four days after it started, foreshadowed Texas' emergence as Mr. Biden's chief legal adversary. Since then, Texas has filed multiple lawsuits seeking to hinder Mr. Biden's immigration agenda. The state has already convinced a federal judge to rule against limits on interior immigration arrests and through another case is seeking to force Mr. Biden to expand Title 42 to once again include unaccompanied minors. In July 2021, granting a request by Texas, a federal judge ordered the Biden administration to stop processing first-time applications for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provides work permits and deportation protections to unauthorized immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors.\u00a0 A month later, Texas and Missouri convinced another judge to mandate the revival of a Trump administration policy that requires asylum-seekers to await their U.S. court hearings in Mexico, a program that Mr. Biden had suspended after calling it inhumane.\u00a0 In late October, Mayorkas issued a second memo to terminate the\u00a0Remain in Mexico rule, but it won't take effect until the court order is lifted. The Trump-era program was restarted in December; though its implementation has been limited so far. With less fanfare, the Biden administration has reshaped the work of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agency in charge of deportations and immigration arrests, scrapping Trump-era rules that broadened the population subject to deportation and expanded immigration detention.\u00a0 Current rules direct ICE agents to arrest migrants who recently entered the U.S. illegally, noncitizens convicted of serious crimes and those who threaten national security. They generally exempt undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for years from arrest if they have clean records. \"We have fundamentally changed immigration enforcement in the interior. For the first time ever, our policy explicitly states that a non-citizen's unlawful presence in the United States will not, by itself, be a basis for the initiation of an enforcement action,\" Mayorkas said. \"This is a profound shift away from the prior administration's indiscriminate enforcement.\" The Biden administration has barred, in most circumstances, the detention of pregnant or nursing women and victims of serious crimes. It also ended mass ICE arrests at worksites and expanded the number of \"sensitive locations\" where agents should avoid making arrests to include bus stops and shelters. The long-term detention of migrant families with children \u2014 which the Trump administration sought to expand to deter illegal border crossings \u2014 has also been discontinued, for now. In May, ICE stopped using two detention facilities plagued by allegations of abuse and initiated a review of its detention system. Mayorkas on Wednesday said additional detention centers will be closed. ICE, however, has yet to fulfill Mr. Biden's campaign pledge to end for-profit immigration detention. \"I don't want to get into the substance of a policy memorandum that I've not yet issued,\" Mayorkas said. \"I will only say the following: number one, detention reform is a priority of mine, and two, the president fulfills his promises.\" Mr. Biden has also rolled back several limits the Trump administration placed on legal immigration, from categorical bans to bureaucratic processing restrictions. For the current fiscal year, Mr. Biden set an ambitious target of resettling up to 125,000 refugees fleeing war and violence, a dramatic reversal of the historic low refugee cap of 15,000 that Mr. Trump set before leaving office.\u00a0 The admissions target will likely not be met, however, given the state of the refugee resettlement infrastructure, which is still recovering from the pandemic and cuts under Mr. Trump, and currently focused on helping the Afghan evacuees who were relocated to the U.S. last summer. Mr. Biden's administration has offered Temporary Protected Status, a humanitarian protection from deportation, to more than 400,000 immigrants already in the U.S., including Haitians and Venezuleans who fled political and economic crises in their home countries. The State Department resurrected and expanded the Obama-era Central American Minors initiative, which allows some parents in the U.S. to bring their children from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to the country legally. Early in his presidency, Mr. Biden revoked a Trump order that restricted immigration and travel from 13 countries, most of them African or predominantly Muslim. He also refused to extend restrictions on work and immigrant visas that Mr. Trump put in place during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden administration also stopped enforcing Trump administration regulations that gave U.S. officials broader discretion to reject green card and visa applications from low-income immigrants deemed to be a \"public charge,\" or an economic burden on the country. In many ways, Mr. Biden will continue to face immigration policy challenges in 2022 that have bedeviled Republican and Democratic presidents for decades. Massive case backlogs continue to plague U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the immigration court system, crippling the government's ability to adjudicate applications in a timely manner. There's currently no viable path to fulfill Mr. Biden's pledge to legalize the country's undocumented immigrants. Any such proposal would face insurmountable odds if Republicans regain control of the House in November's elections. Inaction in Congress could prompt Mr. Biden to take executive action, but that would likely invite additional lawsuits from conservative states like Texas. While migrant arrivals at the southern border have recently plateaued, they could increase sharply later this year, as historical trends suggest, creating a new humanitarian and political challenge for Mr. Biden. There are, however, some opportunities for Mr. Biden to implement his immigration policy vision in 2022. The Afghan evacuee resettlement effort, which has enjoyed bipartisan support, could serve as a model to reinvigorate the U.S. refugee program, test private refugee sponsorship and increase admissions.\u00a0 While some Biden appointees fear the rescission of the Title 42 border rule may trigger a migration wave, its eventual end could allow the administration to test initiatives it has proposed, including a plan to let asylum officers review migrants' requests for protection, instead of transferring cases to backlog-ridden courts. The main objective of the proposal is to dramatically speed up the screening of asylum-seekers. In an ideal scenario, it would allow the U.S. to quickly determine whether migrants should be deported because they don't qualify for asylum or allowed to stay because they are fleeing persecution or torture. But the administration still needs to finalize the rule and hire hundreds of asylum officers to implement it. Biden officials support setting up campus-like centers to screen migrants, but none have yet been erected. And while Title 42 is supposed to be a temporary emergency order, there's no telling when it will be lifted. On Wednesday, Mayorkas said he expects to start the asylum overhaul plan \"in very short order.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Seventy-eight congressional districts will hold primaries Tuesday, with about 19 in competitive districts that could determine control of the U.S. House this November, according to ratings by The Cook Political Report. Ten of them are in California. This includes Republican David Valadao in California's 22nd District, who was one of the ten House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attacks. Two Republicans are challenging Valadao in the primary, former city Councilman Chris Mathys and Education Board Trustee Adam Medeiros, but Trump has not endorsed either of them. California has a \"top-two\" primary system where the top two vote getters move on to the general, regardless of party. In an attempt to boost Mathys' chances of blocking Valadao out, the Democrat-backed House Majority PAC has ran an ad that point out Valadao's impeachment vote and highlights Mathys as being \"100 percent pro-Trump and proud.\" State Assemblyman Rudy Salas is expected to be the Democratic nominee against Valadao, if he makes it, in November, attempting to flip back a seat that was held by a Democrat until 2020. Democratic Reps. Katie Porter, Josh Harder and Mike Levin are on the target list for national Republicans and are waiting to see who their challenger this November will be. Of the three, Levin may face the toughest race, since his district leans Democratic by only two points, according to data from Dave's Redistricting App.\u00a0 Two House Republicans who flipped seats in traditionally conservative Orange County, Young Kim and Michelle Steel, are top targets for Democrats this cycle. Kim is being challenged from the right by Mission Viejo City Council \u00a0councilman Greg Raths. Her campaign and the House GOP-backed Congressional Leadership Fund have run ads portraying him as a liberal, a sign they're taking the challenge seriously. Physician Asif Mahmood is likely to be the Democratic nominee.\u00a0 Steel saw her district become slightly more Democratic during redistricting. She's been in a combative campaign against Democratic Navy veteran Jay Chen, a Taiwanese-American. Both Kim and Steel are among the first Korean Americans to serve in Congress.\u00a0 Two Democrats are running against Republican Mike Garcia, who flipped California's 25th District in Los Angeles County in 2020: Christy Smith, a state assemblywoman who lost to Garcia twice, and veteran John Quaye Quartey. Also in California, the special election for Republican Devin Nunes' seat. Nunes, one of Trump's biggest allies, resigned in 2021 to run Trump's social media company,\"TRUTH Social.\" Republican Connie Conway will face Democrat Lourin Hubbard to complete the rest of Nunes' term. The version of the district Nunes represented, the 22nd, will cease to exist in 2023 due to the new Congressional map, so neither candidate has said they'll run for a district in November. Iowa and New Jersey also have three competitive seats each, while New Mexico has two. In Montana, Ryan Zinke, a former interior secretary during the Trump administration, is trying to clear his primary for the new Congressional district that covers the western bit of the state. All three Republican incumbents In Mississippi have challengers on the right. Rep. Steven Palazzo's race in Mississippi's 4th District is likely to head to a runoff, since six other Republicans will be trying to siphon away votes from him.\u00a0 One of Rep. Michael Guest's primary opponents, former Navy pilot Michael Cassidy, has gone after him for voting to establish a Jan. 6 commission. Democratic Congressman Bennie Thompson, chair of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attacks, is being primaried by businessman Jerry Kerner, who is running to the right of Thompson. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is up for reelection this year. Newsom easily beat back a recall attempt in September and appears to be on a clear path to winning a second term.\u00a0 None of the Republicans who were running to replace Newsom in the recall jumped into the 2022 race, but several lesser-known challengers are running. Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla is also on the ballot this year. Newsom appointed Padilla to fill Vice President Kamala Harris' vacated Senate seat. Padilla is expected to win a full-term and serve the remainder of Harris' term. In Los Angeles, voters will weigh in on the city's next mayor. Current Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is term-limited. President Biden also nominated Garcetti to serve as ambassador to India, although he has not yet been confirmed.\u00a0 The top candidates to replace Garcetti appear to be Representative Karen Bass and real estate developer Rick Caruso. Caruso has spent about $40 million on the race, compared to Bass' $3.2 million. Caruso has spent roughly what Vice President Kamala Harris spent on her 2020 presidential campaign.\u00a0 Bass was on Mr. Biden's vice presidential shortlist in 2020 and has been running as a progressive candidate. She has been criticized by some liberal activists over her plans for ending homelessness and hiring more police officers, according to the Los Angeles Times. Caruso, a former Republican, spent years without a party affiliation and registered as a Democrat in January 2022. He said in a statement announcing his Democratic affiliation that he will be a \"pro-centrist, pro-jobs, pro-public safety Democrat.\" A UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll from late May showed Bass (38%) and Caruso (32%) well ahead of Los Angeles city councilmember Kevin de Leon (6%). If a candidate doesn't receive more than 50% of the vote, the top two candidates will face off in a runoff in November.\u00a0 The top issues for voters, according to that poll, were homelessness (45%), crime and public safety (34%) and housing affordability (26%).\u00a0 In the Bay Area, voters will decide whether to recall progressive San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin. Boudin is one of the most high-profile district attorneys in the country and the recall is seen as a measure of how voters in a solidly Democratic city feel about progressive criminal justice policies.\u00a0 One of Boudin's key platforms included reducing incarcerations, and he said public safety would be his top concern. Critics say San Francisco isn't safer and blame Boudin's progressive policies and diversion programs for crime in the city.\u00a0 If Boudin is recalled, San Francisco Mayor London Breed would appoint his replacement.\u00a0 Iowa Democrats will nominate a candidate who will likely challenge Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley in November. Former Representative Abby Finkenauer, retired Admiral Michael Franken and Glenn Hurst, a doctor and Minden city councilmember, are all vying for the nomination. Finkenauer had to fight to get on the ballot after\u00a0a judge initially ruled\u00a0that she did not have enough signatures to qualify for the primary ballot. The\u00a0Iowa Supreme Court reversed that decision\u00a0several days later. She was elected to Congress in 2018, but lost her bid for reelection in 2020. Franken is making another run at the Senate after losing in the Democratic primary in 2020. Grassley, who is the oldest Republican senator at 88 years old, is\u00a0running for his eighth term. He won his election in 2016 by about 24 points, but does have to get past a primary challenge from Iowa state Senator Jim Carlin. Cook Political Report rates the race as safe Republican. \u00a0 Iowa also has a gubernatorial race in November. Republican incumbent Governor Kim Reynolds will likely be a heavy favorite in that race. She is expected to face Democratic candidate Deidre DeJear.\u00a0 Republicans hope they'll be able to flip control of New Mexico's gubernatorial mansion when November rolls around. Democratic incumbent Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, has faced criticism after purchasing jewelry from a store when non-essential businesses were closed and settling a harassment claim from a former campaign staffer.\u00a0 A Morning Consult poll from late April showed 48% of registered voters in New Mexico approve of the job Lujan Grisham has done, while 45% disapprove. Among those running in the Republican field are former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti, state Rep. Rebecca Dow, Sandoval County Commissioner Jay Block, veteran Greg Zanetti and executive director of New Mexico Right to Life Ethel Maharg.\u00a0 A recent KOB/SurveyUSA poll found the economy (41%) was the most important issue for voters followed by crime (16%) and climate change and water supply (13%). GOP primary voters were most concerned about immigration, but only about one in eight voters overall said it was their most important issue.\u00a0 Ronchetti, who was on New Mexico airwaves as a meteorologist for about two decades, was the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in 2020 and lost to Democrat Ben Ray Lujan by about six points.\u00a0 Ronchetti has been the top fundraiser on the GOP side, raising nearly $2.5 million, according to the most recent data on the New Mexico Secretary of State's website. Dow has raised about $1.3 million, while Zanetti reported about $560,000 and Block reported roughly $250,000. Lujan Grisham led all of the candidates with about $5.4 million raised.\u00a0 South Dakota Senator John Thune, the second-ranking Republican, is seeking his fourth term in Washington. Thune has a couple of primary challengers, including National Guard veteran Bruce Whalen and entrepreneur Mark Mowry, but is expected to win on Tuesday.\u00a0 Thune is expected to face Democrat Brian Bengs in November and will be a heavy favorite. Thune won 72% of the vote when he was last elected in 2016.\u00a0 South Dakota Republican Governor Kristi Noem, who is seen as a rising star in Republican politics and is a potential future presidential candidate, is also on the ballot in 2022. Noem is facing former South Dakota House Speaker Steve Haugaard in the primary, who has claimed Noem isn't conservative enough. Noem, who has Trump's endorsement and a 58% approval rating, is expected to win her race. She will be a heavy favorite against expected Democratic candidate Jamie Smith, the Democratic House Minority Leader, in November.\u00a0 For races with three or more candidates, a candidate has to win at least 35% of the vote to avoid a runoff.\u00a0 CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Paris\u00a0\u2014 Incumbent Emmanuel Macron will face far-right nationalist Marine Le Pen in a winner-takes-all runoff for the French presidency, after they both advanced Sunday in the first round of voting in the country's election to set up another head-to-head clash of their sharply opposing visions for France. Polling agency projections and a partial official count of votes showed France teeing up a repeat of the 2017 runoff that made Macron the country's youngest-ever president \u2014 but with no guarantee this time that the outcome will be the same. Addressing his supporters who chanted \"five more years,\" Macron warned that \"nothing is done\" and said the next two weeks of campaigning for the April 24 second-round vote will be \"decisive for our country and for Europe.\" Claiming that Le Pen would align France with \"populists and xenophobes,\" he said: \"That's not us.\" \"I want to reach out to all those who want to work for France,\" he said. He vowed to \"implement the project of progress, of French and European openness and independence we have advocated for.\" The election outcome will have wide international influence as Europe struggles to contain the havoc wreaked by Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. Macron has strongly backed European Union sanctions on Russia while Le Pen has worried about their impact on French living standards. Macron also is a firm supporter of NATO and of close collaboration among the European Union's 27 members. With two-thirds of votes counted, Macron and Le Pen had pulled comfortably clear of hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon, out of the two-candidate runoff in third place. Macron, a 44-year-old political centrist, won by a landslide five years ago but he is bracing for a far tougher second round against his 53-year-old political nemesis. Le Pen is promising seismic shifts for France \u2014 both domestically and internationally \u2014 if elected as the country's first woman president. Macron for months had looked like a shoo-in to become France's first president in 20 years to win a second term. But National Rally leader Le Pen, in a late surge, tapped into the foremost issue on many French voters' minds: the soaring costs for food, gas and heating due to rising inflation and the repercussions of Western sanctions on Russia. Polling agency projections put both Macron and Le Pen on course to improve their 2017 first-round showings, highlighting how French politics have become increasingly polarized. Macron was expected to capture a sizeable first-round lead of around 28% support, ahead of Le Pen's projected 23%-24% of the vote. Melenchon was credited with about 20% support. Both Macron and Le Pen now need to reach out to voters who backed the 10 presidential candidates defeated on Sunday to win in round two. Le Pen seemed to target Melechon's left-wing supporters in particular by promising \"social justice\" and fixes for \"a France torn apart.\" \"The French people honored me by qualifying me for the second round,\" Le Pen said. Her supporters celebrated with champagne and interrupted her speech with chants of \"We're going to win!\" Yet some of her defeated rivals were so alarmed by the possibility of Le Pen beating Macron that they urged their supporters Sunday to shift their second-round votes to the incumbent. Melenchon, addressing supporters who sometimes shed tears, repeatedly said: \"We must not give one vote to Mrs. Le Pen.\" Describing herself as \"profoundly worried,\" defeated conservative candidate Valerie Pecresse warned of \"the chaos that would ensue\" if Le Pen was elected, saying the far-right leader has never been so close to power. Pecresse said she would vote for Macron in the runoff. Pollsters suggest that just a few percentage points could separate the familiar foes in the second round. The runoff campaign is likely to be far more confrontational than round one, which was largely overshadowed by the war in Ukraine. After Le Pen dropped off her blue ballot envelope in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont, she said \"given the situation in the country and in the world,\" the election outcome could determine \"not only the next five years, but probably the next 50 years\" in France. In the 27-member EU, only France has a nuclear arsenal and a U.N. Security Council veto. To beat Le Pen in the runoff, Macron must pick apart her years-long rebranding effort to make herself seem less extreme, a makeover that has even highlighted her love of cats. Macron has accused Le Pen of pushing an extremist manifesto of racist, ruinous policies. Le Pen wants to roll back some rights for Muslims, banning them from wearing headscarves in public, and drastically reduce immigration from outside Europe. Her softer image has won over some voters but made others even more suspicious. Yves Maillot, a retired engineer, said he voted for Macron only to counterbalance Le Pen. He said he fears that her long-standing hostility to the EU could see her try to take France out of the bloc, even though she's dropped that from her manifesto. \"I don't think she's changed at all,\" he said. \"It's the same thing, but with cats.\"",

            "article_content": "A key member of President Biden's economic team, Cecilia Rouse, will leave his administration in the spring, a White House official said Friday. Rouse took academic leave from Princeton University to serve as chair of Mr. Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, and she plans to return to the university. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss personnel changes and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The pending departure comes after the midterm elections and as Mr. Biden's term reaches its halfway point, often a time of transition for any presidential administration.  The economy could prove to be an even more delicate issue next year. The White House has tried to assuage concerns about a potential recession in the near future, pointing to a strong job market. But the Federal Reserve has also been\u00a0raising interest rates to battle continued inflation. Bloomberg was first to report Rouse's planned departure, and it said Brian Deese, director of Mr. Biden's National Economic Council, plans to depart next year.  Rouse, a labor economist, was the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers. Deese is scheduled to participate in a meeting with Biden and business and labor leaders at the White House on Friday afternoon. It's the Democratic president's first public event since returning from a trip to Egypt, Cambodia and Indonesia.  The official said there was no timeline for Deese to leave the administration. There was additional turnover in the Biden administration earlier this month when Chris Magnus, the head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, was forced out of his job. Immigration authorities have struggled to manage the flow of migrants toward the United States' border with Mexico, a frequent point of criticism from Republicans.",

            "article_content": "Warren, Mich. \u2014 For the first seven minutes of his Michigan rally Saturday, former President Donald Trump stuck to two familiar issues Republicans are running on this November: inflation and the rising cost of living under President Biden, and immigration and the southern border.\u00a0 Then, he turned to a topic that's been occupying him since November 2020: that the presidential election had been \"stolen\" from him.\u00a0 He claimed John James, now a congressional candidate for Michigan's 10th District, had won his last race for U.S. Senate in 2020. He did not. James lost to Sen. Gary Peters by over 92,000 votes. Trump accused Democrats of obliterating \"election integrity.\" He said America is a \"third world country\" because of how ballots are counted, and he praised France for using paper ballots. Trump did not acknowledge a Michigan investigation led by a panel of state Republicans that found no evidence of widespread fraud. And then he urged the crowd crammed into the arena in Macomb County, where he won by 8 points in 2020, to turn out in November so that they can overtake Democrats. \"Michigan patriots have to shatter every record, because they cheat like hell, these people,\" Trump said, implying that Republican voters have to run up the margins so Democrats \"can't rig it.\" Republican voters in the state \u2014 and at the rally \u2014 also believe Trump was cheated in 2020. \"Absolutely,\" the election was stolen, said Deborah Brown, a retired telecommunications worker and longtime Republican.\u00a0 Over half Republican politicians in the state, too, agree with Trump that the election was stolen.\u00a0 Nine of the 17 statewide and federal GOP congressional nominees in Michigan have expressed doubt about President Joe Biden's victory, even though his margin in the state exceeded 154,000 votes, according to a CBS News analysis. Three of those nine are incumbent members of Congress who voted to object to the electoral college results in Arizona and Pennsylvania on Jan. 6, 2021. They were all recognized by Trump during his rally.\u00a0 This is happening in all of the states that Trump won in 2016 but lost in 2020: in Arizona, 11 out of their 13 candidates are considered \"election deniers.\" In Wisconsin it's 5 out of 13 candidates, in Georgia 10 out of 19 candidates deny Mr. Biden won the election, and in Pennsylvania, it's 9 out of 20 who believe this is the case. \"How pervasive the fraud was, that's a secondary issue,\" Michigan Republican candidate for secretary of state Kristina Karamo told CBS News before Trump's remarks. \"Some people just don't know how big of a problem it is, but when you start to lay out the evidence, it's horrible.\"\u00a0 Karamo cited wireless modems being used in some of the state's election machines, falsely claimed they were hacked in 2020 and suggested they invite fraud in future elections. While there's been no instances of fraud in these systems, some have moved away from using modems according to The Detroit News.  In response to a question on whether she believes the upcoming election will be credible, Karamo declined to answer and instead said she \"can't believe\" Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson's warnings that election officials have been threatened with violence. \"I think that is so grossly irresponsible of an election official to say that. I've lived in Michigan my whole life, I've never seen anything like that ever,\" Karamo said.\u00a0 In early September, Benson said on \"Face the Nation\" that many secretaries of state and election officials are worried about \"violence and disruption on Election Day\u2026 and in the days surrounding the election.\" A Brennan Center survey of election officials in March found that 1 in 6 officials have \"experienced threats.\"\u00a0 Republicans including Shane Hernandez, GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, are calling for voter ID laws and closer monitoring of drop boxes. He said that state Republicans want to replicate Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin's poll-watching measures on Election Day.\u00a0 \"We need to make sure we have the team on the ground to make sure people are comfortable,\" he said.\u00a0 The GOP nominee for Michigan governor, Tudor Dixon, signaled she agrees with the falsehood that Trump won the 2020 election, raising her hand at a primary debate when asked if candidates believe it was stolen, though she didn't bring it up at the Trump rally Saturday. A Trafalgar Poll released last week found Dixon is trailing Gov. Gretchen Whitmer by about 5 points. No poll in the state has shown Dixon leading in the past month. The unfounded belief that the election was stolen \u2014 \"that's why so many people are here now, and we expect to get [Trump] back. There's a lot of Christians like myself here, and we're praying that [Trump] gets back in here in 2024,\" Brown, the retired communications worker said as she waited in line for the rally. She said she'd like to hear GOP candidates say more about the 2020 election and \"election integrity,\" too, a sentiment shared by other rallygoers. Michigan pollster Steve Mitchell says most Michigan GOP voters think Mr. Biden \"is an illegally elected president.\" \"If you're going to run as a Republican and you find yourself denying that, you're not going to get support from Republicans,\" Mitchell said.\u00a0 The source of their belief in this is Trump. \"The voters believe him,\" Mitchell said. \"There's nothing that anyone can do to dissuade them from the fact that the election was not indeed stolen in Michigan.\"\u00a0 Ronald Dwyer, who's running for Oakland County commissioner, is the rare GOP candidate in the state who isn't sure there was enough fraud to turn the election against Trump, but he still thinks it's time to move on.\u00a0 \"We're halfway through the current term; we just got to move forward,\" he said.\u00a0 A CBS News poll in September found that 63% of Republicans believe there was \"widespread fraud\" in the 2020 election, primarily in Democratic and urban areas. Another poll found that if they lose midterm elections, 64% of Republicans said they should accept the results and look to 2024, while the remainder said they should challenge places where Democrats won.\u00a0 Who controls the statewide positions in Michigan and other battleground states could play an outsized role when it comes to certifying the winner of the next presidential election, in 2024.\u00a0 Whitmer, who was taunted by chants of \"Lock her up!\" from a GOP-heavy crowd Saturday, has argued she's the \"last line of defense\" against what she characterizes as GOP efforts to weaken democracy, according to Bridge Michigan.\u00a0 Carl Marlinga, the Democratic nominee for Michigan's 10th District, said a central reason for his campaign is to help ensure Michigan Democrats are the majority in the congressional delegation \u2014 in case the Electoral College results are tied in 2024 and the state's congressional delegations become the final arbiters of the presidential election.\u00a0 \"I want to be there in January of 2025\u2013 I want to be at least one of the 435 to say whatever the reality is, whether it's a Democrat or a Republican, I want to make sure the real winner gets certified,\" he said.\u00a0 While Trump says he doesn't think there will ever be a \"fair election\" again, he's hoping the candidates he supports this November will pass more restrictive election laws. \u00a0 \"Everywhere the Republican party has a chance, we must pass critical election integrity reforms,\" he said.\u00a0 The Michigan GOP-led Legislature is already trying to do this. In 2021, the state senate introduced 39 election-related bills \u2014 to require photo IDs to vote and others to curb access to absentee ballot applications, according to the Detroit Free Press. Whitmer has vetoed several of these bills, calling them part of a \"a coordinated, national attack on voting rights that is designed to undermine confidence in our election system.\" In Michigan's August primary, the number of absentee ballots issued and returned was nearly double the amount in 2018, after the state dropped its requirement for voters to have an excuse in order to obtain a mail ballot. Last Thursday, Michigan began making absentee ballots available to be picked up.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Katie Hobbs, Democratic candidate for governor in Arizona, that aired on Sunday, Oct. 9, 2022. MAJOR GARRETT: Now to Katie Hobbs, she is the Democratic nominee for governor and she's also in Phoenix this morning, Secretary Hobbs, good morning. Welcome to Face the Nation. So your opponent said you don't want to debate. I'd like to ask you: are there any conditions under which you would agree to debate Kari Lake, so the voters of Arizona could hear from the two of you, side by side and in real time? DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR AZ GOVERNOR KATIE HOBBS: Look, what I've been focused on is opportunities like this, where they can see us back to back and hear directly from us about the issues that are important to Arizonans and how we would govern without a circus like she created during the GOP Republican primary. I have no desire to be a part of- of the spectacle that she's looking to create. Because that doesn't do any service to the voters of Arizona to hear from us, where we stand on the issues and how we would govern. MAJOR GARRETT: So sometimes voters learn things from moments of duress or challenge or circus. Don't you think you're strong enough to handle any kind of circus Kari Lake might present if in fact, she were to present one? Don't the voters of Arizona deserve to see that real? NOMINEE HOBBS: I think the voters of Arizona have had a chance to see how I work under crisis throughout my leadership during the 2020 election as Secretary of State. When we had to combat multiple election challenges from- from former President Trump and his band of election deniers, including my opponents Kari Lake. MAJOR GARRETT: So I want to ask you about immigration. We had a long conversation with Kari Lake about that. Last night you tweeted, \"Arizona bears the brunt of the failures of US immigration policies.\" Now by our count, that is your second tweet in a month about immigration. Who specifically is responsible for this failure? And why only now did you decide to share that sentiment with your Twitter followers? NOMINEE HOBBS: Oh, this is certainly not the first time that I've spoken out about immigration in this campaign. We are a border state and immigration as it is a very important issue to Arizona border- voters. And as a border state, we have borne the brunt of decades of inaction in Washington from both parties to address both border security and comprehensive immigration reform. And- and we need the federal government to step up. But what I want to be really clear about is that my opponent's positions on this issue are nothing but empty rhetoric. She's not offering real solutions. When she talked about invoking the constitutional authority of the state. She's talking about declaring an invasion at our southern border. That would do absolutely nothing to increase border security, but it would bring untold levels of chaos into our state. It's not a real solution. I have a border security plan that's been endorsed by two border sheriffs because they know that it's going to focus real solutions and bring meaningful relief and help them make their communities safer. MAJOR GARRETT: As a practical matter, were Arizonans safer under immigration policies of the present administration or the one just before it? NOMINEE HOBBS: Look, we've had a- a pretty bad immigration policy for decades. We need to get comprehensive immigration reform done. And it's both parties in Congress have been dragging their feet to- to get this done. MAJOR GARRETT: But, when you say there is a failure of current immigration policy, that's a Biden administration failure, is it not by definition? NOMINEE HOBBS: Look, Trump has centered his whole immigration policy around finishing the wall and it's not done. And- but Biden does need to step up immigration and border security. Absolutely. Arizona is bearing the brunt of- of illegal drug trafficking, gun trafficking and smuggling. And we do need more border security. It's not going to get done by declaring an invasion at the border or dismantling the F.B.I., which is another thing that my opponent has called for MAJOR GARRETT: On the question of abortion, your opponent described you as something of an extremist, those are her words, not ours. Do you support the current 15-week ban in Arizona? Or would you seek- seek a different approach? And is there a week limit different than 15-weeks you are in favor of? And if so, why? NOMINEE HOBBS: I don't support the 15-week ban. But let me just say that Kari Lake is- is entirely misconstruing my position on this issue. You and I both know that late-term abortion is extremely rare. And if it's being talked about, it's because something has gone incredibly wrong in a pregnancy. A doctor's not going to perform an abortion late in a pregnancy just because somebody decided they want one. That is ridiculous. And she's saying this to distract from her incredibly extreme position, which has\u2013 she's gone on the record saying she supports Arizona's complete abortion ban that what- that is in the courts right now being decided if that will be the law of Arizona or not. She's called it a great law. She's called people who seek abortion murders and executioners. And- and under a Kari Lake administration, we would have government mandated forced births that risk women's lives. And- and her position is the one that acts that's extreme. It's out of touch where- with where the majority of Arizonans are who support access to safe and legal abortion. And under her administration, women would not be safe. MAJOR GARRETT: What would the Hobbs administration's week limit be for abortion access? If it's not 15-weeks? What is it? NOMINEE HOBBS: Look, abortion is a very personal decision that belongs between a woman and her doctor. The government and politicians don't belong in that decision, we need to let doctors perform the care that they are trained and take an oath to- to perform. MAJOR GARRETT: So if an Arizona voter were to conclude from your previous answer, that you do not favor any specific week limit on abortion, would they be correct? NOMINEE HOBBS: I support leaving the decision between a woman and her doctor and leaving politicians entirely out of it. MAJOR GARRETT: Our polling also indicates that the economy is very important to Arizona voters. And on that issue, both the economy generally, inflation specifically, according to our data, you trail your opponent. What is your approach to inflation and the economy in Arizona? And why is yours superior to that of your opponent? NOMINEE HOBBS: Well, first, let me say I'm the only candidate in this race who is not a millionaire. My husband and I raised our kids through financial ups and downs. And I know the struggle that a lot of Arizonans are feeling right now having to stretch to put food on the table thinking about taking a second job, or not being able to pay the mortgage. And so we have a comprehensive plan to address the rising costs that Arizonans are facing right now. That will put money back in their pockets. We cut taxes on all kinds of everyday items like over the counter medication, school supplies, diapers, feminine hygiene products, we provide a child- a state level child tax credit, and tax credits for people who want to go back to work in higher paying jobs to get career and technical education. Economists have looked at my affordability plan next to Kari Lake's plan and they said that my plan does put people back to work and- and help them fight inflation. And that Kari Lake's plan actually will make inflation worse. MAJOR GARRETT: Do you identify yourself with the Biden economic administration- economic plans and inflation fighting plans? And if so, would you advise the President to campaign along your side in Arizona? NOMINEE HOBBS: I'm focused on the race here in Arizona and the needs of Arizona and it's a race between myself and Kari Lake. And- and the- the ideas that we're bringing to the table. MAJOR GARRETT: And one- one more time before we let you go because I think it is on the mind of Arizona voters. Are you saying, this morning, that there is no circumstance that you can envision or would even try to negotiate in which you and Kari Lake would appear at a debate together before the election? NOMINEE HOBBS: At this point in the race with 30 days to go. Our schedule in terms of- of forums is pretty much set. And- and I'm really happy with where we are in the plans we have to continue talking directly to the voters of Arizona. MAJOR GARRETT: Katie Hobbs, Secretary of State of Arizona, Democratic nominee for governor, thank you very much and we will be right back with a lot more Face to Nation. We invite you to please stay with us.",

            "article_content": "Arizona is another battleground where strong opposing forces underpin the race. Democratic candidates enjoy stronger personal ratings, while Republican voters are thinking more about national Senate control. There's a tough economy and desire for tougher border controls helping Republicans, versus abortion helping Democrats.\u00a0 And in this state that was so close in 2020, election denialism does not find favor beyond a handful of those in the Republican base \u2013 nor do voters want it to be a campaign focus. What's working in Democratic Senator Mark Kelly's favor is the majority approval of his job performance and the fact that he is personally liked. In fact, he is the most personally liked of the four statewide candidates tested for Senate and governor. By contrast, over six in 10 dislike how Blake Masters handles himself personally.\u00a0 Also, Kelly has support from those who want abortion to be legal \u2014 which most voters do. However, while abortion is important to Democrats, it does not rank as highly among voters overall, compared to the economy, inflation, or immigration here. And Democrats face a deficit on those items.\u00a0 The economy and immigration are central, and voters hold negative views of the economy \u2014\u00a0 \u00a0 both Arizona's and the nation's. That is aiding the Republican candidates: they're winning voters who say these issues are paramount.\u00a0 Like Democratic candidates elsewhere, Kelly enjoys a wide lead among voters who say abortion is very important, but that advantage is countered somewhat by voters who emphasize immigration. Immigration ranks third in the state as being \"very important\" (higher than it does nationally), just behind the economy and inflation. And among voters saying immigration is very important, Masters leads big, helping keep the race close. Kelly enjoys a bit of crossover voting from Republicans, with about one in 10 backing him, similar to the level he won over in 2020. In this case, he's more likely to get support from Republicans who think abortion ought to be legal than from those who don't. In the wake of the ruling by a judge to reinstate a law that bans virtually all abortions in the state, most voters would have abortion be legal in all or most cases in Arizona \u2014   and majorities of voters would not criminalize it.\u00a0 Women, more so than men, say an illegal abortion should not result in a criminal penalty for the women who have the procedure, the doctors and medical staff, or anyone who helped the woman pay for or obtain the abortion.\u00a0 There is some division among Republicans on this. Roughly half would not penalize a woman for having the abortion, even as many oppose the procedure, but most would favor criminal penalties for a doctor for performing an abortion.\u00a0 That said, a 57% majority of self-identified \"MAGA\" Republicans would subject a woman having an abortion to criminal penalties, along with even higher support for punishing doctors and medical providers and anyone who paid for it.\u00a0 Voters who want abortion legal are more likely than those who don't to prioritize it as a voting issue, and these voters are backing Kelly over Masters. As we've seen elsewhere, abortion is also a top issue for Democratic voters here in Arizona. Most Arizona voters think Kelly will support policies to protect abortion access, and most think Masters will support policies to restrict it. There is a distinct gender gap. Kelly has a big lead with women, and Masters has a double-digit lead with men. Kelly also leads with younger voters and Hispanic voters. Masters is ahead with older voters, White voters, and evangelicals. When asked directly about securing the border, more voters think Masters would support policies that make the border more secure than say that about Kelly. Just over half of Arizona voters say immigration has changed the area where they live at least some in recent years, and a large majority who say so say it's changed for the worse. Voters who feel this way place a great deal of importance on the issue of immigration. Nine in 10 of them say it's very important in their 2022 vote, and they are heavily backing Republican candidates in both the Senate and gubernatorial races here. Overall though, a majority of Arizona voters feel most of those trying to cross the border are motivated by a search for jobs and better lives. But just the same, they would have the U.S. be tougher on those trying to cross the border. This is driven by Republicans who overwhelmingly feel this way, and a smaller majority of independents. More Hispanic voters also want the U.S. to be tougher than easier on those trying to cross the border. As in other battleground states and nationally, the economy and inflation in Arizona are top issues for voters, and the Republican candidates lead among voters who call these issues very important. As with most midterm elections, this one is at least partly a referendum on the current president. More Arizona voters say their Senate vote is to oppose President Joe Biden than to support him. His approval rating here among registered voters is 39%, which is lower than his most recent national number.\u00a0 Outright election denialism finds little resonance with voters in Arizona: fewer than one in five Arizona voters want their elected officials to say that Mr. Biden is not the legitimate winner of the 2020 contest.\u00a0 Many don't care either way, though. Moreover, the 2020 election isn't anywhere near the top issues they want candidates talking about \u2014 it pales in comparison to the economy and immigration among other topics. Yet it still might be affecting the race a bit, in terms of what GOP candidates are seen talking about \u2014 at least as a distraction from other issues. For example, independents who say they've been hearing Blake Masters talking about the 2020 election are less likely to be voting for him than those who say they've heard him talking about the economy. And they're more likely to call him \"extreme,\" instead of \"mainstream.\" And election denialism might still be a key test among some in the GOP base.\u00a0 For Republicans to whom an official's stance does matter, denialism is still more of the draw than acceptance: by a 4 to 1 ratio, they'd prefer officials who said Biden didn't legitimately win to those who said he did. Looking ahead, the vast majority of Arizonans want their governor to accept the results of future elections, no matter which party is the winner. However, three in 10 Republicans say the next governor should challenge and investigate elections when Democrats win \u2014 and they overwhelmingly back Republican gubernatorial nominee Kari Lake. While the Democratic candidate has a slim three-point edge in the race for Senate, the Arizona governor's race is even between Democrat Katie Hobbs and Lake. Lake \u2014 who does not have the extra hurdle of running against an incumbent \u2014 is generally better liked than her Republican counterpart running for Senate. Lake trails Hobbs by nine points among Arizona registered voters on how she handles herself personally, but this is far better than the 20-point deficit Masters has against Kelly on this measure.\u00a0 When asked whether each of the four candidates' positions were \"mainstream\" or \"extreme,\" Lake is viewed as extreme by slightly fewer Arizona voters than Blake Masters is, though both are more likely to be seen as extreme than their Democratic opponents. Here again, we see a familiar Democratic advantage on abortion as very important, while voters who are most concerned about immigration and the economy favor the Republican candidate. Lake's tighter contest, compared to Masters', is partly described by ever-so-slight differences like a slightly smaller gender gap, slightly less attrition from her own party, plus those comparably better favorability ratings.\u00a0 This CBS News/YouGov Battleground Tracker survey was conducted with a statewide representative sample of 1,164 registered voters in Arizona interviewed between September 30-October 4, 2022. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, education and geographic region based on the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as to 2020 presidential vote. The margin of error is \u00b13.8 points.\u00a0 Toplines",

And this week on Face the Nation: Domestic and international crises test global relations, as world leaders converge in London for Queen Elizabeth's funeral. Their next stop, the annual United Nations gathering in New York. And, as President Biden struggles to fight economic headwinds, a political battle over immigration explodes, when red state governors pick up the pace on relocating migrants crossing their borders by unceremoniously relocating them to blue state sanctuaries, like the sidewalk in front of the vice president's Washington home. Plus, Russian President Vladimir Putin faces a public rebuke from a key partner and the cold shoulder from another, as Ukrainians retake more of their territory, uncovering horrors left behind by Russian forces. Finally, our continuing coverage of the stress test of our democracy, as our nervous nation starts the 50-day countdown to midterm Election Day. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. It is a somber Sunday as we come on the air today. In London, there is unprecedented security for the hundreds of world leaders, including President Biden, who are gathering for tomorrow's state funeral of Queen Elizabeth. It will be the largest assembly of heads of state and government in years. Our Scott Pelley spoke with President Biden before he left for the U.K. and discussed how he's navigating the new world order for tonight's season premiere of 60 Minutes. (Begin VT) SCOTT PELLEY: President Xi and Vladimir Putin have met on the same day that you and I are sitting here in the White House. And I wonder, if this is a new, more complicated Cold War, how do you manage it? JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): I don't think it is a new, more complicated Cold War. Look, when President Xi invited Putin to Beijing during the Olympics, where they had their meeting and their -- the new relationship, not long after that, I called President Xi, not to threaten at all, just to say to him -- we have met many times. And I said that: \"If you think that Americans and others were going to continue to invest in China based on your violating the sanctions that have been imposed on Russia, I think you're making a gigantic mistake. But that's your decision to make.\" Thus far, there's no indication that they have put forward weapons or anything that Russia has wanted. So -- well, maybe I shouldn't say any more. SCOTT PELLEY: Oh, I wish you would. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: No. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Here at home, a political firestorm erupted between Republicans and Democrats over immigration, an issue made more complicated by challenging relationships between the U.S. and some of our neighbors to the south. Republican governors have been relocating some who've crossed the border into their red states for months now. But, last week, the images of migrants flown or bused from Texas to Martha's Vineyard, Vice President Harris' residence in Washington and New York City has sparked a fury of political backlash. (Begin VT) KAMALA HARRIS (Vice President of the United States): I think it is the height of irresponsibility, much less just, frankly, a dereliction of duty when you are an elected leader to play those kinds of games with human life. GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS (R-Florida): They were so proud to be sanctuary jurisdictions, saying how bad it was to have a secure border. The minute even a small fraction of what those border towns deal with every day is brought to their front door, they all of a sudden go berserk. GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT (R-Texas): Now New Yorkers and people in Washington, D.C., are having to deal with it. And now Texas is sharing our pain with the rest of the country. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. is set to record more than two million migrant arrests at the border with Mexico this year, a record high. We turn now to Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar. He represents a border a district in South Texas. And he joins us this morning from Laredo. Congressman, I know you feel strongly about what's happening in your backyard. I wonder if both you and your constituents support busing these migrants up and down the East Coast? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR (D-Texas): Look, first of all, we need solutions, and not theater. By sending off -- folks off to New York and Chicago, it does bring attention, but I -- we want to focus more on solutions on the border. We got to give Border Patrol, we got to give ICE, Homeland Security the equipment, making sure they have everything where they can enforce the law, because, if we don't have repercussions at the border, we're going to continue getting 8,000 people a day. And let me mention one more thing, Margaret. They might get two buses a day in some of those cities. Just for my hometown in Laredo, we're sending out 21 to 26 buses a day out of Laredo, just to give you an idea of what's happening here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Right. Understood, the volume, but, of course, in some of these places like Martha's Vineyard, there aren't even migration centers, and there was no coordination. Is that the part you're objecting to? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Yes, look, after all, the migrants are human beings, and we've got to treat them like human beings. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: They are being used as political pawns to get publicity. But, at the same time, I represent some of the poorest counties along the border in the nation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, I know you have shared with us some video of what's happening in your district, that law enforcement officers have shared with you some pictures, some video that our viewers are seeing right now. Is law enforcement getting the resources that they need? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: No. Look, the men and women in green, the men and women from Homeland, they need to get the support. They are good men and women, and what they need to do is have two things. One, they need to get more personnel, and we're adding more personnel in the appropriations bill. They need to get the equipment. They need to get -- but -- they need to get help. But the most important thing, is they got to be able to enforce the repercussions, because if you don't enforce the repercussions... (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? What does that mean, repercussions? Are you talking about the fact that many of these migrants that are being bused are from countries like Venezuela, where the U.S. cannot deport them because of diplomatic relations being so strained? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Look, right now, we're getting people from Saudi Arabia, China, India, Bangladesh, and, of course, Cuba and Venezuela. There are certain folks, the countries that might not accept some of the people, you got to look at asylum. But most of the people coming in don't apply for asylum. We've got to do -- as your next guest is going to say, Secretary Jeh Johnson, he treated the people with respect. But at the end of the day, he enforced the law, and he returned people. And one of the things that this administration is not doing is, they're showing people -- he showed people going and landing in the countries in Honduras and El Salvador to show that there's repercussions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Margaret, when was the last time you saw -- you saw a picture or video of people going back? You only see people coming in. And you've got to have words, along with action to enforce it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I mean, it's pretty complicated. But Title 42 still is in place. There is expelling of migrants happening. It sounds like what I hear you saying is, you want the White House or higher-level officials to go and make these public statements. Vice President Harris, when she was asked about this, pointed right back to people with your job, lawmakers, to go rewrite the laws and pass immigration reform. What actually needs to be done, and how do you respond to that? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Look, there are enough -- and with all respect to the V.P., there are enough laws on the book right now that can return people back. Secretary Johnson, your next guest, did it the right way. He treated people with dignity, but he returned people, and he showed images of people being returned, because, right now, the cartels are using people because they make, let's say, $8,000 a person. In two years, with all the people that have come in, the get-aways included, that's about four million individuals. You multiply that by $8,000, and that shows you how much these bad guys are being enriched at the sake of these human beings. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, on that point, the homeland security secretary was on this program back in July after those 53 migrants died in the most tragic smuggling incident in this country. And he said it is possible, because of how sophisticated these smugglers have gotten, to bypass U.S. checkpoint sometimes. Is it that the framing of this conversation is completely wrong, that it's not just people walking across, that it is very sophisticated criminal enterprises? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Look, everybody that comes across is somehow controlled by the bad guys. I mean, people just don't happen to walk across a river or across the border. It's all controlled by the migrants. Every sector, for example, along the border is controlled by some sort of cartel across. Yes, they're very sophisticated. Yes, they have got the money. Yes, they do counterintelligence. What happened to those 53 migrants, we don't have a checkpoint that's big enough to handle what we're seeing, so the bad guys were able to use that checkpoint, because we haven't put the resources on that checkpoint like we need to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. And I know you've shared images with us of some of the coyotes, some of the smugglers who have gotten these trailers filled with people across. But there is interdiction taking place. I know you know that. What are you saying is needed? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Oh, yes, but I -- but -- well, what I'm saying is, if you look at the Border Patrol sectors in my area, 60 percent of the Border Patrol agents are in border processing centers, that is, they're taking care of migrants; 10 percent of them are doing administrative work. That leaves only 30 percent of the Border Patrol doing the work, 30 percent. Therefore, large numbers coming in will be crossing, and then you also have more deaths out there, because there's less Border Patrol agents saving' Border Patrol needs help. Men and women in green need help, no ifs, no buts about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, lastly, one of the bigger problems in this country right now is the economy and the worker shortage that we have. I wonder if this is part of that. If you have people who are desperate for economic opportunity coming here and America needs workers, isn't there some way to make this work for America? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Absolutely. I support a guest-worker plan. I support a way that you can -- and we passed that from the House. And we're waiting for our Senate to get that done. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: And I will tell you that, if we have people under a guest-worker plan, then Border Patrol's job will be done easier, because the people looking for a job will come in the legal way, and then Border Patrol can focus on the bad people. So, it would help us on security. So, we need to make our legal system work better. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. All right, Congressman, thank you for your insights. And we now to the guest you heard the congressman talking about, Jeh Johnson. He served as homeland security secretary under former President Obama. And he joins us this morning from New Jersey. Mr. Secretary, your policies are being endorsed here. I don't know if you want to respond, though, to what the congressman said, in terms of a stronger message needing to be sent by this administration, going to countries and showing that expelling of migrants is happening. JEH JOHNSON (Former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security): Well, thanks for having me on, Margaret. First, I know that following me is Professor Robert Pape, who will present some findings on his research. I have been a big proponent of his research now about the concerns around white nationalism for some time. And I urge your viewers to pay close attention to what Professor Pape has to say. Information -- illegal immigration is an information-sensitive phenomenon. It reacts sharply to information in the marketplace about perceived changes in enforcement policy on our Southern border. This administration, I believe unfairly, is perceived as lax on border enforcement. In fact, we are sending back over 100,000 people a month and have been for the last two years, over two million people. The lesson I learned managing this issue is, you've got to repeat yourself maybe 25 times before anybody will listen to you. You have to show that we are, in fact, sending people back... MARGARET BRENNAN: Why isn't that happening? FORMER SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON: ... probably about as fast as -- well, that's a good question. My friendly advice to the current administration, DHS and the White House is, we have to continually stress that we are, in fact, with the machinery of government, about as fast as we probably can, given the current legal construct and the resources we have, sending people back at well over 100,000, either expel expulsion or deportation. That's a lot of people. Now, there's a larger problem here that, frankly, we did not face when I was in office. We were dealing principally with the Northern Triangle countries, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Mexico. This problem has become hemispheric. In addition to those countries, you now have Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela who are not cooperating with us. Their countries are literally imploding, and there is migration to the north and the south. Our Border Patrol capabilities, our resources are bigger than they were eight, seven years ago, when I was in office. But they do struggle to keep up with this crisis. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. FORMER SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON: And, from my point of view, we need to stress that we are, in fact, returning people as fast as we can. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when it comes to moving migrants around the country right now -- you're a lawyer -- the federal government moves migrants from the border to other parts of this country quite often. What's the difference when a state governor does it, albeit, I know, without warning? FORMER SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON: Well, there's a right way and a wrong way to do that, Margaret. The wrong way is, on 20 minutes' notice, to send people by bus or airplane to the Edgartown Airport or to Mass Ave. in front of the vice president's residence without giving local resources, NGOs, shelter's local government an opportunity to plan for how they intend to feed and clothe and house migrants. What the governors of Florida and Texas are doing, frankly, is a political stunt and treating people like livestock. The right way to move people to the interior -- and I think it's something that we should do -- 8,000 a day into McAllen, into Henry Cuellar's district, in Laredo or El Paso, I have been saying for some time is not sustainable. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. FORMER SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON: And so we do need to move people to the interior, but through a well-coordinated effort, in coordination with NGOs, Catholic Charities, state and local government and the federal government. There is a right way to do that. It requires coordination and cooperation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why isn't that happening, I guess, is the question we keep coming back to. And, as you're saying, it's becoming politicized. The Wall Street Journal had an op-ed saying it's hard to imagine a bigger spectacle of American political failure than the histrionics over migrants. They slam Republicans for staging a political stunt, but they also say Democrats are just trying to deflect away from their own border policy failures. Is that a fair assessment, in your view? FORMER SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON: Frankly, Margaret, the politics currently are such that politicians, elected officials find it more advantageous to simply scream at the other side and complain about how evil or lax the other side is. It does take political courage to come together and put together legislation on comprehensive immigration reform. It passed the Senate in 2013. It failed in the House in 2014. But that's simply the only way we're going to deal with this problem through guest-worker programs, through stronger border security, through trying to address the problem at the source. It takes political courage, but, right now, the politics of this issue are all wrong. And I'm afraid nothing's getting done. MARGARET BRENNAN: But we have a crisis, so it requires action. Do you see a clear, coordinated planning or strategy from the White House, that controls Customs and Border Patrol and Homeland Security and the people on the front lines of this? FORMER SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON: I know DHS is working very hard. They've ramped up the resources to deal with the influx at the Southern border. It's much larger. The ability to move larger volumes of people is much larger than it was seven, eight years ago. But there needs to be a more comprehensive federal, state, local, executive and legislative branch effort at this. And we can do this, if we're willing to cooperate, work together, exercise some political courage, have the governor of Texas willing to work with the governors of some Northern states... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. FORMER SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON: ... at moving people in a more coordinated, cooperative fashion into the interior of our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Johnson, thank you for your analysis this morning. Face the Nation will be right back. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a look now at the latest challenges facing our economy. Our Mark Strassmann reports from Los Angeles. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): Back on track, America's railroads, with a tentative labor deal. But no one can seem to put the brakes on inflation, the latest rate, 8.3 percent. That's six straight months above 8 percent. DIANE SWONK (Chief Economist, KPMG): We now have an inflation that may be much more entrenched and sticky. MARK STRASSMANN: Economist Diane Swonk, an adviser to the Federal Reserve, worries workers keep losing ground. DIANE SWONK: All the gains in employment we have seen, all the acceleration in wages we have seen, we have lost all of that, and then some, to inflation. MARK STRASSMANN: Blame a tangle of lingering buffeters, including the pandemic recovery, consumer demand, Ukraine and the supply chain muddle, which is why averting a railroad strike was so critical. This doesn't help, the backlog at Southern California ports, the gateway for roughly 40 percent of American imports. Here, at the Port of Los Angeles, the director says 28,000 shipping containers need to go out by train. That number should be zero. Good news, dropping gas prices; $3.68 gallon is the national average, down 26 cents in the last month. Now bad news. Grocery costs jumped 13.5 percent year to year, the biggest leap since 1979, electricity, car repairs rent all up, same for medical costs, even trips to the dentist. With more people living paycheck to paycheck, the average household spending $460 more a month than a year ago, and mortgage rates also trending up. The 30-year fixed average creeped above 6 percent for the first time in 14 years. For everyday Americans, it's a lot. And the more entrenched inflation becomes, the thornier the recovery. On Tuesday, the Fed meets again, and you know the agenda. Analysts expect another rate hike, the fifth one this year. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Our Mark Strassmann reporting from Los Angeles. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Ukraine and recent setbacks for Russian President Vladimir Putin, both diplomatically and on the ground in Ukraine. That blue area is territory retaken by Ukraine in recent days, and they have made some horrific discoveries there. CBS News foreign correspondent Debora Patta reports. (Begin VT) DEBORA PATTA (voice-over): This is what Russian troops left behind when they fled Izyum in panic, a pine forest of death, more than 400 wooden crosses marking shallow graves, and new allegations of atrocities to add to a list of war crimes so long, it numbers over 30,000. It's overwhelming for investigators, who've been at it for months now. Multiple torture chambers across the region dispense the terror that kept civilian populations under control. These grim discoveries come after a lightning counteroffensive reclaimed most of the territory seized by Russia in the northeast at the start of the war. It began here in Bayrak, where Russian soldiers fled their bases down here in panic, clearing the way for Ukrainian forces to reshape the battlefields of Kharkiv. Vladimir Putin's war is not going according to plan. Here's Volodymyr Zelenskyy braving liberated towns near the front line to pay tribute to his soldiers this past week. President Zelenskyy... Where he told us he intends to keep Russian troops on the run. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (Ukrainian President): The main thing is, we are coming back, and we are on the way to the end. DEBORA PATTA: In striking contrast to Vladimir Putin, desperately needing allies, who has yet to visit his troops on the ground. (MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) DEBORA PATTA: Reduced to this, a video showing the leader of the Russian mercenary group Wagner recruiting prisoners for the war in Ukraine, promising freedom in exchange for fighting on the front line. Wagner has been accused of human rights atrocities in Syria and several African nations, raising the haunting fear of more wooden crosses on shallow graves in a country that has already endured unimaginable suffering. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Our Debora Patta reporting in Ukraine. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We are joined now by Andriy Kostin, the prosecutor general of Ukraine. Good morning and thank you for being here. ANDRIY KOSTIN, (Prosecutor General of Ukraine): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: We just saw our correspondent show some pretty horrific images of what is happening in your country. You keep a database of possible war crimes. You have more than 30,000 documented. How do you begin to sort through them and prioritize? ANDRIY KOSTIN: First of all, at the moment we have fixed (ph) 34,000 war crimes in Ukraine. When we are talking about prioritization, of course, the cases, like we see today and yesterday and days before of war crimes committed in Kharkiv region, including the Izium, of course, such cases are our priority. Nevertheless, we have a lot of cases which are still ongoing which started in places like Bucha and Irpin. And all of the shelling and destroying of all of civil objects in Ukraine are also fixed and then are also investigated. So, what we see now is, of course, the horrible amount of potential war crimes committed by Russian aggressor. I would like to say even that what we see now is a system of Russian aggressor. What they do on the occupied territory. And it seems that, for me, that whenever Russian army comes, they turn this place into new Bucha, as we see in Izium. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your president was on this program in the spring in the wake of Bucha, where it was horrific, the images. He called that genocide. Are you seeing evidence of genocide? Can you bring that case to a court? ANDRIY KOSTIN: We have a case on genocide in the office the prosecutor general. And we are in all the time in communication with international criminal court and Prosecutor Hahn (ph), because the International Criminal Court has also the authority to look at the genocide case. So, we understand that all of these facts put together will lead us to possible conviction in crime of genocide. MARGARET BRENNAN: No sitting leader has ever been prosecuted for genocide. Can you actually prove that Vladimir Putin authorized or knew all of what was happening under the command of his military? ANDRIY KOSTIN: Of course, it's not an easy way to prove that this system of command, responsibility from the highest level. What we understand at the moment, that the crime of aggression is definitely, we know who is responsible for it because the crime of aggression is the mother of all of these crimes, of war crimes, genocide, because without aggression there will be no other war crimes. And for that reason, for the crime of aggression, the highest political and military leadership should be prosecuted and should be punished. MARGARET BRENNAN: This past week the United States sanctioned the presidential commissioner for children's rights -- this is an odd title given what she's accused of -- who has overseen the taking of children and forcing them into Russia. Your ambassador has put that number at 91,000. There are reports that Secretary Blinken has cited that puts that number at 260,000 children taken from their families. How many of these kids can be returned and can you prove that this is part of this pattern you're talking about of genocide, an intent to destroy? ANDRIY KOSTIN: We definitely understand that the kidnapping and forcibly moving of our children of the future of Ukrainian nation, forcibly -- forcibly sent to Russia is, of course, from my point of view, is an element of potential genocide. I will tell you that at the moment we have more than 50 children, only 53, 55 children returned to Ukraine. Some of them now are in a safe place in Europe. But the number which we in the office of prosecutor general have is thousands and thousands of children, for which we have exact evidence that they were kidnapped and forcibly sent to Russia. We identified now more than 5.5 thousand (ph) children who were kidnapped and sent to Russia because we - MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ANDRIY KOSTIN: In our office, we need to identify definitely. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And the United States has now pointed that figure - figure - finger, excuse me, right at the Kremlin. I want to ask you about sex crimes and sexual assault and rape. There have been some horrific accounts, women chained in basements, children who are attacked. I don't even want to recite half of what I read yesterday. Is rape a deliberate act of subjugation being used by Russia? ANDRIY KOSTIN: We saw it in Bucha. We know that these cases where in Kharkiv region, which is now deliberated (ph), we have evidences of these cases. The most important is to find out proper evidences and to fix them properly. What - what I need - what I need at the moment now, I created a special unit in the prosecutor office general for the sexual violence crimes. And we have a specific team of prosecutors who are well trained for this category of crimes. The -- it's important for us to communicate with people and to find out these cases in order for the victims of these cases to report about them. And for this reason, we also are in close contact with our colleagues in European countries where a lot of people who -- Ukrainians who fled to Europe, some of them could be victims or witnesses of sexual violence crimes. And we are now communicating, trying to find also these cases. Not -- in the office of prosecutor general, we have now more than 40 ongoing investigations on cases where we definitely know that the crime of sexual violence was committed by Russian aggressors. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sir, thank you for your time today, Mr. Prosecutor General. ANDRIY KOSTIN: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good luck to you. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to democracy and politics. University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape studies political violence. And, Professor Pape, good morning to you. ROBERT PAPE (University of Chicago Professor of Political Science): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's good to have you here in person. When we spoke back in January about the research you've done at that point, you issued a warning that stuck with us because you talked about the threat of political violence around the midterm elections. We are 50 days away. What are you worried about now? ROBERT PAPE: Margaret, we have not just a political threat to our democracy, we have a violent threat to our democracy. It's important to remember that January 6th wasn't just trespassing and going into a federal building. Thousands of individuals used violence to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power. What we have been tracking at our center at the University of Chicago, the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, for a year and a half is the violent portion of that insurrectionist movement. Today, there are millions of individuals who don't just think the election was stolen in 2020, they support violence to restore Donald Trump to the White House. In fact, just over the weekend, that is just a few days ago, we conducted our most recent nationally representative survey. Today there are 13 million individuals -- the equivalent, I should say, of 13 million individuals who support the use of force to restore Donald Trump to the presidency. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about 5 percent of the U.S. population. ROBERT PATE: Five percent. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have extrapolated out from your research. That's obviously disturbing. I want to ask you about the context we are in right now because we're seeing a lot of stressors. The economy, clearly one of them, and what we've been talking about today, immigration. ROBERT PATE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And migration. You were on last time talking about something called the great replacement theory. And that is the belief among some of these insurrectionists that the Democratic Party is trying to replace voters with new people, more obedient voters. How widespread is that conviction and does what is happening now in cities up and down the East Coast trigger this? ROBERT PATE: It likely could, Margaret, reinforce these fears of the great replacement. To be clear, we're focusing on not just support for Trump, but the violent support for Trump that overrides democracy. And when you look at that, what you see is there are two big drivers among those 13 million individuals. The first driver is this fear of the great replacement. The idea that the Democratic Party is replacing the current electorate, the current white electorate with more minority voters from the third world. And you hear the -- MARGARET BRENNAN: And to be clear, non-U.S. citizens cannot vote in federal elections in the midterm races. ROBERT PATE: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be abundantly clear. Please continue. ROBERT PATE: That is correct. It is a conspiracy theory. But it's not just on fringe social media, like Parler, Gab, 4chan, 8chan. This is every day on Fox News. It's on Newsmax. It's on OneAmerica. It's on talk radio. So, this is driver number one. Driver number two is a belief in the QAnon cult idea, which, at first blush sounds a little -- almost laughable that they would believe a satanic group of pedophiles runs the U.S. government. But we've done focus groups with these folks and what they really mean by that, Margaret, is that there are politicians that have gotten on the Lolita Express with Jeffrey Epstein and have taken money for foundations, for political support. MARGARET BRENNAN: Corruption. ROBERT PATE: For corrupt. That's what's really what's going on. So, if you marry those two together, you have a dangerous cocktail. You have the fear of this great replacement happening by a Democratic Party and then you have the fear of corruption and immorality. And that's that dangerous combination that's leading to violent support against our democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you just mentioned QAnon. And, as you just explained, it's a set of conspiracy theories involving sex trafficking. And there is this belief that former President Trump is the one person -- or one of the people who could end it all. And I want to play some video here because at a political rally last night, Mr. Trump used a song titled after a QAnon slogan. I'm going to play the sound and listeners will have to listen to the music, not necessarily what the president is saying. Listen to the background music. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: It would never have happened with me as your commander in chief and for four long years it didn't happen. And China, with Taiwan, is next. (END VIDEO CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a QAnon song. The former president has posted images of himself wearing a \"q\" on his lapel on social media with the phrase \"the storm is coming.\" That's another one of their slogans. What does all of this mean and is it threatening? ROBERT PATE: First, it is threatening. Just to cut right to the heart of it. What it means is that the former president is willing to court, not just supporters of his, but those who support violence for his goals, number one of which is being restored to the White House. This is extremely disturbing because, well, in the fall of 2020, in a presidential debate, Donald Trump could be asked, well, do you know what a Proud Boy is or do you know what QAnon is, and he could say, oh, I'm not so sure. That's not the case today. Today it's quite clear and the problem that we face is that over and over, in tweets by the former president, he is deliberately stoking not just the fires of anger of getting him political support, but the fires that are leading to that violent 13 -- the equivalent of 13 million. And that is really the heart of our problem that we face as a threat to democracy because if it's just a political threat, well, then we can have elections. But once it's not just denying an election but using violence as the response to an election denial, now we're in a new game. And that's why it's so important we have this conversation. MARGARET BRENNAN: What has the FBI's search of the former president's home done to the people you are tracking? ROBERT PATE: So, what we've done in our poll, the one that we just recently did over the weekend, is we asked an additional question, which is, do you believe that the use of force is justified to prevent the prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information? And the numbers go up a bit. Not huge. Goes from 13 to 15 million. But, interestingly, when we pull apart the data, you get a slightly different set of supporters. So, what's really concerning is there's a little bit of ebb and flow that goes up, as we see new issues come on the horizon. And that means that we need to just realizes, this is really important and we need to have this national conversation about what we really want in our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's why we have you here today, to start that conversation, sir. Thank you for are sharing your information. ROBERT PATE: Thank you, Margaret. Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment. ROBERT PATE: Thank you. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett and CBS News election law contributor David Becker, who have a new book out on the state of American democracy. It's called \"The Big Truth: Upholding Democracy In The Age Of The Big Lie.\" Congratulations to you both. DAVID BECKER: Thank you very much. MAJOR GARRETT: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Major, I want to start with you because in those just literally the first page of the book you use the phrase \"American Civil War.\" You go on to write that in the upcoming election in November, and in 2024, trust itself is going to be tested. Democracy no longer suffers from a lack of participate energy, it suffers from a lack of respect, allegiance, knowledge, humanity, and most of all, trust. How dangerous is the moment that we are in? MAJOR GARRETT: It feels more dangerous, Margaret, than any I've encounter in covering politics at the national level since 1990. Stating what clearly what happened in 2020, it wasn't a fraudulent election, no crime was committed. That doesn't mean you have to be happy with the result. But one of the burdens of democracy is when you're unhappy with the result, your obligation is to win the next election, not slander baselessly the election you fairly lost. And we have a component of American politics now that wants to slander an elections that was fairly lost because they're unhappy. And that unhappiness does not entitle you to drag down American democracy because if, Margaret, we enter a phase in American life where either political party refuses to accept a fair and verified election simply because it lost, then we will dismantle democracy bit by bit before our very eyes. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of our colleagues here, Nicole Skinga (ph), interviewed Kim Wyman (ph). She is the senior election security lead at -- part of Homeland Security. She spent 30 years working in elections out in the state of Washington. And in this interview, she clearly is feeling that this threat is hitting home. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Some of the threats are real, you know, we're going to hang you, I hope somebody puts a bullet in your head, that kind of thing. So, it's unnerving. It's unnerving. (END VIDEO CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a Homeland Security official being moved to tears by what she is talking about. I mean, it's extremely powerful to me to hear that. How common is that right now? DAVID BECKER: Yes, unfortunately, it's very common. She, like so many of her colleagues, and she's seeing this because she's working with them, are facing an onslaught of threats and harassment and abuse in the aftermath of the 2020 election that is completely divorced from the reality of their success. The election professionals all over the country, red states, blue states, Republicans, Democrats, somehow managed the highest turnout we have ever seen in American history in the middle of a global pandemic. And the ultimate results of this election were -- withstood scrutiny from 60 courts around the country. It was remarkable. MARGARET BRENNAN: What's the scenario they fear this November? DAVID BECKER: They embrace aggressive transparency. They want everyone to see everything that they're doing. And yet despite the facts, despite that transparency, all that seems to matter is that some people believe that it is impossible for their candidate to lose. And if we get so divorced from that reality, we get so divorced from our democratic principles that, as Major said, we start being unwilling to accept the possibility of defeat, what might then -- what might be possible then? And we've already seen this. This isn't hypothetical. We've seen this on January 6th. And we could see in the future dozens of little January 6th not focused on Washington on one particular date, but focused in many different places on many different dates. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Major, you talk about the political benefits to calling 2020 into election, particularly for the former president. According to CBS numbers, in battleground states, over 60 percent of Republican candidates on the ballot are election deniers. Two of the best known, perhaps, Kari Lake out in Arizona and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania. Is this -- indulging this simply the cost of winning an endorsement from the former president, who is a political power house, or do they believe it? MAJOR GARRETT: It's certainly the former, getting presidents in -- President Trump's endorsement runs through a sieve that requires you to say the 2020 election was stolen. And if you say it the loudest of any of the Republicans also vying for that endorsement in any particular state, you're most likely to get that endorsement. And Kari Lake is an interesting example of this phenomenon. She said before the primary was decided that fraud was afoot. She said while votes were being counted fraud was afoot. She was trailing and then she came out ahead late in the process and said it was, then, therefore, legitimate. I would only say that is not a veil of hypocrisy, that is the very definition of hypocrisy. The exact process you assailed is the one that made you the GOP nominee. Therefore, it's legitimate only because you become the nominee? That doesn't add up. MARGARET BRENNAN: David, we've talked in the past about Democrats who have questioned the outcome of elections. Republicans often point to that when this is discussed. How concerned are you now that this kind of language is just becoming not normalized but made into just a political tool? DAVID BECKER: Yes, I'm very concerned about that because factually speaking right now we have the most professional, accurate, transparent, secure election system we've ever had. And it keeps getting better every election cycle. But - and -- MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's interesting you say that because, as you know, there has been this movement to change voting rights and to protect them. So, it is becoming discussed as if there is something, perhaps, not working right. DAVID BECKER: It's really troubling in the sense that while it's not moral equivalence here, it's not coming equally from both sides of the political spectrum, it is definitely coming overwhelmingly from the extreme right right now. There certainly are aspects of it coming from across the political spectrum. But we could get to a point that if this is seen as politics as usual, that this is just part of the game. We're going to be at a very, very dangerous point for our democracy. If the losing side cannot accept defeat, especially in a country that's divided 50-50. MAJOR GARRETT: The great fear I have, Margaret, is, politics is a lot like the NFL. It's a copycat league. Whatever succeeds, you replicate. On the right, in the Trump world now, the fastest way to social media fame and fundraising is to deny the 2020 election. You don't think Democrats aren't watching that? And maybe tempted by the same social media and fundraising lure that that has? They will be. That's why we have to stop it, back away from it and say, not here, not this place. This part of our civic life is sacred. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you both for sharing the book with us and your insights. We'll be back in a moment.

            "article_content": "French President Emmanuel Macron will have his work cut out for him over the next two weeks as he seeks re-election. He led the field after the first round of Sunday, winning almost 28% of the vote, almost five points ahead of far-right leader Marine Le Pen, with 23%. The two now go through to the second-round runoff on April 24. That was the case five years ago, too \u2013 but then, Le Pen getting through to the second round was a surprise. This time, Le Pen ran her campaign with her eye firmly fixed on the prize of the Elys\u00e9e presidential palace. The leader of the far-right National Rally party toned down her extremist rhetoric and avoided addressing any of the topics that might remind people that an image change does not mean a policy shift. There was no mention of her hardline stance on immigration, Islam or national identity. Macron is sure to change that over the next two weeks. It's expected there will be a candidates' debate, and he will raise those issues. He will also remind French voters that Le Pen has long been a fan of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Even as she condemned the invasion of Ukraine and very publicly visited some of the refugees who fled to France, she still believes Putin and France should be allies. The challenge for Macron now is to unite the left and center-left behind him for the second-round runoff. He said today that he also wanted to reach out to Le Pen's voters. He noted that he respected his opponent, but \"I fight against Madame Le Pen's ideas; I want to speak to her voters\". Most of the 10 candidates who lost yesterday's first round called on their supporters to block Marine Le Pen. However, that doesn't mean they will vote for Macron \u2013 they may simply abstain. When he rode in on a wave of change and optimism five years ago, Macron promised to rid France of the extremism that had brought Le Pen to the second round. However, extremism is clearly higher now than then. A third of voters yesterday chose a far-right candidate. And a further 22% voted for the far-left, meaning that more than half of the voters preferred an extremist \u2013 and Macron has failed utterly to fulfill his promise. Sunday's first round confirmed what was already a trend, as none of the traditional center-left and center-right candidates could even attract five% of the vote. Macron has disappointed many of the left and center-left voters who backed him in 2017 in order to block Le Pen. Many feel he is out of touch with what concerns people right now \u2013 the economy, their purchasing power and job security. Opinion polls show that Macron is considered a good statesman, and the best man to lead the country in a crisis. The French feel he has done a good job overall in handling the Covid pandemic, and backed his shuttle diplomacy over Ukraine. But that may not be enough to see him re-elected. \"Trust in Emmanuel Macron is higher than ever,\" Emmanuel Rivi\u00e8re, director of international polling at Kantar Public told CBS News. \"But when you want to be re-elected as president, you have to propose something for the five years to come. And I think it's not clear what Emmanuel Macron proposes to do in the five years to come.\" The same polls found that Le Pen was seen as being more aware of people's concerns and more likely to bring about changes to improve their financial lot. \"We're very close,\" Le Pen said Monday. \"I can win the second round.\" With just two weeks to convince voters to back them, the runoff candidates need to persuade those who voted for the other 10 candidates \u2013 and the 26% who abstained \u2013 to vote for them. The contest is far from over.",

            "article_content": "With President Biden's approval rating stuck in the mid-40s, inflation at a 40-year high, and voters historically inclined to punish the party in power in midterm elections, Democrats vying for seats in Congress are assessing whether and how to campaign with the president. As the president prepares to deliver his first State of the Union address, a new CBS News poll released on Tuesday morning found that Mr. Biden's approval rating remained at 44%. That rating is up one point from last month, and the same number he received in January and November CBS News polls.\u00a0 The president's approval rating started to fall last summer during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and fell even further as inflation became a bigger issue.\u00a0 Mr. Biden received 41% approval for his handling of Russia and Ukraine, but fewer than 40% of Americans approve of how he has handled crime, the economy, immigration and inflation. The president did receive a 51% approval for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, as case numbers have declined, and mask requirements are being lifted around the country.\u00a0 But if Mr. Biden's approval numbers hover around 40% on key issues for voters, it could threaten Democratic candidates across the country later this year. His approval rating remains at 78% among Democrats, but just 37% with independent voters.\u00a0 In October 2018, CBS News polling showed former President Donald Trump had a 42% approval rating, including support from 87% of Republicans, but only 38% of independent voters \u2014 similar to Mr. Biden's level of support. Republicans went on to lose control of the House that November.\u00a0 Party strategists and operatives advising campaigns say that Democrats aren't likely to turn down a visit from the president, but they aren't relying on him to carry over the finish line either. To compete in this environment, they say candidates will need to emphasize local concerns as much as possible, rather than national. They point to Mr. Biden's recent trip to Culpepper, Virginia, where he appeared with vulnerable Democratic Representative Abigail Spanberger to talk about prescription drug prices.\u00a0 And they expect candidates will appear with the president to tout ways in which the infrastructure bill signed into law last year helped their district or state.\u00a0 \"Democratic frontline members are very happy to stand by the president next to the bridge they got money for,\" said Chris Taylor, a spokesman for the House Democrats' campaign committee. \"They've each got to win their own races, and thanks to President Biden, they can point to delivering on major local priorities funded in the American Rescue Plan and the infrastructure package.\"\u00a0 But emphasizing local issues in races can be increasingly difficult to pull off, especially while standing next to the president of the United States. \"We are in such a polarized environment now that the days of a congressional incumbent outpolling the president are over,\" said former Representative Steve Israel, who chaired the Democrats House campaign arm for the elections in 2012 and 2014.\u00a0 \"In an environment like this, you can't escape the national,\" Israel said. But, \"You can edit it to be local.\"\u00a0 CBS News reached out to 15 top Democratic Senate campaigns in nine battleground states on Monday to ask if they would welcome a campaign visit from the president and what they'd want his message to be. Six of those campaigns responded and said they would welcome a presidential visit. They also encouraged Mr. Biden to get out of Washington, where some key items of the president's agenda are stuck in both intra-party and partisan politics.\u00a0 \"Every day the president and vice president are out with real people and not in Washington is a good day for Democrats and for the president's agenda,\" said Matthew Daggett, deputy campaign manager to Pennsylvania Senate candidate Malcolm Kenyatta.\u00a0 \"I think it's always an asset to have the president campaign,\" DSCC Chairman Senator Gary Peters told CBS News. \"But as to where he goes, in individual states, ultimately it's up to the individual candidates and senators to determine what they would like to see.\" \u00a0 Mr. Biden told reporters earlier this year that he does plan to get on the road more. Democratic senators told White House chief of staff Ron Klain at a meeting last week to preview the State of the Union that they like seeing him out around the country, talking about achievements. After his State of the Union address, he will travel to Superior, Wisconsin, to talk about infrastructure. Republican Senator Ron Johnson is also up for re-election in that state. The president is also keenly aware that the outcome of the 2022 midterms have consequences not only for his agenda, but also for his own reelection prospects. Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Florida, Arizona, Nevada and New Hampshire all have key Senate races this year, and are critical presidential battleground states.\u00a0 \"It makes sense when we are thinking about 2024 to begin to lay the groundwork for 2022 in those states,\" a White House adviser told CBS News. \"It's working to elect governors to be partners with us in state houses, working to elect people in the Senate to help build on the seats we have now, but also put that infrastructure in now so we are running stronger, harder and faster headed into 2024\u2026he's clear eyed about that.\" The adviser insisted the midterms are a political priority for the president, saying \"Anybody who has paid enough attention to his life's work knows the party matters to him, he's a party builder.\" To that end, Biden and the DNC earlier this month announced a $15 million transfer to the campaign committees for House and Senate Democrats.\u00a0 Groups allied with the White House to push Mr. Biden's accomplishments have already made major investments in battleground races.\u00a0 Building Back Together, a nonprofit organization focused on supporting the president's agenda, has spent more than $25 million on paid media in eight competitive states and dozens of House districts.\u00a0 Danielle Melfi, the executive director of Building Back Together, said the group knows that \"people are affected\" by rising costs and the ongoing pandemic. She stressed that Mr. Biden \"shares people's frustrations\" and said her group wants to double down on its investments to demonstrate tangible impacts from the Biden administration. \"There's a lot at stake in elections and we want to make sure folks know the great work that has already been done to try to make their lives better this past year,\" Melfi said. Republicans are eager to tie Democratic candidates to Mr. Biden throughout the midterm cycle due to the president's low approval ratings. \"These numbers are showing us where the American people are right now, and they do not have confidence in Joe Biden or the Democrat Party,\" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told reporters on Monday.\u00a0 And not every major candidate is welcoming the president with open arms. Former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, who has focused his Texas gubernatorial campaign on local issues like the state's power grid, told reporters in January that he is \"not interested in any national politician \u2014 anyone outside of Texas \u2014 coming into this state to help decide the outcome of this.\" The president's party normally has a difficult\u00a0time with the first-term midterm elections, especially for House candidates. In 2018, two years after Trump won, Republicans lost 40 House seats and the majority, but managed to gain two Senate seats. In 2010, two years after Barack Obama won the presidency, Democrats lost 63 seats and control of the House, as well as six Senate seats.\u00a0 While Democrats narrowly hold the Senate majority due to Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote, they lost seats in the House in 2020. In 2022, Republicans just need to flip just five seats to take over the lower chamber.\u00a0 There have already been warning signs for Democrats after Republicans won a hotly contested gubernatorial race in Virginia and came much closer than projected to capturing the governor's mansion in New Jersey.\u00a0 In the past, Mr. Biden was seen as an asset on the campaign trail. During the 2018 midterms, he campaigned for 60 candidates in 24 states, establishing relationships with Democrats ahead of his own presidential campaign. After winning the presidency, Mr. Biden campaigned for now Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in the January 2021 Georgia runoffs, reminding voters that the Senate majority, and his own agenda, was at stake.\u00a0 Over a year into his presidency, those dynamics have shifted. Democrats note that candidates like Warnock outperformed the president in their races.\u00a0 \"Because Senate campaigns are the top of the ticket this year and because senators have such large and distinct brands in the eyes of voters, they tend to be a contest of two candidates,\" said DSCC Communications Director David Bergstein.\u00a0 \"I know that the folks around here are focused on the politics. I'm focused on the people I was sent to represent,\" Senator Warnock said when asked if he wants Biden to come to Georgia to campaign for him. \"I came here as a pastor and that's still the lense through which I do everything that I do. I'm trying to do the most good for as many people as I can for as long as I can.\"\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Kari Lake, Republican candidate for governor in Arizona, that aired on Sunday, Oct. 9, 2022 on \"Face the Nation.\" MAJOR GARRETT: Now to the race for governor of Arizona. Our latest poll shows Democrat Katie Hobbs and Republican Kari Lake tied at 49%. The two candidates have not scheduled a debate but they are here to answer our questions. Each candidate will have about eight and a half minutes, we intend to cover the same issues with each candidate. issues identified by our own polling as of leading concern to Arizona voters. Our ability to cover this ground, of course, will be influenced in no small measure by the length of the candidates answers. First Republican Carrie Lake, who joins us from Phoenix. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR AZ GOV KARI LAKE: Good morning, Major. Thank you so much for having me on. Just to clarify, I have agreed to any and all debates, and I will be taking part in one without my opponent next week on the 12th. I would love it if she would show up because I think there's a lot of important issues that the people of Arizona need to hear about.\u00a0 MAJOR GARRETT: We'll get to that, I promise. Your website is detailed and specific on the question of immigration and border security. You call, if elected as governor, for Arizona to join other states to form what you call a compact to carry out border security separate from the federal government, including arrest and detention. For the benefit of Arizona voters, can you explain the legal and practical application of this approach? LAKE: Well, of course, if you know the Constitution, you know that Article 4, Section 4 calls for the federal government to protect us from invasion, and under Joe Biden's lack of leadership, we just aren't seeing that. And we have an invasion at our border, the cartels, these Narco terrorist groups have operational control. And they're using Arizona to smuggle people, to traffic children and to traffic the most dangerous drug we've ever seen, fentanyl. And so we're going to invoke our Article One, Section 10, basically, authority to take care of our own border and protect our own border. It's right there in black and white in the Constitution. And we meet all three criteria, we have an invasion, our people are in imminent danger, and time is of the essence. There's no time for delay. So we're going to have other states offer help. I've already got a couple other governors who are willing to help out. And I know that if you ask people in other states that are not border states, they deem this crisis on the border as one of the top issues facing our country\u2013 \u00a0 MAJOR GARRETT: Would Arizona\u2013\u00a0 LAKE: with young people dying of fentanyl poisoning right now. MAJOR GARRETT: Would Arizona go it alone if it didn't get this compact agreement with other states? LAKE: Yes, we will. But I believe we will get help. I've already talked to some other governors and they're- they're vowing to help us out wherever they can, because they realize that what comes into Arizona, fentanyl, people coming here illegally, children being trafficked, doesn't stay in Arizona, it goes to all 50 states. And I just spoke last week to a mother and father who lost their son. And it's just tragic. We're losing more people to fentanyl in Arizona, since Joe Biden took office than we lost in 9/11 or during COVID. MAJOR GARRETT: If, as there would likely be, federal challenges were presented, would you as governor await for those federal challenges to this state compact be resolved? And would you respect them if they were to any way impinge upon or restrict or nullify the state compact approach? LAKE: We will, we will challenge the federal government. If they're going to challenge us, I think we have the right to do this. And we will have attorneys file lawsuits as well. But we're not going to back down and let our people be overrun with drugs, watch our children die. We had a 16 year old die here in the metro area last week from a fentanyl overdose. We can't keep having this happen. We're losing our young generation. So I hope that Joe Biden doesn't fight us because then it would really look like he is on the side of the cartels. And I don't think he wants the people to think that MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 Your website also says that Washington D.C. incentivizes illegal immigration to satisfy, quote, big business lust for cheap labor. Does that big business lust reside in Arizona at all? LAKE: I think it resides everywhere. And we saw it with Nancy Pelosi last week. I mean, it was the most racist thing. I think I've heard her say although she said quite a few things that are offensive. She said these people coming in illegally should go pick fruit in the South. I mean, I couldn't believe my ears, MAJOR, when I heard that. We want to make sure that our middle class and our working class are healthy. The Democrats used to care about our working class. And now they appear that they don't. They want to see 5 million people come in. These 5 million people were this thing. They're not staying on the streets. It's American citizens who are homeless. And they're taking jobs from hard working Arizonans, and we're going to start putting Arizona first and protecting our citizens in this state. MAJOR GARRETT: Nominee Lake our polling shows that abortion is a very important issue to Arizona vote voters you have been quoted as saying Arizona will be a state where we will not be taking the lives of our unborn anymore. You've also more recently been quoted as saying that in Arizona abortion should be rare and legal. Are those statements consistent? LAKE: I-I was in an interview when I said that, and I was I was telling the interviewer that when abortion was first presented, they said it should be. It should be rare, safe and legal. And now it's become anything but rare. In Katie Hobbs' world, you can ask her about this, I understand she's coming up next, they're for abortion right up until birth, if you are in the hospital in labor, the abortionists are for giving you an abortion, If you desire one. MAJOR GARRETT: What are you for?\u00a0 LAKE: We need to draw the line- We need to draw the line somewhere. I am going to be the executive of the state, the chief executive officer, and I will follow the law. The law right now as it stands is Governor Ducey's law at 15 weeks, so we'll follow the law. MAJOR GARRETT: Would you seek to restrict abortions be-be-beyond- closer than 15 weeks? LAKE: May I finish?\u00a0 MAJOR GARRETT: Sure. LAKE I am- I'm a woman. I'm a mother. I'm all for women's health care. I come from a large family, seven sisters I have, of course I want women's health care. This has moved beyond health care. We're not giving women choices. I'm for giving women true choices. And when they walk into an abortion center, they're only given one choice. And they're not told that you have the choice to keep your baby, and we can help and here's how. Or we can help you find a loving family who will adopt your baby. I want to give women true choices. I will uphold the law, whatever that law is. And I want to see to it that we've save more lives. Right now the Democrats have started pushing so far from that rare but safe, to anything goes up to nine months of pregnancy, after birth. Katie Hobbs my opponent actually has voted for, and you look at her voting record, allowing a baby who survives an abortion that the hospital would refuse medical care and allow the baby to die on a cold metal tray. She voted for that. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 We will take that up with Katie Hobbs, I guarantee you. This week, Nominee Lake, a 64 year old Iowa man was arrested and charged for threatening to lynch Maricopa County Supervisor Clint Hickman. In reaction, Hickman said, \"people in positions of influence and leadership in Arizona are silent. How can you be silent?\" Do you have a reply from Mr. Hickman? And would you support, and do you support federal and state prosecution of anyone who threatens the lives of an election worker? LAKE: I think that anyone who threatens anyone's life should be detained and questioned. I'm not for violence in any way. And I should remind you that, you know, during COVID, when a lot of Americans were faced with not being able to use their free speech to speak out against what was happening, they were losing their jobs, they were losing their businesses, they were being forced to get shots that they didn't want. People were being bullied and-and attacked and also threatened during that time. I think we need to get back to where we have free speech and we shouldn't be threatening people, and I hope that they arrest that man and detain him. MAJOR GARRETT: Earlier this week, Blake Masters, as you know, Republican nominee for the Senate said he has not seen evidence of vote counting problems or election results that would have changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. He also said President Biden is the legitimate president. Do you agree? LAKE: I think we have major problems in our election system. And when it goes back to 2000. We had Democrats saying the 2000 election wasn't fair. They were complaining the 2004 election wasn't fair. 2016, Kamala Harris spoke out and said that the electronic voting machines were hacked in front of her eyes and nobody called them election deniers. And now all of a sudden in 2020, Garrett, we don't have free speech anymore. We can't speak out against our own elections. All I'm asking for is the ability to speak out when our government does something wrong. We should be able to speak out against it\u2013 MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 Do you agree with the statement that Blake Masters made? LAKE: I- I'm not going to take on what Blake said. I'm going to take on what I said. And what I say is we have problems in our election. They haven't been solved in 2016. They weren't solved in '18. Just a month or two ago during our primary election. And I'm sure your voters- your viewers don't even know this. Katie Hobbs' office advised the counties on how many ballots to print. This was two months ago\u2013 MAJOR GARRETT: Nominee Lake\u2013\u00a0 LAKE: and they under printed ballots in our biggest county, and they ran out of Republican only ballots one hour into voting. We have to restore honesty to our elections; we must restore honesty. MAJOR GARRETT: In fairness, restore, in fairness and in timing for both you and Katie Hobbs. We have to end it there. Thank you very much for being with us on FACE THE NATION. We'll be back in just one minute. Stay with us.",

            "article_content": "Texas' incumbent Republican Gov. Greg Abbott could be facing his closest Democratic challenger ever, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, the one-time Democratic star who is risking his second straight election statewide loss in Texas.\u00a0 Early voting ended Friday, with almost 4.8 million Texans voting before Election Day, far fewer than the nearly 9 million who voted early in 2020, a presidential election year. Former President Donald Trump, who won the state twice, visited South Texas to help drive up voter participation and campaign for Republicans. He also hit the deep-red 27th Congressional District, although his rally was in Nueces County, which he won twice, but O'Rourke carried it in 2018. Abbott skipped the rally, but Trump lavished praise on him anyway, calling him a \"wonderful man\" and saying O'Rourke wanted to \"abolish guns, God and oil.\"\u00a0 Abbott is seeking a third term, while O'Rourke, his Democratic challenger,is hoping to become the first Democrat to be elected statewide in Texas since 1994, when George W. Bush won the governor's race against Ann Richards.\u00a0 Abbott has opened up a double-digit lead in two recent polls, coming after months of what appeared to be a tightening race. Both O'Rourke and Abbott have raised huge sums of money, with over $100 million raised this year alone.\u00a0 He was first elected in 2014 by 20 points and won reelection in 2018 by 13 points \u2013 the same year as O'Rourke's failed Senate run. Abbott has been mentioned as a possible presidential contender, too,\u00a0 following in the footsteps of his predecessors, Bush and former Gov. Rick Perry.\u00a0 Despite his consistent lead in the polls, Abbott hasn't taken this election lightly, especially given O'Rourke's strong run for Senate in 2018 and President Joe Biden's relative success, compared to any Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton in 1996, losing to Trump by under 6 points.\u00a0 O'Rourke spent the summer traveling the state as part of a \"Drive for Texas,\" hitting 70 cities over around 50 days. After a brief hiccup at the end \u2013 hospitalization and a break from the road \u2013 he ended up crisscrossing the state and hitting Republican areas (Alpine in West Texas and Lockhart in central Texas), swing areas (the Rio Grande Valley and the Dallas suburbs), the diverse cities (Houston and San Antonio) and the Democratic heart of Texas, Austin.\u00a0 O'Rourke needs them all to win: Voters of color, Republican Texans to flip, suburban swing voters, youth voters and all the true blue Texas Democrats he can get. He brought out two larger-than-life Texas Democrats, Cecile Richards, the daughter of the late Texas Gov. Ann Richards, and Luci Baines Johnson, the daughter of the late President Lyndon Johnson to campaign with him in Austin.\u00a0 O'Rourke told CBS News in an interview in September that while he was out on the road, he saw \"so many people demanding change \u2013 and they're not typing it out on Twitter, or yelling it at the TV.\"\u00a0 \"They're showing up at our events and then signing up, to go knock on doors and meet voters and win this election so that we can overcome these challenges,\" he added. On his social media feeds, O'Rourke often highlights Trump supporters or Republicans who have decided to vote for him \u2013 and said in the interview that when he was in El Campo, a Trump supporter asked him to sign a MAGA hat.\u00a0 But as O'Rourke hit the road this summer to travel to 70 cities throughout the state, at many of his stops, he was greeted by protesters and hecklers. At his last stop of that trip in Lockhart, Texas, at the beginning of September, a group of protesters said they consider themselves the \"three Musketeers\" who protest O'Rourke.\u00a0 \"He isn't welcome, especially in Bastrop,\" said Monica Carson, the legislative chair of the Lost Pines Republican women and one of the protesters at the Lockhart event. Former President Donald Trump carried Bastrop County by more than 13 points in 2020. \"There's so many people moving here from Democratic states that are trying to turn Texas blue. And us Texans are standing up [against] it.\" In 2018, O'Rourke appealed to donors outside Texas borders, bringing in a record $80 million over the course of the race and eventually landing more than 4 million votes \u2013 more than 2 million more than the last Democratic candidate for Senate in the state. But he still fell almost 3 points short of toppling Cruz.\u00a0 It's been a rocky road since then. O'Rourke launched a presidential bid that first garnered huge attention \u2013 a Vanity Fair cover and a then-record-breaking first-day fundraising haul of over $6 million \u2013 but he dropped out in Nov. 2019 before any votes were cast after going to the left on guns. Only a month later, the Texas House Democratic Campaign Committee leaked advised candidates not to appear with him, showing his possible vulnerability even in his own state.\u00a0 Despite his continued strength in the state, Abbott has been preparing for O'Rourke, filling a war chest of $55 million in June 2021, six months before O'Rourke even announced he would be running.\u00a0 But he has moved further to the right in the past eight years, launching a National Guard mission along the border called Operation Lone Star, loosening gun laws, signing a restrictive abortion law in 2021 \u2013 ahead of the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe \u2013 and pushing through a voter law that led to Democrats fleeing the state.\u00a0 Then there was the 2021 Texas freeze, which led to a dayslong power outage throughout most of the state, exposing the state's shaky power grid. According to a Dec. 2021 report by the Texas Department of Health Services, 246 deaths were blamed on the storm, making it one of the state's worst natural disasters in history.\u00a0 The criticism of Abbott's response to the freeze stood in stark contrast to the praise he received for the response to Hurricane Harvey, which slammed the Gulf Coast with days of rain in 2017. Days after the hurricane hit near Corpus Christi as a Category 4 storm, Abbott elevated a moderate Democrat, Texas A&M University chancellor John Sharp, to lead the newly-formed Governor's Commission to Rebuild Texas. The state's top emergency management official praised Abbott as being \"24/7\" to the Texas Tribune, and Trump praised Abbott when he came down to Corpus shortly after the hurricane hit.\u00a0 When O'Rourke launched his bid for governor, he hit Abbott hard over the grid failure \u2013 and continued through a February 2022 storm when Abbott said \"no one can guarantee\" the power would stay on.\u00a0 But that slip didn't compare with what was to come from Abbott. On May 24, an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 children and two teachers before being shot and killed by a Border Patrol officer who responded. At a press conference with local and state officials in Uvalde the day after the shooting, Abbott said the shooting \"could have been worse\" if not for the response of law enforcement. In the days and weeks following the shooting, local authorities provided shifting \u2013 and often conflicting \u2013 accounts of what happened. Abbott was forced to backtrack, said he'd been \"misled\" about the shooting, and although O'Rourke and other Democrats called for Abbott to call a special session of the Legislature to investigate, Abbott instead convened a committee of three legislators to conduct a probe.\u00a0 Ahead of the report's release, surveillance video of the shooting was leaked that showed officers waiting in the hallway for 77 minutes \u2013 in some cases, even as the screams of children could be heard. The committee's report found that 376 law enforcement officers in total responded to the shooting, and said there had been \"systemic failures and egregiously poor decision making.\" On May 25, O'Rourke crashed Abbott's press conference and confronted him over gun laws, telling him \"you are doing nothing\" and blasted him for not acting after other deadly mass shootings in the state. In typical O'Rourke fashion, the video went viral and led to a fundraising blitz.\u00a0 A dark money group called \"Coulda Been Worse\" has taken out millions in advertisements targeting Abbott and other Republicans, including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton.\u00a0 In Austin two weeks after the shooting, Imelda Garza, who said she was a gun owner and a Republican, of nearby Georgetown said she messaged a friend and recalled that after seeing O'Rourke confront Abbott. Garza said she is from South Texas and came from a family of gun owners, but she said the shooting and the response was \"outrageous.\"\u00a0 \"All he was trying to do was stand up for the children of Texas, and if Texas changes, maybe we can change more states and more hearts,\" she said about O'Rourke at the press conference.\u00a0 It's the type of voter O'Rourke needs, and he knows it O'Rourke has often touted his forays into the redder parts of the state, even kicking off his road trip this summer in rural Texas, which carried Cruz to victory in 2018 with a more than 50-point advantage.\u00a0 As he got back on the campaign trail in Laredo at the end of August, O'Rourke said \"for us to make up this ground right now, we need you all. It will not be the Democratic party, it will not be the candidates by themselves. It will not be some magical amount of money or mysterious message that we come up with ourselves in a focus group, it is going to be the people of this community, in this room right now, who have been written out of this democracy before.\"\u00a0 One of O'Rourke's frequent lines on the campaign trail is \"it does not matter, no me importa, if you're a Republican or a Democrat, or an independent\" as long as you're there to listen. \t But at one town hall in Mineral Wells, Texas \u2013 located about 50 miles from Fort Worth, straddling the border of the red Texas Panhandle \u2013 O'Rourke lost his cool on a hecker who laughed as he talked about the Uvalde shooting. \"It may be funny to you, motherf*****, but it's not funny to me,\" O'Rourke said as the room erupted in cheers.\u00a0 O'Rourke told CBS News in the Sept. interview that he feels \"bad for them, their candidate won't show up. They're never seen Greg Abbott.\" \"They're every bit as important as every other Texan, whether they support me, or oppose me,\" O'Rourke said. \"And what I've often found is that when we invite these protesters in, they've got very thoughtful questions, they have concerns that are the same ones, frankly, that I have about the direction of this state.\" Abbott has tried to tie O'Rourke to rising crime and the Biden administration, especially on immigration and the economy. A CBS News poll from June had gas prices, inflation and the economy ranked as the three most important issues to Texans. Immigration and crime were not listed, although Abbott has run ads accusing O'Rourke of supporting the \"defund the police\" movement.\u00a0 In April, Abbott started busing migrants from Texas to Washington, D.C., saying he was \"going to take the border\" to the Biden administration. He followed up by sending migrants to the Democrat-run cities of New York and Chicago. Mayors Muriel Browser of D.C. and Eric Adams of New York have criticized the move, and Adams has alleged Abbott never contacted him before sending migrants to the city.\u00a0 While O'Rourke has on the trail decried the program as a \"stunt,\" a majority of Texans support the program, according to a Texas Public Policy poll from Sept. O'Rourke, who represented a border city, El Paso, has not shied away from immigration and has campaigned extensively in South Texas and the Rio Grande Valley.\u00a0 The two candidates met at what will likely be the only debate on Sept. 30, in the Rio Grande Valley. O'Rourke slammed\u00a0 Abbott on immigration, noting that he's been in power for eight years and still,\u00a0 \"you blame everyone else\" for the immigration crisis. \u00a0 Prior to the debate, a focus group told Nexstar that 40% supported Abbott, 27% backed O'Rourke, and 33% were undecided. After the debate, 50% supported O'Rourke, 43% supported Abbott, and 7% were undecided.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click\u00a0here\u00a0to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Last week was an extremely troubling one in American politics. We now have just eight days left until Election Day, and the country is feeling deeply unsettled. Our CBS News Battleground Tracker poll out this morning shows that a stunning 79 percent -- that's nearly eight in 10 likely voters -- say that the country is out of control. That's an ominous sign for the Democrats, who hold power in Washington. Of those 79 percent expected to vote next Tuesday, Republicans have a more than 20-point advantage. Two issues, the health of the economy and the health of American democracy, have taken center stage in this campaign, and it is the latter subject and the political rhetoric that could help fuel violence that is under fresh scrutiny following Friday's attack on Paul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, at their home in San Francisco. CBS News congressional correspondent Scott MacFarlane has more. (Begin VT) SCOTT MACFARLANE (voice-over): The day after the horrific attack, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed gratitude for law enforcement and her husband's medical team and said she and her family were heartbroken and traumatized by the life-threatening attack. President Biden spoke with the Pelosis on Saturday. JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): Don't know for certain, but it looks like this was intended for Nancy. He kept asking: \"Where's Nancy? Where's Nancy?\" SCOTT MACFARLANE: Forty-two-year-old David DePape will face a series of felony charges in the coming days, including attempted homicide, accused of striking the 82-year-old Pelosi in the head multiple times with a hammer. DePape's social media posts are saturated with conspiracy theories, Holocaust denial and claims of election fraud. Democrats argue Republicans must do more to denounce the violence and end the baseless claims that could fuel threats. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That's the problem. We can't just say, I feel badly about the violence and we condemn it. Condemn what produces the violence. And this talk produces the violence. SCOTT MACFARLANE: The attack on Paul Pelosi is the latest in a growing wave of threats and plots against elected officials. Capitol Police records obtained by CBS News show nearly 10,000 investigations into threats on members of Congress last year. Georgia Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock has spent heavily on security this election cycle. Our Nikole Killion caught up with him on the campaign trail. SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-Georgia): I'm not naive about the tough moment we're in. And there are people who are trying to stir that up for short- term political gain game. It's dangerous stuff. SCOTT MACFARLANE: Meanwhile, an intelligence bulletin obtained by CBS News warns of a heightened threat from domestic extremist groups on and after Election Day, not just possible targeting of elected officials, but of elections administrators, political rallies and of possible attempts to intimidate voters or use claims of fraud to justify violence after the election, especially in cases where it takes additional time to certify the results. (End VT) SCOTT MACFARLANE: Despite baseless claims of fraud, the 2020 election is considered the most secure and successful in U.S. history. And voting so far in 2022 has been safe and secure. So far, more than 20 million people have voted early, and elections officials say they're being vigilant and coordinating with police, emphasizing, everyone should feel safe coming out to vote -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott MacFarlane, thank you. We go now to Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also known as CISA. That's the Homeland Security agency tasked with securing America's cybersecurity infrastructure and coordinating with states on election security. And you're going to be very busy. I'm glad you're here with us today. JEN EASTERLY (Director, U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency): Great to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about this bulletin, first off. It warns, domestic violent extremists may view election-related infrastructure, personnel and voters as attractive targets. Are you aware of immediate and credible threats? DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: No. Let me be very clear at the top. We have no information about specific or credible threats to disrupt or compromise election infrastructure. I want that to be very clear. We are putting out information, like the warnings that you mentioned, to make sure that state and local election officials have the information that they need to protect their voting systems and their election infrastructure. That said, Margaret, it is a very complex threat environment. You have cyber threats. You have insider threats. You have rampant disinformation. And, yes, very worryingly, you have threats of harassment, intimidation and violence against election officials, polling places and voters. Let's be really clear. That has to stop. It is unacceptable behavior. It's undemocratic. And we all need to work together to ensure that this is a safe and secure election. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it is the states that administer the election. You are providing support to them. What is the Election Day plan for security and then communication? What are we going to hear and see? DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: So, on Election Day, actually, we at CISA are going to be in our own operations center. We're going to have federal government partners, private sector partners there, and then we're going to be in direct communication with all of the state and local election officials whose job it is to run and administer elections. We're going to be working to share information, and we're going to be working to be able to respond to anything that happens. But, remember, at the end of the day, the relationship between local officials and local law enforcement is incredibly important. And I was really encouraged by the opinion piece that came out yesterday with the sheriff in Massachusetts, one in Colorado, talking about the fact that ensuring election security is a nonpartisan issue, and threats to election officials have to stop. So, that connectivity at the local level, the information sharing, the planning and exercising that's happening is really important to ensuring security at the -- at the polling place and at the ballot box. MARGARET BRENNAN: We talk a lot about rhetoric and the risk of triggering violence. And social media is a place where false information often spreads. So, I want to ask you about what's happening now at Twitter. It's now privately owned by billionaire Elon Musk. This morning, he tweeted a conspiracy theory about Nancy Pelosi's husband. Given how charged our environment is, are you concerned about how this platform might change and that it's going to make your job more difficult? DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Well, first of all, horrific attack on Mr. Pelosi, and thoughts and prayers go to their family. That is a decision that social media companies, that Twitter will make. They make their own decisions, based on terms of service. I am laser- focused... MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the owner himself tweeting this out. DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: I am laser-focused on the next nine days and the time that comes after elections on doing everything we can to ensure security. I do want to be very clear on this, though, Margaret. These elections, election officials, these are not faceless backroom bureaucrats. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Right? These are our relatives, our friends, our neighbors. They're in our community. They are dedicated public servants that are working day in and day out to ensure the security of elections. And they deserve not just our support, but our admiration and respect. And they deserve to be safe. And we all need to be responsible about ensuring that's a safe and secure environment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why I'm asking you about the place where these conspiracy theories spread. The FBI report, when we looked at it, in terms of those direct threats to election workers, highlighted Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Wisconsin as places where voter intimidation and threats to election workers have been seen. Are these areas of greatest concern for you? DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Concerned across the board. We have cyber threats from nation states and cyber criminals. You have insider threats. You have physical threats, as we talked about, and then you have disinformation, so, disinformation, foreign influence that can be used to sow discord, that can undermine confidence in election integrity and that can be used to incite violence. So, what are we doing? We're doing a couple things. First of all, we're putting out information about tactics and disinformation and how to build resilience against disinformation. We have a rumor vs.reality site that's basically election literacy. But, most importantly, we are amplifying the voices of local and state election officials. They are the trusted voices that understand how elections work. If anybody has questions about voting or what -- how it all works, you should go to their local -- local election officials. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So, that's who they should be following on Twitter and social media? DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Those are the experts. MARGARET BRENNAN: Find out who your local election official is and follow their account? DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Exactly. Exactly. And, you know, I should point out, the National Association of Secretaries of State, NASS.org, TrustedInfo2022, a great source for information, as well as the National Association of Election Directors, NASED.org, frequently asked questions. That's the best -- best place to go. They know how elections happen. If you've seen one state in an election, you've seen one state. It's actually surprisingly technical and complicated, and that's why I welcome people asking questions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: You know, the beauty of democracy is that it's participatory. We can all have a role. So, volunteer, be a poll worker, ask questions, the more transparency, the better. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I want to ask you about the foreign threat. In 2016, Russia probed voter registration logs. We know there are warnings about what China is doing right now. How effective has this campaign by Beijing been? And are there other state actors or non-state actors you're concerned about? DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: Yeah, we've seen Russia, we've seen Iran, we've seen China use the playbook for influence operations. That's why it's so important that Americans realize... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now. DIRECTOR JEN EASTERLY: ... that they need to build resilience against that. If you see information that's on the Internet, you're not sure whether it's true, be critical about it, ask questions, look at the source, investigate it, and don't spread that information any more broadly and give -- basically give foreign adversaries a chance to manipulate Americans and to sow discord and to create lack of confidence in our elections. But I want to be very, very clear. I have confidence in the elections that are going to be run because of the massive amount of work that's been done across the federal government, at state and local election officials, with election vendors, to put multiple, multiple layers of resilience and security controls in place. I am confident that elections will be safe and secure, and the American people should have confidence in the integrity of elections when they go to the ballot box, when they cast their vote. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, good luck to you. It will be a busy next few days and weeks. Thank you very much. And we turn now to the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Minnesota Congressman Tom Emmer. Good morning. Good to have you here in person. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER (R-Minnesota): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to ask you about what we've just been talking about here. How concerned are you about the risk of political violence, and how should it be minimized? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: There's no place for violence, period, in our society, physical violence or violence against someone's property. I think you've already covered that here this morning. The incident in San Francisco, tragic as it is, I think we need some more information about it, but we should all be feeling for Paul Pelosi and his family. Hopefully, there will be a 100 percent recovery. MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to be abundantly clear, you denounce any kind of attack on the Pelosi family? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Absolutely. There should be no attacks, period. There should be no violence in our society, again, whether it's political or otherwise. There's no place for it in a civilized society. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm glad you said that, because I want to ask you about something in our CBS News poll that shows that, even as Republicans are poised to lead this contest and -- and take control of the House, we see suspicion, specifically among Republicans, about the voting process. A big majority of Republicans support the idea of private citizens challenging election officials as they process and report vote counts on election night. We're seeing that on the screen now. Two-thirds of Republicans support the idea of private citizens patrolling around ballot drop boxes and polling places. This is just Republicans. We don't see this with Democrats. We do not see this with independents. Would you urge private citizens not to patrol polling places? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Well, you picked the words, Margaret. I would say that it is Republicans, Democrats, independents. All American citizens are very acutely aware, as your previous guest just mentioned, about our election process. I think this is going to be a very good election, because people are awake. They're paying attention. They should volunteer as poll watchers. It's a state-based system. Whatever your state requires and allows, you should definitely be involved. And I think it's going to help the process. MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to be abundantly clear, poll watching is different than voter intimidation, which is unlawful. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Nobody should be intimidated when they're exercising their most precious right to vote. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when you see video, as we have seen in a place like in Arizona, where you see individuals with tactical gear, where you see individuals with weapons outside drop boxes, where -- how do you classify that? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Again, no one should feel intimidated when they're exercising their right to vote. MARGARET BRENNAN: That is intimidating? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: You've got -- you've got stories on both sides of the aisle. You have got stories in many different states about how people have felt as though their right was infringed on. I think cooler heads need to prevail. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: I really think we're going to have a good election. I think you've got 15-million plus that have already participated in early voting across this country. I think you're going to have a big turnout in nine days from now on the election. And I think, again, Republicans, Democrats and others are well aware of the issues that we had during COVID. People were stepping up and trying to do things to make sure we were protected and safe, but they were adjusting election laws on the fly. I think a lot of that has been resolved. I think you're going to see a really good experience in nine days. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So you would urge citizens not to patrol polling places? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Again, I urge everyone, get involved. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Whatever your state allows, get involved. Volunteer. MARGARET BRENNAN: I need... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Exactly what your... MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... your previous guest said. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because I want to ask... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Be part of the process. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, because, in this bulletin, it also talks about a linkage in drawing and -- and undermining confidence in elections because of 2020. And you are on this list that we have of 307 Republicans running for office who have raised doubts about the integrity of the election. I mean, they're drawing a direct line here between sowing distrust then and what we are seeing right now. Do you regret sowing doubts yourself? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: I -- what you're referring to, I have never sowed doubts about the election. I have definitely raised questions. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you signed onto this Texas amicus brief... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Absolutely. Let's talk about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... that went to the Supreme Court to overturn it. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: What it said was -- Margaret, what that -- what that said, that amicus brief, is that a lot of people, governors, attorneys general, secretaries of state, took unilateral action during COVID, changing... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... changing the election laws themselves. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you don't regret these... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Again, if I could finish -- changing election laws themselves to try and make sure that we were safe while we exercised our right to vote. That particular amicus brief, all it said was that we need to reaffirm that state legislatures, and legislatures alone, make their election laws. So, as we go forward, once we're out of COVID, we have to... MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... go back to that. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, to be clear, you don't consider yourself an election denier? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Absolutely not. MARGARET BRENNAN: And Joe Biden is the legitimately elected... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: We -- we... MARGARET BRENNAN: ... president of United States of America? (LAUGHTER) REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: He's sworn. He's serving. He is the president of the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: He is the president of the United States. But you stand by... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: And we've got an election in nine days. We've got an election in nine days that we've been working on for the last two years. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: You reported in the in -- intro that eight out of ten Americans in that same poll that you're referring to are concerned with where this country is. They say it's out of control. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you're not undermining... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: If you look, eight out of 10... MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not meaning to undermine confidence in the 2020 election with your comments here? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Eight out of ten Americans right now think we're on the wrong track. That's what they're going to be voting on in nine days. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know. And I would love to talk about something other than people being worried for their lives. But, unfortunately, that's where we are. I want to ask you about this when it comes to political violence. On your Twitter feed, you posted this video we're going to show just a few days ago where you're firing a gun, and it says: \"Enjoyed exercising my Second Amendment rights. #FirePelosi.\" Why is there a gun in a political ad at all? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: It wasn't an ad. I was -- I was tweeting out -- I was tweeting out something that I had just done. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hashtag -- or a tweet -- hashtag #FirePelosi, with a weapon. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Well, now you're... MARGARET BRENNAN: Wouldn't a pink slip be more fitting, if it's about firing her? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: It's interesting, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why a gun? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: It's interesting, Margaret, that we're talking about this, this morning, when, a couple of years back, when a Bernie Sanders supporter shot Steve Scalise... MARGARET BRENNAN: Which was horrendous and horrific... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... when a Bernie Sanders supporter... MARGARET BRENNAN: ... which is why we should be not... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... shot Steve Scalise... MARGARET BRENNAN: ... be putting weapons... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... I never heard you or anyone else in the media trying to blame Democrats for what happened. We need to stay focused on what we're all doing... MARGARET BRENNAN: We did extensive coverage of what happened to Steve Scalise. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Excuse me? MARGARET BRENNAN: There was extensive coverage, sir. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: But nobody tried to equate Democrats' rhetoric, people that say... MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm not talking about your rhetoric. I'm talking about what you posted. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: It's the same. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're shooting a gun. Our viewers just saw it. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Yeah, right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hashtag #FirePelosi. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Exercising our Second Amendment rights, having fun... MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not a debate about the Second Amendment. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... shooting a gun. Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not a debate about the Second Amendment. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Yes, it is. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hashtag #FirePelosi. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Yes, it is. I -- I'm running the campaign operation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you not understand that that is suggestive to people who are in a bad state, and, in this current environment, how risky it is? As you're talking about... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Well, I disagree, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... the importance of lowering the rhetoric... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: I disagree with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... why do you leave that up? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Again, I never saw anyone after Steve Scalise was shot by a... MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm talking about right now... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... Bernie Sanders supporter... MARGARET BRENNAN: ... what just is happening right now. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: .. trying to equate -- equate Democrat rhetoric with those actions. Please don't do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Looking at your candidates, Republican candidates have spent more than $116 million on ads that mentioned Speaker Pelosi by name in their cycle. If this is about the issues, why shouldn't make it about the issues? Why not depersonalize it? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: It is absolutely about the issues. It's about the fact that we have double-digit inflation... MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think... REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: ... exploding -- exploding cost of living. We've got a crime wave across this country that is a direct result -- is the direct result... MARGARET BRENNAN: In this moment -- we are eight days out -- don't you think this needs to change? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Again... MARGARET BRENNAN: Why not pull some of these ads? Why not just delete your tweet? REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Well, I'm sure -- I'm sure people would like to talk about anything but what the Democrats have done to this country, which, quite frankly, is exploding cost of living, a crime wave in our major cities that is the result of this defund the police nonsense and cashless bail. I mean, you look at New York City, where you put someone in jail at 9:00 p.m. for assaulting someone on the street and they're back out on the street at 9:00 a.m. committing crimes again. You look at my state of Minnesota, Minneapolis, it's had 6,000 assaults since the beginning of the year, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: Those are the issues that are top of mind for every voter in this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: That's why they're going to show up in -- on the -- on November 8. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. REPRESENTATIVE TOM EMMER: And that's why Republicans are going to win in the midterms. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what our projections are showing. But I would suggest more pink slips, fewer weapons in our ads in this environment. Sir, thank you for joining us. Face the Nation will be right back. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by David Becker. He is CBS News election law contributor. David, welcome back here. We just had that conversation about the environment that we are in right now. I know you have been raising concerns for a while about many of your colleagues, people you know who serve as election workers, who are fearful about what's to come. What are you hearing? DAVID BECKER: Yes, I mean, they have been suffering for two years now abuse, threats and harassment not only directed at them and their staffs, but their families, their children in some cases. It seems like election deniers do want to create an environment of fear. I think they want election officials to be scared. And they want voters to be scared, to some degree. I think it's also really remarkable that voters have responded with over 20 million of them voting already. We have 1.6 million of them having already voted in Georgia alone. The environment is really scary right now for a lot. I mean, we see that from the polling. We see that from what Scott was just talking about earlier as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: And these are people in your community that you know. DAVID BECKER: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: This isn't big, bad Washington. DAVID BECKER: No. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. DAVID BECKER: I talk to election officials regularly. I was talking to an election official in Florida just last night who was dealing with an issue at a polling place. I talk to election officials in Arizona, including those issues that we have seen in Maricopa County, Arizona. Important to note that... MARGARET BRENNAN: Those men in the tactical gear that we were just talking about. DAVID BECKER: Right, at a couple of... MARGARET BRENNAN: ... that a federal -- federal judge says is their -- is permitted. DAVID BECKER: Right, yes, at least for now. It's been appealed to the Ninth Circuit, and it will be heard next week. So, we will see if that is still the case. Under federal law, there are multiple statutes that prohibit voter intimidation or attempted voter intimidation. And I can tell you, as a former lawyer who used to serve in the Department of Justice, that videotaping or photographing voters against their will, following them, that has been the kind of activity that the DOJ has viewed as intimidating in the past. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to make a very clear distinction here, because we were talking about with Congressman Emmer the call for people -- and you have heard it from the head of the RNC -- to come and watch voting occur. That is not illegal. DAVID BECKER: No, it's not only not illegal. Properly trained poll watching by both parties is a really good thing. Extreme transparency is something that's practiced by election officials all over the country. They want people to come in and see what they're doing. That is a really good thing. But they serve as flies on the wall. If they see a problem, they're supposed to report it to the proper authorities. When we see vigilantes -- and this is only happening in a few places -- start to take matters into their own hands, those people are not properly trained. But people who want to volunteer to be poll workers working for the actual election jurisdiction, more poll watchers working for their campaigns or their political parties, as long as they're well-trained, that's a really good part of the process. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. But voter intimidation is unlawful. DAVID BECKER: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: You -- we were looking in our research here at that the AP has a report saying the most litigation ever fired -- filed before an election is happening right now, most of those lawsuits by Republicans. What does that signal to you? DAVID BECKER: Well, I think people are very attuned to what's going on with the election process. That's not necessarily a bad thing. We're also seeing efforts to change rules in red areas as well, things to install hand counting of ballots, which is a really bad idea, really comes up with inaccurate counts, takes a lot longer, breeds more concern about the process. A county called Nye County in Nevada is doing that. But resolving these kinds of disputes before the election is a good thing. So, if we're having a lot of litigation, it's important for everyone to know the rules by election night. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DAVID BECKER: It's not OK to question those rules after the election. You mentioned that Texas lawsuit that came in December 2020. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DAVID BECKER: That was a perfect example of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you very much, David Becker. DAVID BECKER: Thank you, Margaret. And we will be seeing a lot more of you, I know, in the coming days and weeks. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. And we're replayed on our CBS News Streaming Network throughout the day Sunday. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We go now to the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, that's New York Congressman Sean Patrick Maloney. Good morning to you. REP. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY (D-NY) (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start where we just left off with our other guests. How concerned are you about the risk of political violence? And can you say, unequivocally, that you and your fellow Democrats will accept the outcome of your elections? SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: Of course, we'll accept the outcome of the elections. Always have. Always will. And - and we're very concerned about the integrity of our elections, especially when people are trying to intimidate people with weapons, when they're engaged in these tactics to try to undermine confidence. Now, we're - we're going to accept the results of the election. That's - that's the American way. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm glad you said that because there's been a lot of attention drawn to comments by some Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, who just released a taped statement online where she was talking about upcoming elections and she said, right-wing extremists already have a plan to literally steal the next presidential election and they're not making a secret of it. I understand hyperbole, but would you agree that that's not helpful in the current environment to talk about plots to steal elections? SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: Yes, no, I don't understand what that means and I didn't see the comment. Let me - let me tell you what I think. What I think is that it's perfectly legitimate for both parties to make sure that voting is fair, that there's no fraud, that when votes are cast, that the people have a right to cast them or don't. And that's normal. And in a close election, you might have a recount, you might have other examination of absentee ballots. That's all run of the mill stuff. What's different is people showing up with weapons and sitting in the back of a pickup truck next to a drop box trying to scare the tar out of people who are just exercising their vote. What's different is when a president, for the first time in our history, says he was cheated out of the result when he knows that's a lie. So, let's -- let's not - let's not - let's not pretend for a minute that both sides have the same - same amount of accountability for - for the loss of confidence in our elections. One side has been out there for a couple of years now doing everything they can to pretend Joe Biden didn't win fair and square when he did. And that's the difference. MARGARET BRENNAN: On that topic, Democrats shelled out about $53 million to support 13 Republican candidates during the primaries. I know you're part of strategy here and the strategy was to elevate less electable Republicans in order to benefit Democrats. And some of this worked for you, but in at least two races these guys have realistic shots at victory. I'm looking at John Gibbs in Michigan, for example. Do you take responsibility for helping election deniers? SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: Well, at the DCCC, there's only one race in the country, one, where we - where we engage in the - in the tactic you're talking about. And what we did was we ran an ad that's true that said he's too extreme for western Michigan. And we ran that general election ad about two weeks early. And Hillary Scholten has been beating him consistently since she became our nominee. She's a strong pro-choice Democrat. He's a nut. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you stand by the strategy? SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: And she's going to -- and she's going to beat him. What I can tell you is that, in a budget of $340 million, we spent about $400,000 running a true general election commercial two weeks early calling John Gibbs an extremist, which he is. And - and that's all you're talking about. Now, I can't be -- I - I can't answer to what governors did or what senators did or what other people did. But the committee I ran, in a budget of $300 million, put $400,000 into speeding up a general election ad that was truthful. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: And we're going to win that race. MARGARET BRENNAN: The top three issues when we talk to voters that they tell us they're concerned about are economy, inflation and crime. Half of voters, according to our poll, think Democrats would cut police funding. Now, I saw an ad the DCCC just bought in your district, and it opens with you talking to a policeman. You are keenly aware of this. Why hasn't your party been able to shake that perception of being soft on crime? SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: Well, because a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth gets its shoes on, as the saying goes. In my own case, I brought $7 million for local police departments, supported the Invest to Protect Act, which will fund all the police departments in my district, all under 125 officers. That's the most important support we've done for police in 30 years. And if you care about rising crime, my goodness, we should listen to police who are begging us to do something about the gun violence, which is at the heart of so much rise in crime. And, of course, the MAGA crowd is in the pocket of the NRA and won't touch common sense (ph) bipartisan gun safety legislation, which we passed through the House. So, we have a record of results supporting good policing and - and - and going after gun violence. And that's what people need to know. MARGARET BRENNAN: In our poll, 46 percent of voters believe Republicans' economic policies will help them. Only 40 percent say the same about Democrats. Fifty-three percent of voters believe gas prices will go up under Democrats. Twenty-one percent say the same of the - of the GOP. I mean, since you're talking strategy here, in these closing days, how do you change these perceptions and how do you get out younger voters? SEAN PATRICK MALONEY: Right. Well, what people need to know is that we have a plan for cheaper gas, cheaper groceries, cheaper housing, cheaper health care. We have a plan for safer streets, supporting good policing and attacking gun violence, which is so much of the problem, and supporting our freedoms, our reproductive freedoms and our voting rights. And that's a -- those are real plans. Now, you can take a poll and you can - you can take a snapshot at any given time. But, of course, your former guest had no plan for the economy. They have no plan for gun violence. They have no plan to move our country forward, protecting voting rights, protecting reproductive freedoms. So -- so what I would say is, don't punish the people who are fixing your problems and don't reward the people who are trying to exploit the problems for their own political power. That's really the difference right now. We're - we're engaged in the hard work of bringing our country forward. The other side's working on their own power. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look at some of our battleground tracker findings and the issues that are setting the mood in America in these final days of campaign '22. Mark Strassmann reports from Los Angeles. (BEGIN VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): America's zeitgeist, vulnerability, like this home invasion hammer attack on a politician's 82-year-old spouse, reinforcing we're an anxious, often resentful bunch heading into midterms. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Now with Joe Biden, there's a big thumb on top of you where you can't enjoy yourself. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just need to see some peace. And I think the only way to do this is voting. MARK STRASSMANN: The economy, especially inflation, indisputably top of mind in voter anxiety. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The cost of groceries are outrageous. Utilities are outrageous. It keeps going up. MARK STRASSMANN (on camera): And gas prices. Look at these in Los Angeles, right at $7 a gallon for regular. That would be nightmarish in most of the country. But here in L.A., prices have actually been coming down in the last couple weeks. MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): In our latest CBS News poll of registered voters, a majority blame President Biden and the Democrats for the economy and gas prices. The president fighting that perception. JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Unemployment is not 6.5 but 3.5 percent, the lowest it's been in 50 years. MARK STRASSMANN: Republicans see inflation numbers and smell blood. SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Not just a red wave, but a red tsunami. MARK STRASSMANN: Crime is another voter worry, like last week's deadly school shooting in St. Louis, the 40th this year involving injuries or deaths. In major cities, murder rates and shootings, both down slightly, but from a 30 percent spike two years ago. Our poll shows Republicans have a double-digit lead on crime policies to make you feel safer. But American voters want this election cycle of leadership to confront other challenges. Immigration, an infectious dies trifecta, Covid, the flu and RSV, gun policy and abortion in a post-Roe America. Our poll says a majority of voters think Republicans will pass a national abortion ban. Another worry, culture wars invading the classroom and performance that's plummeting. It's one more challenge calling out for grownup intervention as millions of Americans now vote for their idea of a grownup, knowing that whoever wins, half the country will resent it, again. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann reporting from Los Angeles. Our new CBS News battleground tracker poll shows Republicans still have an edge in the race for control of the House. CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto is here. Anthony, tell us more. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret. You know, we've been talking to voters throughout this campaign in all the congressional districts. Right now our latest CBS News estimate is that the Republicans lead in 228 districts. That is enough to take the House majority. Now, there is a range around these estimates. Let me show you the political implications here. They really center around turnout. You might ask, do Democrats have any chance to hang on, even to a slim House majority? The answer to that starts with the possibility that they'd get bigger turnout from younger voters. If voters show up the way they did in, say, 2018, that could get the Democrats a little bit closer, make the House effectively even. The trouble for them is, we have not seen strong indications that that is going to happen. The more likely scenario is that Republicans, who do have an express turnout advantage, more motivation, more enthusiasm so far, if their turnout advantage grows, we plug that into the model and that would get the Republicans up to 238 seats, a slightly larger majority. Now, in any case, we're looking at a seat gain here for the Republicans that's about or even below average for a party out of power. You might ask why that is, especially given the concerns about the state of the country and the state of the economy. Let me show you a split that I think tells a lot of the tale. I asked people, which concerns you more, whether or not the U.S. is going to have a functioning democracy or whether it's going to have a strong economy? And the results are somewhat split. But look at the voting differences here. Those who are more concerned about functioning of democracy, voting for Democrats. Those more concerned about the strong economy, voting for Republicans. And I think that defines the way that voters see the very large stakes here and the way the parties are expressing those stakes, which is partly why this race is so locked in. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you. And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For more now we turn to our political panel. Amy Walter, publisher and editor-in-chief of \"The Cook Political Report,\" senior White House and political correspondent, Ed O'Keefe is here, and Nick Timiraos, chief economic correspondent for \"The Wall Street Journal\" is also at the table. Good morning to all of you. AMY WALTER (Publisher and editor-in chief, \"Cook Political Report with Amy Walter\"): Good morning. NICK TIMIRAOS (Chief economic correspondent, \"The Wall Street Journal): Hi. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Amy, we just heard Anthony's scenario here. This is not a red wave, but it is a Republican majority. Does it match with what you're seeing? AMY WALTER: Yes. I think the way that Anthony pointed it out is a very smart way of thinking about this. You know, elections -- normally midterm elections, the challenge for the in-party usually is that their own side doesn't turn out. And that's where the other side is much more motivated. And when you see those big, big gains, like we saw say in 1994 or 2010 on the part of Republicans. This year we're seeing that Republicans and Democrats are motivated. Republicans a little bit more. But Democrats feel pretty good that they're at least getting more of their base turned out. Now, young voters being always a challenge for Democrats. But, look, I think what happened over the course of the summer is that the issues surrounding abortion rights, plus the focus on Donald Trump, January 6th, and, quite frankly, a little better of an economic picture gave some boost of enthusiasm to Democrats and got them energized in terms of the voters, more energized to turn out. But it feels as if that has pretty much stalled. That it hit this point and it hasn't really gone much further. And, instead, where the focus is now, it's no longer as much about abortion or Donald Trump, and much more about the things that Anthony pointed out, which is the economy, gas prices and people feeling, quite frankly, pretty stuck. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we frame this as, you know, sort of a choice with (INAUDIBLE). And - and, Ed, in some of these recent politic ads, I'm thinking about in Maloney's district, I was just watching one, they're changing the focus to be about extremism. ED O'KEEFE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: So not even talking about the affirmative case, but fear the other side. ED O'KEEFE: Right. Not - and not only in the realm of democracy and - and those concerns, but in the realm of abortion rights and - and Social Security and Medicare being ripped up or rethought. I watched Maloney this week actually make that exact argument to a bunch of seniors in assisted living facilities. He said, if you don't think they might come after your Social Security and Medicare, look what they just did to abortion rights after 50 years of threatening to do it. So that's kind of a way to make both arguments at the same time but not make an exclusive (ph) abortion argument. And that's the kind of pivoting that they've done here, now realizing that abortion isn't as urgent an issue. Part of the reason one Republican I talked to this week said, look, you go look at mothers across the country who may be concerned about abortion rights, but they're not necessarily bumping up against the issue of abortion rights every day, they're bumping up against the fact that beef is costing three times as much as it did before. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ED O'KEEFE: And those more urgent economic issues may be what's drawing people back over to the Republican side. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. I want to come back to the issue of abortion in a second. But, Nick, can you pick up on this because our poll shows 69 percent of voters describe the condition of the national economy as bad. Only 27 percent say it's good. You've got a piece saying -- out in \"The Journal\" saying basically American consumers are doing pretty well. NICK TIMIRAOS: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why don't they feel that way? NICK TIMIRAOS: Yes, that's a great question, Margaret. You know, the issue here is that if you look at the labor market, 3.5 percent unemployment rate, what's not to like about that? But if you look at, you know, what's happening with wages, they are not keeping up with prices. We had another report Friday that shows that Americans' wages are not keeping up with prices. And so those are real income cuts. Nobody likes that. You drive by the gas station, you see how expensive gas is and you look at what's happening right now with interest rates, they've gone up a lot this year. Mortgage rates this week are above 7 percent for the 30-year fixed rate mortgage. We haven't seen that since 2001. So, yes, on paper, you know, there are things you can point to that look great, but people just don't feel great about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we have this Fed meeting in the coming days. What are the conversations inside the Federal Reserve right now about when inflation gets better and what they plan to do? NICK TIMIRAOS: Well, the problem for the Fed is that monetary policy takes time. It acts with a delay on the economy. So, you can't see your moves right away. The Fed, this year, has raised interest rates as the fastest pace since the 1980s. Normally they raise rates by a quarter point every six weeks or so. This year they've been going at three-quarters of a percentage point. And when you don't have time to see how that influences the economy, it's like barreling down the highway but using the rearview mirror to guide where you're going. It raises the risk that you're going to drive off the road. And the problem here for the Fed is, they can't take a risk of not getting on top of this inflation because even though the risk of doing too much is a recession, the risk of not doing enough is that inflation just stays high and you have to have a bigger downturn later. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, I mean, those are the details of it. That is monetary policy. What is it that - that Republicans are actually arguing, Ed, they can do because, really, the reality is, their hands are pretty tied here. ED O'KEEFE: They are. I - you know, if you read their websites, if you listen to what they say - MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE). ED O'KEEFE: They want to cut government spending and, in some cases, they want to see implementation of the bipartisan infrastructure bill that either they voted for and they don't want to admit that will help their districts even if they voted against it. And I - AMY WALTER: Yes, I mean - ED O'KEEFE: Go ahead. AMY WALTER: Well, and that's the bottom line, when you're in charge, and things are going well, you get the credit, a lot of which you don't deserve. When you're in charge and things aren't going well, you get the blame, even if you don't' deserve all of it. And when you're the out party, you get the benefit of the doubt because voters are saying, well, I don't know, if Ed can really fix this, but these folks who are in charge, they're not doing a very good job. Let's just - let's just put it -- let's just give them a shot, which is why Democrats are doing the extremism thing. If people are upset with the status quo, which they clearly are, Democrats' only chance to hold on, especially in some of these Senate races, is to say, the bigger risk is taking a risk on the other side. Staying with the status quo you don't like is uncomfortable but not as bad. ED O'KEEFE: And the other ironic thing, a lot - much like the Fed, the - the problem for the Biden administration and Democrats is a lot of their accomplishments are going to take time to be implemented. AMY WALTER: Right. That's right. ED O'KEEFE: The Medicare price cuts don't kick in until next year. AMY WALTER: That's right. ED O'KEEFE: The bridge isn't getting rebuilt until early 2024. AMY WALTER: Right. ED O'KEEFE: So they can talk about all these things in the abstract, but the voter can't see it yet. AMY WALTER: That's right. That's right. ED O'KEEFE: The president may know, come my re-election, if I'm running in 2024, people will see what I did - AMY WALTER: That's right. ED O'KEEFE: But I -- they won't be able to see it before November 8th. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's also kind of hard sometimes to message around market forces. ED O'KEEFE: Right. Kind of? MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, an - an energy analyst that I - that I speak to was pointing out, you know, Ron Klein, the chief of staff to the president, tweets almost daily about the price of gas. He's like, why are they trying to own something they cannot control? ED O'KEEFE: That is a question that the White House chief of staff is going to have to answer for. And not only is -- why are they tweeting about something that they can't control, why is he tweeting so much to begin with every morning about this and other issues when he, perhaps, should be running the White House? I've heard this from Democrats. I think we'll hear it a lot more from Democrats after the elections if it goes south for them. It is an obsession for them because they know it is the psychological and the sort of data barometer that we've all used to measure inflation and the discussion about the economy. But, yes, it is something completely out of their control. And perhaps by doing that it's -- as that energy analyst noted, it may have drawn too much attention to the president and allows him to take more of the blame. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Nick, in \"The Journal,\" a survey of economists putting the probability of recession over the next 12 months as 63 percent. So, that is the Congress that Republicans would be walking in to control. NICK TIMIRAOS: Yes. And the issue here is, the economy is slowing. We knew it was going to slow because we had a boom last year. But if it doesn't slow enough, if consumers keep spending the savings that they've accrued during the pandemic, then that just means the Fed is going to come in and raise interest rates more. You know, this week we're going to get close to 4 percent on the policy rate that the Fed sets, but we could go closer to 5 percent next year. And, you know, there's a - there's a Fed chairman who used to say that it was the Fed's job to take the punch bowl away as the party was getting started. And that's what you're seeing this year. But if consumers keep spending money, we had very solid earnings reports this past week from United, Visa, Coca-Cola, if consumers keep spending, then Jay Powell is going to get on the phone and call the cops and say, we've got to get the noise volume down here. We've got - we've got to get these people to go home because this is just not sustainable to have inflation continuing to run higher and higher and higher. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And that's hard to explain sometimes that like things -- some things are going to get more expensive by design. It's going to get more expensive for you to borrow money because of what's happening. NICK TIMIRAOS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming back to the issue of abortion, Amy and Ed. I think it's interesting that the dynamic seems to have changed on this in terms of bringing out voters. You were saying, Ed, that people feel inflation, perhaps, is a more immediate crisis than abortion access. I wonder, Amy, because it's so different state by state. AMY WALTER: Right. That's what we're - MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that it? AMY WALTER: It's quite interesting actually. Where we're seeing Democratic -- especially candidates for the House, having the most trouble is actually in blue states, like Oregon, California, places where the issue of abortion is pretty well settled. These are Democratic-run states. They're - the -- it's not an existential question -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the state has already codified it? AMY WALTER: Because the state has either codified or it's Democratic and the governors' candidates have all pledged to go forward in that way. It's the red and purple states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, where we know that this issue is not settled and where, in Michigan, of course, they have a ballot initiative, as well as a governor's race. You have governor races in those other states. So, there's much more of a - of a friction there, right, about the decision being determined by your vote this November that's not as apparent in some of these blue states. ED O'KEEFE: Yes. And the fact that they have to run into New York, Oregon, the president's going to New Mexico this week. AMY WALTER: Right. ED O'KEEFE: It all speaks to the fact that perhaps they may have miscalculated how abortion would work in those states and how much money Republicans have to spend right now in the closing weeks to really put a bunch of Democrats on the ropes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Good to have all three of you here. Thank you very much. And that's going to do it for us here at FACE THE NATION today. Thank you for watching. And tune in next Tuesday, Election Day. I can't believe that. Wow. AMY WALTER: I can't believe you just said that. MARGARET BRENNAN: And night, starting at 5:00 p.m. on our streaming network with a special edition of \"Red and Blue.\" And we'll be on both the broadcasts and streaming networks starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time through the night and into the morning.

And on this Fourth of July weekend on Face the Nation, we will look at the challenges facing an increasingly divided America. President Biden's message after a week of consultation with our closest allies on the issues threatening global stability: All is well with our friends. The biggest threat to the world view of America is from within. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): You haven't found one person - - one world leader to say America is going backwards. America is better positioned to lead the world than we ever have been. The one thing that has been destabilizing is the outrageous behavior of the Supreme Court of the United States. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: He's not the only one angry with the Supreme Court, as they conclude their most consequential session in years, with far-reaching decisions on religion, the environment, immigration and, of course, abortion rights. He's hoping Democrats channel their anger and fear into support for his party in the November midterm elections. (Begin VT) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I share the public outrage that this extremist court that is committed to moving America backwards. But, ultimately, Congress is going to have to act to codify the -- Roe into federal law. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will assess the impact of these rulings. The court did rule in favor of President Biden's plan to scrap a Trump era policy to make asylum seekers wait in Mexico, clearing the way for more migrants to enter the U.S. We will talk with Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas about how the administration plans to handle the influx. With rapid-fire local court decisions causing more chaos over where abortion is now illegal, we will look at the state of maternal health in America. How can we keep our abysmal record from getting worse? Then: What's next for the January 6 hearings following Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson's stunning testimony? (Begin VT) CASSIDY HUTCHINSON (Former Aide to Mark Meadows): The president said something to the effect of: \"I'm the effing president. Take me up to the Capitol now.\" (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with a key member of the January 6 Select Committee, Congressman Adam Schiff, about the attempts to influence witness testimony unfavorable to the Trump administration. Plus, more of our CBS News exclusive interview with the new German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Thank you for joining us this holiday weekend. We begin today with immigration and the win for the Biden administration last week in the Supreme Court, that of the ending of President Trump's remain-in-Mexico policy. To discuss that and more, we want to welcome Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to this broadcast. Mr. Secretary, good morning to you. Happy early Fourth of July. ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security): Good morning. And the same wish to you, Margaret. Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what happens now that remain-in-Mexico is going away? Are you ending this policy immediately? And what happens to those individuals in the encampments waiting right across the border? SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we were very pleased with the Supreme Court's decision. So, now, in light of the favorable Supreme Court ruling, we have to wait for that ruling to reach the district court that issued an injunction preventing us from ending remain-in-Mexico. So we have several weeks to go before the district court lifts its injunction. And, until then, we are obligated by the district court's ruling to continue to implement the remain-in-Mexico program. And we will do so in accordance with law. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, those people will still have to wait in the camps on the Mexican side of the border, but what happens to them next? SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Right now, they do have to remain in Mexico. And then we will actually continue with their immigration enforcement proceedings. Remember, when people are encountered at the border, they are just not merely released into the United States. They are placed in immigration enforcement proceedings. And that is what will occur with these people. Their proceedings will continue in immigration court, where they will pursue their claims for asylum. And if those claims are unsuccessful, they will be swiftly removed from the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Reuters is reporting that there are right now thousands of people who departed on Friday and are moving towards the U.S. border. What do you need right now? Do you need more personnel for customs and border control? Do you need more equipment to tackle these smugglers that are exploiting these people? SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we are working very closely with our partners to the south, with Mexico, that breaks up very often these caravans of individuals that seek to take that dangerous journey to reach our border, only to be met with the enforcement of our laws. We have said repeatedly. And we continue to warn people not to take the dangerous journey. We saw so tragically in San Antonio, Texas, one of the possible tragic results of that dangerous journey. And so many people don't even make it that far in the hands of exploitative smugglers. And we continue to enforce immigration law, as is our legal responsibility. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are saying right now -- what I hear you saying is, do not come. But those words are not being heard. People are moving right now. So the efforts to stop the root causes are not stopping them. This horrific trafficking, the worst smuggling tragedy in U.S. history this week, with those individuals found dead in that trailer truck, that's not stopping people. Are you predicting that this is only going to get more significant from here, that we're going to go beyond the record surge in migrants? SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: No, I'm not predicting that at all. And, in fact, in the wake of the San Antonio tragedy -- and our Homeland Security Investigations is the lead federal agency investigating what occurred and working with the United States Attorney's Office in the prosecution of thus far four individuals who have been charged with that heinous crime. We're working with our partners to the south, because this is a regional challenge that requires a regional response. I last week spoke... MARGARET BRENNAN: But they got past U.S. -- the U.S. border officials. SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Oh, so we have a multilayered approach. Margaret. We, of course, have our inspections at the port of entry with our sophisticated nonintrusive technology. We then have checkpoints that are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Laredo checkpoint in question, 10,000 to 14,000 vehicles pass through that checkpoint every day. This fiscal year alone... MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how did this smuggler get these people across? Fifty-three people died. SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: These are very sophisticated transnational criminal organizations. They have evolved over the last 30 years. In the '90s, I prosecuted them, and they were much more rudimentary. Now they are very sophisticated, using technology. And they're extraordinarily organized transnational criminal enterprises. And we are much more sophisticated using technology and personnel 24 hours a day. You know, we have saved more than 10,000 individuals this fiscal year alone in more than 400 vehicle inspections. So, can a truck get through, through sophisticated means? Sometimes, yes. But I have to say, we have interdicted more drugs at the ports of entry than ever before. We've rescued more migrants. We're seeing a challenge that is really regional, hemispheric in scope, and we're addressing it accordingly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I also want to ask you here at home about what we've seen in the past 24 hours. There's been this back-and-forth between state and federal law enforcement regarding security to Supreme Court justices and protests outside their home. Does the threat go beyond picketing? Is it specific and credible? SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So we have seen a heightened threat environment over the last several months over a number of different volatile issues that galvanize people on different sides of each issue. We in the Department of Homeland Security become involved when there's a connectivity between the opposition to a particular view or an ideology of hate, a false narrative and violence. It is that connectivity to violence when we engage. And we are very mindful that the Supreme Court's decision in reversing and overturning Roe v. Wade has really heightened the threat environment. And we have deployed resources to ensure the safety and security of the Supreme Court and the justices. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I do want to ask you about what we saw this weekend up in Boston. A white supremacist group called Patriot Front marched through that city. They recently planned events, a riot in Idaho. You're seeing this far right group the Proud Boys also disrupt events in California. How concerned are you right now about these militias? SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, I have said -- and this has been echoed by the director of the FBI -- that domestic violent extremism is one of the greatest terrorism-related threats that we face in the homeland today, individuals spurred by ideologies of hate, false narratives, personal grievances to acts of violence. And it is that violence that we respond to and we seek to, of course, prevent. We are in a heightened threat environment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time today. SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by California Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff. He is a member of the January 6 Select Committee and chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Good morning, and good to have you here in person. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D-California): Good morning. Thank you. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to pick up on what we just heard from the secretary when we were talking about this far right group the Proud Boys. This was one of the militias involved in January 6. And in this incredible testimony this past week from Cassidy Hutchinson, the former Trump White House aide, chief of -- to Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, she testified she heard conversations inside the White House about this far-right group and another one called the Oath Keepers. Is there corroborating evidence to show that there was communication between those militias in the White House? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I don't want to get too far ahead of what we intend to present in our next hearings, but our very next hearing will be focused on the efforts to assemble that mob on the Mall, who was participating, who was financing it, how it was organized, including the participation of these white nationalist groups like the Proud Boys, the Three Percenters and others. And so we'll be presenting information we have. We haven't answered all the questions that we have. We continue our investigation into precisely the issue you're describing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hutchinson was specific in saying Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, was someone she heard talking about them. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, and this is one of the reasons we had interest in his testimony and have interest in the testimony of others. We obviously want to probe any connection between these dangerous groups and the White House. I think we've gotten some answers, but there's still a great deal we don't know that we're endeavoring to find out. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's an incredible allegation, of course. So we'll track that. I want to also ask you, the vice chair of the committee, Liz Cheney, said not prosecuting former President Trump over the attack on the Capitol would be a much graver constitutional threat to the country than the political difficulties involved with bringing charges. She said this in an ABC interview. She also said there are possible criminal referrals, not just one, but multiple. Do you agree? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I do. I do. You know, for four years, the Justice Department took the position that you can't indict a sitting president. If the Department were now to take the position that you can't investigate or indict a former president, then a president becomes above the law. That's a very dangerous idea that the founders would have never subscribed to, even more dangerous, I think, in the case of Donald Trump. This -- Donald Trump is someone who has shown, when he's not held accountable, he goes on to commit worse and worse abuses of power. So I agree with Judge Carter in California. I think there was evidence that the former president engaged in multiple violations of the law, and that should be investigated. MARGARET BRENNAN: But there will be a political calculus to this as well. This is an incredibly divided country right now. Millions of people voted for the former president and still believe, wrongly, that he won the election. Prosecuting him, isn't there a very high risk to that? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: You know, it's certainly not a step to be taken lightly at all. At the same time, immunizing a former president who has engaged in wrongdoing, I would agree with our vice chair, I think is more dangerous than anything else. And the decision not to move forward with an investigation or not to move forward with a prosecution because of someone's political status or political influence or because they have a following, to me, that is a far more dangerous thing to our Constitution than following the evidence wherever it leads, including when it leads to a former president. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleague Adam Kinzinger was on another program this morning and said new witnesses have come forward since Cassidy Hutchinson testified. How many? How significant? Is there more new information that requires more hearings? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: You know, I think there's certainly more information that is coming forward. In terms of whether that will materialize into particular witnesses on this topic or that topic, we're going to wait and see. But we are following additional leads. I think those leads will lead to new testimony. It's part of the reason we wanted her to come before the public, is, we were hoping it would generate others stepping forward, seeing her courage would inspire them to show the same kind of courage. MARGARET BRENNAN: Has she inspired the former White House counsel Pat Cipollone to take up the request to speak to him again? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I hope so. We're in discussions with Mr. Cipollone's counsel. I'm hopeful that we can work out bringing him in for testimony. He clearly has information about concerns about criminal violations, concerns about the president going to the Capitol that day, concerns about the chief of staff having blood on his hands if they didn't do more to stop that violent attack on the Capitol. Hard to imagine someone more at the center of things. And I hope that he'll demonstrate the same courage we saw Cassidy Hutchinson display. MARGARET BRENNAN: Who is attempting to intimidate the witnesses, as Congresswoman Cheney said? And how significant are the security threats against Hutchinson? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I have to imagine the security threats are very pronounced. Certainly, our members are feeling them and hearing them. I have to expect the same is true of her, since the former president and his enablers are going after her. We want to make sure that she is safe. We have several concerns. We have the concern over safety for witnesses. We have concern over people who are trying to influence or intimidate witnesses. MARGARET BRENNAN: Who's doing that? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: You know, I can't comment on specific but... MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: ... we wanted to let the country know and anyone in the former president's world know that, if they seek to intimidate witnesses, they will be referred for prosecution. And we hope that Justice Department will move against them. But we also have a concern about the fact that some of these witnesses are sharing lawyers, that, essentially -- and this gets to some the testimony revealed during the Cassidy Hutchinson hearing -- that they're reviewing transcripts, that they're essentially coordinating, potentially, their stories, or that witnesses feel they've got big brother watching them when they sit in for their depositions. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on that, I want to ask you. One of the things that Cassidy Hutchinson described having been told by another individual is about this tussle in the Beast, the president's vehicle, where he allegedly lunged for the wheel demanding to be taken to the Capitol. The committee's already interviewed Tony Ornato, the White House operations director, and Secret Service agent Robert Engel. Was this the first time you heard about that incident? Did they back that up or contradict that testimony? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I can't go into the specifics of the prior testimony. But I can say I think we'd be interested in having them come back and others that can shed light on this. But the most important thing is there doesn't appear to be any dispute over the fact the president was furious that he could not accompany this armed mob to the Capitol. That seems to be undisputed. And the fact that the president knew that the mob was armed, wanted the magnetometers down, so they could take their arms to the Capitol, that doesn't seem to be disputed by anyone except Donald Trump. And he has, as we've seen in the past, no credibility at all. MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, before I let you go, with your Intel hat on here, the bullet that was used to kill American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh has been handed over to the United States. It's undergoing ballistics testing right now. If Israeli soldiers did indeed kill her, what consequences should there be? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think there needs to be an independent investigation, so that we understand exactly what happened and who was responsible and why. Once we know that, then I think we can talk about what the consequences should be. But I do think there needs to be an objective investigation. And I'm glad that the United States can help play a part in that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Schiff, thanks for your time. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The Supreme Court ended its term with a number of historic and some controversial rulings. For a breakdown and a look at what comes next, we turn to CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford. You have been incredibly busy, Jan. We had a number of these decisions this week that reflect the will of the conservative majority. President Biden called them extremist -- an extremist court. How do you characterize the decisions? JAN CRAWFORD: Well, I mean, this is a court that has shown it has clearly turned firmly to the right. And it could have sweeping implications for American life, the democratic process. Taken together, what we have seen this term is that this is a court that is not going to get involved in these divisive policy issues, unless that is clearly within its purview. If it is not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, then that goes to the democratic process. That's what we saw in the abortion rights case, overturning Roe vs. Wade, was not specifically mentioned; therefore, we're not going to resolve it. Back to the democratic process. And if Congress can't do his job, and Congress isn't acting, this is a court that says administrative agencies and unelected bureaucrats, they can't jump in and fill those vacuums if Congress isn't acting and try to set major policy questions. That was the case involving climate change and the EPA. So, I mean, the bottom line is, this court, unlike a more liberal court, is not jumping in to fill these vacuums where Congress or the legislatures are failing to act. And that is going to mean a profound difference in the democratic process and the rule of the courts -- the role of the courts. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not clear. JAN CRAWFORD: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, it's not clear if lawmakers will take up these issues. (CROSSTALK) JAN CRAWFORD: With dysfunction in Congress, absolutely. But they're saying the ball is in Congress' court or the state legislatures when it's a policy dispute, if it's not specifically addressed by the Constitution. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, to that point, because now we are seeing all these states, their courts, their legislatures have arguments over what to do next, particularly on the issue of abortion. Kentucky, Florida, Utah, Louisiana, really significant legal battles taking place about abortion protections. What is your takeaway so far? I mean, is there a commonality to where they're ending up? JAN CRAWFORD: Right. So, remember, 26 states asked the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade and let them set their own policies on abortion rights. And that's what we're seeing now, the court agreed. And we're seeing that play out across the country. Already states, almost a dozen states have laws in place ready to go to completely ban abortion in their states. So you're seeing abortion rights advocates go into those states and file lawsuits in state courts under state constitutions, because the Supreme Court said, it's not in the federal Constitution, but if a state has more protective rights in their constitutions, then work it out there. And so that's what we're seeing now. We're seeing these legal battles play out as -- the same time as the state legislatures are passing their own laws, blue states passing laws to enshrine abortion access or protect it even more, for example. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And the chaos has led to some people mistakenly thinking abortion is banned or something. It's not. It's... JAN CRAWFORD: That's been the most striking thing, I think. The Supreme Court did not ban abortion nationwide. They just said there's not a right to abortion in the Constitution. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. JAN CRAWFORD: Therefore, it goes back to the democratic process, and states can set their own policies. If Congress wants to do something, Congress can, but it's not in the Constitution. So now you have seen this patchwork of laws. And you're seeing legal challenges under state constitutions. But you're going to see different laws in different states. If you're in New York or California or Boston or Illinois or any of those Democratic states, this ruling will not affect your life at all. Your -- the laws in your states won't change. It's those red states that we see that will try to ban or greatly restrict abortion... MARGARET BRENNAN: We will follow that. JAN CRAWFORD: ... and already are seeing that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's coming. JAN CRAWFORD: Oh, God. (CROSSTALK) JAN CRAWFORD: Oh, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you say, \"Oh, God\"? That's not a good reaction, Jan. JAN CRAWFORD: It's -- as big of a term this was -- and, of course, whenever the court overturns a nearly 50-year-old precedent, as they did with Roe vs. Wade -- next term could be as consequential, divisive as this term, or more so. They have major cases already on the docket. They will continue to add them throughout the year. They have already got a case challenging affirmative action in college admissions. I expect the court is going to end that. They have got a case involving kind of a conflict between free speech and gay rights and whether a state law can prohibit someone from saying on their Web site they oppose same-sex marriage and don't want to do that business in designers and artists. They have got voting rights. They have got an election procedure case that could have huge implications for elections. I mean, this is just the beginning... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JAN CRAWFORD: ... and a new justice stepping into a divided court. MARGARET BRENNAN: An historic new justice. Jan, you will be back with us a lot, I understand, based on what you just sketched out. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for your analysis. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week we traveled to Madrid to speak with the new chancellor of Germany, Olaf Scholz, during a week of international meetings among top U.S. allies who are faced with a growing list of problems, including rising food and energy prices exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Chancellor Scholz is one of the few European leaders who still speaks to Vladimir Putin. So that's where we started our conversation. (BEGIN VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: When you speak to Putin, does he acknowledge the sanctions? Does he acknowledge how much his economy has been hurt? Or does he just not care? OLAF SCHOLZ (Chancellor Of Germany): I think he cares, but he will not really admit it. So you get some idea - MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it hasn't stopped him. OLAF SCHOLZ: You get some idea that it really is hurting him and that he understands the deep impacts of our sanctions on his economy. And I'm always mentioning it because it's necessary to say it. This is now happening to a country that is not that advanced, that is really needing all the technologies from the rest of the world for having a similar standard of living and for having the chance to be part of gross (ph) -- indeed world economy. And this is now the real damage to the Russian economy that they have no chance to do this. MARGARET BRENNAN: When will Putin run out of weapons, run out of funds, or can he -- this continue for years? OLAF SCHOLZ: No one really knows. He is - he is the head - the leader of a very great country with a lot of people living there, with a lot of means. And he is really doing this brutal war with - and -- and he prepared for it. So, he will be able to continue with the war really a long time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that Vladimir Putin will stop at Ukraine? OLAF SCHOLZ: I (INAUDIBLE) that all what we do will help to give him the view that this is not working and that he will not be successful. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your country has earned this reputation of overpromising and underdelivering when it comes to Ukraine. Ukraine received its very first delivery of German howitzers, this artillery, last week. Why did it take that long? We're in the fifth month. OLAF SCHOLZ: So, we took a very, very hard decision to change political strategies we followed for many decades, never to deliver weapons into a country that is in a conflict. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. OLAF SCHOLZ: When we decided, for instance, to send the most modern howitzer, which you can buy on the world market, which is in use in Germany, it was very difficult to organize that this could be used in the war because you have to have some training. And we had Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. And when the training ended, in the end they came with the weapon, with the howitzers to Ukraine, and they are now in use. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the United States is doing that. They're providing weaponry within 48 hours sometimes of the president signing, and carrying out training. Why did it take this long for Germany? OLAF SCHOLZ: I think -- I think you should understand that there is a difference of a country like the United States spends that much for defense, which is a very big investment, and you have a lot of weapons at your stocks. Together with the United States and the United Kingdom, we decided to deliver multi-rocket launchers to Ukraine now, which are - MARGARET BRENNAN: Those haven't been delivered yet. OLAF SCHOLZ: We are sending them and we are doing it with the means and ways we have, and with the training. And once again, there are a lot of very experienced people who yesterday looked at Google and today they know how to do things. But I will tell you, there are weapons, but you have to have your training and you have to have it not in Ukraine, you have to have it here in our countries. And so we will always see that Germany is one of the countries that is doing the most, because what we are sending now is the most sophisticated technology you can use. There is also anti-ballistic -- there are also weapons we give to Ukraine that they can defend the air. MARGARET BRENNAN: The anti-aircraft missiles you've promised? Radar you've promised? OLAF SCHOLZ: The anti - no, they can defend a city from -- against the rockets and missiles that were sent there from Putin. And this is very expensive and very effective technology, but they will get it. MARGARET BRENNAN: The delays have led to speculation that it's not about getting the supplies, it's about the will of the government to actually deliver them, and whether there's fear of provoking Putin or whether it's years of budget cuts to your defense industry that have made it just not possible for the German military to act quickly. How do you respond to that? OLAF SCHOLZ: Those who are looking to the facts see that we are doing what is feasible. We are changing the way, how we spend money for defense. And this is the big increase, which will change the situation and will give us the chance to be more quick in reaction to a threat that is coming to NATO, the alliance, or to our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Germany is providing about $2 billion in aid to Ukraine. That's roughly what you spend per month on gas from Russia, on coal, on energy supplies. So, while you're helping the Ukrainians financially, you're also essentially giving Vladimir Putin a financial lifeline. OLAF SCHOLZ: He cannot buy anything from the money he's getting from us because he has all these sanctions on imports for modern technologies and things he is looking for. So, this is what he's making very angry. But to be very clear, when we decided on sanctions together and with all our allies, we said always we will do it in a way that we harm Putin more than us. And many countries in Europe are depending, for historical reasons, and because they are near to the place, and it is the nearest place to get the gas on the imports of gas. And will now whole Europe is deciding to go out of this dependence. This will change the scenario even on the world market. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Vladimir Putin can use that money elsewhere, just not in the west. OLAF SCHOLZ: But he cannot buy -- MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is it still $2 billion a month that Germany is sending to Russia? OLAF SCHOLZ: It is always decreasing. And we draft the sanctions in the way that they hurt Putin. And this is what we do. And, once again, we are now doing real investments into technology and pipelines and ports. And I know there are people that sometimes think that when you are having - taking a decision one afternoon, the next morning you have a port and a 40 kilometers pipeline. MARGARET BRENNAN: No, it takes time. OLAF SCHOLZ: But in the real life this is not happening. When Europe is deciding to go out of the import of - of gas from Russia, this will have consequences. MARGARET BRENNAN: It will have huge - I mean this is the equivalent of them declaring war on you, by cutting gas supplies to Germany. OLAF SCHOLZ: Hundred - hundred -- this is - MARGARET BRENNAN: This isn't just your choice. They're using that as a weapon against you. OLAF SCHOLZ: This is, obviously, the case. And this is why I was starting to discuss the question what to do if the gas delivery will be reduced right when I entered office. We should be very much prepared that we will have high energy prices all over the world in all countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: So Germany's heavy industry association, BDI, warned a halt in Russian gas deliveries would make recession inevitable. OLAF SCHOLZ: It is not -- it will be very tough if we will have a shortage of energy supplies. Obviously, all our countries, all our life is depending on the supply of energy. And, obviously, a lot of countries -- the most countries of the world are depending on the supply from (INAUDIBLE). And so we have to prepare for a difficult situation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin is weaponizing inflation. He's weaponizing food. Is he right to bet that he can fracture the western alliance by making it harder for Europeans and Americans and everyone else to afford food in these months ahead? OLAF SCHOLZ: You are very right. The shortages of food, many people in the world are seeing now as a threat to them, are the direct consequence of what Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the war he is imposing on the country. You're right that all the rising energy prices are also a direct consequence of his doing. And he is -- he is the one that is doing the wrong things. And we are always discussing this with our partners on the globe. We are starting an initiative to support countries that have not enough food with food. MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't reopen the Black Sea Ports, if Putin doesn't agree to let the food out of Ukraine, how do you lower global food prices? OLAF SCHOLZ: We are now collecting money for supporting the poorest countries, that they will be able to deliver food to the people. And this is our international initiative. We organized together with others for food security, and we will continue to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it risks global instability. OLAF SCHOLZ: It is a real problem and it is a real consequence of Putin's war. And this is why it is even more necessary that we support the people. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it also puts pressure to end this conflict sooner. What is your timeline for when this can end? OLAF SCHOLZ: The conflict will end when Putin understands that he will not be successful, tis idea to - just to conquer part of territory of his neighbor. MARGARET BRENNAN: Members of the German government have admitted it was a mistake to be so dependent on Russia for so long. OLAF SCHOLZ: I think it was not right that we were not prepared to have at any time the chance to change the one that is delivering gas, oil and coal to us. So We should have invested all over Europe in infrastructure that gives us the ability to change the supply from one day to the other. And I think this is the lesson that has been learned in Europe and in many other places, that you have to prepare -- be prepared for a situation like this. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden also talks about this potential conflict between democracies and autocracies. Is that the biggest threat on the horizon? OLAF SCHOLZ: We should be clear about the threats that are coming to our future, and this is coming from autocracies, yes, because they tend to be aggressive. And this is an aspect we should be very much aware of. And I am. And this is why I organized our meeting we had in Germany with the G-7 group of democratic -- economically successful democratic states that we invite partners from all over the globe that are also democracies for making it happen that the democracies are strong. MARGARET BRENNAN: And by strong, it also comes with 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe and 300,000 NATO response forces in Europe. This isn't just diplomacy, this is muscle. OLAF SCHOLZ: This is. And it's necessary. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Chancellor, thank you for your time this morning. OLAF SCHOLZ: Thank you. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Our full interview is on our website and our YouTube channel. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Leaders at the G-7 last week pledged an additional $4.5 billion to address what the secretary general of the United Nations is calling an unprecedented global hunger crisis. But aid organizations are warning it won't be enough, as Russia's war in Ukraine severs supply lines and inflation continues raging. CBS News foreign correspondent Debora Patta is in South Sudan with this report. (BEGIN VT) DEBORA PATTA (voice over): Hunger is a never-ending season in South Sudan. For three years, this country has been battered by one climate change shock after another. Apocalyptic flooding in the north, crippling drought in the southeast. Millions were already starving. Then came the war in Ukraine, triggering the U.N.'s biggest humanitarian crisis this century as food and fuel prices soared, tipping this country over the edge. In Guit (ph), floodwaters have still not receded. DEBORA PATTA (on camera): I'm standing in a place where people used to live. These were their homes. This was the land that they used to cultivate and live off. And now it's completely submerged under water. DEBORA PATTA (voice over): Sarah Nyawal's (ph) entire village is gone. She has nothing to eat but the water lilies she's collecting. In the community of Canal Pigi (ph), every child brought to nutritionist Mona Shaik (ph) during our visit was severely malnourished. SARAH NYAWAL: I'm afraid, you know, any child like that, we are very close to losing them. DEBORA PATTA (on camera): Really? SARAH NYAWAL: Within days. DEBORA PATTA (voice over): There was Nyanjima Gatlak (ph), who walked for over a month to get food for her weak and listless eight month old baby, Kang (ph). And Nyabany Kong (ph), who already lost one child to hunger and hasn't eaten for two weeks. Her mother-in-law, Nakoni (ph), is wasting away. Battling almost impossible odds, the World Food Program is doing its best. But since Russia invaded Ukraine, their costs have risen exponentially. WFP's Marwa Awad (ph) says they've been forced to suspend aid to nearly 2 million of the 6 million people they feed here. MARWA AWAD: We're having to do humanitarian triage. This is the worst thing that any humanitarian or aid worker has to do. We must do something to help. DEBORA PATTA: Subsistence (ph) farmer Nachapa Lamunia's (ph) own mother starved to death. This was her last bag of food rations for the year. It will be finished in two weeks. Just tell the world we need food, she implored. And when you visit again, she said, we will smile and tell stories of how we survived and find ways to help others in need. No one should die of hunger. There's enough food to feed everyone on earth. The stories we heard continue to haunt us. The people of South Sudan, the world, must not forget. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Debora Patta reporting in South Sudan. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: According to the Gates Foundation, the maternal mortality rate is higher here than in any other developed country. And the elimination of federal protection for abortion rights only underscores that reality and the risks ahead. Dr. Henning Tiemeier is the director of the Maternal Health Task Force at Harvard University and he joins us now. Good morning to you, Doctor. HENNING TIEMEIER, M.D. (Maternal Health Task Force Director at Harvard University): Hello, Margaret, and good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning. I think this is incredibly important because I want to put the issue of abortion itself aside for a moment and talk about pregnancy in America as these states rewrite these laws. So, how is it possible that in the richest country in the world we have the highest maternal mortality rate? And how do we stop it from getting worse? HENNING TIEMEIER: Well, I have to say two things to that. First of all, there seems to be an issue with the data. We think it's higher than in other developed countries, so it is higher. But some of the uptick we've seen recently is partly due to poor data collection. So, that has been corrected, but it is higher. So why is it higher? We think that has to do with the general health of women in America. So, it is a background risk. And it is partly due to poverty, to poor health care during pregnancy, and, importantly, poor care after pregnancy, after delivery. MARGARET BRENNAN: It -- the mortality rate among black mothers is three times higher than white women. Why? HENNING TIEMEIER: That is correct. It is much higher. It is substantially higher. And it is -- you must understand that there's about 700 women dying during or after labor or in the first months after delivering. Seven hundred per year. And we know that most of these deaths are preventable. And they, indeed, occur in minorities more often and in particular in black women. And why that is, is essentially one of the biggest challenges of public health. And we see that as the top of the iceberg of poor health in women and poor health in black women. And there are several reasons that seems to go from poverty, to discrimination, to poor care for this group of women. MARGARET BRENNAN: So according to the CDC, nearly 40 percent of all abortions performed in this country happen among black women. So, in laying out what you did, I would base the assumption that you are projecting that the death rate for these mothers will also climb? HENNING TIEMEIER: I don't think we have good projections in numbers at the moment because that will depend on many of the issues, actually, that you touched on before, on the legal issues, on the access to abortion in other states. But we know that abortion occurs in people of poverty and in minorities much more often. We know that they have difficulties to access abortion outside the state. So we think it will impact their physical and mental health. How many deaths, nobody knows. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HENNING TIEMEIER: It is very hard. It will - it will - it's -- I wouldn't want to quantify that. MARGARET BRENNAN: No. HENNING TIEMEIER: I couldn't put a number. It depends on so many other things. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you know, we looked at Medicaid coverage in this country. It covers about 40 percent of all births in the country. And the federal government is trying to get states to take more money to extend maternal health care so it's not just cut off at two months, but it goes for longer so women can get pelvic exams and they can get other things after they give birth. States like Mississippi aren't doing that. What's the consequence if you don't have access to health care after two months? HENNING TIEMEIER: So, what you're pointing out now is one of the big issues and one of the things that could be addressed quickly. There are numerous states, Mississippi is one of them, but don't forget Texas is another one, and that counts in big numbers, that have not expanded, as we say, Medicaid. They have not accepted the Affordable Care Act offer to expand health care to women in the first year. And I would actually say it should go further than that in the first year after delivery. That means that you have very little right and very little coverage. So only the very, very poor in these states are covered, but a big number of poor women, of relatively poor, low income women, women that struggle to make the time and the money to be ensured, are not covered for things like mental health, physical checkups, even -- so they will not have the pelvic examinations that are needed, you are right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So America looks a lot different now than it did in 1973. Brookings says about 40 percent of U.S. households have women as the prime bread winner. So, I want to ask you how important it is, in your view, from a medical perspective, that women be able to take recovery time after childbirth, because, of course, as you know, in this country, there is no federal guarantee of paid family leave. So if these women have to work to support their family, their job's in question, essentially, or at least being paid for it. HENNING TIEMEIER: I think this is such an important issue. It's, in a way, underrecognized. I know that the vice president addressed some of this. But it is very important to see that we need many measures to improve maternal health. One of them would be to improve prenatal care and the other is indeed to improve postnatal care, but also to support families. And it is in particular poor disadvantaged families, buying them time. So, giving them leave -- paid leave is very important because having a child is a stress on the system. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HENNING TIEMEIER: Imagine you have three children, you have a fourth one, then you need - you know, if you're making a minimum low (ph), you will not manage to - to make your ends meet. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. HENNING TIEMEIER: You will not find the time to breastfeed. We see that breastfeeding is - is not going up as we wished it would because of this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. HENNING TIEMEIER: So, I argue, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor - HENNING TIEMEIER: And many of my colleagues, that we need time. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will continue to cover your research. Thank you. We'll cover those issues on this program as well. I have to leave it there, though. So, we'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Here in the nation's capital, we are surrounded with reminders of the challenges our forefathers faced in times of great conflict here at home and abroad. There are tributes to those who fought for America's freedom from tyranny, to those who led Americans through some of is darkest times in our 246-year-old history. There are collections of the histories of oppressed minorities who fought for equal footing among their fellow Americans. And monuments to the titans who fought for equality and justice, a fight that continues to this very day. Sprinkled throughout there are bits of wisdom from these giants. When we look at them today, one might think that maybe they knew where we were headed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: They seek to establish systems of government based on the regimentation of all human beings by a handful of individual rulers call this a new order. It is not new and it is not order. (END VIDEO CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: We can gather strength from looking back as we struggle to go forward. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. Happy Fourth of July. (ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

And this week on Face the Nation: With just 15 days to go until midterm Election Day, both sides are making their closing arguments about why they deserve your vote. Campaign '22 is hitting the homestretch now. With Democrats facing economic headwinds, is President Biden a drag on some Democratic tickets? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be here. Plus, we will talk with the administration's senior energy security adviser, Amos Hochstein, about those stubbornly high gas prices. Then, we will look at the surge of respiratory virus cases affecting the very young with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. And we will get more on political misinformation and election security with tech journalist Kara Swisher and CBS News cybersecurity expert and analyst Chris Krebs. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. On this last full week in October, polls continue to show some incredibly tight races across the country. Can Democrats revive their stalled momentum and get their supporters to the polls, or will Republicans take control of the House and possibly the Senate? President Biden has been on the campaign trail and Pennsylvania telling reporters, it ain't over until it's over, quoting Yogi Berra, of course. Senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe reports. (Begin VT) AUDIENCE: Fetterman! Fetterman! ED O'KEEFE (voice-over): From Pennsylvania... LT. GOVERNOR JOHN FETTERMAN (D-Pennsylvania): Dr. Oz celebrated when Roe v. fell. (BOOING) ED O'KEEFE: ... to Arizona. GOVERNOR GLENN YOUNGKIN (R-Virginia): Hello, Arizona! ED O'KEEFE: ... Democratic and Republican candidates are making their final arguments. BETO O'ROURKE (D-Texas Gubernatorial Candidate): There's this attack on our democracy, on the very right to vote. ED O'KEEFE: Republicans are sticking to a message focused on the economy and crime. MEHMET OZ (R-Pennsylvania Senatorial Candidate): This is an economic and health crisis. A doctor can help fix it. I will keep us safe, cut your taxes and protect our jobs. BLAKE MASTERS (R-Arizona Senatorial Candidate): You think you and your family deserve better than open borders and fentanyl and double-digit crime increases? ED O'KEEFE: While many Democrats believe a focus on abortion rights will help bring out their base. KAMALA HARRIS (Vice President of the United States): The Republican Party have been very clear that it is their agenda to have a national ban on abortion. ED O'KEEFE: For his part, President Biden has been touting his work to curb inflation and cut gas prices. Last week, he approved the release of more oil from America's Strategic Reserve, but denied any connection to the looming election. JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): I have been doing this for how long now? It's not politically motivated at all. ED O'KEEFE: Despite the president's work, many Democrats in the most competitive races don't want to be seen with him. QUESTION: Tim Ryan in Ohio said he doesn't want you there. Warnock said -- wouldn't say. Do you think they're making a mistake? PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: No, there have been 16 I have already done. And we're getting a lot more asked. ED O'KEEFE: One Democrat who is in big demand, former President Barack Obama, who's now on the airwaves for Democrats in key races... BARACK OBAMA (Former President of the United States): You can count on John Fetterman. Make sure he can count on you. ED O'KEEFE: ... and plans to campaign in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin. (End VT) ED O'KEEFE: In the coming days, attention will focus on Pennsylvania, where Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz will meet in their one and only debate. And here in Washington, there are looming fights over raising the debt limit and future funding for the war in Ukraine, as Republicans say they will force a rethinking on those issues if they take control of Congress -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, thank you. And we are joined now by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Good morning, and it's great to have you here at the table, Speaker. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D-California): My pleasure. Thank you. Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have said a lot is going to be determined by turnout. But you've heard our CBS estimates have the Republicans taking the House with 224 seats. How do you shift the momentum? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, let's just say, first and foremost, good morning. It's Sunday morning, 15 days or so before the election vote. Vote -- people are already voting. We're very pleased with our early vote for our owning-the-ground initiative. I -- it's interesting to me, because, for a year-and-a-half, the media has been saying, oh, they've gone -- it's gone, the president's party always loses in the off-year. And now we're down to the stretch. And we're down to very close races. And we feel very confident. I have been in over 20 states since Congress adjourned in the last month or so. And I see very clearly that the ownership of the ground is with us. It's about getting out the vote. Everything else is a conversation compared to that. But, in order to do that, you have to have inspiration. You can't run on empty. And the fact is, is that, when I hear people talk about inflation, as I heard him there, we have to change that subject. Inflation is a global phenomenon -- phenomenon. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The E.U., the European Union, the U.K., the British, have a higher inflation rate than we do here. It's not -- the fight is not about inflation. It's about the cost of living. And if you look at what we have done to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, to bring down the cost of -- of energy and the rest in our legislation, you will see that that has been opposed every step of the way by the Republicans, and they have no plan for lowering the cost of living or helping with inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely, inflation is a global problem. And it's hitting a lot of countries very hard. But there is also that question of fiscal spending. Congressman Jim Clyburn, who serves in leadership alongside you, said the following earlier this week: (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE JAMES CLYBURN (D-South Carolina): All of us are concerned about these rising costs. And all of us knew this would be the case when we put in place this recovery program. Any time you put more money into the economy, prices tend to rise. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you also realize at that time that the congressional spending would add to inflation? Did you see that risk then? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, first -- first of all, government spending does -- we had a pandemic, and that brought down unemployment from 7 percent to 3.5 percent now. It put people back to work, children back in school, inoculations in the arm, and it helped take us through that stage of the pandemic. But let me just say that, because of people -- more people working and the rest, the national -- the deficit has been cut in half from $2.8 to $1.4 trillion. That is a big change. So, it is -- it's, yes, we had to take a step forward to solve the pandemic problem, but we did so in a way that would reduce the national deficit. And that is -- cannot be ignored. MARGARET BRENNAN: But on things like sending, you know, those $1,400 checks, putting cash out there. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes, that's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, didn't that end up contributing to inflation? Do you have any regrets about the bills you passed and how you structured them? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: No, absolutely not, because this -- that was necessary for people to survive. Our purpose... MARGARET BRENNAN: The risk, though, was that it was inflationary. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: But the point is, is that, when you reduce unemployment, it's inflationary. That is a fact. When I was a new member of Congress, I was told that unemployment was dangerously low in our hearings on inflation and unemployment. Unemployment is dangerously low for what it does to inflation. But the fact is, the point is, is that this is about helping America's working families meet their needs. And that was essential to them, less inflationary than a $2 trillion tax cut for the high end that the Republicans gave and we're still paying a price for, $2 trillion, 83 percent of the benefits going to the top 1 percent. So we feel proud of what we've done. We feel proud of the president to help America's working families to lower their cost, and, in doing so, to reduce the deficit. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the issues that voters tell CBS News are important to them, abortion ranks number seven, up top, economy, inflation, crime, immigration. Was it a miscalculation to believe that the momentum from striking down Roe vs. Wade was going to help Democrats? Why not talk more about these issues around the economy? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, I can just say this. Nobody ever -- elections are about the future. They're about the economy. Everybody knows that. Nobody said we're doing abortion, rather than the economy, but it's -- it's about both. And I can tell you that that issue is very, very provocative and encouraging people to vote across the country... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: ... having just been there, not sitting in Washington, but while going around the country. But I will say this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty-four percent of likely voters, according to our polling, are motivated by this issue of Roe. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: And that's a good number. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you need them to win, right? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: They need to show up. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: But let me -- yes, let me say this. Here's what happens. Let's just talk about what this comes down to in these races and why I'm optimistic about it. I mean, it's a fight. These are close races. It's like the Olympics. And a half-a-second, you can be gold, silver, bronze, or honored to be an Olympian. So these are tough fights. But that's what they are. And it's a big change from what the media was -- media thread of, oh, they can't possibly win. No, we can possibly win. But here's the thing. In these districts, the district -- the Republicans have said that, if they win, they want to subject Medicare, Social Security, health blackmail, to lifting the debt ceiling. They have said they would like to review Medicare and Social Security every five years. They have said that they would like to make it a discretionary spending, that Congress could decide to do it or not, rather than mandatory. So, Social Security and Medicare are on the line. A woman's right to choose is on the line. The planet is on the line, issues that relate to prescription drugs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: For years, we've been trying to get the -- the secretary to negotiate for lower prices. We couldn't get it done, until we had the Democratic president and a strong majority enough in the Congress to get it done. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that, the future and the new Congress potentially. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: You told Andrea Mitchell earlier this week: \"We need generational change, but, in some cases, there's no substitute for experience.\" REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you remain in leadership in the new Congress? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: I'm not talking about that. I'm here to talk about how we win the election. MARGARET BRENNAN: But to deliver on all these things... REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: I was only paying -- I was only paying Andrea a compliment for all the experience that she has. MARGARET BRENNAN: I see. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The -- but the fact is, what we need to... MARGARET BRENNAN: So you may or you may not? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: I'm not here to talk about me. I'm here to talk about the future, America's working families, for the children. It's always about the children. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: And the point is this, that the -- these issues, if you're a senior, you have a lot at risk. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: If you're a childbearing age woman, you have a lot at risk, if -- your family does. If you care -- if you care about the planet, you have a lot at risk. They said it's a hoax. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: When we had the debate on our funding for addressing the climate crisis, not one Republican vote. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: We talked about -- so, what we need to go forward with is more that we had in our agenda and childcare... MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: ... child tax credit, issues like that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Speaker, I appreciate you coming here today. We did also invite the Republican House leader to join us. He declined the invitation. We'll be right back. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Thank you. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to former FDA Commissioner, Pfizer board member Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Dr. Gottlieb, it is great to see you. But I have other tough issues to ask you about, including this surge in respiratory infections among children in 33 states now. We're seeing some pediatric units overwhelmed. Why is this happening, and why is it having such a powerful impact? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Well, look, we're seeing a surge right now in Respiratory Syncytial Virus. This is a virus that we typically see in the late winter. We started to see cases in the summertime. And we're seeing a peak in cases right now. This is not unlike the season last year, where we also saw an early peak in those cases. Some people ascribe it to the fact that children have been somewhat removed from these circulating pathogens, so you don't have as much immunity in the population generally. So it's changed the typical cycle for this virus. And we're seeing these waves of infection from RSV earlier in the season than we would normally see. For most people, this is a self-limiting infection. It's an upper respiratory infection. It causes cold-like symptoms. But, for children under the age of 2, it can be a serious infection. And it's especially concerning for those who are immunocompromised, children who are immunocompromised, or those in a neonatal intensive care unit, as well as older adults, elderly Americans... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: ... or people who have other kinds of conditions that put them at risk. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this is happening, you have flu season coming, and we have COVID ticking up. The White House says everyone needs to go out and get their COVID booster by Halloween. Do you agree with that timeline? And how do you protect yourself against all of these respiratory risks? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think now's a prudent time to not just get the COVID booster, the new bivalent vaccine, but also the flu vaccine. Right now, we have flu cases picking up. It looks like this may be a more aggressive flu season. The predominant strain right now is H3N2. And the vaccine appears to be a good match for the strain. So, the vaccine, based on what we see right now based on the genetic sequence of the strain that's circulating and the antigen that's in the vaccine, does suggest that the vaccine is going to be quite protective this season. So it's a good time to get it. I think, in terms of just protecting yourselves, it's just the normal things that we advise people to do, wash your hands, try to avoid crowded spaces, if you are someone who's at risk. And if you don't feel well, stay home. Don't send a child to school if they're not feeling well, so you don't expose others to an infection. MARGARET BRENNAN: Wear a mask? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: So, all the things that we have learned to do to just good -- well, look, I think, if you're someone who's at risk or someone who wants to take extra precaution, one-way masking, we know, does work, if you're going to wear a high-quality mask. I don't think people are going to be generally wearing them right now. But I think, for people who are at risk, who want extra -- an extra measure of protection, that's another step... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: ... that can help afford them that. The one thing -- the final thing I will say is that, for parents who have children who have an upper respiratory infection, many times, they're testing them, finding out it's not COVID and feeling relieved. I think they still need to be vigilant that it could be RSV, it could be early flu. So, if you see progressive symptoms, seek out help from a doctor. There are treatments that are available that could help children with RSV. MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted. It is election season. And I want to ask you about a false claim about COVID vaccines that really hit the campaign trail, and it's been in conservative circles in particular. Under U.S. law, just to be clear, the CDC does not mandate vaccines, as we have talked about here before. The state governors have the authority to do that. Can you explain what the CDC advisers actually did last week? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, well, this week, they took the recommendation that already existed for children to get vaccinated with the COVID vaccine, which was their general recommendation they issued last year. And they incorporated it into their formal recommendations, which are their permanent recommendations. Some people refer to it as their vaccine schedule. That doesn't translate into state mandates. There are a lot of vaccines in that schedule. For example, the flu vaccine is in that schedule. They recommend that for children. No states mandate that. The HPV vaccine is in the schedule. Only two states mandate the HPV vaccine for children to attend school, Virginia and Rhode Island. Even the dengue fever vaccine is in the schedule. And, obviously, no states mandate the use of that. So, what got started on Twitter initially was that the CDC recommendations automatically translate into state mandates, which is not true. One of the reasons why the CDC went ahead and made this formal recommendation is that it also allows the vaccines to be incorporated into the Vaccines for Children's Program, which provides federal funding for indigent kids to get access to vaccines. And so that's part of the impetus. But there will be no state mandates. Quite frankly, I don't think there should be state mandates. I don't think we're at the point right now where we should be considering mandating this vaccine as a condition to attend school. While I think every child should seek out this vaccine, parents should strongly consider vaccinating their kids, I don't think it should be mandated by states. And I wouldn't expect to see any state mandating this vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Thank you for your clarity on that, because the misinformation -- misinformation, you just said, started on Twitter. Tucker Carlson amplified it. But, as we just showed our viewers, you see a number of candidates and sitting governors spreading this. You have presidential candidate potentially Mike Pompeo. You have the governor of Virginia, the governor of Utah, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the GOP candidate for governor of Arizona, Kari Lake. They're all putting out tweets with this false idea. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. And... MARGARET BRENNAN: So there's clearly a political force in an anti-vaccine sentiment. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think, from a public health standpoint, the more that this becomes a political matter, and the more people make this a political matter, the campaign against mandates bleeds into a campaign against the vaccine itself. And people generally don't take away the nuance of those messages, if there is any nuance in those messages in the first place. They hear the skepticism against the vaccine, and then they're less likely to consider it for themselves, even where it makes sense from a clinical standpoint. I didn't see a lot of people stepping up and saying, look, my state won't mandate the vaccine. We believe these are decisions that should be left to pediatricians and parents. But I would strongly encourage parents to make sure that their children are up to date with all the available vaccines, especially in advance of this flu and COVID season. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That would have been an appropriate message, in my view, for a governor to say who wanted to say, look, we're not going to mandate it, but we still think it's important. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I -- the closest I saw anyone coming to that was Spencer Cox in Utah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And, to be clear, the CDC wasn't as clear as they could have been either. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's why we wanted you to help translate that for our viewers today. Dr. Gottlieb, I have to leave it there. So good to see you again. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to threats to election security and efforts to combat false information online. We're joined by CBS News cybersecurity expert and analyst Chris Krebs and Kara Swisher, tech journalist and host of the podcasts On With Kara Swisher and Pivot. Good to have you both here. KARA SWISHER (Host, Pivot): Thanks for having us. MARGARET BRENNAN: We were just talking about this to Dr. Gottlieb, but on the election front -- and, Kara, I want to start with you -- there have been these recent studies talking about Facebook, TikTok approving even ads with political misinformation on them. How does this continue to happen with vaccines and with political misinformation? Why can't these platforms get control? KARA SWISHER: Because they don't want to make those decisions. They want to opt themselves out of decision-making on editorial. And you heard Nick Clegg, who's running -- is number two at Facebook right now, essentially, just gave an interview where he talked about that: We shouldn't be the arbiters of this. We shouldn't do this. It should be government. But then -- then we have the First Amendment, so government can't intercede. So, I think they don't -- there's just so much of it, and it floods the zone so much, and they make money from it, that they don't want to -- they don't want the responsibility for it, even though it's on their platforms and they should have the responsibility. MARGARET BRENNAN: And some of it sort of dances or flirts with distortions. And so you have to be in that government business of spotting this. But, Chris, how do you even do that? FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, it's -- it's a challenge, as Kara pointed out with the First Amendment issues. You know, DHS launched their Disinformation Governance Board earlier in the year, and that was not actually met with any kind of fanfare, and they ultimately sort of backed down, even though efforts they were taking through that group were -- have been under way for a decade or more within DHS. So, one of the things that we looked at back in the 2020 election was not so much the specific claims or the specific elements of mis- or dis- information, but it was more the thematics that were emerging, so not pinning it to a single individual, instead looking at, hey, these are some of the claims we were seeing, and here are the security controls or preventions in place that would actually not allow that to happen in an election. And we're seeing some continuation of that, but, once again, there's so much of it. And, once it hits, it's really hard to go bit by bit and pull it back. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to show our viewers some of the video, that our CBS affiliate out in Arizona filmed multiple incidents of possible voter intimidation. They had armed individuals wearing tactical gear, as you can see there, camped out by a voter drop box. There were other two with handguns that were concealed yesterday. So, some of this is driven towards a very specific conspiracy that emerged, right? So, Chris, how does the FBI head this off, and not allow it to go into political violence? FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, the -- I think the important thing here is that, if any voter or election official sees these sort of things happening in Arizona -- Arizona, they -- they make a report. They tell the -- the relevant officials, and they can investigate, and they can look at these people. They can investigate, ensure -- and then there's a deterrence measure in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it takes the guy with the tactical gear before that happens? I mean... FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, and -- and that's the biggest challenge here, as I see it, is that the continued efforts to delegitimize the 2020 election are resulting in candidates that are incentivized to push these lies. But, also, then you have a radicalization and activation across the voter base that are effectively -- this is performative. These -- this doesn't happen. You know, the claims of mules and ballot trafficking, it doesn't happen, particularly in a way that someone like this would -- would be able to detect anything. Moreover, what's happening is, the people that are being accused of ballot trafficking or being a mule actually report it to the officials and say: Here's my name. Here's my contact information. I was accused of this. Would any legitimate fraudster or mule do that and then report on themselves? Of course not. So, it's all performative. And, unfortunately, I am concerned that it results in violence. KARA SWISHER: It's -- more importantly, chaos is the point... FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Yes. KARA SWISHER: ... chaos and discord. It's actually from the Russian playbook. FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Yes. KARA SWISHER: Chaos is what they want, discord, problems, making people radicalized, radicalizing people. And it's -- it's in the mainstream. Before, it was sort of -- it bubbles up from the bottom, but now it's pushed down from the top. And so, just last night, you saw Trump say a number of things that were radicalizing. I don't know what else to say it. And so that goes down, and then it goes back up. And it's -- it's hit the mainstream now. They don't even need these -- these ads or anything else, because it's now infected some of the public so much. And so this is where people get their news, a lot of news. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. FORMER DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Yes. KARA SWISHER: And, before this, we had sort of information obesity. Not enough people got good news. Now they get a lot of information, but not actual facts. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a quick break and come back, talk more about this in a moment. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation now with Chris Krebs and Kara Swisher. Kara, I want to pick up with you. We've been talking about social media. Twitter may find a new buyer, billionaire Elon Musk. KARA SWISHER: Yes, on Friday. MARGARET BRENNAN: On -- Friday is the day, I believe. KARA SWISHER: Yes, supposedly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Mark Warner, who chairs the Intel Committee, has said that there is no American more dependent upon the largess of the communist party than Elon Musk. He's the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, the rocket ships. Bloomberg saying that the administration's going to have to do national security reviews potentially of businesses he owns. KARA SWISHER: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how much of a risk is it if this transaction goes through? KARA SWISHER: It depends on what they find, I guess. You know, I mean I think the issue is - is he -- he already does a lot of defense work. A lot with the rockets and everything else. And it's considered very innovative and has done amazing things. The International Space Station is - is -- depends on Elon Musk and his rockets. And so he does a lot of - you know, obviously, with transportation, that's another area that's important to look at, and who owns it. And Twitter also. Who -- this is a big communications platform, even though it's a terrible business, so who owns it matters. And so, who are his investors? Who is putting money into it, et cetera, et cetera, should be looked at as a matter of course. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, yes, I mean it's almost kind of amazing, Chris, that - that there isn't more scrutiny. I mean there is FCC scrutiny of ownership of news organizations. KARA SWISHER: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to social media and a company like TikTok, it's owned by a Chinese firm. An increasing number of Americans are relying on it for actual news, not just tweeting about themselves but actual news. Is this a risk? CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, I - I think, just to the - to your point, as more people use these platforms, as they get more information, as they're shifting away from traditional media that we're all used to, the intelligence services of our adversary are seeing this shift as well. And so it's not necessarily specifically about TikTok. It's all platforms. And it's all avenues. But TikTok represents a specific risk. And - and a colleague of mine wrote a paper, Dakota Carey (ph) wrote a paper for cyber scoop talking about how it's not necessarily the data security challenges, it's that the Chinese Communist Party may have the ability through the parent company of TikTok to actually shape narratives, suppress, lift, shape what we see on a daily basis. And it doesn't have to be everything you see all the time, it can just be enough. KARA SWISHER: Yes. CHRISTOPHER KREBS: It can just be enough, a little bit. And I think about what happens if -- if the Chinese invade Taiwan? What happens in the runup to the '24 election if they're not happy with some of the more - you know, the stronger stance that this administration is taking in China? MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. CHRISTOPHER KREBS: There's a significant amount of risk exposure we have here. KARA SWISHER: And then who -- who owns Twitter? Who - who are his investors? I think that's a normal question for a government to ask. You know, the CCP doesn't own CBS, to my knowledge, so - MARGARET BRENNAN: The Chinese Community Party, no. But, for Elon Musk, I know you know him, and last question here on this. Russia watcher Fiona Hill said Putin plays the egos of big men, gives them a sense that they can play a role, but in reality they're just direct transmitters of messages from Vladimir Putin. She just gutted Elon Musk when he was pushing pro-Russia positions. I mean, is it really that? I mean are -- are adversaries use business icons to further their foreign policy? KARA SWISHER: Why, yes, that's happened before. I don't know if you've heard about President Donald Trump. I mean people have talked about that. So, yes, I think - I think Elon's doing this on his own. But he's -- you know, he's -- he's -- a lot of people in Silicon Valley are also mouthing the same thing. There's sort of a certain class of tech bros (ph) that are into this idea. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you still think this transition - transaction -- KARA SWISHER: Well, they have no -- foreign policy experience, or they have no business doing this, but that doesn't stop them, which is about everything. There are excerpts on everything case (ph) because they're the richest people in the world, in case you didn't know. So, I think it's slightly dangerous. I don't know, Chris? CHRISTOPHER KREBS: A little bit. MARGARET BRENNAN: We could keep talking about this. CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to keep talking about this but I have to take a break here - CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Next week. MARGARET BRENNAN: And bring some important information to you from voters themselves, actually. We wanted to better understand how Americans could impact the vote in the year's elections. And our CBS News campaign 2020, I -- 2022 -- sorry, it's moving quickly, eye in America is tracking four groups of what we are calling election influencers. And on Friday we spoke to some pressured parents. These are voters who describe themselves as feeling post-pandemic stress over finances and kids. (BEGIN VT) LASHAWN (Democrat): I feel like Biden is doing a pretty good job. But my concern is like the crime. I want to know who is - you know, what exactly will they do about this because it's -- it's out of control in Chicago. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about in Arkansas and Texas? STEPHANIE (Independent): I live more in the suburbs. So it's not as prevalent in my neighborhood. But it's still something that's concerning. JOHN (Republican): Not so much. Greg Abbott, our governor, does a great job. And the only thing, you know, that we've been having trouble with is, you know, the border. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, immigration is a concern for you in these upcoming elections? JOHN: We just left a pandemic. When you have thousands upon thousands every day crossing over, they don't have to get tested. You know, we don't know what they're bringing in. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some of those pandemic-era restrictions are still in place along the border. What do you need to see that would change your impression of immigration in this country? JOHN: I - I really like how DeSantis and Abbott have been taking them and - and shipping them out to bluer states so they can recognize the problems that we've been having in - in Texas and in Arizona. You know, we -- Greg Abbott needs to have a lot more control over the border itself. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you will still vote Republican in this upcoming -- JOHN: Yes. I - I would still support Greg Abbott because his running -- he's running up against Beto, Beto, and, you know, he -- he's all about the open border. MARGARET BRENNAN: Show of hands, will all of you accept the election results from these midterm races in 2022? Yes? All of you trust the elections that -- and the systems to run them? How would all of you describe the current state of the U.S. economy? STEPHANIE: Oh, I would say scary. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scary? STEPHANIE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lashawn, how would you describe it? LASHAWN: I would say it's unstable because it's just so much going on. MARGARET BRENNAN: John, in one - in one word, how would you describe the U.S. economy? JOHN: Horrible. MARGARET BRENNAN: Horrible? JOHN: In regards to -- with the inflation. I - I watched last week a bag of six-ounce broccoli go from $1.99 to this week being $2.49. MARGARET BRENNAN: Can I see a show of hands, is anyone driving less because of the cost of gasoline? So, you're still filling up your gas tank and still driving despite prices climbing higher. JOHN: Just to go to work. I got - I drive 11 hours to go to work. MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow. JOHN: I live in east Texas, work in New Mexico. So, I have to buy it regardless. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have high prices changed the way you live your life? LASHAWN: I still have to do whatever I need to do to get around, but, I don't know, what can you do? You have to just adjust. It's not just the, you know, heating, the cost of living, the electricity, everything is just -- it's just really hard. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, John and Stephanie, have you had to make changes in your life because of inflation? STEPHANIE: Yes, ma'am. MARGARET BRENNAN: What have you done? STEPHANIE: We have cut back on our going out to eat, kind of eliminated the Amazon Prime, Netflix, limiting that kind of stuff. I have looked for ways to budget better with groceries. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that President Biden has control or greater influence over the economy? STEPHANIE: I don't think it's just as much Congress and also state and local as it is Biden. I won't think it's just one person. MARGARET BRENNAN: What are your biggest concerns about raising children in America right now? John? JOHN: The whole woke culture affecting our children. All these elementary schools and middle schools having woke culture pushed on them from the LGBT Plus community for sexual identity and gender. We should be pushing the actual school studies, math, social studies, science, not, you know, gender studies or sexual identification. MARGARET BRENNAN: What have you seen that makes you concerned? JOHN: In the district that I am at - I - that I live in, there hasn't been really anything going on. But I'm originally from Iowa. And just recently there was some protests at an Iowa school for bringing in a transgender art -- art show. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're not concerned about your kids in Texas, you're seeing this on the news, that's what's raising your concern? JOHN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lashawn, I'd like to get you to weigh in on this. LASHAWN: I can also agree with some of his points. I really will say sex education. I feel like some things, you know, are brought to the children's attention they wouldn't even think about. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have eight kids. I imagine you have some pretty specific ideas in your mind when you're speaking about this? LASHAWN: Yes, I do. Yes. The children aren't -- you know, they're really influenced. You can teach them one thing at home, but when they go to school, they're just as much influenced by their teachers and their surroundings. And we should have more input, the parents, of what we want them to learn. MARGARET BRENNAN: Stephanie, what -- what's your biggest concern? And if you want to react to any of that, go ahead. STEPHANIE: I - I agree. The other issue has to do with Covid. There's less teachers in the school district. And, because of that, they have student choice school days. So, the students can choose whether or not they want to go to school that day because there's not enough teachers or bus drivers to get them there. And so I worry about their education. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you said your top issue was crime, what did you have in mind? LASHAWN: Robberies and, you know, murders, you know, stabbings and -- it's like it -- every time you turn on the news, somebody killed their baby. And, you know, they're losing their mind. It's like people all -- everywhere are doing everything and it's not -- it's like they're out of control. Nobody's stopping them. MARGARET BRENNAN: John talked about how concerned he was about the border in his state of Texas and migrants coming into the country. LASHAWN: I mean, there's nothing wrong with helping, but there -- we have more problems here in our country. I feel like there's so - so much focus on helping immigrants, and it's not enough focus on the people here that might need assistance. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you blame your mayor and your governor for that or do you blame Washington for that? LASHAWN: It's everybody. Everyone. Washington, the mayor. I mean, using -- it's like they - they help who they want. Certain people, certain groups of people, they'll help them and then they'll neglect someone else. MARGARET BRENNAN: Often when we do these focus groups, we have people of -- from different party affiliations disagreeing with each other, but I'm hearing all of you echo a lot of the same concerns and agreeing with each other. None of you are very optimistic about the country right now. STEPHANIE: No. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For a closer look on that additional release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and its impact on prices, we're joined by Amos Hochstein, the special presidential coordinator for international energy affairs. Good morning. Good to have you back here. President Biden has released more oil from the SPR than all previous presidents combined. Republicans are saying this is depleting the stockpile and it's a national security risk. When you were last here, you said that this would end towards the end of the year. Did you know then that three weeks before the election there was going to be a release? AMOS HOCHSTEIN (Presidential Coordinator On Energy Security): Well, first, it's good to be here. Thank you for having me again. The president, before I came here last time, the president was in the middle already of releasing 180 million barrels. This is still part of that 180 million barrels. So, the announcement that was made the other day is because it takes some time to - to get those barrels released. And these barrels will be released in December. The president's been committed to bringing down gasoline prices. When -- you mentioned when I was here last, we talked about then prices were coming down from $5 and we were about $4.50. Today they're at $3.80 or $3.79. And, in fact, most Americans see prices around $3.40 to $3.50. So, he's been committed to bringing those prices down. And this release is just part of that process that's been going on for months. MARGARET BRENNAN: And he says he may do more, but when we last spoke, you said private industry was expected to pick it up and so that you wouldn't have to keep doing these emergency releases. Why isn't that working? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, I think it is working. The private industry is increasing supply and production. MARGARET BRENNAN: Then why would he have to do more release. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, what the president said is that we are going to be very watchful to see what happens around the world. There are a lot of geopolitical events. The Russian invasion. I don't know what Putin's going to do in December or in January. So, we have to be ready for that. So what the president said is, we're going to complete the 180 that we've - that he has announced many months ago, as he's been doing monthly. That will continue on into December. And then, as we are - we are making sure that we are prepared, so if we need to do additional releases, we can do them very, very quickly. MARGARET BRENNAN: There's going to be a European ban on Russian crude imports on December 5th. That's going to have an impact globally. How much of a shock is that going to have on energy prices ahead of the holidays? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, I think that's exactly what we're talking about, right? So, the president made this release -- announced this release that will happen in December, around the time that the ban comes in. We are also working with Europe and other G7 partners around the world, countries in Asia, to see if we can make sure that we continue to have the Russian barrels on the market, but ensure that the price that -- and the revenues that Russia gets continue to be depressed. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the price cap you're trying to roll out still? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: This is the price cap. Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: So that price cap, though, and the negotiations around this has raised speculation that that was one of the factors in Saudi Arabia's decision to pull 2 million barrels a day off the - off the market. And the president has said he's furious that he's going to retaliate against Saudi Arabia. Is that what happened here? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, look, clearly the president said it better than I can, that he was extremely disappointed in the OPEC decision and that he thought it was a mistake. And, clearly, nobody can argue that it was warranted for any economic reason to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's what OPEC says. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: I understand, but nobody else thinks that it was warranted. And even OPEC, when they announced at 2 million, then they say, well, we're not actually going to cut 2 million, we're just going to cut 900. And then you look a little deeper and it's really just about 500. So the impact on the market is not going to be as significant. So, this was more of a big, political statement that OPEC has - has made. And we're - look -- MARGARET BRENNAN: How so? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Look, at the end of the day, the president was disappointed in what OPEC did, but his commitment is to do things here in the United States, where we can - where we can have an impact on the American economy, bringing down prices as they have. And, look, think about it this way, when I was here last, in June we were at $120 a barrel of oil and $5 of gasoline. Today we're at $85. MARGARET BRENNAN: $85. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: $85. That's - that's 30 percent. MARGARET BRENNAN: And Bank of America has said today they expect an average of $100 a barrel next year. That just came out this morning. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Yes, but look at - but the -- in June Goldman Sachs expected the last quarter of this year to be $140, prices to rise to $140. So the banks keep saying that the prices is going to go up. The president keeps taking decisive action here that has led to these lower prices. MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are short-term fixes that the release is. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: These are not short-term fixes, Margaret. These are -- we've been in this now for eight, nine months. This is almost a year now of higher prices and the president has taken these actions. So, I don't think these are short-term. I understand that the banks make their own analysis. But they've -- they haven't been accurate over the time and the -- what is really what you can measure is that we're down 30 percent on oil prices and we're down over $1.20 in -- in the United States on gasoline. And, in fact, we're now almost every single week for the last several months, we've seen a decline in gasoline prices in the United States. And so we're working with allies. We're trying to strengthen the American economy - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: While also making sure that our allies' economies are strong as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, real quick, are you going to be able to close this deal between Israel and Lebanon that would allow for drilling off their coast? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, I think that this is a really great development, an historic agreement between two enemy countries. Lebanon doesn't even recognize the state of Israel. We're going to have a deal. We're going to sign it hopefully this Thursday. And I hope that this continues to commitment -- our commitment to stability in the region and prosperity for both countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: Amos, good to have you here. Hope to have you back again soon. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the war in Ukraine. First up, our Holly Williams reports from Kyiv. (BEGIN VT) HOLLY WILLIAMS (voice over): In the Russian-occupied city of Kherson, in southern Ukraine, the authorities, installed by Moscow, have now ordered all residents to leave ahead of an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive. Kherson was seized by the Russians in the early days of the invasion. Now Ukraine claims that Russia's planning to blow up a hydroelectric dam in the region to slow the Ukrainian military's advance and has already laid mines, risking a catastrophic flood. Herman Halushchenko is Ukraine's energy minister, and told us if the Russians destroy the dam, it could even leave a nuclear power plant without water for cooling. HOLLY WILLIAMS (on camera): So if the Russians blow the dam, one potential consequence is a nuclear accident. HERMAN HALUSHCHENKO (Ukraine Energy Minister): It could be. It could be. HOLLY WILLIAMS (voice over): As Russian forces struggle to hold onto territory they've seized, they've launched a new wave of attacks on Ukraine's cities, including with so-called kamikaze drones. The U.S. says Iran is supplying drones and even has troops on the ground helping the Russians operate them. Ukraine says the main target, with over 300 strikes, is energy facilities. As a harsh winter looms, there have already been blackouts in some parts of the country. HOLLY WILLIAMS (on camera): What's the worst case scenario here? Could Ukrainians end up this winter with no heating and no electricity? HERMAN HALUSHCHENKO: I think not. But, frankly speaking, it also will depend on how intensive these attacks would be in the future. HOLLY WILLIAMS (voice over): Ukraine says what it's still asking for is more air defense systems from its friends in the west. (END VT) HOLLY WILLIAMS: Ukraine says that Russian strikes on Saturday cut off power to more than 1.4 million households. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Holly, thank you. There are currently 100,000 U.S. troops supporting NATO allies in European countries that surround Ukraine. Our Charlie D'Agata spent time with some in Constantia, Romania. (BEGIN VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice over): The Screaming Eagles have landed. The 101st Airborne Division deployed on the very edge of NATO territory. With Colonel Edwin Matthaidess and Brigadier General John Lubas, we board Blackhawk helicopters and head toward the border with Ukraine. Specifically trained to hit the ground fighting, when the call came, the colonel said his soldiers were ready. COL. EDWIN MATTHAIDESS (Commander, 2nd Brigade Combat Team): And, you know, you could see it on their face that-that all that stuff we had talked about, about being ready, about training hard, you know, not leaving anything on the table, you know, they had a chance to put it into use and they're -- they're doing that same stuff here today. CHARLIE D'AGATA (on camera): Right. It just got real. EDWIN MATTHAIDESS: It did. CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice over): We traverse the Black Sea coast across the water from Russian-held territory in Ukraine and Crimea, until we reached the forward operating site, where soon U.S. and Romanian NATO forces were conducting a joint air and ground assault. Live fire tank and artillery rounds took aim at targets, simulating the battlefields of Ukraine. CHARLIE D'AGATA (on camera): This isn't a routine military exercise against a hypothetical enemy. This is a real-life combat scenario against a very real enemy, one that's not so far away. BRIG. GEN. JOHN LUBAS, (Deputy Commander 101st Airborne Division): We're about 250 miles from the front line of Russian troops. And the way we are dispersed right now, we are ready to transition from our current locations where we're currently at to combat operations on order. CHARLIE D'AGATA: It's the first time the 101st has been headquartered in Europe since the D-day landings, seen here with then General Dwight Eisenhower, prepared to defend European allies again if called upon to fight. Now, almost 80 years later, the 101st is back. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Go, go, go! CHARLIE D'AGATA: Making a mark in history once more. (END VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA: Those military exercises come at a time when broader NATO nuclear exercises are underway, now entering the second week. They involve 60 aircraft from 14 countries, including U.S. B-52 bombers. They were scheduled long before the war in Ukraine began. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Charlie D'Agata, thank you. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0that aired Sunday, Oct. 23, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are joined now by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. Good morning, and it's great to have you here at the table, Speaker.\u00a0 HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: My pleasure, thank you, good morning.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You have said a lot is going to be determined by turnout. But you've heard, our CBS estimates have the Republicans taking the house with 224 seats. How do you shift the momentum? SPEAKER PELOSI: Well, let's just say, first and foremost, good morning, it's Sunday morning, 15 days or so before the election vote, people are already voting, we're very pleased with our early vote for our owning the ground initiative. I- it's interesting to me, because for a year and a half, the media has been saying, Oh, they've go\u2013 it's gone, president's party always loses in the off year. And now we're down to the stretch. And we're down to very close races. And we feel very confident. I've been in over 20 states since Congress adjourned in the last month or so. And I see very clearly that the ownership of the ground is with us. It's about getting out the vote, everything else is a conversation compared to that. But in order to do that, you have to have inspiration, you can't run on empty. And the fact is- is that, when I hear people talk about inflation, as I heard him there, we have to change that subject. Inflation is a global phenomenon- phenomenon. The EU, the European Union, the UK, the British, have higher inflation rate than we do here. It's not- the fight is not about inflation. It's about the cost of living. And if you look at what we have done, to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, to bring down the cost of- of energy and the rest in our legislation, you will see that that has been opposed every step of the way by the Republicans, and they have no plan for lowering the cost of living or helping with inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely. Inflation is a global problem. And it's hitting a lot of countries very hard. But there is also that question of fiscal spending. Congressman Jim Clyburn, who serves in leadership, alongside you said the following earlier this week. JIM CLYBURN SOT: All of us are concerned about these rising costs. And all of us knew this would be the case. When we put in place this recovery program. Anytime you put more money into the economy, prices tend to rise. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you also realize at that time that the congressional spending would add to inflation? Did you see that risk then? SPEAKER PELOSI:\u00a0 Well first- first of all, government spending does- we had a pandemic, and that brought down unemployment from seven percent to three-and-a-half percent now. It put people back to work, children back in school, inoculations in the arm, and it helped take us through that stage of the pandemic. But let me just say that because of people, more people working in the rest, the national deficit has been cut in half from 2.8 to $1.4. Trillion. That is a big change. So it is- it's, yes, we have to take a step forward to solve the pandemic problem. But we did so in a way that would reduce the national deficit and that is cannot be ignored. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, on things like sending you know, those $1,400 checks, putting cash out there. I mean, didn't that end up contributing to inflation? Do you have any regrets about the bills you passed and how you structured them? SPEAKER PELOSI: No, absolutely not. Because this- that was necessary for people to survive. Our purpose\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: The risk though, was that it was inflationary. SPEAKER PELOSI: But the point is, is that, when you reduce unemployment, it's inflationary. That is a fact. When I was a new member of Congress, I was told that unemployment was dangerously low in our hearings on inflation and unemployment. Unemployment is dangerously low for what it does to inflation. But the fact is, the point is, is that this is about helping America's working families meet their needs, and that was essential to them. Less inflationary than a $2 trillion tax cut for the high end that the Republicans gave and we're still paying a price for $2 trillion, 83% of the benefits going to the top 1%. So we feel proud of what we've done. We feel proud of the President. To help America's working families to lower their cost, and in doing so to reduce the deficit. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the issues that voters tell CBS News are important to them, abortion ranks number seven. Up top: economy, inflation, crime, immigration. Was it a miscalculation to believe that the momentum from striking down Roe versus Wade was going to help Democrats? Why not talk more about these issues around the economy? SPEAKER PELOSI: I can just say this. Nobody ever- The elections are about the future. They're about the economy. Everybody knows that. Nobody said we're doing abortion rather than the economy, but it's- it's about both. And I can tell you that that issue is very, very provocative and encouraging people to vote across the country, having just been there not sitting in Washington, but while going around the country, but I will say this\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: 24% of likely voters, according to our polling, are motivated by this\u00a0 issue of Roe. SPEAKER PELOSI: That's a good number.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 But you need them to win. Right? They need to show up. SPEAKER PELOSI: Let me say this, here's what- Let's just talk about what this comes down to in these races and why I'm optimistic about it. I mean, it's a fight. These are close races, it's like the Olympics and a half a second, you can be gold, silver, bronze, or honored to be an Olympian. So these are a tough fight. But that's what they are. And it's a big change from what the media was- media thread of, oh, they can't possibly win. No, we can possibly win. But here's the thing in these districts- the district- the Republicans have said that if they win, they want to subject Medicare, Social Security, health blackmail, to lifting the debt ceiling. They have said they would like to review Medicare and Social Security every five years, they have said that they would like to make it a discretionary spending that Congress could decide to do it or not, rather than mandatory. So Social Security and Medicare are on the line, a woman's right to choose is on the line, the planet is on the line, issues that relate to prescription drugs. For years, we've been trying to get the- the Secretary to negotiate for lower prices. We couldn't get it done until we had the Democratic president and a strong majority enough in the Congress to get it done. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that: the future and the new Congress potentially. You told Andrea Mitchell earlier this week, \"we need generational change, but in some cases, there's no substitute for experience.\" Will you remain in leadership in the new Congress?\u00a0 SPEAKER PELOSI: I'm not talking about that. I'm here to talk about how we win the election. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to deliver on all these things- SPEAKER PELOSI: I was only paying Andrea compliment for all the experience that she has. MARGARET BRENNAN: I see. SPEAKER PELOSI: But, the fact is we need to\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: So you may or you may not?\u00a0 SPEAKER PELOSI: I'm not here to talk about me. I'm here to talk about the future. America's working families, for the children. It's always about the children. And the point is this, that the- these issues if you're a senior, you have a lot at risk. If you're a childbearing age woman, you have a lot at risk if your family does. If you care- if you care about the planet, you have a lot at risk. They said it's a hoax. When we had the debate on our funding for addressing the climate crisis, not one Republican vote. We talked about- So what we need to go forward with is more that we had in our agenda and child care, child tax credit, issues like that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Speaker, I appreciate you coming here today. We did also invite the Republican House leader to join us. He declined the invitation. We'll be right back. SPEAKER PELOSI: Thank you.",

I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. In just a few moments, you will hear our exclusive interview with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Plus, we will hear the U.S. response to what has been a critical week on the national security front, marked by increasingly desperate moves on the part of Russian President Vladimir Putin, as Russia's struggles in their war on Ukraine. Here at home, we have also got a new CBS News poll that reveals some disturbing indications about voters who want to contest the upcoming elections six weeks before Election Day, and the look at the potential impact of those higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve. But we begin with Ukraine. Our Debora Patta has the latest from Kyiv. (Begin VT) DEBORA PATTA (voice-over): Staged polls in occupied cities like these, referendums amid the rubble and ruin of war, a grotesque mockery of democracy, ballots propped up by bullets. Election officials accompanied by armed soldiers go traipsing up flights of stairs, knocking on doors, searching for voters. Others pound the streets with loud hailers. (WOMAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) DEBORA PATTA: Russia news outlets were keen to show enthusiastic voters in occupied Kherson. A day later, that same location was deserted. Ivan Fedorov, the exiled mayor of now occupied Melitopol, calls it a farce. IVAN FEDOROV (Exiled Mayor of Melitopol): I think that we can name Russian, it's terrorists which hold our citizens as hostage. Russians take hostage our citizens now inside Melitopol. DEBORA PATTA: The White House regards the referendums as a sign of Vladimir Putin's weakness following crushing battlefield defeats. (GUNSHOTS) DEBORA PATTA: But Putin is not only a sore loser. He's a dangerous one, threatening nuclear weapons and imposing an immediate call-up for military reservists. It sparked widespread anti-war protests at home, resulting in hundreds of arrests and the panicked exodus of young men fleeing the country to dodge the draft, like Sergei, caught up in a long line of traffic at the Finnish border. SERGEI (Russian Fleeing to Finland): I just pack my bag and directly go to Finland. DEBORA PATTA: Many of those caught up have never fought in a war, let alone one that already has hardened Russian fighters on the run. (End VT) DEBORA PATTA: Nobody's waiting with bated breath here in Ukraine for the results of those elections. It is clear Putin wants to push through a vote to annex the territories quickly. And that could happen as early as this week -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Our Debora Patta reporting from Ukraine. When we spoke to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Saturday, we began with Vladimir Putin's referendum in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine, actions intended to help him justify annexing territory which is equivalent to the size of the state of Maine. It is illegal under international law. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. says they're a sham and intended to take about 15 percent of your territory away. What happens to Ukrainians living in these areas if they respond \"No\" when they are asked if they want to be part of Russia? VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (Ukrainian President) (through translator): The referendum can lead to very tragic moments. You started your question with an answer. That is correct. Those people who don't come to referendum, Russians can turn off their electricity and won't give them an opportunity to live a normal human life. They force people -- they throw them in prisons. They force them to come to these pseudo- referenda. And, also, they also announced mobilization. They're forcing people to fight, people from the temporarily occupied territories. I see other threats when they complete -- if they succeed with these referenda, the ballots have been -- had been already prepared. The Russia -- the Russian government can officially announce that the referendum had been completed, and the results will be announced. This would make it impossible, in any case, to continue any diplomatic negotiations with the president of Russian Federation. And he knows it very well. I have spoken about it publicly. I think it's a very dangerous signal from President Putin that tells us that Putin is not going to finish this war. That is what's going on. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration has built its entire policy around avoiding direct conflict with Russia. Once this annexation happens, does it change that dynamic? Is Russia using this as an excuse to say that it is being attacked because the West is providing Ukraine with weapons, if it is seizing Eastern Ukraine to annex it? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): Yes, that's exactly so. That is correct. Look, he knows. He feels it, and his military leadership reports to him. He knows that he's losing the war. In the battlefield, Ukraine has seized the initiative. He cannot explain to his society why. And he is looking for answers to these questions. It's seven months since Russia occupied, tried to occupy Ukraine, but they couldn't. And now he has to justify. He has to take steps to justify. He says: See, let's look at it. I am not afraid of Ukraine. It was a special operation, but now it's Russia. It's our territory. Look, we conducted referenda. Now it's the West who attacks Russia. Now the West attacks our territories. We have let the society join Russia, the society that wanted to be with Russia. He has announced the mobilization. It used to be hidden. Now you see that it has been announced publicly. For several months, they've been secretly mobilizing. But now they admitted that their army is not able to fight with Ukraine anymore. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin continues to dangle the threat of nuclear weapons use. You've called this nuclear blackmail. Do you think he's bluffing right now? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): Look, maybe yesterday, it was bluff. Now it could be a reality. Let's look. What is a contemporary use of nuclear weapons or nuclear blackmail? He targeted and occupied our nuclear power plant in the city of Enerhodar. He continues his blackmail related to us exporting electricity to Europe. Several days ago, they started shooting at another nuclear power plant. The nuclear plant lost all the windows and doors, et cetera. So, he wants to scare the whole world. These are the first steps of his nuclear blackmail. I don't think he's bluffing. I think the world is deterring it and containing this threat. We need to keep putting pressure on him and not allow him to continue. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden has said more sanctions are coming. PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): I think that there's sanctions that must be implemented towards the very end completely. If we cut Russian banks from SWIFT, we need to cut all Russian banks from SWIFT. If we talk about an embargo for energy, we need not to look for compromises, or we need to make sure that this embargo will be working and all the prices would be implemented according to the embargo, because the profits from these imports support the Russian army and fund the war. The United States could show its leadership position and recognize Russia as a sponsor of terrorism. I understand there will be implications. These implications will make diplomatic negotiations impossible. However, they are terrorists, and we cannot let them do it out of fear. They will not surrender. We need to keep applying pressure. They are terrorists. They don't have honor. They cannot keep their word. They do not kill military personnel. They rape, torture and kill civilians. We found a big mass grave of half-a-thousand people. Today, I received more information. The journalists are on their way. They found two more mass graves, big graves with hundreds of people also. And we're talking about a little town of Izyum. Do you know there are two more mass graves in a small town? This is what's going on. The sanctions need to continue. The sanctions will have political impact, as well as financial impact. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. has released intelligence about Russia's filtration centers that it is putting Ukrainians into, and estimate that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian children are being taken to Russia. Does forcibly separating kids from their families constitute genocide? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): We have all the information about filtration camps, isolation camps. People are being tortured with various means. They apply pressure. They torture with electric current and so on. And apart from that, there's deportation, I can't say exact numbers. I don't want to lie. I want you to know all the truth. I can't say or confirm that hundreds of thousands of children have been deported, because families have been separated. But it's absolutely true that there are thousands of these children. We have confirmed that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Offensive operations are more expensive than defensive operations. The White House is asking Congress for $12 billion more to provide to Ukraine. What do you need this money for? What is essential right now? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): Thousands of people have been killed, raped, tortured. That's why we need this help to deoccupy our territories to make sure that more people survive. I don't think that this is the highest price in the world to save thousands of lives. We're very thankful for HIMARS and other MLRSes that give us an ability to conduct our offensive. Our army seize the initiative, cuts the technical capabilities of Russia. Second, artillery. Artillery helps us to save the lives of our warriors, our fighters. They need an opportunity to get supplies of tanks from the United States, as well as Europe. If the U.S. will be able to show its leadership and will be able to get the tanks, then the Germany -- then Germany and other European countries will follow. I think, if we get tanks from the U.S., European allies will also help us to deoccupy Ukrainian cities with tanks. Air defense systems, we absolutely need the United States to show leadership and give Ukraine the air defense systems. I want to thank President Biden for a positive decision that has been already made. And, to the U.S. Congress, we received NASAMS. It's the air defense systems. But, believe me, it's not even nearly enough to cover the civilian infrastructure, schools, hospitals, universities, homes of Ukrainians. MARGARET BRENNAN: Can there be stability in Europe if Vladimir Putin remains in power? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): No. MARGARET BRENNAN: No? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): I don't have anything to add. My opinion is no. We have observed this over the years. We don't see stability. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. President, thank you for your time today. I do want to ask before I let you go, you have kept Ukraine united during this war. Have you seen evidence that Vladimir Putin will now come and target you in this moment of desperation? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): You are very right in saying that we are united. We have become even more united now than ever. I'm one of the targets, of course. It goes without saying. It's not because of my personality, just because I'm -- because the president is a leader of their country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. President, thank you for your time. And good luck to you, sir. PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): Thank you very much. We will need it. We wish you peace and everything. Thank you very much for your support, the United States. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: And Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. Good morning to you, Jake. Thank you for joining us. JAKE SULLIVAN (U.S. National Security Adviser): Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Zelenskyy told us that, if this annexation happens, it will make diplomatic talks with Vladimir Putin impossible. They need artillery in Ukraine, he says, more air defense systems and tanks. Will they get it? And how significant of an escalation is this? JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Margaret, not only will they get it, but they've been getting it. The United States at this point alone has provided more than $15 billion in weapons, and that's included air defense systems, hundreds of artillery pieces, hundreds of thousands, if not millions of rounds of artillery. And we have facilitated the transfer of tanks from NATO allies who have the Soviet era tanks that the Ukrainians have trained on. We will continue to do all of that. And what Putin has done is not exactly a sign of strength or confidence. Frankly, it's a sign that they're struggling badly on the Russian side. And we're going to help the Ukrainians be able to take advantage of the gains they've made and to continue to push back against the Russian forces that are brutally occupying portions of their country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yesterday, Putin replaced one of the top logistics generals with a man who's known as the Butcher of Mariupol. Are we seeing the beginning of the collapse of the Russian army? JAKE SULLIVAN: I think it's too soon to make comprehensive predictions like that. I think what we are seeing are signs of unbelievable struggle among the Russians. You've got low morale, where the soldiers don't want to fight. And who can blame them, because they want no part of Putin's war of conquest in their neighboring country. You've got Russia having depleted its stores of precision-guided munitions. You've got Russia disorganized and losing territory to a capable Ukrainian force. And you've got a huge amount of infighting among the Russian military leadership, and now the blame game has started, to include these replacements. So, Russia is struggling. But Russia still remains a dangerous foe and capable of great brutality, as we've seen with these mass graves outside of Izyum. So, we continue to take that threat seriously. And we continue to see our obligation being providing Ukraine all that it needs to be able to effectively defend itself and defend its country and defend its freedom. That's what we're intent on doing. And we are not taking our eye off the ball. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin will carry out this annexation of eastern Ukraine within the next few days. If Russia is expanding its nuclear umbrella over this part of the country, does that put the U.S. in more direct conflict with Russia? And does a nuclear weapon being used there put Russia in conflict directly with the U.S. and NATO? JAKE SULLIVAN: We have been crystal clear, up to and including President Biden, that we will not recognize the sham referenda. They in no way represent the will of the Ukrainian people. And we will treat this territory for what it is, Ukrainian territory, not Russian territory. And we will continue to support the Ukrainians as they seek to deoccupy this territory. So, we've been clear. We're not going to stop or slow down our support to the Ukrainians, no matter what Putin tries to do with these fake elections and fake referenda and annexation. Now, when it comes to the question of nuclear use, President Putin's been waving around the nuclear card at various points through this conflict. The last few days are not the first time. And we've always taken it seriously. We've... MARGARET BRENNAN: But he hasn't been as cornered as he is now. JAKE SULLIVAN: It's true. And it is a matter that we have to take deadly seriously, because it is a matter of paramount seriousness, the possible use of nuclear weapons for the first time since the Second World War. We have communicated directly, privately, at very high levels to the Kremlin that any use of nuclear weapons will be met with catastrophic consequences for Russia, that the United States and our allies will respond decisively. And we have been clear and specific about what that will entail. We have, in public, been equally clear, as a matter of principle, that the United States will respond decisively if Russia uses nuclear weapons and that we will continue to support Ukraine in its efforts to defend its country and defend its democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia has been talking about this nuclear power plant, rather than nuclear weapons, just within the past 24 hours. Where does that fall? Is this an escalating threat? JAKE SULLIVAN: So, for your viewers, there is a nuclear power plant that is in Russian-occupied portions of Ukraine. It has been put into cold shutdown to make it less likely that there's some kind of catastrophic incident at the plant. It is actually still being operated by the Ukrainian operators, who are essentially at gunpoint from the Russian occupying forces. And the Russians have been consistently implying that there may be some kind of accident at this plant. We've been working with the International Atomic Energy Agency and with the Ukrainian energy regulators to try to make sure that there is no threat posed by a meltdown or something else from the plant. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake, you're a busy man watching the world right now. There's a lot I want to ask you. But I have to ask you about Iran and these protests led by women after the death of this 22-year-old woman who didn't have her hair covered properly, in the view of the morality police. She died. How significant is this? And is it making you reassess the offer you put on the table to lift sanctions on Iran in regard to its nuclear program? JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first, Margaret, the fact that we are in negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program is in no way impacting our willingness and our vehemence in speaking out about what is happening on the streets of Iran. We have, in fact, taken tangible steps to sanction those morality police... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. JAKE SULLIVAN: ... who caused the death of Mahsa Amini. We've taken steps to make it easier for Iranians to be able to get access to the Internet and access to communications technologies that will allow them to talk to one another and to talk to the world. So, from our perspective, we will do all that we can to support the brave people, the brave women of Iran, as they stand up for themselves. And... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I was asking you, though, about the offer to lift sanctions off of Iran in regard to its nuclear program, because that would allow for the regime to have a financial lifeline. JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, I think it's important for everyone to understand that, at the height of the Cold War, as Ronald Reagan was calling the Soviet Union the evil empire... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, the arms control. JAKE SULLIVAN: ... he was also negotiating an arms control agreement with Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely. JAKE SULLIVAN: So, that's -- that is what we're talking about here. We're talking about diplomacy to prevent Iran from ever getting a nuclear weapon. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. JAKE SULLIVAN: If we can succeed in that effort -- and we are determined to succeed in that effort -- the world, America and our allies will be safer. And that will not stop us in any way from pushing back and speaking out on Iran's brutal repression of its citizens and its women. We can and will do both. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, I understand the offer is still on the table. The strategy hasn't changed. Jake, thank you very much for your time. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Our September CBS News Battleground Tracker shows the race for control of Congress has tightened yet again. As of today, Republican stand to win 223 seats. That is five more than they need to take control of the House. But that number is within the estimate's margin of error, which is plus or minus 13 seats. The GOP edge has been shrinking since July. We will have more from our new poll in our next half-hour, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. For a closer look at our CBS News battleground tracker poll, we're joined by CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto. Anthony, always good to have you here. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you've been very busy as we get closer to these midterms. And you tested a number of very big ideas. What are voters telling you they think is at stake? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, the first thing is, it gives you a sense of the stakes here in the minds of voters, which they say are really large. And, specifically, 68 percent say their rights and freedoms are potentially at stake in this election. And, for context, that's even more than, say, things like their finances and their financial well-being is at stake here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Now, look, there's always, in every election, the campaigns will say, this is the most important election ever. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, we want to - so we step back and say, OK, be specific. What do you think will happen were one side or the other to win? And one thing that stands out is, people think that if the Republicans take control of Congress, that women, by three to one, will have fewer rights and freedoms than they currently do than would have more. And some of that is related to views on abortion, which we'll get to in a second. There's also -- there's other groups that stand out here. For example, LGBTIQ folks voters think will have fewer rights if the Republicans were to win. Now, the other part of this, though, is tied to views on democracy, which a lot of people worry about right now. And that comes out in some of these findings, too. MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is -- election are central to democracy, so what is it that people see at risk here when you ask that? ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, three-quarters of people continue to say they think democracy is under threat. That's number one. And then, to your point about elections, we asked people, because there's so much context here, people are still talking about election denialism, still arguing about what happened in 2020. So, OK, what happens if your side loses this time? Republicans, what happens if Democrats win a state or a district, and vice versa? And we found a third of Republicans and half of MAGA Republicans specifically, and that just under one in five Democrats said their party should be prepared to challenge states and districts that they lose. And that's -- MARGARET BRENNAN: A third of Republicans? ANTHONY SALVANTO: It's a third of Republicans. And it's even higher for MAGA Republicans, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the election hasn't happened yet. ANTHONY SALVANTO: And it hasn't happened yet. So -- MARGARET BRENNAN: But it shows a distrust in the institution itself. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Absolutely. And I think that's really the critical point. If we have this distrust in the process, in the way that we adjudicate our differences here going in before it's even settled, that's part of what's under -- people see that and they sort of say -- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the whole ballgame when it comes to democracy itself. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes, it really is. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you also -- we referenced the fact that when it comes to how close this race could be, it's narrowing here. Republicans have a narrow advantage. ANTHONY SALVANTO: It is. Some of that relates -- A lot of that relates for Democrats to the abortion issue. So, let me start with that because it's also very much what the Democrats want this race to be about in part. Democrats have a growing lead among people who say abortion is the most important issue. And, in particular, for women who want abortion to be legal, it's the most important thing. It's more important than inflation. It's more important than the economy. And it's a deal-breaker. They have to have that position in a candidate to vote for them. By contrast, let me turn to the Republicans for a second. They continue to have their lead on the economy. It hasn't grown. It's stable. And there's plenty of voters out there who think they're not talking about it enough. But the other thing they kind of want this election to be about is immigration, which we tested in this case. There's a big part of the Republican base, almost nine in 10, 87 percent, who like the idea of moving migrants from border areas into Democratic-leaning areas. MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Why is that important with the base? Well, to the extent that this is a turnout election, it's important to motivate your base. And, OK, Republicans really like that. It's much more mixed with the rest of the public. But they specifically like it for one reason, that they think it calls attention to the problem. And to the extent that it's putting that more on the radar, it is for independents, for other Republican voters. And, again, back to the idea of, what is this election going to be about. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we're in the final weeks. What's the closing argument? ANTHONY SALVANTO: I think two things. One is, you're going to hear a lot of talk about democracy, like we said. One is you're going to see this back and forth of, what is this about. Is it abortion rights, immigration, the economy. But the other part of it is, there's half of each party's voters about that see the other side, not as political opposition, but as enemies. And it's a little bit sobering to see that. But you have to, out from that, think, what happens if you view the other side as somebody you can't work with, that's a threat to your way of life? MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ANTHONY SALVANTO: In some ways it justifies any action. It justifies things that you might say or do that you wouldn't otherwise if you still believed in the system. And I think that, again, it's difficult to say, and we should emphasize it's not everyone, but oftentimes those folks are the most ideological, they have the loudest voices and they certainly drive the narrative a lot. And that's very much what you're going to see because then the parties start to say, well, those people vote. Those people are going to turn out. So, if you see the campaigns talking about why the other side is bad, and a lot of voters say that's what the campaigns are mostly talking about why the other side is bad, that kind of runs counter to what you usually see where campaigns are talking about, what can we do for you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. The affirmative argument. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, some really sobering perspective here. Thank you for all your work on this. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thanks, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Financial markets flashed warning signs last week of growing economic uncertainty. CBS News senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann reports from Atlanta. (BEGIN VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): Inflation stubbornly above 8 percent. The Dow ending this week below 30,000. Vanished, nearly two years of gains. Interest rates up three points in six months. And worse, we're all flying blind here. JEROME POWELL (Federal Reserve Chairman): No one knows with any certainty where the economy will be a year or more from now. MARK STRASSMANN: That uncertainty is now hitting us where we live. WOMAN: I do like these cabinets. MARK STRASSMANN: In America's worsening housing crunch. Over that two-year feeding frenzy to overpay, many buyers shudder at mortgage rates above 6 percent, the highest in 14 years. GLENN KELMAN (Redfin CEO): What's even more significant is how much sellers are pulling back. If you borrowed money at 3 percent to buy a house, you're never going to leave. MARK STRASSMANN: Another issue, so-called shelter inflation. Surging home prices and rents racing faster than wages. MARK ZANDI, (Moody's Analytics Chief Economist): You're going to be feeling this. It's not just one part of the country, it's almost all parts of the country. MARK STRASSMANN: Moody's Analytics says more than half of America's largest regional markets are significantly overvalued by 25 percent or more. Two hundred and ten out of 413 markets, many pandemic boom towns. Moody's number one, Boise. Home prices 72 percent too high. Other overvalued areas, Austin, Charlotte, Las Vegas, and Phoenix. MARK ZANDI: I expect national house prices nationwide, you know, across all these markets, to probably fall about 10 percent peak to trough, you know, over the next year or two. MARK STRASSMANN (on camera): Housing is notoriously cyclical. What goes up must come down. MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): In a recession, expect the law of gravity here to kick in with a vengeance. Moody's predicts home value declines could double. For now, few experts predict a housing crash, a plunge in home values as deep and painful as in the Great Recession. But in much of America, affordable housing's an ongoing crisis. Many experts say that should improve slowly if the Fed can nudge supply and demand into a healthier place and confidence in the economy can find a new home of its own. GLENN KELMAN: The sales volume is going to be low. Prices are going to come down some. But the bottom isn't going to fall out of the market. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Mark Strassmann reporting from Atlanta. And we turn now to the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Raphael Bostic. Good morning to you, sir. It's good to have you back. I want to get your perspective. We know stock market is not the economy, but it is a forward-looking indicator. And it's showing some concern right now. Around the world, central banks are trying to get control of inflation. The Fed has already raised rates five times this year. Why isn't inflation coming down? RAPHAEL BOSTIC (Atlanta Federal Reserve President): Well, first of all, good morning, Margaret. It's really good to see you. And, you know, inflation is high. It's too high. And we really need to do all that we can to make it come down. And when you think about its source, it's because we have very high demand, we have not enough supply. And as long as you have that gap, prices are going to be feeling upward pressure. So we've got to narrow that gap. And what we were hoping would happen is that we'd see some movement on the supply side, to move the supply up so that there wasn't so much of a - of an auction on goods that are in the marketplace. But that hasn't happened. And that really has meant that we have had to turn to our policies to try to take demand down and reduce its level. And I think a lot of what you saw in the - in the lead-in piece here is that that demand is starting to shrink. And, ultimately, that will start to pay dividends when we think about inflation levels. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, these higher interest rates, for businesses it, you know, it makes it more expensive for them to get loans. For consumers it makes it more expensive, as we were talking about, to get mortgages, credit card debt, loans. That's how it sort of cools things off a little bit. We've already had two back-to-back quarters of negative GDP growth, which would put us in that category of recession. How significant of a pullback are you expecting here? RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, first of all, I think that the GDP number is one way to think about the economic performance, but many others would suggest that the economy has a lot of positive momentum. We're still creating lots of jobs on a monthly basis. And so I actually think that there is some ability for the economy to absorb our actions and slow in a - in a relatively orderly way. Look, we need to have slowdown. There's no question about that. But I do think that we're going to do all that we can at the Federal Reserve to avoid deep, deep pain. And I think there are some scenarios where that's likely to happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Deep, deep pain or that you can avoid the deep, deep pain? RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Oh, that we can avoid the pain. Thank you for that. Sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: Allen Blinder (ph), the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, wrote a piece in \"The Journal\" this week and he said, the chances of a softish landing, based on history, are well under 50 percent but above zero. What are the odds here that this is a soft landing? RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, I'm not an odds person. People who know me know I don't like to gamble because I hate to lose money. But I will tell you, this is something that - it's going to be hard. It's not going to be easy. There will likely be some job losses. But I think if you look over the historical history here and our economic experiences, there's a really good chance that if we have job losses, it's going to be smaller than what we've seen in other situations. And that's what I'm banking on. You know, I talked to business leaders and people in communities across the southeast. They are concerned, but they do still feel that there's a way to get to 2 percent in terms of inflation that will still leave them in a good place and leave our economy in a place where it is poised to grow and be resilient. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're still sticking with 2 percent? RAPHAEL BOSTIC: That's our target. We are - we haven't changed my view. I haven't changed my view on that. And I'm going to keep working to make sure that inflation starts to move in that direction as soon as possible. MARGARET BRENNAN: So at the beginning of June, Jamie Dimon, who is the CEO of JP Morgan, predicted an economic hurricane. This week he was before Congress and he said some of the challenges facing the U.S. are persistent inflation, shocks from Russia's war in Ukraine, and rising oil prices. You can't control some of those things. Are we in the eye of this storm? Is this the hurricane? RAPHAEL BOSTIC: So, I don't know if it's a hurricane. Look, there are lots of things that have happened over the last several months that really have been unexpected and have made our job more difficult. You know, the war in Ukraine definitely disrupted supply chains and I think set us back in terms of our recovery by many months. And so that's - that's real. But there are also some positive things happening. Now, just last week we averted the rail strike. I think that was a very positive thing. And we are still hearing, as I talk to businesses, that they are not expecting that they are going to have to lay off people very soon. And so we have momentum. And we should not lose sight of that as we start to see demand come down and us get inflation under control. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about that because you look at the American south. We just did this CBS News polling to get political views, and we're seeing people in the state of Georgia have a rosier view of the economy than people nationwide. So, 55 percent of Georgia voters describe the economy to us as good. Nationwide, only 28 percent say that. So, that's perception. What's reality? And what's happening in the south that's not reflected in the rest of the country? RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, I can't speak for the rest of the country. What I will tell you is, here in Atlanta, there is still considerable job growth. Businesses are saying that they are seeing a lot of economic potential. And that is shaping, I believe, the willingness to invest in the future. My expectation is that, as we move along and we start to get inflation more under control, that viewpoint will become more generalized across the country and people will be able to look over longer horizons and see that there's potential out there. So, you know, I understand we've got a lot of uncertainty now. The situation in Russia that you spent the first part of this show on has got everyone on edge. But we do know that some bottlenecks are starting to ease. And I'm hopeful that over the next several months we'll start to see that gap between the high demand and that lower supply narrow significantly, which will then translate into inflation moving closer to our target. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have job growth, you said, in the south. Do you have enough workers? RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, we do have the challenge of a tight labor force. Everyone I talk to says, look, it's harder to find workers than it has -- than it was two years ago. But others -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the solution immigration? RAPHAEL BOSTIC: Well, immigration could contribute to that. But what I would say is, our business leaders have said, it's not as hard today as it was a month ago. So, they are starting to see those challenges ease up. But, look, we have - we have lots of complexity in our labor market. We know inflation is down. We know that families have done a lot of rethinking about whether they need two earners or whether they should keep someone home and not -- we have challenges in terms of child care. There's a lot of churn in our labor markets that we are going to have to monitor. And, you know, I'm grateful, my team, we've been doing a lot of good research on this and we've identified some places to focus on that will give us a good clue as to the extent to which labor markets are easing. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be watching for that. Thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to January 6th and the congressional investigation into the attack on the Capitol. Joining us is California Democratic congressman Pete Aguilar, who is on that committee and joins us from Los Angeles. Good morning to you. REP. PETE AGUILAR (D-CA): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We had a poll, as you may have heard, out that shows one- third of Republicans and half of self-described MAGA Republicans think that the party should plan to challenge states and districts that Democrats win. This is in November. Seventeen percent of Democrats feel they should challenge if the GOP wins. What does that say to you about trust in elections and the risk of political violence like we saw on January 6th? PETE AGUILAR: It tells me that we have more work to do, but it's deeply alarming that we had a former occupant of the White House who any time result went a different way than he wanted called it fake news. And he sought to undermine our democratic institutions time and time again. So, it's not much of a surprise that some of that has seeped into the American public. But our job is to make sure that we protect democracy and do everything we can to prevent that from happening. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have this first public hearing since July. It will be this Wednesday. Politico is reporting that Vice President Mike Pence's activities are a focus of that hearing. Last night at a festival in Texas Congresswoman Cheney said that the committee's still in discussions with Mike Pence's counsel, but she's optimistic he has an obligation to appear. Where do you fall on that? Do you need to subpoena him or is that written testimony that you'd accept? PETE AGUILAR: Well, I think it's important that we hear from the vice president. But the committee's work continues. We haven't made a determination on where we go with the vice president specifically. Those continue to be evolving discussions. And if there is something to announce, I'm sure the chairman will announce that. But I think what's more important is this hearing that we have coming up on Wednesday will be a continuation of what we heard in June and July, which was that the president played a direct role in trying to undermine our democratic institutions and prevent a peaceful transfer of power. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the focus is not specifically on the vice president? PETE AGUILAR: I'm not going to get into the content of the hearing that we'll have on Wednesday. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. PETE AGUILAR There are new details that we have learned broadly about the investigation, and we plan to share some of those this week. MARGARET BRENNAN: To that point, Congresswoman Cheney said there are 800,000 pieces of communications the committee has received from the Secret Service. What is in those documents? How material is it? PETE AGUILAR These are still not the text messages that were discussed before, but these seem to be communications internally amongst staff members. So, there's a lot of information that our investigative team has been going through. We will detail, you know, all of it on Wednesday. But it's important that they are providing the information and that it continues to help in our investigative work. Understand what exactly was happening on January 5th and January 6th as this rally was happening and as the president was directing the mob to go to the Capitol. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the lead Secret Service officer on the then president's detail, Tony Ornato, has been in question. He retired over the summer. Can you speak to him now? PETE AGUILAR: Well, that's a conversation for him and his attorney. We remain deeply wanting to hear from him. The Secret Service indicated that they would make him available prior to his retirement. And then he coincidentally went out and retired. So, we feel that it's important. He has spoken to us. But, obviously, we've heard new details since his testimony that we feel are important to ask. So, he, and others, remain an important part of our investigative work that continues. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you mean to suggest that he retired so he wouldn't have to testify? PETE AGUILAR: I'm just saying that the timeline is the timeline. We were in conversations to hear from him and then he retired. So, as a private citizen, we will continue to work with his private attorney to see if it -- to see if he will come before the committee and share additional testimony with us. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you mentioned at the top how critical the committee's work is. And critics have pointed to the fact that you took a break over the summer as a counterpoint to that, saying it couldn't be that immediate if you went away for six weeks. How do you respond to that? PETE AGUILAR: Well, I can assure you that -- and anyone looking at the calendar for the nine of us on the select committee would know that we didn't go away. The investigative team continued their work. They continued looking through the documents that you referenced earlier. We continued to investigate, take depositions and testimony from key witnesses. All of those happened. They just happened out of public view. So, we look forward to continuing this discussion over 20 hours of hearings that we have had so far. We look forward to the hearing this week. But ultimately, this is about protecting our democracy. And the final report in the future will have the committee's stamp of what we do next. And what happened, where we go from here and how precious democracy is and that it's worth fighting for. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Aguilar, we'll be watching this week. Thank you for your time today. Our CBS News coverage of the January 6th investigation hearing starts at 1:00 p.m. Eastern. You can see it on our broadcast or streaming network on Wednesday. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Since we ran out of time in our interview, Jake Sullivan did want to clarify that when it comes to Iran, the Biden administration still believes in nuclear diplomacy, but is not close to a deal at this point. And we will see how things unfold. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

            "article_content": "Since a judge in Pima County judge ruled that Arizona can enforce a near-total ban on abortions, abortion access has become a key issue in the tight race between Republican Kari Lake and Democrat Katie Hobbs to be the state's next governor. A new CBS News Battleground Tracker poll of likely Arizona voters shows Hobbs and Lake tied at 49% with less than five weeks until Election Day. Six in 10 registered voters in Arizona say abortion should be legal in the state in most cases. In September, a judge removed a decades-old injunction that blocked enforcement of a law that's been in place since 1901, over a decade before Arizona became a state. That law makes it illegal for anyone to provide an abortion surgically or with drugs and is punishable by two to five years in prison.\u00a0 The ruling, weeks before the midterm elections on Nov. 8, is energizing Democratic voters and some independent-leaning Republicans in the state, whose support could be crucial particularly in the race. Former Republican state Sen. Heather Carter said Tuesday that she's switched her party registration to independent because of the \"extreme\" positions her GOP colleagues are taking on many policy issues, including abortion rights.\u00a0 \"I've been registered Republican since I was 18 years-old, but the party has just moved beyond anything I recognize (from) when I first registered as a Republican,\" Carter said in an interview with CBS News.\u00a0 She said Arizona's abortion ban on can \"create unintended consequences that are dangerous for women,\" and will turn Arizona into a \"vigilante state for women receving healthcare.\" Carter says she's urging Republican voters to cross party lines this fall. \"I am asking you to vote for sanity,\" she said. Abortion is also a key issue driving the Arizona Senate race. According to the new CBS News poll, Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly leads GOP nominee Blake Masters 51% to 48%.\u00a0 Like Democratic candidates elsewhere in the country, Kelly enjoys a wide lead among voters who say abortion is very important. More than seven in 10 likely Arizona voters who say abortion is very important in their vote for senator prefer Kelly over Masters.\u00a0 Republican Peggy Neely, a former elected official in Phoenix, said abortion access is the reason she's going to vote for Kelly, rather than Masters.\u00a0 \"He's too extreme,\" Neely said. \"We cannot have Blake Masters representing us as a women to make sure that our rights are protected.\" Some Republican voters have said they're open to supporting Democrats in November because of the abortion rights issue. \"We need to leave women's bodies alone. As a man, we have no right, we should shut up,\" said Jorge Santana, a lifelong registered Republican who works in higher education. Speaking with CBS News at a farmers' market south of Phoenix, Santana said abortion rights are the main issue pushing him to vote for Democrats this fall. For 21-year-old Maddie Merker, a student at Arizona State University, the recent change to the abortion law is motivating her to vote for Democrats as well. She said she wants to hear the candidates in the gubernatorial race talk more about environmental issues but acknowledged that abortion rights are the main issue driving her vote. \"People are going to get abortions, it is just if they are going to do it safely or not so it doesn't make sense to not let people do it because then it just puts more women at risk so I cannot agree with that,\" Merker said. A day after the judge's ruling, Hobbs held a press conference promising to \"use every tool at my disposal to restore abortion rights in Arizona.\" That led to her campaign's best fundraising week of cycle with over $1.2 million in grassroots donations fueled by reproductive rights advocates. Lake's campaign has continued to focus on immigration, education and the economy, but the Republican nominee was asked about the abortion ruling in an appearnce on Fox News recently. \"I'm pro-life. I've never backed away from that and never will,\" Lake said. \"The Democrats have tried to politicize the issue in such a disturbing way,\" she added. On her campaign website, Lake says \"we must also support people who choose to act responsibly when they are not ready to have a child, and that means making all common forms of birth control available over-the-counter and providing assistance to those who are financially unable to pay for their own birth control.\" In Tucson, Lake supporters like Karen Kosha agree there should be certain exceptions like rape and incest for abortion, \"but to use it as a birth control, and that is what a lot of Americans are doing, no, I don't support birth control by killing the babies.\" Retired retail worker Jan McSheffrey told CBS News that she's a lifelong Republican and will vote for Lake because of her stance on abortion. \"Abortion is basically child sacrifice in my estimation,\" McSheffrey said on Sunday before a Lake event in Tucson. \u00a0 Small business owner Beth Rouin said she has voted for Democrats including Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, but she plans to support the Republican ticket in Arizona this year. She voted for former president Trump in 2016 and 2020 but said she's not a \"blind Trumper,\" adding that she likes Lake because \"she is not afraid to speak her mind.\" Rouin said abortion rights should be left up to the states, adding that women in Arizona who want the procedure can always drive to California. \"I am against it, but I also think a lot of women are backed up against the wall when they make that choice so I kind of understand it,\" Rouin said. Two recent polls showed Hobbs leading Lake by one point with less than six weeks before Election Day. Both polls indicated abortion rights as one of the top issues for voters. According to a Suffolk University / Arizona Republic poll, abortion is a significant motivation for\u00a0 women voters in Arizona. More than seven in 10 Democratic women ranked the issue as their top priority this year, compared to 49% of independent women and 37% of Republican women said the same. The close gubernatorial race is drawing attention from national GOP figures as well. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, is holding rallies with Kari Lake and Republican nominee for Senate Blake Masters on Tuesday and Wednesday in the state. On Sunday, Trump will also campaign for Lake and Masters in Arizona. CBS News reporter covering the intersection between politics and tech.",

So, he's trying to walk back the super pro-life positions to something that more closesly reflects the electorate.\" Masters' scrubbing of his campaign website, first reported by NBC News, comes as a major Republican Super PAC diverts resources from the Senate race in Arizona to other 2022 battleground states.\u00a0 The Senate Leadership Fund (SLF), a GOP group allied with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, pulled back $8 million in ad buys from the Arizona race last week and doesn't plan to go back on air until October.\u00a0 \"That sends a message that they don't think that Masters can pull it off. That is the loudest message you can hear right there,\" Montague said.\u00a0 In a statement to CBS News, SLF President Steven Law said the super PAC wants to move resources to \"other offensive opportunities that have become increasingly competitive,\" adding that \"we're leaving the door wide open in Arizona.\" \"We see multiple paths to winning the majority, and we are going to invest heavily and strategically to achieve that goal,\" Law said. Some Republican strategists say Masters still has time to appeal to moderate voters. The electorate in Arizona is split into thirds with independents making up the second largest voting bloc, just behind Republicans.\u00a0 Chuck Warren, a national Republican strategist who's worked on campaigns in Arizona, thinks that if Masters can successfully tie incumbent Democratic Senator Mark Kelly to President Joe Biden's low favorability in the state, \"then this a real flip of a coin race.\" Warren said Masters needs to \"focus on kitchen table issues\" instead of trying to go viral for controversial comments that force his campaign to play defense.\u00a0 Earlier this week, Masters posted a tweet tying economic downturns to an increase in diversity at the Federal Reserve Bank. He followed that up with a video message calling Vice President Kamala Harris \"so incompetent she can't even get a sentence out\" and suggested she was seleted for role because Biden wanted to fulfill race and gender quotas.\u00a0 \"I've never spoken to anyone who can say with a straight face that Kamala was somehow the most qualified candidate for that job,\" Masters said.\u00a0 Republican strategists fear these types of Trumpian insults - ones that helped Masters win the primary by double digits - might also cause him to lose the general election, which they believe a more mainstream conservative would have won. They think it's a missed opportunity, after sensing earlier this summer that the political environment heavily favored conservatives.\u00a0 \"I'm frustrated that Trump saddled us with these candidates that aren't going to most likely be winners,\" Montague said. The Trump-endorsed candidates for Senate, governor, secretary of state, and attorney general often campaigned together across Arizona and easily won their primaries. But with the general election less than 10 weeks away, some Republican strategists in Arizona say their party chose the riskiest candidates in every statewide contest.\u00a0 A recent Fox News poll of registered Arizona voters showed Masters trailing Kelly by 8 points. Another one of likely 2022 voters showed Kelly leading Masters by more than 3 points.\u00a0 \"I don't see how Blake Masters wins this general election,\" a longtime Arizona GOP strategist said. \"The guy does not understand Arizona and continues to be like 'oh well, you know, we're just gonna swing as far right as we can and then he's got no room to maneuver.\" For some Republicans in Arizona, that brings back memories of the 2018 Senate race when GOP nominee Martha McSally lost to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. McSally bested Trump-aligned candidates Kelli Ward and Joe Arpaio in the 2018 primary. Montague described that race as a competition to see which candidate was the most \"bombastic, far-right, meat eating person wrapped around Trump's leg.\"\u00a0 He said McSally lost in 2018 because she failed to appeal to moderates and questioned whether Masters can execute a pivot in the final weeks.\u00a0 Warren said Masters needs to focus his messaging on the economy, crime, and border security. He said if the Masters campaign can properly communicate on these issues then \"this will be a really interesting and tight race.\" There is also a big gap in fundraising and with the SLF pausing spending in Arizona, it will be up to Masters to make up the difference. He has only raised $5 million this cycle, compared to the $54 million Kelly has raised so far.\u00a0 But Masters does have the support of big tech billionaire Peter Thiel. The mega donor gave $15 million to start the Saving Arizona super PAC, which spent the money on behalf of Masters during the primary.\u00a0 Theil is also providing heavy financial support for J.D Vance, the GOP nominee for Senate in Ohio. The Senate Leadership Fund has already spent over $26.7 million for ads this cycle in the Ohio Senate race, according to data from AdImpact.\u00a0 Republican operatives say with McConnell's group pausing spending in Arizona, Theil needs to pony up for his chosen candidate. The billionaire's money could help Masters stay within striking distance of Kelly and give Republicans a shot at taking back the Senate.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the intersection between politics and tech.",

And this week on Face the Nation, we will dive into one of the most closely watched governor's races in the country and examine problems facing America at home and abroad.  We have new CBS polls in Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona. And, in back-to- back appearances, we will hear from Republican Kari Lake and Democrat Katie Hobbs, as they are running dead even to be Arizona's next governor. Our political panel will track this unique Arizona event and the week's news.  Then: Financial markets remain jumpy, and recession anxieties got more fuel after the OPEC cartel cut oil production. We will check in with top economist Mohamed El-Erian about the road ahead.  Finally, a key bridge linking the Crimean Peninsula with Russia is destroyed. Ukrainians celebrate, while Russia fumes. What are Vladimir Putin's options? Could one be battlefield nuclear weapons? We will have a report from the region.  It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.  Good morning. Welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret Brennan is off.  We have new CBS Battleground Tracker polls from several key states. In Michigan, Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer is leading her Republican challenger, Tudor Dixon, 53 percent to 47 percent.  In Wisconsin, we're tracking two statewide races. The governor's race between Democratic incumbent Tony Evers and his Republican challenger, businessman Tim Michels, is deadlocked, with both candidates at 50 percent. In the Senate race, incumbent Republican Senator Ron Johnson is polling at 50 percent against his Democratic rival, Mandela Barnes, who is at 49 percent.  We also learned last week in Arizona incumbent Democratic Senator Mark Kelly is narrowly ahead of his Republican challenger, Blake Masters, 51 percent to 48 percent.  Joining us now to discuss all of this is CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto.  Anthony, good morning. Catch us up on the dynamics of these Senate races. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Major.  So, Wisconsin and Arizona are two Senate races out of, I think, five that will ultimately determine control the chamber. So, they're both close for reasons that are across all of these races. And that is, it's the economy against abortion, which is to say, Democrats are winning voters who are concerned about abortion.  That's happening in Wisconsin. Mandela Barnes is getting almost three- quarters of those who say it's very important. And then the economy. Republicans are winning voters who say the economy is most important, going to punish the party in power. And that's the Democrats. He's getting almost two-thirds of them.  Now, having said that, each party is sort of jockeying to try to add another set of issues to that list. And on the Republican side, one of those is crime. So, they're running attack ads. They're trying to tie Democrats to this unpopular position -- and it is unpopular in Wisconsin -- of defunding the police.  And when voters perceive, if they perceive that Barnes supports defunding the police -- again, that's their perception -- then they aren't voting for him. And he's behind Johnson on the idea of, will your -- will their policies keep you safe?  Now, Democrats, for their part, would like to add this issue of election integrity, threats to democracy after the attempts to overturn 2020.  MAJOR GARRETT: Under that banner of threats to democracy, some Republicans won their primaries by denying or questioning the 2020 election.  To what degree is that position either being embraced or backed away from or having an effect on the general elections they find themselves in now?  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, look, for Republicans, it was almost a litmus test in their primaries. And they're still supporting their candidates regardless of their stance.  There's a little bit of evidence that the position of trying to overturn 2020 hurts Republicans in this sense, if you look at independents who believe that Ron Johnson -- again, their perception -- was trying to overturn the election, they're not voting for him.  And the way it also connects is on candidate qualities. Take a look at Arizona. A majority of people say that they'd prefer their elected officials say that Joe Biden won, which he did. Now, when you look at voters who say that they think that the candidates are -- or a Republican candidate is talking about 2020, they're more likely to label that candidate as extreme, as opposed to mainstream.  And that goes towards candidate qualities, where Democrats have tended to have an advantage. Those are the dynamics all at work here. MAJOR GARRETT: Anthony Salvanto, thank you very much.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you.  MAJOR GARRETT: Now to the race for governor of Arizona.  Our latest poll shows Democrat Katie Hobbs and Republican Kari Lake tied at 49 percent. The two candidates have not scheduled a debate, but they are here to answer our questions. Each candidate will have about eight-and-a- half minutes.  We intend to cover the same issues with each candidate, issues identified by our own polling as of leading concern to Arizona voters. Our ability to cover this ground, of course, will be influenced in no small measure by the length of the candidates' answers, first Republican Kari Lake, who joins us from Phoenix.  Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.  KARI LAKE (R-Arizona Gubernatorial Candidate): Good morning, Major. Thank you so much for having me on.  Just to clarify, I have agreed to any and all debates, and I will be taking part in one without my opponent next week, on the 12th. I would love it if she would show up, because I think there's a lot of important issues that the people of Arizona need to hear about.  MAJOR GARRETT: We'll get to that, I promise.  Your Web site is detailed and specific on the question of immigration and border security. You call, if elected as governor, for Arizona to join other states to form what you call a compact to carry out border security separate from the federal government, including arrest and detention.  For the benefit of Arizona voters, can you explain the legal and practical application of this approach?  KARI LAKE: Well, of course, if you know the Constitution, you know that Article 4, Section 4 calls for the federal government to protect us from invasion.  And under Joe Biden's lack of leadership, we just aren't seeing that. And we have an invasion at our border. The cartels, these narco terrorist groups have operational control. And they're using Arizona to smuggle people, to traffic children, and to traffic the most dangerous drug we've ever seen, fentanyl.  And so we're going to invoke our Article 1, Section 10, basically, authority to take care of our own border and protect our own border. It's right there in black and white in the Constitution. And we meet all three criteria. We have an invasion, our people are in imminent danger, and time is of the essence. There's no time for delay. So we're going to have other states offer help. I have already got a couple other governors who are willing to help out. And I know that if you ask people in other states that are not border states, they deem this crisis on the border as one of the top issues facing our country...  MAJOR GARRETT: Would Arizona...  KARI LAKE: ... with so many young people dying of fentanyl poisoning right now.  MAJOR GARRETT: Would Arizona go it alone if it didn't get this compact agreement with other states?  KARI LAKE: Yes, we will.  But I believe we will get help. I have already talked to some other governors. And they're -- they're vowing to help us out wherever they can, because they realize that what comes into Arizona, fentanyl, people coming here illegally, children being trafficked, doesn't stay in Arizona. It goes to all 50 states.  And I just spoke last week to a mother and father who lost their son. And it's just tragic. We're losing more people to fentanyl in Arizona since Joe Biden took office than we lost in 9/11 or during COVID.  MAJOR GARRETT: If, as there would likely be, federal challenges were presented, would you, as governor, await for those federal challenges to this state compact be resolved? And would you respect them if they were to any way impinge upon or restrict or nullify the state compact approach?  KARI LAKE: We will -- we will challenge the federal government, if they're going to challenge us. I think we have the right to do this.  And we will have attorneys file lawsuits as well. But we're not going to back down and let our people be overrun with drugs, watch our children die. We had a 16-year-old die here in the metro area last week from a fentanyl overdose. We can't keep having this happen. We're losing our young generation.  So I hope that Joe Biden doesn't fight us, because then it would really look like he is on the side of the cartels. And I don't think he wants the people to think that.  MAJOR GARRETT: Your Web site also says that Washington D.C. incentivizes illegal immigration to satisfy -- quote -- \"big business lust for cheap labor.\" Does that big business lust reside in Arizona at all?  KARI LAKE: I think it resides everywhere.  And we saw it with Nancy Pelosi last week. I mean, it was the most racist thing, I think, I have heard her say, although she's said quite a few things that are offensive. She said these people coming in illegally should go pick fruit in the South. I mean, I couldn't believe my ears, Major, when I heard that.  We want to make sure that our middle class and our working class are healthy. The Democrats used to care about our working class. And now they appear that they don't. They want to see five million people come in. These five million people, where are they staying? They're not staying on the streets.  It's American citizens who are homeless. And they're taking jobs from hardworking Arizonans. And we're going to start putting Arizona first and protecting our citizens in this state.  MAJOR GARRETT: Nominee Lake, our polling shows that abortion is a very important issue to Arizona vote voters. You have been quoted as saying Arizona will be a state \"where we will not be taking the lives of our unborn anymore.\"  You've also more recently been quoted as saying that, in Arizona abortion, should be rare and legal. Are those statements consistent?  KARI LAKE: I -- I was in an interview when I said that, and I was -- I was telling the interviewer that, when abortion was first presented, they said it should be -- it should be rare, safe and legal.  And now it's become anything but rare. In Katie Hobbs' world -- and you can ask her about this -- I understand she's coming up next -- they're for abortion right up until birth. If you are in the hospital in labor, the abortionists are for giving you an abortion, if you desire one.  MAJOR GARRETT: What are you for?  KARI LAKE: We need to draw the line. We need to draw the line somewhere.  I am going to be the executive of the state, the chief executive officer, and I will follow the law. The law right now as it stands is Governor Ducey's law at 15 weeks, so we'll follow the law. Listen, I'm a woman.  MAJOR GARRETT: Would you seek to restrict abortions beyond -- closer than 15 weeks?  KARI LAKE: May I finish? MAJOR GARRETT: Sure.  KARI LAKE: I am -- I'm a woman. I'm a mother. I'm all for women's health care.  I come from a large family. Seven sisters, I have. Of course I want women's health care. This has moved beyond health care. We're not giving women choices. I'm for giving women true choices. And when they walk into an abortion center, they're only given one choice.  And they're not told that you have the choice to keep your baby, and we can help, and here's how, or we can help you find a loving family who will adopt your baby. I want to give women true choices. I will uphold the law, whatever that law is.  And I want to see to it that we save more lives. Right now, the Democrats have started pushing so far from that rare but safe to anything goes, up to nine months of pregnancy, after birth. Katie Hobbs, my opponent, actually has voted for -- and you look at her voting record -- allowing a baby who survives an abortion, that the hospital would refuse medical care and allow the baby to die on a cold metal tray.  She voted for that.  MAJOR GARRETT: We will take that up with Katie Hobbs, I guarantee you.  This week, nominee Lake, a 64-year-old Iowa man was arrested and charged for threatening to lynch Maricopa County Supervisor Clint Hickman. In reaction, Hickman said: \"people in positions of influence and leadership in Arizona are silent. How can you be silent?\"  Do you have a reply from Mr. Hickman? And would you support and do you support federal and state prosecution of anyone who threatens the lives of an election worker?  KARI LAKE: I think that anyone who threatens anyone's lives should be detained and questioned. I'm not for violence in any way.  And I should remind you that, during COVID, when a lot of Americans were faced with not being able to use their free speech to speak out against what was happening, they were losing their jobs, they were losing their businesses, they were being forced to get shots that they didn't want, people were being bullied and -- and attacked and also threatened during that time.  I think we need to get back to where we have free speech, and we shouldn't be threatening people. And I hope that they arrest that man and detain him.  MAJOR GARRETT: Earlier this week, Blake Masters, as you know, Republican nominee for the Senate, said he has not seen evidence of vote-counting problems or election results that would have changed the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. He also said President Biden is the legitimate president. Do you agree?  KARI LAKE: I think we have major problems in our election system. And we - - and it goes back to 2000.  We had Democrats saying the 2000 election wasn't fair. They were complaining the 2004 election wasn't fair. 2016, Kamala Harris spoke out and said that the electronic voting machines were hacked in front of her eyes. And nobody called them election deniers.  And now, all of a sudden, in 2020, Garrett, we don't have free speech anymore. We can't speak out against our own elections. All I'm asking for is the ability to speak out. When our government does something wrong, we should be able to speak out against it.  I think we have major...  MAJOR GARRETT: Do you agree with the statement that Blake Masters made?  KARI LAKE: I -- I'm not going to take on what Blake said. I'm going to take on what I said.  And what I say is, we have problems in our election. They haven't been solved in 2016. They weren't solved in '18. Just a month or two ago, during our primary election -- and I'm sure your voters -- your viewers don't even know this -- Katie Hobbs' office advised the counties on how many ballots to print. This was two months ago.  MAJOR GARRETT: Right. Nominee Lake...  KARI LAKE: And they underprinted ballots in our biggest county, and they ran out of Republican-only ballots one hour into voting.  MAJOR GARRETT: Nominee Lake...  KARI LAKE: We have to restore honesty to our elections. We must restore honesty.  MAJOR GARRETT: In fairness -- in fairness and in timing for both you and Katie Hobbs, we have to end it there. Thank you very much for being with us on Face the Nation.  Face the Nation will back in just one minute. Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MAJOR GARRETT: Now to Katie Hobbs. She is the Democratic nominee for governor, and she's also in Phoenix this morning. Secretary Hobbs, good morning. Welcome to Face the Nation.  So, your opponent said you don't want to debate. I would like to ask you, are there any conditions under which you would agree to debate Kari Lake, so the voters of Arizona could hear from the two of you side by side and in real time?  KATIE HOBBS (D-Arizona Secretary of State and Gubernatorial Candidate): Look, what I have been focused on is opportunities like this, where they can see us back to back, and hear directly from us about the issues that are important to Arizonans and how we would govern, without a circus like she created during the GOP Republican primary.  I have no desire to be a part of -- of the spectacle that she's looking to create, because that doesn't do any service to the voters of Arizona to hear from us, where we stand on the issues and how we would govern.  MAJOR GARRETT: So, sometimes, voters learn things from moments of duress or challenge or circus. Don't you think you're strong enough to handle any kind of circus Kari Lake might present, if, in fact, she were to present one? Don't the voters of Arizona deserve to see that real?  SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS: I think the voters of Arizona have had a chance to see how I work under crisis throughout my leadership during the 2020 election as secretary of state, when we had to combat multiple election challenges from former President Trump and his band of election deniers, including my opponent, Kari Lake.  MAJOR GARRETT: So I want to ask you about immigration. We had a long conversation with Kari Lake about that.  Last night, you tweeted: \"Arizona bears the brunt of the failures of US immigration policies.\"  Now, by our count, that is your second tweet in a month about immigration. Who specifically is responsible for this failure? And why only now did you decide to share that sentiment with your Twitter followers?  SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS: Oh, this is certainly not the first time that I have spoken out about immigration in this campaign.  We are a border state, and immigration as it is a very important issue to Arizona border -- voters. And, as a border state, we have borne the brunt of decades of inaction in Washington from both parties to address both border security and comprehensive immigration reform.  And -- and we need the federal government to step up. But what I want to be really clear about is that my opponent's positions on this issue are nothing but empty rhetoric. She's not offering real solutions. When she talked about invoking the constitutional authority of the state, she's talking about declaring an invasion at our Southern border. That would do absolutely nothing to increase border security, but it would bring untold levels of chaos into our state. It's not a real solution. I have a border security plan that's been endorsed by two border sheriffs because they know that it's going to focus real solutions and bring meaningful relief and help them make their communities safer.  MAJOR GARRETT: As a practical matter, were Arizonans safer under immigration policies of the present administration or the one just before it?  SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS: Look, we've had a -- a pretty bad immigration policy for decades. We need to get comprehensive immigration reform done. And it's -- both parties in Congress have been dragging their feet to -- to get this done.  MAJOR GARRETT: But, when you say there is a failure of current immigration policy, that's a Biden administration failure, is it not, by definition?  SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS: Look, Trump centered his whole immigration policy around finishing the wall. And. it's not done.  And -- but Biden does need to step up immigration and border security, absolutely. Arizona is bearing the brunt of -- of illegal drug trafficking, gun trafficking and smuggling. And we do need more border security. It's not going to get done by declaring an invasion at the border or dismantling the FBI, which is another thing that my opponent has called for.  MAJOR GARRETT: On the question of abortion, your opponent described you as something of an extremist. Those are her words, not ours.  SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS: Yes.  MAJOR GARRETT: Do you support the current 15-week ban in Arizona? Or would you seek -- seek a different approach? And is there a week limit different than 15 weeks you are in favor of? And, if so, why?  SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS: I don't support the 15-week ban.  But let me just say that Kari Lake is -- is entirely misconstruing my position on this issue. You and I both know that late-term abortion is extremely rare. And if it's being talked about, it's because something has gone incredibly wrong in a pregnancy.  A doctor's not going to perform an abortion late in a pregnancy just because somebody decided they want one. That is ridiculous. And she's saying this to distract from her incredibly extreme position, which has -- she's gone on the record saying she supports Arizona's complete abortion ban that would -- that is in the courts right now being decided if that will be the law of Arizona or not. She's called it a great law. She's called people who seek abortion murderers and executioners. And under a Kari Lake administration, we would have government-mandated forced births that risk women's lives.  And her position is the one that -- that's extreme. It's out of touch where -- with where the majority of Arizonans are, who support access to safe and legal abortion. And, under her administration, women would not be safe.  MAJOR GARRETT: What would the Hobbs administration's week limit be for abortion access? If it's not 15 weeks, what is it?  SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS: Look, abortion is a very personal decision that belongs between a woman and her doctor.  The government and politicians don't belong in that decision. We need to let doctors perform the care that they are trained and take an oath to -- to perform.  MAJOR GARRETT: So, if an Arizona voter were to conclude from your previous answer that you do not favor any specific week limit on abortion, would they be correct?  SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS: I support leaving the decision between a woman and her doctor and leaving politicians entirely out of it.  MAJOR GARRETT: Our polling also indicates that the economy is very important to Arizona voters. And, on that issue, both the economy generally, inflation specifically, according to our data, you trail your opponent.  What is your approach to inflation and the economy in Arizona? And why is yours superior to that of your opponent?  SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS: Well, first, let me say, I'm the only candidate in this race who is not a millionaire.  My husband and I raised our kids through financial ups and downs. And I know the struggle that a lot of Arizonans are feeling right now, having to stretch to put food on the table, thinking about taking a second job, or not being able to pay the mortgage.  And so we have a comprehensive plan to address the rising costs that Arizonans are facing right now that will put money back in their pockets. We cut taxes on all kinds of everyday items like over-the-counter medication, school supplies, diapers, feminine hygiene products. We provide a child -- a state-level child tax credit and tax credits for people who want to go back to work in higher-paying jobs to get career and technical education. Economists have looked at my affordability plan next to Kari Lake's plan, and they said that my plan does put people back to work and -- and help them fight inflation and that Kari Lake's plan actually will make inflation worse.  MAJOR GARRETT: Do you identify yourself with the Biden economic administration -- economic plans and inflation-fighting plans?  And, if so, would you advise the president to campaign along your side in Arizona?  SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS: I'm focused on the race here in Arizona and the needs of Arizonans. It's a race between myself and Kari Lake and -- and the -- the ideas that we're bringing to the table.  MAJOR GARRETT: And one -- one more time before we let you go, because I think it is on the mind of Arizona voters, are you saying this morning that there is no circumstance that you can envision or would even try to negotiate in which you and Kari Lake would appear at a debate together before the election?  SECRETARY OF STATE KATIE HOBBS: At this point in the race, with 30 days to go, our schedule in terms of -- of forums is pretty much set. And -- and I'm really happy with where we are in the plans we have to continue talking directly to the voters of Arizona.  MAJOR GARRETT: Katie Hobbs, secretary of state of Arizona, Democratic nominee for governor, thank you very much.  And we will be right back with a lot more Face to Nation. We invite you to please stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MAJOR GARRETT: Here's something of a pro tip.  If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR, or we're available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. And we're replayed on our CBS News Streaming Network at -- on Sundays at 1:30 p.m., 4:00 p.m., and 10:00 p.m.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with some analysis with our expert political panel.  We ask you, please stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation.  More than 21 months after the attack on the U.S. Capitol, a trial against defendants charged with seditious conspiracy began here in Washington. New disclosures were presented to jurors in what prosecutors call one of the most important cases seeking accountability.  CBS News congressional correspondent Scott MacFarlane has more.  (Begin VT)  SCOTT MACFARLANE (voice-over): A crime unlike any in the nation's history has led to a criminal trial unlike any in history.  Stewart Rhodes, military vet, Yale Law grad and former congressional staffer, is founder of the far right Oath Keepers group. Along with four co-defendants, he's standing trial for seditious conspiracy, accused of plotting to attack and block the peaceful transfer of power in America, and facing decades in prison if convicted.  Former Justice Department attorney Michael Greenberger says, no matter the outcome of the six-week-long trial, history will be made.  MICHAEL GREENBERGER (Former Justice Department Attorney): This case is the most important seditious conspiracy case that was ever brought.  SCOTT MACFARLANE: In the trial's opening days, prosecutors argued the group was plotting just days after the election. Jurors heard a clip of Rhodes from November 9, 2020, urging his group to be ready to fight to create a pathway to keep Trump in power. STEWART RHODES (Founder and Leader, Oath Keepers): I'm willing to sacrifice myself for that. Let the fight start there, OK? That would give President Trump what he needs, frankly.  SCOTT MACFARLANE: Prosecutors showed an open letter written by Rhodes to then-President Trump encouraging Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, to mobilize military veterans and militias, and order a new election the militia would help administer.  They played this interview clip of Rhodes for jurors:  STEWART RHODES: We have men already stationed outside D.C. as a nuclear option.  SCOTT MACFARLANE: Prosecutors argued the conspirators shared messages referencing civil war and predicting blood and violence, and they said the group staged guns outside the D.C. limits and helped the execution of a military stack formation to breach the Capitol.  For the Justice Department, which has gone to trial against approximately 20 January 6 defendants so far and won convictions in every case before a jury, the stakes here are higher. The Justice Department has limited experience going to trial on the charge of seditious conspiracy, but Greenberger says the trial itself could help avert a future attack. MICHAEL GREENBERGER: Bringing the trial shows all these people out there who think, oh, I will go to Washington, I will have a good time, it'll be fun, we will break into the Capitol, no, you're going to end up, win or lose, convicted or not convicted, devoting a large part of your life and your fortune to defending yourself.  (End VT)  SCOTT MACFARLANE: The trial resumes Tuesday, and the jurors ought to get comfortable. This could last all the way up to Thanksgiving. Six to seven weeks is the estimate.  MAJOR GARRETT: Speaking of getting comfortable, we have a nice, big, full table here at Face the Nation.  I want to welcome everyone. CBS News congressional correspondent Nikole Killion joins Scott MacFarlane. Also, we have \"New York Times\" chief White House correspondent Peter Baker and \"New Yorker\" staff writer Susan Glasser.  Susan and Peter, I want to also let you know, are co-authors of a new book on the Trump presidency called \"The Divider.\"  It's great to have you all with us.  Susan and Peter, I want to start with you.  To what degree did what you just saw with Kari Lake, who many in the Trump world regard as a fast -- fast-rising star, reinforce what you write about in \"The Divider\"?  SUSAN GLASSER (Co-Author, \"The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017- 2021): Well, thank you very much, Major.  I was really struck in your interview with her that the Trumpist style in American politics, a la the famous paranoid style in American politics, seems to be with us whether or not Trump himself is literally on the ballot.  I think that Kari Lake is an example. First of all, she was rerunning a Trump play from the 2018 midterm elections, which did not work, by the way, in which he falsely claimed that there was an invasion at the Southern border and actually sent real U.S. military troops to defeat this fake invasion.  You have her and other candidates now using this language of invasion. I think we should point out, as a matter of fact, that we are not actually experiencing an invasion, number one. Number two, you just -- you have brazenness, I think, as a superpower. And so you have -- for Donald Trump, right, he's willing to go anywhere, to say anything. And one thing he's found is that millions will follow him, for example, in the election lies about 2020.  Interestingly, in your interview, she did not -- she was not willing to actually come out and say that Joe Biden was not the legitimate...  MAJOR GARRETT: What Blake Masters said...  SUSAN GLASSER: Absolutely, even...  MAJOR GARRETT: ... running for the Senate as a Republican in Arizona.  SUSAN GLASSER: Even though they have all sought Trump's endorsement on the basis that they endorse his false claims. Very interesting.  Does that mean that they can't quite fully imitate Donald Trump?  MAJOR GARRETT: Peter, and yet -- I think it's important to put the \"and yet\" -- Kari Lake is running neck and neck in Arizona. Donald Trump got millions more votes when he ran for reelection in 2020 than 2016.  What does that tell you?  PETER BAKER (Co-Author, \"The Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017- 2021\"): Yes.  Well, we call the book \"The Divider\" not because Trump created the divisions in our society, but he managed to -- he manifested them. He's the manifestation of them, and he figured out how to exploit them politically.  And what we're now seeing is whether he can -- he can -- his inheritors, if you will, can then translate that same style, that same technique and approach on the state level in places like Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, and so forth.  And the answer right now is, they have a real strong support. It's a very evenly divided country. When you see these battleground states at 50/50, it tells you that the Trump part of the country is not just a minority. It is a significant part of America and what -- we have to confront that one way or the other, and rather -- and it can't be dismissed.  This is something that's going to outlast Trump himself.  MAJOR GARRETT: Do you think that voters drawn to it are wrong to be drawn to it, or that that is an acceptable alternative in American politics, and that there is something Democrats are missing about this particular approach? PETER BAKER: Yes, there's a politics of grievance, right?  What Trump successfully tapped into is a sense out there of resentment among a lot of Americans, who feel like the elites in some fashion or another have let them down, whether the elites be in Washington or in their state capitals.  It's also a dividing, of course, along racial lines, along cultural lines, along ethnic and income lines. And it's been a successful trademark in this era. And the question is, how do you address those concerns in a way that doesn't exacerbate the divisions, instead of bringing people together?  MAJOR GARRETT: Nikole, you're on Capitol Hill, but you have also been traveling.  What have you been seeing in relation to the things that Peter and Susan have been talking about? I know you were recently in Georgia. There's a Trump-preferred candidate there, had a very stressful week. Catch us up.  NIKOLE KILLION: Well, that's right.  And, in terms of Herschel Walker, for now, the party seems to be standing with him. And so are voters. They are willing to look past his faults. But I think it's yet another example of many voters being willing to accept anything.  At one point, in our races, the issue of candidate quality was something that meant a lot. But now you have candidates who deny elections, candidates who may have had past transgressions, and yet voters are willing to look past that.  So, and...  MAJOR GARRETT: And, in -- and, in the case of the Georgia race, it's not just a transgression. It's something that fundamentally disagrees with what his position is, if I understand it correctly, on access to abortion.  NIKOLE KILLION: Well, absolutely.  This is somebody who has been staunchly anti-abortion, doesn't support abortion with exceptions, but yet these reports have started to come out that, at one point in time, he paid for an abortion for a girlfriend, perhaps encouraged her to get an abortion on a second opportunity.  And so that didn't happen. This woman claims to be the mother of his child. Again, CBS News has not been able to independently verify some of those claims. But it does raise questions about where he comes down on this issue. And this race is critical. I mean, this race could really decide control of the Senate. And so this is kind of a make-or-break moment for his campaign.  MAJOR GARRETT: Scott, you watch the trials, the prosecutions resulting from January 6, 2021, very closely, but you also keep a very close eye on the atmospherics around the Capitol and the midterm elections itself.  What is the sense of risk that members of Congress seeking reelection feel they are under, either at home or in the Capitol itself?  SCOTT MACFARLANE: A significantly growing risk.  In just a year's time, the Capitol Police have investigated thousands of potential threats against members of Congress. And then the Justice Department reveals that it has a task force that is also reviewing hundreds, if not thousands, of potential threats.  And the political impact of this aside -- and there may be a significant political impact to election denialism and questioning the integrity of elections -- let's talk about the blocking and tackling of administering elections.  It puts that at risk as well. You chronicle this well in your book. But I will add, I talked to the elections administrator in Lansing, Michigan, Ingham County, Michigan, a purple county in Michigan, concerned about threats against her poll workers, concerned about recruiting poll workers, finding people to come in and want a piece of that.  And we know that some of the administrators of elections nationwide are trying to recruit law students, American Bar Association-related volunteers, somebody to come man the polls in this uniquely toxic environment.  MAJOR GARRETT: Toxic environment, Susan, does that feel like something that will be inevitable, not only in this midterm election?  It's not going to go away. Clearly, we know that. Will this toxicity, should we assume it will continue all the way up to 2024, possibly beyond?  SUSAN GLASSER: Yes, I think it's not just a matter of rhetoric, right?  It's structural changes that are being made in our politics. You have Trump, who's reoriented the Republican Party and radicalized it. \"The Washington Post\" reported this week that 299 nominees, Republican nominees for House, Senate and major statewide posts, are election deniers, including in -- some will be in key races where they are determining the counting and the certification of votes going forward. And, by the way, many of those Republican nominees are in safe Republican seats, so they're now guaranteed to have essentially a wave of Trumpian shock troops who have made election denialism a foundation of the Republican -- Republican Party's new ideology.  So, it's not just a matter of rhetoric. I think we're changing the structure of American politics in ways that are designed to exacerbate this ongoing crisis in American democracy.  MAJOR GARRETT: Nikole, it's pretty clear, if you look at the spending patterns in some of the Senate races, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, dramatic examples of this.  On the Republican side, more than half of the money spent on TV advertising is about crime. To what degree do you see that playing as a potential -- potentially pivotal issue in the midterms?  NIKOLE KILLION: Well, it certainly is a Republican talking point and an issue that they want to put front and center.  I was just in Wisconsin over the weekend and talked to Senator Johnson, who is going for his third term. And he did say that he feels that that should be a defining issue in this election.  On the flip side, though, in terms of his opponent, he has tried to paint him as someone who is soft on crime. But in terms of Mandela Barnes, his approach has really been making this abortion rights issue, which we have seen Democrats time and again in a lot of the Senate races really tried to bring that to the fore.  So, again, kind of, as Anthony pointed out earlier, I think it's the -- each party has a different narrative, and it's a matter of which one is going to rise to the top.  MAJOR GARRETT: Peter, in your book with Susan, do you deduce anything that you think is of lasting and positive value from the Trump year -- years?  (LAUGHTER)  PETER BAKER: Well, look, I think it's reinforced this conversation about what our democracy is and should be, right?  And it's forced us to look at the structure, as Susan said, of our politics and of our system. But I think that what the concern is, we don't know where it's going to lead us. Do we reaffirm our commitment to this system that we created 240-some years ago, or are we going to find ourselves lost?  And I think that that's the big question heading into 2024.  MAJOR GARRETT: I mean, if the former president were sitting here, he would say: I improved the economy. I made American foreign policy stronger. PETER BAKER: Yes.  MAJOR GARRETT: Would you say any of that has a validity, based on all the research that went into the book?  PETER BAKER: There are a lot of voters out there who say, look, I like Donald Trump because I liked some of the things he accomplished. I did like tax cuts, or a conservative Supreme Court justice, or regulation cuts or what have you.  But the question that is raised, at least certainly in our book, goes beyond a specific Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative ideological - - ideological fight. It goes to the larger questions of what we want to be as a country.  And I think that's what makes Trump unique. He's not like other Republicans or Democrats. It's not about policy. It's not about what our health care should be or tax cuts. It's about whether you believe in the system that we created.  MAJOR GARRETT: It is a time for uniqueness and larger questions, to be sure.  Peter Baker, Susan Glasser, Nikole Killion, Scott MacFarlane, thank you so very much.  We will be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MAJOR GARRETT: As Russia's military suffers more setbacks in its invasion of Ukraine, President Biden warned last week that Russian President Vladimir Putin is -- quote -- \"not joking\" -- unquote -- when he talks about using nuclear weapons, saying we face a prospect of nuclear Armageddon unlike anything we have seen since the height of the Cold War.  For more on what's happening on the ground in Ukraine, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata has more.  (Begin VT)  CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice-over): In a serious escalation to the war here, security cameras captured the moment a massive explosion tore through the Crimean bridge on Saturday morning. Russian officials blamed the explosion on a truck bomb, calling it an act of terror.  It comes on the back of a series of setbacks on the battlefields. Ukrainian forces have been clawing back territory on multiple fronts, in the south, toward Kherson, and east in the Donbass region, where we traveled to the liberated city of Lyman. On the way, we spoke with Colonel Serhiy Cherevaty, who took part in the battle.  Which weapons were important in this fight?  (COLONEL SERHIY CHEREVATY SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)  CHARLIE D'AGATA: \"Artillery was very important,\" he said, \"American weapons and, of course, the HIMARS,\" the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems that can strike targets deep behind enemy lines.  (GUNSHOTS)  CHARLIE D'AGATA: But every inch of ground retaken in the very territory President Putin has illegally annexed risks retaliation and deepens the specter of a nuclear response.  And in an interview with the BBC, President Zelenskyy has warned, Russia may be getting ready.  VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (Ukrainian President): They begin to prepare their society. That is very dangerous.  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Once again this week, the Russian military showed a reckless disregard for human life.  (MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Overnight, rockets rained down on a residential neighborhood in Zaporizhzhia, leveling apartment blocks, killing more civilians, the latest in a series of strikes.  Earlier this week, on a grand avenue in Zaporizhzhia, we found firefighters still dousing a mountain of twisted metal and concrete.  Several hours after the rocket attack, and the building is still smoldering. This is no longer a rescue operation. And this is an upmarket neighborhood in the center of town. The more Russian troops lose against Ukrainian soldiers, the more they retaliate against civilians.  (End VT)  CHARLIE D'AGATA: Renewed shelling at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has cut the main power lines there.  Engineers have had to rely on emergency diesel generators. President Putin has signed a decree declaring that it's now officially under Russian ownership -- Major. MAJOR GARRETT: Charlie, thank you.  We will be back in a moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to America's economic challenges.  And to help us out, I want to bring in Mohamed El-Erian. He is the chief economic adviser at financial services company Allianz. He is also president of Queens College in Cambridge. He's good enough to join us this morning from New York.  So, this week was a very volatile week in the U.S. stock markets. Volatility has been ever-present, I would say, during this calendar year, but this week seemed really volatile.  For my audience, for our audience, break it down. What's going on? What is the source, if you can identify it, of that volatility?  MOHAMED EL-ERIAN (Chief Economic Adviser, Allianz): So, the main source of this volatility is changing perceptions of the Federal Reserve.  We are in this incredible situation, Major, where good news for the economy is bad news for the markets. And that's because the markets are worried that the Federal Reserve will tip us into recession by overreacting to strong economic news.  MAJOR GARRETT: Every White House I have ever covered -- and it's been more than one or two -- has said, you know, the market isn't the economy. The economy is the economy. And what markets do, markets are going to do.  Even so, volatility affects people's retirement, their planning and their sense of their medium- and long-term futures. How should people be looking at that? And when they hear the president, as he did on Friday, talk about navigating this transition, what does that mean?  MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, first, there's volatility, and there's unsettling volatility, volatility, when things go up and down and, on the whole, you're better off over time.  But that's not what we've had this year. We've had unsettling volatility, because we've had the stock market down by anything from 20 to 30 percent. We've had bonds, which are supposed to safeguard your investment, also down by about 15 percent.  So, there's been nowhere to hide. That's why people feel insecure. That's why they look at their retirement plans with concern. The president is right. We are currently on what I think of as a bumpy journey to a better destination, and we need to navigate both the journey and get ready for the destination. There is a possibility that the Federal Reserve makes another mistake and that that bumpy journey actually changes the destination. That's why the markets are on edge.  MAJOR GARRETT: Is it your perspective that the Federal Reserve has already made a series of mistakes, either not acting fast enough or overreacting?  MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So it's made two big mistakes that I think are going to go down in the history books.  One is mischaracterizing inflation as transitory. By that, they meant it is temporary, it's reversible, don't worry about it. That was mistake number one. And then, mistake number two, when they finally recognized that inflation was persistent and high, they didn't act. They didn't act in a meaningful way.  And, as a result, we risk mistake number three, which is, by not easing the foot off the accelerator last year, they are slamming on the brakes this year, which will tip us into recession.  So, yes, unfortunately, this will go down as a big policy error by the Federal Reserve.  MAJOR GARRETT: Continuing your metaphor, slamming on the brakes, does that mean it is impossible to achieve the either literal or mythical soft landing?  MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Even Chair Powell has gone from looking for a soft landing, to a softish landing, to now talking about pain.  And that is the -- the problem. That is the cost of a Federal Reserve being late. Not only does it have to overcome inflation, but it has to restore its credibility. So, yes, I fear that we risk a very high probability of a damaging recession that was totally avoidable, Major.  MAJOR GARRETT: Washington, D.C. is a hyperpolitical town, not a news bulletin. So it tends to absorb information internationally, sometimes in personal ways.  So there's a lot of chatter this week that when OPEC Plus decided and announced it was cutting production, that that was against President Biden specifically. Do you agree with that? Or do you think it's a broader OPEC Plus declaration about the direction of the global economy?  MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, first, it does hurt the U.S., and we've seen oil prices go up above $90 a barrel.  What does that mean? It means that inflation, which has been coming down, now risks going up again. So, that -- that is not good for us. However, that it came as a surprise, it didn't come as a surprise to me. OPEC is looking to protect oil prices in the context of declining global demand. All three major areas in the world, China, Europe, and the U.S., are slowing much faster, which means less demand for oil. So, what does OPEC do? They cut back supply.  So, this shouldn't have come as a big surprise. That's what they do. That's the history. But it's certainly not good news for the U.S. economy.  MAJOR GARRETT: Tying these things together, do you think higher gasoline prices inevitably mean higher inflation, making all the things we've discussed more complicated?  And do you have a Consumer Price Index prediction for the near future?  MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, the next measure comes out in a few days. That's going to be for September. Headline inflation will probably come down to about 8 percent.  But core inflation, what measures the drivers of inflation and how broad they are, is still going up. So we still have an inflation issue. Inflation will come down, Major. The question is, does it come down with a slowdown in the economy or a major recession? That is the question that's being debated right now.  It's not whether we'll have inflation coming down. We will. But it's the cost of that inflation coming down.  MAJOR GARRETT: Is the jobs report this week a silver lining in all of this otherwise gloomy assessment?  MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: It certainly is.  We created 260,000 -- 263,000 jobs. That's a lot for this stage. We also reduced the unemployment rate to 3.5 percent. That's really low. There was one, one concern, which is that labor force participation, how many people are in the labor force, came down. And that's not good news. And it talks to the importance of focusing on human capital.  MAJOR GARRETT: One last thing before I let you go. We have about 30 seconds.  About two or three months ago, it was common for people on the Web to see stagflation headlines. We are not in a stagflation situation.  MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: We are. Growth is coming down. Inflation is still high. Unfortunately, it's not time to eliminate that term yet. MAJOR GARRETT: Very good. Mohamed El-Erian, we thank you so much for your time.  And we will be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MAJOR GARRETT: Well, that is it for us today. We want to thank you for watching.  Margaret will be back next week.  For Face the Nation, I'm Major Garrett. ",

Kelli Ward, chairwoman of the Arizona GOP, announced the condemnation by the panel on Twitter, saying Bowers is \"no longer a Republican in good standing & we call on Republicans to replace him at the ballot box in the August primary.\" The censure resolution from the state party criticized Bowers for a number of actions as a state House member, including on election integrity, immigration and gender identity. The measure also claimed Bowers \"has not been forthright in his interactions between others in legislative leadership, Republican Party leadership, his dealings with Maricopa County bureaucrats, lobbyists, consultants, the liberal media.\" \"Bowers has lost the confidence of a majority of Republican Party leaders and his colleagues in the legislature in the state of Arizona,\" the resolution stated. Bowers testified publicly before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol last month alongside elections officials from Georgia who discussed how former President Donald Trump and his allies pressured them to toss out election results from their states.\u00a0 The Arizona House speaker detailed how John Eastman, a conservative attorney who was behind a plan to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and Rep. Andy Biggs, a Republican from Arizona, urged him to decertify President Biden's electors. He also recalled receiving a call from Trump and lawyer Rudy Giuliani after the election, during which Giuliani claimed to have evidence of voter fraud in Arizona, evidence that never materialized. Bowers told the committee the scheme to replace Mr. Biden's electors with a fake slate for Trump was a \"tragic parody\" and emotionally discussed protesters showing up at his home after he defied the former president and refused to go along with his plan to reverse the election results in Arizona.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump touched down in Arizona Saturday for his first rally of the midterm election year, bringing the spotlight to a state that will have hotly contested races for governor and the U.S. Senate in November.\u00a0 In the governor's race, Trump has endorsed Kari Lake, a former news anchor who says she wouldn't have certified the 2020 election. He has not yet picked a Senate candidate to take on incumbent Democrat Mark Kelly. The Republicans who are vying to challenge Kelly include Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, solar power executive Jim Lamon, venture capitalist Blake Masters and retired Air Force Major General Michael \"Mick\" McGuire.\u00a0 Democrats have won the last two Senate races in Arizona, including the 2020 special election when Kelly defeated former Senator Martha McSally by 2.4 points. Kelly, a retired astronaut, is serving the remainder of the late Arizona Senator John McCain's term and must run again this year for a full six-year term.\u00a0 Trump isn't expected to endorse anyone Saturday \u2014 Arizona's primary is August 2, and sources familiar with the race believe Trump is waiting to see how the race shapes up before he decides on a candidate.\u00a0 His endorsement is powerful, but it doesn't always clear the field. North Carolina Congressman Ted Budd, for instance, is in a tough race against former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory. And in Alabama, Trump-endorsed Congressman Mo Brooks is locked in a\u00a0tight contest\u00a0against Katie Britt, who was retiring Senator Richard Shelby's chief of staff.\u00a0 Trump remains popular with Arizona Republicans. Though his endorsement failed to carry McSally to victory in the 2018 or 2020, it would be influential in the primary. \"If you're any candidate in this race for Senate, you want his endorsement,\" said Chris DeRose, a lawyer and former Brnovich staffer in the state attorney general's office. \"Do you need it to win? No. But you'd be crazy not to want it.\" In November, Trump attended a fundraiser that Masters held at Mar-a-Lago. Masters, who is the president of billionaire Peter Thiel's foundation and holds a Stanford law degree, told CBS News that winning the race becomes \"a lot harder\" without Trump's endorsement, but he's sure the former president won't back any of his opponents.\u00a0 Brnovich has been the front runner in the race and his supporters are counting on his record on immigration to help him in the primary. A source familiar with the race said that Trump and Brnovich speak regularly, and Brnovich could visit Mar-a-Lago soon. Over time, Trump has become less pointed in his criticism of Brnovich over Arizona's election results. Days after the 2020 election, Brnovich told Fox Business \"there is no evidence, there are no facts that would lead anyone to believe that the election results will change\" and said Trump had lost because voters split their tickets. Months later, Trump was still not acknowledging his defeat and attacked Brnovich for not trying to prove the election had been stolen from him.\u00a0 In May, he labeled Brnovich \"lackluster\" and said he was \"nowhere to be found\" regarding the 2020 election. \u00a0 Lamon, a veteran who launched his candidacy in May, drew attention this week after he released an advertisement this week using the anti-Biden slogan \"let's go Brandon.\" Democrats say Trump is \"creating chaos\" in the Republican primaries, \"elevating deeply flawed GOP candidates, escalating Republicans' infighting, and forcing their candidates to attack each other over who can suck up to Trump the most,\" said Jazmin Vargas, a spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\u00a0 One issue Republicans will have to navigate is the review of the 2020 election that Arizona Senate Republicans ordered in Maricopa County. The review, which was widely criticized by election experts, ultimately showed a wider margin of victory for President Joe Biden.\u00a0 Maricopa County has denied the report's claims of counting invalid ballots and election administration errors, saying the review was plagued by \"faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions, and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws.\" \u00a0 \"The audit issue, especially for Republicans on the ticket this year, it's like walking a tightrope of floss,\" said Mike Noble, chief of research at the nonpartisan polling firm OH Predictive Insights.\u00a0 Lamon is leaning into the Maricopa review and said it highlighted enough issues \"to move that election into President Trump's column\" in Arizona. He and other Republicans sent a document to Congress falsely claiming they were the state's electors. He told CBS News that he didn't regret this because slates of electors have to be submitted by a certain date, and he claimed Republicans wanted to be prepared \"if in fact this election was decertified.\" Masters said in November that he thinks Trump won the 2020 election. \"Joe Biden is president right now,\" Masters told CBS News. \"Do I think he won a free and fair election? I don't. I don't think we had a free and fair election in 2020. If we did, I strongly suspect, truly believe that President Trump would still be president.\"\u00a0 He faults mail voting practices expanded by COVID and social media companies for quashing negative stories about the Bidens. McGuire, the retired major general, told CBS News that \"there is no constitutional remedy or dispute about the fact that Joe Biden received more than 270 electoral votes.\" When asked if he believed Biden won the election fairly, McGuire said he looks forward to what comes from Brnovich's review of findings that were turned over to the attorney general's office. And he's not the only one in the race targeting primary front runner Brnovich over the 2020 election.\u00a0   Lamon rallied outside of Brnovich's office in December, calling for more action. Masters said Brnovich \"needs to hold people accountable where laws were broken\" and thinks Brnovich is trying to \"kick the can past the primary so that he can pretend to be tough on election integrity.\" \"It's always easy to take cheap shots from the cheap seats,\" a Brnovich campaign spokesperson said in a statement. \"Attorney General Brnovich remains focused on doing his duly elected job and will present the findings when his office concludes the investigation.\" Brnovich's allies point to his victory at the U.S. Supreme Court in a case challenging Arizona voting laws about ballots cast in the wrong precinct and a ban on \"ballot harvesting\" and his office's demand that the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors comply with a subpoena related to the state Senate-ordered review of 2020.\u00a0 Views of the audit and 2020 election may impact moderate suburban voters in Arizona who helped carry Democrats to victory in 2020, Noble said, but other issues may be more pressing in November.\u00a0 \"If people are feeling pain points with the economy, inflation, things of that nature, that's going to supersede social issues, or an audit is going to feel very distant in the voters' memories,\" Noble said.\u00a0 Immigration and the economy were the top issues for Republicans in a November poll by OH Predictive Insights. Migrant encounters in the Tucson sector were up 72% in October and November, over the same time period in 2020, while encounters in the Yuma were up by 2,400%, according to Customs and Border Protection data. Encounters along the southern border were very low during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 \"There has always been an issue with lawlessness and misconduct at the border, but I have never seen it like it has been since the 20th of January,\" said McGuire, who served as Adjutant General of the Arizona National Guard from 2013-2021.\u00a0 Lamon says he supports legal immigration, but worries border patrol agents are struggling to keep up with the spike in border encounters, which he deemed \"an invasion.\" \"They're coming from around the world,\" Lamon said. \"America really needs to understand that. This is a border control issue.\" Masters, who worked with Thiel, wants to see stricter regulations on major technology companies. \"When they control the flow of information in a free society, when they have motive and opportunity to swing elections, I think that's something we ought to take a look at. Right now the attitude is just complete laissez-faire,\" Masters said.\u00a0 Lamon was the only candidate to bring up working with his counterpart in the Senate if he wins, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. \"We could be a juggernaut, Republican and Democrat, working together,\" he said.\u00a0 Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, who has been repeatedly attacked by Trump, has said that he is not interested in running for Senate, but some allies still hope he'll change his mind.\u00a0 \"He will never have my endorsement or the support of MAGA Nation!\" Trump said in a statement Friday after Politico reported that Ducey is still open to entering the race.\u00a0 Trump has also not endorsed in competitive primaries in Missouri or Ohio. And he hasn't endorsed in Pennsylvania since his preferred candidate, Sean Parnell, suspended his campaign.\u00a0 \"Arizona, Ohio, Missouri and Pennsylvania are all states that are a lot more complicated \u2014 there's no clear candidate and you might as well let it play out a little bit,\" a Trump adviser said.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Republicans in the Senate on Tuesday blocked a measure that would provide an additional $10 billion in COVID-19 relief from moving forward, declining to throw their support behind the bipartisan deal unless Democratic leaders allowed a vote on an immigration-related amendment. The vote in the evenly divided Senate to clear a procedural hurdle failed 47-52, leaving Democrats well shy of the 60 votes they needed in order for the deal to move forward. The failed vote to begin debate on the $10 billion COVID relief package came one day after Republicans and Democrats announced they had reached an agreement on the supplemental funding for therapeutics, research and vaccines. The deal was the result of negotiations led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and GOP Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, and came in response to a request by the Biden administration for Congress to urgently provide more money to help the U.S. continue its fight against COVID-19. The $10 billion is far less than $22.5 billion initially sought by the White House to continue its vaccination and testing efforts and prepare for future variants, and the agreement omitted $5 billion for global efforts to combat COVID-19. Still, the White House urged Congress to \"move promptly\" on the package to fund immediate pandemic-related needs. Following the failed vote Tuesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki called the blockade by Senate Republicans \"disappointing\" and warned there are \"consequences\" for Congress failing to approve the additional funding. \"The program that reimbursed doctors, pharmacists and other providers for vaccinating the uninsured had to end today due to a lack of funds. America's supply of monoclonal antibodies that are effective at keeping people out of the hospital will run out as soon as late May. Our test manufacturing capacity will begin ramping down at the end of June,\" she said, adding the Senate vote is \"a step backward for our ability to respond to this virus.\" The $10 billion COVID relief bill became ensnared in a dispute between Republicans and Democratic leaders over immigration and border policy, which the GOP is elevating as a key issue ahead of the November midterm elections. GOP senators wanted a vote on an amendment that would prevent Mr. Biden from winding down a Trump-era border restriction known as Title 42 that authorized U.S. border officials to swiftly expel migrants in order to stop the spread of a contagious disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced last week it would end the pandemic-era rule because of improving public health conditions, sparking backlash from Republicans and some moderate Democrats who warned the end of Title 42 would lead to chaos at the border. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters ahead of the vote Tuesday there would \"have to be an amendment on Title 42 in order to move the\" COVID relief bill. \"There are several other amendments that we're going to want to offer and so we'll need to enter into some kind of agreement to process these amendments in order to go forward with the bill,\" he said.\u00a0 Schumer, though, lambasted Republicans from stopping the funding measure from moving forward, calling the failed vote \"devastating\" to Americans. \"Vaccines, therapeutics, and testing were negotiated in good faith and they should not be held hostage to extraneous unrelated issues,\" he said. \"This is too important for the health of the American people, but that seems precisely what some Republicans want to do.\" Romney, who helped broker the deal on the COVID funding, voted against advancing the measure, telling reporters there are \"legitimate amendments to be considered\" and senators \"need to know what the amendment process is going to be.\" While the White House has been pushing Congress to quickly approve the new aid, doing so this week appears difficult. The Senate is aiming to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court before members leave for a two-week recess set to begin Friday, and her confirmation vote could come as soon as Thursday. \"Given the calendar and the fact that we have the Supreme Court nominee hopefully proceeding along, why, it's going to be hard to do both at the same time, but we'll see,\" Romney said.

            "article_content": "Congressman Henry Cuellar is fighting for his political life in the upcoming Texas Democratic primary, hoping to prevail in the rematch against progressive immigration lawyer Jessica Cisneros, a former intern for his office who came within 3,000 votes of beating him in 2020.\u00a0 There's another candidate in the race for the 28th Congressional District, too, educator Tannya Benavides. And another development could play a role in the primary: in late January, the FBI raided Cuellar's campaign office, as part of an\u00a0investigation\u00a0related to Azerbaijan and several U.S. businessmen. Cuellar, who declined to speak to CBS News for this report, said at the time that he expected the probe would\u00a0 \"prove no wrongdoing.\"\u00a0 Early voting is underway for the March 1 Democratic primary. Although South Texas proved friendlier to Republicans in 2020, the 28th District \u2014 which snakes from San Antonio to Laredo and through more rural areas including Jim Hogg and Duval County \u2014 was redrawn for 2022 in a way that gives a slight edge to Democrats. The new district is predominantly Hispanic and covers more area than the state of New Jersey.\u00a0 South Texas and the Rio Grande Valley are being targeted by Texas Democrats, after seeing Republicans make gains in that region in 2020 and one state representative in the area\u00a0switch parties\u00a0in November 2021. This primary is an early test of the appeal of the progressive candidates challenging moderate \"Blue Dog\" Democrats, like Cuellar, in competitive districts that lean Democratic. Cisneros has the backing of Justice Democrats, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and progressive star Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 who traveled to San Antonio last week to rally for Cisernos and Greg Casar, who is running for Congress in Texas' 35th District.\u00a0 Texas has a runoff system for its primaries, so the winner will have to clear 50% support to win the nomination outright. Otherwise the top two vote getters will move forward to a runoff election on May 24. Cuellar, running for his 10th term, is among the most conservative House Democrats in the caucus. He has worked with Republicans to boost security at the border and is unapologetically anti-abortion. One of his first public appearances after the FBI raid was to receive a \"Legislator of the Year\" award from the \"Democrats for Life\" organization.\u00a0 His campaign appeared to have been caught off guard by Cisneros in 2020, but it has ramped up this time, with more door-knocking, more early mailers, T.V. and digital ads. Cuellar's campaign says these efforts had already been undertaken before the FBI investigation. A federal grand jury in Washington D.C. is investigating.\u00a0 Since the raid, Cuellar has kept a low profile but said he's cooperating with the investigation and confirmed\u00a0that he's still running for reelection. His campaign dismissed the impact of FBI probe on the race as \"minimal,\" given Cuellar's standing in the district, and what he's been able to get done for the district through his role on the powerful House Appropriations Committee. \"We are 100% confident it's going to show there's been no wrongdoing. We've actually gotten a lot of support and people almost doubling down their support because they know him, he's been a fixture in the community for a long time,\" said a member of Cuellar's team.\u00a0 Laredo is the base of Cuellar's support \u2014 where other family members are also active in public service. His brother is the sheriff of Webb County and his sister is the county's former tax assessor-collector. At a campaign event for gubernatorial candidate Beto O'Rourke in Laredo, voters were split on Cuellar but didn't count the FBI probe as a strike against him.\u00a0 \"Politicians are forced to raise all of this money continuously in order to support their offices, their travel, the work that they do,\" said Melissa Cigarroa, a Cuellar supporter. She added, \"It doesn't surprise me that sometimes people can take advantage of that-- but you want someone who can do their job, and he's done so good for Laredo.\" Laredo native Joey Medina isn't surprised by the investigation.\u00a0 \"I just follow the candidates who don't accept political contributions from companies and high donors,\" he said. Medina's family voted for Cuellar in 2020, while he alone voted for Cisneros. He said they're leaning toward Cisneros this year because they see how the rising costs of prescription drugs are impacting his battle with diabetes.\u00a0 \"It's forced people to really think about who they're supporting much earlier in the primary cycle,\" Cisneros said about the FBI raid after a canvass kick-off in Starr County. \"[The raid] has really cemented what we've said from day one, that we are the best choice. People do not want someone who has been corrupted by corporate PAC money.\" Cisneros is banking on the rise in her name identification from her last run, as well as additions of left-leaning southeast San Antonio to the district during redistricting, to help her beat Cuellar this time.\u00a0 From January 1 to February 9 Cisneros outraised Cuellar by more than $560,000, though Cuellar still has a $860,000 advantage in cash on hand.\u00a0 Cisneros says she's told her team to \"not get distracted\" by the FBI raid, and to focus on painting Cuellar as part of a broken \"status quo,\" but Cisneros does think the raid might help her campaign, particularly with newer voters added through redistricting. \"It's not a good first impression for a lot of voters that the incumbent has been subjected to an FBI raid so close to the election,\" she said. \"If he really was delivering as he said he was, there's no reason why he should have come 2,700 votes away from almost losing to a 26-year-old candidate with no name-ID in the district.\" Cisneros, who interned for Cuellar in 2014, has made Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and raising the minimum wage the central ideas of her campaign, as well as attacking Cuellar on his anti-abortion stance.\u00a0 Cuellar's campaign argues that nominating Cisneros would heighten the risk that the district will fall under Republican control. Border counties make up about two-thirds of the district, and immigration enforcement resonates with its constituents.\u00a0 Cuellar has voted twice with Republicans on bills that fund the border wall, though he argued he carved out exceptions for areas of his district. One of his campaign ads hits Cisneros on her stances on immigration, warning she'd leave the district with \"open borders, leaving us less safe.\" After gains for the party in South Texas in 2020, Republicans think this district is in play, even though its political terrain has shifted slightly to the left during redistricting. Rural Zapata County, which is in the district, flipped from voting for Hillary Clinton by 33 points in 2016 to voting for Trump by about 6 points in 2020. Cuellar won the county by more than 30 points in 2020.\u00a0 There are seven Republican congressional candidates for this district after only one, Sandra Whitten, ran against Cuellar in 2020. The National Republican Congressional Committee has signaled it will compete in this district, as well as the neighboring Texas' 15th District, an open seat left by Democratic Congressman Vicente Gonzalez. The Republican National Committee has made a multi-million dollar investment into \"RNC Community Centers\" geared towards minority communities. Three are in South Texas, including one in San Antonio and one in Laredo. \"Henry and I are pretty close friends. He does a lot of good for Laredo, he's in charge of the border. I hope he survives his primary,\" said Bill Young, the former Webb County Republican Chair, at a RNC Community Center event. \"But\u2013 it's going to be a battle for him in the primary and in the general.\" Republican candidate and businessman Ed Cabrera said a recent internal poll from his campaign conducted after the FBI raid has Cisneros up 7 points on Cuellar. Benavides noted Republicans have been targeting rural counties. \"There's been so much that's happened since 2020 that we will, as a Democratic party, be judged by,\" Benavides told CBS News during an event in Zapata County. \"They're looking at it as a window of opportunity. So I'm also going to be where the Republican party is at.\" New voting laws passed by Texas' Republican legislature, particularly the restrictions on unsolicited mail ballot applications, the reduced polling place locations and new voter ID requirements, may also have an impact that may be more evident in the outcome of the general election but are already making a difference. Webb County Democratic Chair Sylvia Bruni said she was told 20% of mail ballot applicants in the county have been rejected. \"Democrats tend to like the vote by mail ballot. It was very intended, very targeted for the Democratic voter,\" Bruni said about the new voting laws.\u00a0 Ocasio-Cortez, in remarks at a South Texas campaign rally last weekend for Cisneros and Casar, tied Cuellar to moderate House Democrats who\u00a0pushed to pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill without the Build Back Better social spending plan.\u00a0 Progressives see Democratic opposition to Build Back Better from centrist members as a potent campaign issue. \"There has been a series of lessons this last year on Democrats who get elected and don't actually uphold the commitments associated with supporting the president's agenda,\" said Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of the progressive Indivisible Group, which is spending $60,000 on mailers, ads and direct voter contact in the district. \"When I'm talking to people and they're saying, 'I'm upset about [Kyrsten] Sinema,' well, if you're upset about whether Democrats have the cohesion to move together on a bold agenda, there is action to take right now. And it is races like Representative Cuellar's,\" she added.\u00a0 Early voting in the state runs from February 14 to February 25. The last day to apply for a mail ballot is February 18.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence endorsed a candidate to take on former President Trump's favored candidate in the Arizona governor's race. He joins the state's incumbent governor, Doug Ducey, in backing Karrin Taylor Robson against former TV news anchor Kari Lake. Pence said in a statement that Robson \"is the only candidate for Governor that will keep Arizona's border secure and streets safe, empower parents and create great schools, and promote conservative values.\" Robson called Pence a \"warrior for the conservative values we hold most dear: the sanctity of Life, limited government; law and order; opportunity for all; vigorous defense of the 2nd Amendment; and the knowledge that our freedoms are granted by God.\" She added, \"Modern politics is full of charlatans and fakes, but Vice President Pence is the genuine article. He has never wavered in his conservative beliefs and commitment to our Constitution, and left a rock-solid legacy as Governor to which I will aspire.\" \u00a0\u00a0Pence will be appearing with her at campaign events this Friday in Phoenix and southern Arizona \u2014 the same day Trump is scheduled to hold a rally for Lake \u2014 underscoring the divide between the GOP establishment and Trump.   Prominent establishment Republicans including former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie are also supporting Robson, a housing developer, against Lake, who has been endorsed by Trump. Their push for Robson resembles the effort they mounted for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp in the final stretch of his successful bid to fend off Trump-backed challenger former Georgia Sen. David Perdue. Few states have been as central to Trump's election lies as Georgia and Arizona, the two closest 2020 battlegrounds where he pushed aggressively to overturn the results and fumed when Kemp and Ducey refused to go along. Trump has already faced a setback in Georgia, and the Aug. 2 race in Arizona is among his last opportunities to settle scores and install allies to lead states that may prove decisive if he decides to run again in 2024.  \"In Arizona, people are independent minded, much like they are in Georgia, and they pick the person that they think will be best for the responsibility,\" Ducey told The Associated Press. \"In Georgia, the voters said Brian Kemp, and I'm hopeful in Arizona, they'll say Karen Taylor Robson.\" But the contest in Arizona is likely to be closer. Ducey isn't running again because of Arizona's term limits. As an incumbent seeking reelection, Kemp had an advantage over Perdue in the GOP primary and ultimately defeated him by nearly 52 percentage points.\u00a0 But what once looked like an insurmountable lead for Lake could end in a more competitive finish. With early voting already underway, Robson is drawing on her family's vast fortune to drown out Lake who, despite Trump's endorsement, has lagged in fundraising. Robson had outspent Lake more than 5 to 1 as of the end of June.  The final maneuvering by some leading GOP figures could prove significant in a close race. In addition to Pence, Ducey and Christie, Robson has the support of former U.S. Rep. Matt Salmon, who dropped out of the governor's race and endorsed her. The Border Patrol union, meanwhile, broke with Trump and backed Robson, citing in part Lake's prior statements supporting a pathway to citizenship for people living in the country illegally.  For her part, Lake is an unlikely MAGA champion. A well-known former local news anchor who donated to Barack Obama and for years hung around with drag queens at a gay bar near the television station, Lake once was the antithesis of Trump's brand of politics. Yet she rocketed to the top of the field since she walked away from her three-decade television career, declared \"journalism is dead\" and took a sledgehammer to a pile of TVs.  She built on the powerful connection she'd formed with viewers in the Phoenix media market over 27 years with the local Fox affiliate and created a uniquely strong bond with the base that propelled Trump to the White House in 2016 and still doesn't believe he lost in 2020. Even Trump seemed impressed by the ovation her name inspired when he mentioned it during a rally in Phoenix last year. He endorsed her a short time later.  She, in turn, has adopted his combative style, his narrative about the 2020 election \u2014 she falsely says it was corrupt and stolen \u2014 and his get-tough approach to border security. She's walked away from her close ties with John McCain's family and now feuds with the late U.S. senator's children.  \"We're either gonna go the way of the past, which is the McCain mafia running the show, or we're gonna go with America first,\" Lake told a crowd of hundreds at a country western bar in Tucson last week. Many arrived well over an hour early and waited in the Southern Arizona heat for a chance to get inside.  Lake, 52, routinely berates journalists trying to question her and releases the footage on social media.  Last year, she said she wants to put cameras in classrooms to monitor teachers, nodding to the backlash on the right to teachings on race and history in public schools. If elected, she says, she'd immediately invoke an untested legal theory that illegal immigration constitutes an \"invasion\" of the United States and gives the governor war powers to remove people from the country without proceedings in immigration courts.  Since Robson and her allies began their full-court press, Lake has claimed without evidence that \"they might be trying to set the stage for another steal.\"  \"They have been such RINOs for so long, and I don't trust that they have our country as a priority,\" said Rosa Alfonso, a 60-year-old speech language pathologist in Tucson. \"That's a big deal.\" Robson, 57, is making her first run for office, though she has lifelong ties to GOP politics. He father and brother both held elected office as Republicans.  An attorney for real estate developers, she has been at the center of the suburban sprawl that has propelled the Phoenix area's prodigious growth. Ducey appointed her to the board overseeing Arizona's three public universities, her most high-profile public role before she quit to run for governor.  \"These are serious times,\" Robson said during a recent debate. \"We need a serious candidate with a record of accomplishment.\" Her husband, housing developer Ed Robson, 91, is one of the state's richest residents, amassing a fortune building master planned retirement communities. She says the 2020 election was \"unfair\" but has stopped short of calling it fraudulent. Like Lake, she's running as a border hawk.  She brands her rival \"Fake Lake,\" highlighting a $350 donation she gave to Obama's 2008 campaign, though Robson has herself contributed large sums to Democrats.  \"It's all an act,\" Ducey said of Lake. \"The campaign she's been running bears no resemblance to the life she's lived for the past three decades, nor to the interactions that she's had with me. She's putting on a show. We'll see how many people buy it.\" Fin Gomez and Aaron Navarro contributed to this report.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "While Georgia has received much of the national attention among the states holding primaries on Tuesday, there are also critical Republican primaries in Alabama and tests for both progressives and the Bush political dynasty in Texas.\u00a0 In Arkansas, former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders is expected to win the Republican nomination for governor and will likely be a heavy favorite to win in November.\u00a0 Here are the key races to watch: Republican Sen. Richard Shelby's retirement is creating an open seat in Alabama. There appears to be a three-way race to fill that seat and the race could end up in a runoff. Shelby is supporting his former chief of staff, Katie Britt, who is running against Rep. Mo Brooks and businessman Mike Durant.\u00a0 Trump endorsed Brooks in April 2021, but withdrew his support from the congressman in March. At the time, Brooks was struggling in polls.\u00a0 Trump said that Brooks had \"made a horrible mistake recently when he went 'woke,'\" referring to Brooks saying people should put the 2020 election \"behind you\" during a rally last August in Alabama. Brooks was booed at that rally when he urged the crowd to move on from 2020. After Trump pulled his endorsement, Brooks said that Trump \"asked me to rescind the 2020 elections, immediately remove Joe Biden from the White House, immediately put President Trump back in the White House, and hold a new special election for the presidency.\" \"As a lawyer, I've repeatedly advised President Trump that January 6 was the final election contest verdict and neither the U.S. Constitution nor the U.S. Code permit what President Trump asks,\" Brooks said. Brooks was among the Republicans who objected to election results in Arizona and Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Despite losing that endorsement, Brooks has hung around in recent polling. A recent Emerson poll showed Britt (32%) slightly ahead of Durant (26%) and Brooks (25%). Another poll from the Alabama Daily News also showed the three candidates all with a chance of making the runoff.\u00a0 On the Democratic side, pastor Will Boyd, former Brighton, Alabama, Mayor Brandaun Dean, and veteran Lanny Jackson are vying for the nomination.\u00a0 To avoid a runoff, a candidate needs to win a majority of the votes.\u00a0 Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey is one of many incumbent governors facing a primary in 2022. So far, incumbents have protected their seats in Idaho, Ohio and Texas.\u00a0 A recent Emerson poll showed Ivey leading the field with 46%, putting her close to the mark that she needs to hit to avoid a runoff. Businessman Tim James (18%) and former Trump Ambassador to Slovenia Lindy Blanchard (11%) were her closest competitors.\u00a0 Conservatives criticized some of Ivey's decisions around COVID, including her decision to extend her state's mask order in March 2021. Some activists also claimed her order directing state agencies not to cooperate with a federal vaccine mandate didn't go far enough. \u00a0\u00a0 Ivey has boasted about her conservative credentials, including a 2019 law that amounted to a near-total abortion ban. She recently drew national attention after she signed a law that makes it a felony for doctors to prescribe puberty blockers and hormones to transgender people who are under 19 years old.\u00a0 She also drew criticism for an ad where she said \"if Joe Biden keeps shipping illegal immigrants into our state, we're all going to have to learn Spanish. My message to Biden, no way Jose.\" Rep. Maxine Waters called the ad \"racist,\" prompting Ivey to tweet, \"There's nothing racist with telling the truth about the disaster Joe Biden is causing with illegals invading our country.\" On the Democratic side, educator Yolanda Flowers, businessman Chad Chig Martin, and state Sen. Malika Sanders-Fortier are among those in the race.\u00a0 Incumbent Republican Sen. John Boozman is running with Trump's endorsement, but he is another candidate who will need to clear the 50% mark to avoid a runoff in his primary. There has been little public polling in the race, but a recent poll from Hendrix College had Boozman coming up just short of avoiding a runoff. Veteran and former New England Patriots player Jake Bequette and former journalist and conservative commentator Jan Morgan, are the candidates who have presented the most serious challenge to Boozman.\u00a0 If needed, a runoff would be held on June 21. The Democrats in the race include realtor Natalie James, small business owner Dan Whitfield and former Pine Bluff City alderman Jack Foster. Former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was the first candidate to get Trump's endorsement after he left office in January 2021. When she entered Arkansas' gubernatorial race, she jumped into a crowded field that included the state's lieutenant governor and attorney general. But, by November 2021, Sanders essentially cleared the field when Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge announced that she would instead run for lieutenant governor. Sanders, whose father Mike Huckabee was governor of Arkansas from 1996 until 2007, has been a fundraising force, raising more than $15 million for the primary and general elections.\u00a0 Several candidates are running for the Democratic nomination including former state Rep. Jay Martin, former non-profit leader Chris Jones and educator Anthony Bland.\u00a0 Tuesday also marks the completion of Texas' March primary, when voters will participate in runoff elections.\u00a0 Attorney General Ken Paxton is backed by Trump and hopes to win another term in office. He's facing Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, who is the son of former Republican presidential candidate and Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The election will present a major test for the strength of the Bush political dynasty in Texas. George P. Bush shares a name with two former presidents: His uncle, George W. Bush, and his grandfather George H.W. Bush.\u00a0 Paxton has faced multiple scandals and investigations while in office. He pleaded not guilty in a state securities fraud case and was accused of bribery and other crimes by his former top aides. He has denied wrongdoing in both cases. In a recent ad, Bush said he's proud of his family's work, but \"this race isn't about my last name. It's about Ken Paxton's crimes.\"\u00a0 According to an April poll by the Texas Hispanic Policy Foundation, 40% of Republican primary voters said they would never vote for Bush. Two-thirds of those voters said that's because he is a member of the Bush family. Forty-one percent said they wouldn't vote for Bush because he's not conservative enough. Paxton released a video last week with Trump saying that Paxton is \"the most effective attorney general.\" Paxton received 42.7% of the vote during the March primary, while Bush got 22.8%.\u00a0 A recent Dallas Morning News poll showed Paxton leading Bush 41% to 35%. In the Democratic runoff, the poll showed ACLU lawyer Rochelle Garza leading former Galveston Mayor Joe Jaworski 35% to 20%.\u00a0 TexasThe progressive wing of the Democratic party has one of their biggest tests this election cycle in Texas' 28th district, where immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros is facing off against longtime incumbent Henry Cuellar. Cisneros first challenged Cuellar in 2020 and lost by under 3,000 votes. In the March 2022 primary, neither Cuellar nor Cisneros received over 50% of the vote, resulting in a runoff on Tuesday. Cuellar has looked to bounce back from an FBI investigation that led to a raid of his Laredo home in January, although Cuellar's attorney said that he was not the target of the investigation.\u00a0 He has been trying to appeal to the south Texas constituents through his stances on immigration policy and his role on the House Appropriations Committee. He's been backed by House leadership, who have stood by him after the FBI investigation and after his pro-life position on abortion as highlighted after the leaked draft opinion by the U.S. Supreme Court on Roe v. Wade. \"I do not agree with Henry Cuellar on everything,\" said House Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, referring to Cuellar's stance on abortion. \"We need to sit down with people who we do not agree with and try to find common ground, to do what is necessary to move this country forward.\" Cuellar and allies have also argued that a further left nominee like Cisneros would put the seat at risk of Republican control this November. Cisneros has the backing of the progressive wing of the party and has argued the district needs a change in representation. Her biggest contrast with Cuellar is on abortion, and her campaign has honed in on that in their closing message. \"We need a pro-choice majority in Congress, and Henry Cuellar does not have a part in that. I think his record has been very clear in the past two decades,\" Cisneros said on a press call with Emily's List last Friday. \"And next term, when the Women's Health Protection Act comes up again, he could very much be the Joe Manchin of the House,\" she added, referencing Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin's vote against the bill. \"He cannot be the determining vote on the future of our reproductive freedoms in this country.\" Immigration has been the calling card for Cuellar in his closing message, especially regarding the Title 42 border policy that is being litigated in the courts. Cuellar has warned there would be a large spike of migrants at the border if the policy is lifted, and that it could be politically perilous for Democrats if it is lifted. \"The messaging can be terrible for Democrats if they don't play this or message this right. They'll fit into the narrative that Republicans say \u2014 that Democrats are for open borders,\" Cuellar told CBS News in April. \u00a0 Either Cisneros or Cuellar will face the winner of the Republican runoff in this district between Cassy Garcia, a former aide to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, and preschool director Sandra Whitten. Democrats will also be watching another nearby Democratic runoff in Texas' 15th district, where small business owner Michelle Vallejo will face Ruben Ramirez, who was a former candidate in the district. This seat is a top target for national Republicans, after they've made gains with the Latino population in the region. Minnesota A special primary election is being held Tuesday to\u00a0 fill the seat of the late Republican Congressman Jim Hagedorn. His widow, Jennifer Carnahan, is one of 20 candidates running in Minnesota's 1st District. Ten Republicans are running as well as eight members of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party \u2014 the official name of the Minnesota Democratic Party \u2014 and two legal marijuana candidates. \u00a0 CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "With a rare opening this fall in its congressional delegation, Vermont appears poised to lose its distinction as the only state that has never been represented by a woman in Washington. Three women, including Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and Senate President Pro Tempore Becca Balint, are among the Democrats competing in the Aug. 9 primary for the seat being vacated by the state's lone U.S. House member, Democrat Peter Welch, who is trying to move to the Senate. The two Republican candidates registered to run in the midterm elections are also women.  Given Vermont's liberal reputation, it might seem strange that it would be the last state to send a woman to Congress. But Vermont's tiny population makes it one of a handful of states with the smallest possible congressional delegation \u2014 two senators and one House member. And like many states, Vermont has traditionally reelected its incumbents, who have happened to be White men who have ended up serving for extraordinarily long stretches. That includes Democrat Patrick Leahy, who was first elected in 1974 and is the fourth-longest-serving senator in history. \"It's a bottleneck of leadership,\" said Elaine Haney, the executive director of Emerge Vermont, an organization that works to prepare women to run for elective office. \"And so when someone holds on to all this for a very long time, it shuts off opportunity for everybody else.\"\u2032 Last November, Leahy announced he would retire after eight terms in office. Within days, Welch said he would seek the Senate nomination, leaving the at-large House seat vacant for the first time since 2006, when Welch succeeded now-Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders has served in the congressional delegation since 1991. Haney, whose organization helped train some of the women running for the House on how to campaign, noted that women bring a different experience to elected office than do men. That matters, she said, on issues such as abortion rights, a subject highlighted by a leaked draft opinion from the U.S. Supreme Court that indicated the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion would be overturned. \"I believe strongly \u2014 and I think a lot of other people believe strongly \u2014 that if women, Democratic women, were actually at the table, these kinds of threatening situations would not be occurring, because women's lived experiences would be at the center of the discussion and of the policy,\" she said. The Democratic candidates support abortion rights. A referendum on the ballot in Vermont in November would enshrine reproductive rights in the state constitution, the first such amendment in the country. The state also has a law protecting a woman's right to an abortion. \"We need leaders going to Washington who are unequivocal in making sure that Roe v. Wade is codified at the federal level, and I know that is a top priority for the (Democratic) women in this race,\" Gray said. Welch has also been a fervent supporter of abortion rights and has called on Congress to codify the right to an abortion. He believes electing a woman as his successor will encourage more young people to run for office. \"This is an all-hands-on-deck moment and I couldn't be more excited for our state that these women have stepped up to meet the challenge,\" Welch said in a statement. \"Each of the candidates is uniquely and incredibly talented and I know that they will use their experience to work hard for Vermonters in Congress should they be elected.\" Vermont remains an outlier at a time when the number of women serving in Washington is growing. Montana in 1916 made Rep. Jeannette Rankin the first woman elected to Congress, four years before the 19th Amendment secured women's constitutional right to vote. Since then, nearly 400 women have served as U.S. representatives, delegates, resident commissioners or senators, In 2018, Vermont became the last state without female representation in Congress when Mississippi Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith was appointed to the Senate. The women seeking the Democratic nomination in the Vermont House race have not focused their campaigns on the possibility that one of them will be the first woman from the state elected to Congress. They are instead promising to seek solutions to build the workforce, ease the state's affordable housing problem and combat the climate crisis, among other priorities central to the party. \"They're just not that far apart on a lot of these issues, and I think the election is going to turn on other things, such as questions of temperament and experience and, frankly, name recognition,\" said Matthew Dickinson, a political science professor at Middlebury College. Gray, the lieutenant governor, was elected in 2020 in her first bid for political office. She is a lawyer and a former assistant state attorney general. Balint has served in the state Senate for eight years, including six years in leadership positions, with the last two as president pro tempore. She was previously a middle school teacher. A third Democratic candidate, Sianay Chase Clifford, is a social worker from Essex who previously worked in Washington for Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts. The candidates could also make history in other ways. If elected, Balint would be the first openly gay person to represent Vermont in Congress, while Chase Clifford would be the first person of color to represent the state in Washington. The GOP candidates registered to run for the House seat are accountant Ericka Redic, who lost a state Senate race in 2020, and Anya Tynio, who ran for the U.S. House in 2018 and lost.  Redic says she will focus on fighting inflation, illegal immigration, drug misuse and government overreach, particularly as it concerns vaccine mandates. Tynio said on her website that she is a supporter of the Second Amendment, a proponent of strong border security and supportive of implementing legislation that would reduce inflation, cut the national debt and balance the budget.  Two men, an independent from Brattleboro and a physician from South Burlington running as a Democrat, are also running for the House seat, but neither has reported raising any money. While this fall's election will probably break Vermont's glass ceiling, it's likely the state will have other openings over the next few years. Sanders, an independent, is 80 years old and facing reelection in 2024. Welch is 75. Haney said she would love to see all of Vermont's top elected positions held by women. \"We have normalized male leadership throughout our history. And we are so used to seeing no one but men in charge, and we think, 'Oh, that's fine,'\" she said. \"There is nothing wrong with all women being in charge, and that's what I want to see.\"",

            "article_content": "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris that aired Sunday, July 10, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" ROBERT COSTA: Vice President Harris, let's begin with the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Japan is a country with very strict gun laws, little political violence. What was your reaction when you heard what happened? VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES KAMALA HARRIS: I was shocked, for so many reasons, beginning with the fact that Prime Minister Abe was a great friend to the United States, through many administrations. Our President Joe Biden is very, very fond of him and knew him well. And I've met with the most recent- past- Prime Minister of Japan and when we think about the relationship that we have developed over many years, and a shared vision that I think we have for that region of the world, but also the partnership, it was sad and shocking, and there's no question that the Japanese people are mourning. You know, if you look at his career, too, the length of time that he served really speaks to the impact he had on the country and- and the popularity of his presidency and his leadership. In terms of the issue of gun violence, well, I mean, let's just talk about that in terms of what it means here in the United States--\u00a0 ROBERT COSTA: You just visited Highland Park. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I did. And- you know, I was there within about 24 hours of that tragic act of extreme violence, and I made a point of spending time with the first responders and talked with them about what they've witnessed, the absolute tragedy of it all. And you know, I- listen, for a large part of my career, for most of my career, I was a prosecutor. I have looked at autopsy photographs, I have prosecuted homicide cases and when you meet with first responders, when you meet with families of these victims, you cannot avoid the reality of what the impact of this gun violence is on a community, on families, on people who- who love their community, who love their family member, and assault weapons. So let's just go right to that assault weapons. Assault weapons were specifically and intentionally designed to kill a lot of human beings quickly. It is a weapon of war. If you've ever looked at, if I may be so blunt, an autopsy photograph to see what it does to the human body and the fact that we can't get Congress to renew -- it's not like we're pulling something out of our hat, we've done it before as a nation -- to renew the assault weapons ban, is outrageous. And you can support the Second Amendment, I support the Second Amendment, but we should agree we should not have weapons of war on the streets of America. In that case, well known, sadly, a toddler lost both his parents. When I got to the scene, I was greeted by the mayor and- and the chief and the first responders who told me that story. I- and I can't even imagine what this is going to mean for the life of that child. ROBERT COSTA: Why do so many mass shooters, often young men radicalized online, seem to still have access legally, to weapons and to slip past red flag laws? Like those in Illinois? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Because those weapons are available. And we have to stop allowing those weapons to be available to civilians, living in communities of people who have a right to believe that they are not in a war zone. Understand- I mean, in peace loving communities. These weapons are- are transforming those peace loving communities into war zones. You look at the street, that long street where that parade was taking place. It's a community like any other community, small business owners, shops, people out in their lawn chairs, turned into not only a crime scene but a warzone in terms of the kinds of damage it did, the chaos it created. And the probably permanent sense of fear that the children and the people of that community will have about their vulnerability to weapons like the one in- that was- that were used. It's wrong.\u00a0 ROBERT COSTA: Vice President Harris, you were just with President Biden who issued an executive order-- VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yeah.\u00a0 ROBERT COSTA: --on abortion seeking to expand and bolster access-- VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yeah.\u00a0 ROBERT COSTA: --but so many Democrats in this country remain very angry about the recent Supreme Court decision.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yeah.\u00a0 ROBERT COSTA: California Governor Gav- Gavin Newsom said this in May. Where the hell is my party? He added that Republicans are winning. Let's acknowledge that. Is he right? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Listen, we- I think all of us share a deep sense of outrage that the United States Supreme Court took a constitutional right that was recognized, took it from the women of America. I mean, sit back and think about that for a moment. The highest court in our land just took a constitutional right that was recognized for women to make decisions about their own bodies. And so now we are looking at a situation where the government can tell a person in our country what they can and cannot do with their own body. We are now looking at a case where the government can interfere in what is one of the most intimate and private decisions that someone can make and should be able to make with their pastor, with their prince- with their priests, with their rabbi, with their loved ones and now the government is telling women what they can and cannot do. And so we- we are all outraged in such a fundamental way because this really does hit at the heart of- of the principles upon which our democracy was founded, principles that are about the freedom and liberty that Americans should be entitled to have. It really does get to that, and by the way, you don't have to agree on the issue of (INAUDIBLE), you know- you don't have to agree that you want to, or would advocate that you or a loved one would have an abortion, to agree that the government should not be making that decision for any individual woman-- ROBERT COSTA: Should Democrats\u2013 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: \u2013you don't have to abandon your faith, whatever that might be, to agree the government should not be making that decision for a woman and so that's why I say, let women make those most intimate decisions. Let people make the most intimate decisions that are about what I call heart and home, which includes contraception, which includes same-sex marriage. Let them make that and be free to make those decisions without government interference. ROBERT COSTA: When you look back did Democrats fail, past Democratic presidents, congressional leaders, to not codify Roe v. Wade over the past five decades? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I think that, to be very honest with you, I- I do believe that we should have rightly believed, but we certainly believed that certain issues are just settled. Certain issues are just settled.\u00a0 ROBERT COSTA: Clearly were not.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: No. That's right. And that's why I do believe that we are living, sadly in real unsettled times. You know, you look at it in terms of, there's another example of this point voting rights. You know, my parents were active in the civil rights movement. People marched and fought, broad coalitions of people across race and religion and ethnicity and- and- and gender, to say that, you know, fundamental principle of our- of our democracy is everyone- should have access, who are entitled to have access, to vote. And then we passed the Voting Rights Act to ensure that we would be able to enforce that principle. The court gutted it with Shelby v. Holder in 2013. And now you see states across the country that are intentionally making it more difficult for people to vote. We thought that was settled. We thought that was settled at least by law in the 60's. We look now at the issue of choice. We thought that was settled. Same-sex marriage, I was a long standing commitment to fight for the civil rights of people to love and marry the person they love. And we thought that was settled with Obergefell. Well, if you read the decision in Dobbs, I do believe that that right to privacy is at risk-- ROBERT COSTA: So, if-- VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: --of being attacked. ROBERT COSTA: If all of this is at risk, what will this administration do to try in the coming months before the election-- VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yeah. ROBERT COSTA: --to codify Roe to try to, through Congress, put into law some of these priorities? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: So we have designed our government that there are three co-equal branches. The court, Congress and then the executive branch, the president. And the court has now acted. The President acted this morning again with an executive order around what we will do through the executive branch to ensure that women have the ability to- to travel freely unencumbered, that women will have access to the medication, but we also need Congress to act because that branch of government is where we actually codify, which means put into law, the rights that again, we took for granted, but clearly have now been taken from the women of America. And that does have to happen and we should not allow ourselves to- to minimize the significance of that, which is Congress needs to act. We've seen this in the past, if you think about the Voting Rights Act-- ROBERT COSTA: Sure. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: --Congress acted, Civil Rights Act. Congress acted because where there was any question, especially through the courts or any other system, about the sanctity of these rights, we decided as a nation, we would put it into law. That's what we need to do with Roe and the principles behind Roe.\u00a0 ROBERT COSTA: Speaking of Congress acting-- VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yeah. ROBERT COSTA: --some senators have suggested that Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh misled them during the confirmation hearings on Roe v. Wade. Some Democrats have even called for those justices to be impeached. Do you believe they should be impeached? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I mean, listen, I start from the point of experience of having served in the Senate. I never believed them. I didn't believe them. It's why I voted against. And\u2013\u00a0 ROBERT COSTA: So, what now though? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:\u00a0 Well, what now, we need to understand that states are passing laws because of what the Supreme Court has now allowed to happen. States are passing laws, I think there are about 12 states, for example, I think there are about 12, who have said there's no exception, even for rape or incest. For a- for a woman or a girl to have access to an abortion and this medical procedure. Most recently a 10-year-old child who is the subject of a clearly a sexual assault, having to go through and endure that kind of injustice and violence and then having to travel to another state and this is just in the first two weeks, I think since after the decision. Can you imagine what this is going to mean? And who- and what other cases there will be that maybe we won't learn about that will occur? So what does this mean? It means that we're looking at elections coming up, in 120 something days, they're going to be about who serves in Congress, and we need a pro-choice Congress. Again, you don't have to advocate or believe that this is right for you or your family, but don't let the government make the decision for her family, whoever she may be. It means state offices, governors, secretaries of state, attorneys general. It means local races, who's going to be your DA, who's going to be your sheriff, enforcing laws that are being passed to criminalize medical health providers, and maybe even the women who seek the service. ROBERT COSTA: So a push across the board. The economy, also a key issue for so many Americans-- VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yes, of course. ROBERT COSTA: \u2013a new jobs report released today, the U.S. added over 370,000 jobs last month, but three quarters of the country, according to a CBS News poll, still feel like the economy is in a bad place. Are you hearing them? And are they right? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: There's no question that people, working people, are paying more for gas main- paying more for groceries and that is why for our administration, it is one of our highest priorities to bring down the costs. We, as you know, have released the Strategic Petroleum Reserve so that we're releasing a million barrels of gas a day, of oil a day to bring down the price. We're seeing prices come down, slowly, but it seems maybe surely. We are doing what we need to do to say that we've got to bring down the cost of of childcare and that includes a tax cut that we were able to pass yet not one Republican in the Senate voted for, which is an $8,000 tax cut for families raising children so that they can have a tax cut for food, for medication, for school supplies. We are advocating without any support right now in Congress to bring down the child care costs in terms of paying for a childcare provider. We're saying working families shouldn't pay more than 7 percent of their income in childcare costs. So it is our highest priorities to bring down costs in particular for working people in our country and it is- it's a real issue. There's no question about it. ROBERT COSTA: Basketball star Brittney Griner, she remains imprisoned in Russia. You and President Biden spoke with Cherelle Griner, her wife- VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yes. ROBERT COSTA: You reassured her, but what kind of reassurance is possible now? She has pled guilty. Is a prisoner swap on the table? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: So first of all, we take very seriously and we've been very clear, Brittany Griner, and there are sadly other Americans who are being unlawfully detained around the world, and it is on our highest priority list to bring those folks home. And so you are right, the President and I and- and Jake Sullivan and others have been in touch with Cherelle Griner, Brittany Griner's wife, to do what we can to lend support. I can't talk to you about the details, what's happening behind the scenes, but I can tell you that it is one of our highest priorities to bring these Americans home. ROBERT COSTA: How confident are you she'll come home soon? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: It's- we're gonna do everything we can to bring her home as soon as possible. That is for sure. That is for sure. ROBERT COSTA: We're just months away from the midterm elections. People are looking to this administration, to the White House for a strategy in your party for guidance. Finish this sentence for me. Americans need to vote for Democrats in November because-- VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Our democracy is on the ballot. Truly. Truly. If you look at an issue like choice, it's on the ballot. A woman's right to make decisions about her own body and potentially what can happen in the not-too-distant future around issues like access to and- and making decisions about contraception or same-sex marriage. What's on the ballot? We are- we are without any Republican support in terms of when we're trying to get these bills through, trying to bring down health care costs, trying to bring down the cost of prescription drugs including insulin saying it should be $35 a month. And elections matter. The people who are elected, especially to the United States Congress, will decide the outcome of all of these issues- voting rights, the ability of us to pass voting rights legislation, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, the Freedom to Vote Act, will be a function of who is in Congress. And I think that we have more on the line now than we have had in recent memory, in terms of fundamental rights, and again, fundamental rights around freedom and liberty. ROBERT COSTA: When I go around the country as a reporter and I talk to Black Americans, they bring up voting rights, they also bring up police reform\u2013\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yeah. ROBERT COSTA: \u2013 and they say two years after George Floyd was killed, you have Jayland Walker in Ohio\u2013\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yeah. ROBERT COSTA: \u201360 wounds from police officers\u2013\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: 60 gunshots. ROBERT COSTA: And- 60 gunshots\u2013 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yeah. ROBERT COSTA:\u00a0 Gun violence, still killing Black Americans from police officers. Polls, though, show that support for this administration among Black Americans has softened. How will you turn that around? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS:\u00a0 Well, first of all, Black Americans, Americans in general should be demanding and rightly, that we pass legislation that addresses these issues that you have mentioned. I was an author of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. I believe very strongly that we should have accountability in all systems, including in policing. ROBERT COSTA:\u00a0 But they're frustrated, police reform has stalled. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I believe that we need- you're right. I mean, but again, the- this is the- the- there is a cycle, there is a connection between what we are- what we want to have happen and the power of Congress to actually make it happen. When it comes to changing the laws, when it comes to writing and then putting, in effect, laws that create accountability and greater fairness in our system, be it our criminal justice system, be in our health care delivery system, all of that. But I will say this, what we have also seen is that, Black Americans and all Americans said, look at the United States Supreme Court, there is never in the history of that court been a Black woman to serve. There now is because people stood in line in 2020 for hours, demanding that of the things that they would stand in line to see happen. There would be a Ketanji Brown Jackson on the United States- Justice, excuse me, Ketanji Brown Jackson on the United States Supreme Court. They said, I want to see more support for some of our finest educational institutions that are called HBCUs, and MSIs. And so over $5 billion has gone into because they voted into supporting these institutions. People said, I want to see an extension of the child tax credit. Which we did and in the first year brought down Black child poverty and child poverty in general by about 40% in America. People said, I want to see that you're going to get lead out of pipes because it is causing irreparable damage and particularly to the children that are drinking water out of those pipes. So we are on track with the bipartisan infrastructure law to remove all lead from pipes and also from paint in the next ten years. People said, especially during the pandemic, it is- it is- there is extreme disparities in terms of how a child can be educated through something like a pandemic based on whether they have access and can afford high-speed Internet. We are now on track to ensure that all families in America will have access and it will be affordable to high-speed Internet. So, there are demands that were made by voters saying, these are the things we want out of this administration. And a lot of those demands have been met in the first year-and-a-half. There's still more work to do without any question. ROBERT COSTA:\u00a0 Up on Capitol Hill, there is speculation among some Democrats and some Republicans that President Biden won't run for re-election in 2024. What's your message- what's your message to those who say that? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Listen to President Biden. He intends to run. And if he does, I intend to run with him. (laughs) So there you go. ROBERT COSTA:\u00a0 Another run by former President Trump is possible. He is signaling that. Would that make it more likely that the president runs? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: He did it before. So I- you know, listen, honestly, right now, let's focus on what we got to deal with right now because I know that's how the President is focused. He's focused on doing everything that we've discussed, bringing down the cost of gas, dealing with- seeing through what we need to do around getting roads and bridges fixed in America, focusing on what we have continued to do under his leadership, which is to improve and strengthen the relationship the United States has around the world. You know, I've traveled the world as Vice President, where, you know, I've been to Europe now, I think at least three times in connection with a number of issues, including Ukraine, and these leaders, foreign leaders will come up to me and I think nearly three dozen meetings that I've had. And first thing they say is thank you and thank President Biden for what he has done to restore America's role of leadership and partnership on the globe. ROBERT COSTA: So, all signs point to yes? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: All signs point to good work having happened but more work to get done. ROBERT COSTA: Another issue is immigration. Texas Governor Greg Abbott this week authorized state officials there to arrest migrants and take them to federal border crossing facilities. And he's blamed the administration for the immigration issue in his state. He's called it a, quote, \"invasion.\" What will the administration do about Governor Abbott's decision in the migrant issue? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I would suggest that so called leaders focus on solutions instead of attacks if they really are concerned about a problem, and that includes on the issue of immigration, passing a pathway for citizenship, fixing what, in particular under the prior administration, was a badly broken system. So that we can have a humane and appropriate approach to this issue, including of course, what we will continue to do in terms of prioritizing border security, but understanding we also need to create a pathway. And, and that's where I think everyone should be focused if they're actually concerned about solutions instead of flame throwing. ROBERT COSTA: Vice President Harris, thank you very much for taking the time.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: You're welcome. Thank you. It's good to be with you, Bob.\u00a0 ROBERT COSTA: Good to be with you.",

            "article_content": "President Biden is looking at different options to forgive an unspecified but substantial amount of federal student loan debt \u2014 a move that would thrill some of his most loyal supporters and financially strapped students nationwide, but is a departure from campaign pledges to provide limited relief. The president shared his plans during a 90-minute White House meeting Monday with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, participants in the exchange tell CBS News. The move could affect more than 43 million borrowers who hold more than $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt, the second-largest debt held by Americans, behind mortgages. Rep. Tony Cardenas, Democrat of California, who attended the meeting, said the president is open to forgiving debt for college students regardless of whether they attended a public or private institution.\u00a0 \"The president never mentioned an amount nor did the president say that he was going to wipe out all student debt,\" Cardenas said. \"He did a dialogue with us about the differential between young people who went to public schools or private schools and we CHC members said he should focus on both. And he said, 'Okay, good to know.'\" Cardenas said he reiterated to Mr. Biden that the Hispanic Caucus supports executive action that would forgive at least $10,000 in college debt if Congress can't pass legislation doing so. In response, Cardenas said the president \"smiled and said, 'You're going to like what I do on that, I'm looking to do something on that and I think you're going to like what I do.'\" \"We're looking at it from a vantage point of if they needed help getting through college and they took on debt, it shouldn't matter,\" Cardenas added.\u00a0 Earlier this month, the White House said it is extending a pandemic-era pause on federal student loan payments through August 31, a move that has helped roughly 41 million borrowers save $5 billion in interest payments a month, according to the Education Department. \u00a0 At the White House press briefing on Monday, press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated that the administration would make a decision about canceling some student loan debt between now and the end of August or the pause would be extended further. The president has said in the past he supports canceling up to $10,000 in student loan debt. Psaki said she did not have anything to preview on the issue or how canceling student loan debt would work.\u00a0 Shortly after Psaki's briefing and just down the hall in the West Wing, the subject of student loans came up in the president's meeting with Latino lawmakers, an exchange that also included detailed conversation about immigration policy, environmental justice and the forthcoming midterm elections, according to lawmakers in attendance. \u00a0 When Hispanic Caucus members mentioned student loans, the president said he's asked aides to explore his options \u2014 a signal to lawmakers that he may be willing to go farther than he pledged during the campaign.\u00a0 \"They're looking at different options on what they can do. On forgiving it entirely. That was our request,\" said one of the lawmakers in attendance, who asked for anonymity to speak frankly about the meeting.\u00a0 It was not immediately clear how soon the president might act, but the August 31 deadline, set just as early voting will be starting in several states ahead of the midterms, is seen by many Democrats as a natural point at which to make such an announcement.\u00a0 \"As far as the president going out and talking about student loan cancellation with different groups, I do think that's a very good sign,\" said Cody Hounanian, executive director of the Student Debt Crisis Center. \"I think the president is starting to recognize that student debt cancellation is very popular. It's very popular with specific groups of voters that the president needs to win for this upcoming election, and the fact that he's using debt cancellation as a tool from which to talk to these communities, to me that's a little bit of a change.\" Hounanian did note that the White House has said it has been examining student loan debt cancellation for some time. The ongoing public message that the administration is looking into it while continuing to extend the payment pause has been confusing to borrowers, he said. Officials in the Biden administration have been examining whether the president has the authority through executive action to forgive federal student loan debt since the president took office more than a year ago. \"What this argument all boils down to is, does Biden \u2014 or any president, for that matter, under the law \u2014 will he be violating federal statute by doing broad student loan forgiveness other than what he's been doing under existing programs?\" said Betsy Mayotte, of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors. \"There are some people that say that he does have that authority under the law to do it, and there are some people that say that other than for a small portion of Perkins loans, he does not.\" The Perkins program, which granted low-interest loans to low-income students, stopped making new loans in 2017. Canceling student loan debt would also depend on whether a group or individual challenges the action. Such a move could result in a messy legal battle that leaves borrowers in limbo for some time. It's why the White House and some student loan experts and officials have suggested that lawmakers should be the ones taking action, since legislation would not face the same legal challenges. But the narrowly divided Congress is unlikely able to pass a bill on this issue. \"Ultimately, it would be overturned through this approach,\" said student loan expert Mark Kantrowitz on canceling student loan debt through executive action. He argued the best path to forgive debt would be through the regulatory process, which he said is a slower process, but \"much more likely to survive legal challenges.\"\u00a0 During his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden said he supported the cancellation of $10,000 in student loan debt and congressional action. But some top Democrats have called for him to go further and use executive action to cancel $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower.\u00a0 \"President Obama did it, President Trump did it, and President Biden has now done it repeatedly. The power is clearly there,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\"\u00a0 In a\u00a0new analysis, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimated canceling $50,0000 in student loan debt would forgive the full balance for nearly 30 million federal student loan borrowers. The average forgiveness would be more than $23,800 per borrower. The move would cost about $904 billion. But some of that money, advocates point out, has already been out the door for decades. Advocates for canceling student loan debt have also argued it's a way to build racial equity. Studies show Black borrowers often have to take out larger amounts of student debt for higher education. After graduation, the average student debt held by Black borrowers is higher than the burden held by White and Brown borrowers, studies found. Race, as well as giving economic aid to younger, working-class Americans saddled by a debt load they might not have fully comprehended when they sought the loans, are the big reasons why members of the Hispanic Caucus continue pushing for loan relief.\u00a0 Ed O'Keefe is a senior White House and political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

Cuellar's home and campaign office were raided in January, but he denied any wrongdoing. \"The Justice Department has informed me that Congressman Cuellar is not a target of the investigation,\" Berman said in a statement to CBS News. \"He continues to cooperate fully in the investigation.\" The update was first reported by Fox News. Previously, a source familiar with the investigation told CBS News that the activity at Cuellar's home was part of an investigation relating to Azerbaijan and several U.S. businessmen. At the time of the raids, Cuellar's office said the congressman would \"fully cooperate in any investigation. He is committed to ensuring that justice and the law are upheld.\" It did not confirm an ongoing investigation by the FBI. Cuellar, a moderate Democrat, has represented the Rio Grande Valley's district since 2005. He is currently in a runoff election with his former intern, immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros. She previously challenged him in 2020 and lost by about four points. Cuellar won reelection that year by 18 points, but President Biden only won by 5 points, underscoring Democrats' problems along the border in Texas. Runoff elections in Texas will take place May 24.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION: Russia's assault on Ukraine grinds on into a second month, with no end in sight.  And will the January 6 Committee subpoena the wife of a Supreme Court justice?  The Russian military has leveled cities and killed thousands over the last few weeks, and now announces a new phase, a possible retreat from Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv, where its advances have stalled.  President Biden spent three days in Europe, rallying NATO, visiting troops and refugees, all while taking aim at Vladimir Putin.  (Begin VT)  JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power.  (End VT)  JOHN DICKERSON: The White House said President Biden was not announcing a new effort to remove Putin.  But, if that was muddled, the president was clear about one thing.  (Begin VT)  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Don't even think about moving on one single inch of NATO territory.  (End VT)  JOHN DICKERSON: We will get the latest reporting from the region. And we will get analysis from former CIA acting Director Michael Morell and our David Martin.  We will also get insight from the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch. And we will talk with Will Hurd, a former CIA officer who served in Congress for six years.  Then: New text messages reveal how the wife of a Supreme Court justice aggressively lobbied the Trump White House to overturn the 2020 election. We will talk to the reporters who broke the story, CBS News' Robert Costa and \"The Washington Post\"'s Bob Woodward.  And we will hear from Illinois Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a member of the committee investigating the January 6 assault on the capital.  It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION.  President Biden touched down early this morning from his trip through Europe, where he made the continued case to Western allies for assistance to Ukraine and sanctions against Russia.  Nevertheless, this morning, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy accused the west of lacking courage, making yet another exasperated plea for more fighter jets and tanks.  We want to begin in Lviv, Ukraine, where Russian rockets rained down yesterday, just a few hundred miles away from where President Biden was speaking in Poland.  CBS News foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tyab is there.  IMTIAZ TYAB: John, good morning, well, here in Lviv's historic city center.  And life really does seem to be returning back to normal. But life is anything but following those Russian strikes on a fuel depot just two miles from here. Now, almost immediately after the attack, we could see dark plumes of smoke rising into the sky and later learned at least five people were injured.  Now, Russia's Defense Ministry has confirmed it used long-range and cruise missiles in the assault, saying its target was a plant being used to repair anti-aircraft systems, radar stations and tanks.  Now, the missile strike comes less than a day after Russian generals said the Kremlin would be -- quote -- \"shifting focus\" from its ground offensive aimed at Kyiv to instead prioritizing what Moscow calls the liberation of the contested eastern Donbass region.  And while it doesn't yet look as if Vladimir Putin is changing his approach to the war on Ukraine, what's clear are the Kremlin's military miscalculations, as Ukrainian forces continue to fight back with an intensity few expected.  Now, here in Lviv, which has seen two other strikes nearby in as many weeks, it's been something of a sanctuary for the millions of Ukrainians fleeing violence.  And this Russian missile strike is causing serious concern that it could impact the humanitarian support that so many Ukrainians have received if Russia's attacks here in Lviv continue -- John.  JOHN DICKERSON: Imtiaz, thank you.  CBS News foreign correspondent Debora Patta is in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv with this report.  (Begin VT)  DEBORA PATTA (voice-over): What Russia lacks in apparent military strategy, it makes up for in boastful videos like this one, claiming to show off their cruise missiles heading to Zhytomyr, 100 miles west of Kyiv.  But for Ukrainians at the receiving end of this constant bombardment from the sky, it's hell on earth. The coastal city of Mariupol has been decimated, reduced to twisted skeletons of steel and the hollowed-out shells of apartment blocks.  Hasty burials of the dead provide fleeting dignity. The 100,000 people still trapped there have no electricity, very little food and spend their nights in icy basements.  Fleeing the city carries a deadly risk. Many cars come under fire.  Victoria Medinska (sp?) defied death, escaping with her family to the town of Brovary just outside the capital. All she has left of their life before the war are precious photos and videos stored on her phone.  VICTORIA MEDINSKA (Ukrainian Internally Displaced Person): The town is very destroyed, nothing, I think, nothing left.  DEBORA PATTA: Seven-year-old Masha (sp?) remembers everything.  Were you scared?  MASHA (7 Years Old): Mm-hmm.  DEBORA PATTA: I'm sorry.  And while Mariupol has borne the brunt of the Russian invasion, it's not safe anywhere. In the north ,residents in Kharkiv brace for the worst, sandbagging beloved monuments to protect against the bombing.  Ukrainians have put up a far tougher resistance than Russia expected, determined and defiant.  (End VT)  DEBORA PATTA: But Kharkiv has every reason to be worried. A nuclear research facility has come under fire. Ukraine's nuclear watchdog says the fighting makes it impossible to assess the damage -- John.  JOHN DICKERSON: Debora Patta for us in Kyiv, thank you.  For a detailed breakdown of where the fight in Ukraine stands at the moment and where it might go next, we'd like to welcome CBS News national security correspondent David Martin and Michael Morell, former acting and deputy director of the CIA and a national security contributor here at CBS.  Good morning to you both. Thank you for being here.  MICHAEL MORELL: Good morning.  JOHN DICKERSON: David, I want to start with you.  Where are we in this invasion at the end of this week?  DAVID MARTIN: Well, we have heard what the Russian Ministry of Defense have said about prioritizing Eastern Ukraine.  You have to consider the source there. They haven't been a stellar source of truth. But, on the ground, they are seeing some evidence that the units that -- the Russian units that were advancing on Kyiv have started to dig into defensive positions, basically hunker down against all these Ukrainian counterattacks.  And, at the same time, there's an increased level of bombing in Eastern Ukraine. Now, that does not mean that Vladimir Putin has given up on taking the capital of Kyiv. What I think it means is, they have got to find a battle plan that works.  JOHN DICKERSON: Right. Right.  DAVID MARTIN: Their original battle plan of advancing on these multiple fronts, north, east and south, just didn't work.  So maybe they're going to try one front at a time here. But, at the same time that they are supposedly prioritizing, they are also sending in reinforcements for the first time into Ukraine. And they are keeping up this bombardment of the cities.  Look, we began this war by overestimating the Russians. We shouldn't underestimate them now.  JOHN DICKERSON: Right.  Mike, pick up on that. Stalled, maybe just to reload?  MICHAEL MORELL: So, phase one, for me, was the blitzkrieg right to Kyiv and replacing the government with a puppet government, and Ukraine becomes a vassal state. The Russians lost phase one.  We are now in phase two, in my view. And phase two is digging in defensively, as David said, fortifying, so that you protect yourself from these Ukrainian attacks. They're actually laying -- the Russians are laying mines, which is a defensive maneuver.  And they want to be in these fortifications, so that they can lob their mortars and their rockets and their missiles at Ukrainian cities, in an attempt to break the Ukrainian will, so that I think they can continue to advance. That's what they're trying to do now.  And, as David said, don't underestimate them, right?  JOHN DICKERSON: Right.  David, is there any reassessment from the Pentagon or even the Russians that the Ukrainians have put up more of a fight than they suggested? As you mentioned, they're digging in because the Ukrainians have had these counteroffensives.  Is there any way that the NATO allies and others who are trying to help the Ukrainians can take advantage of this new position from the Russians?  DAVID MARTIN: Well, to begin with, I think everybody underestimated both the will and the skill of the Ukrainians.  They have taken these weapons, these anti-aircraft tank weapons, these aircraft weapons, and they are simply making better use of their systems than the Russians are making of theirs. They are outclassing them on the battlefield.  But there's a second war going on here, which is the attacks on the cities, what Mike mentioned about trying to break the will of the Ukrainian people. And it's really -- the outcome may well depend on which happens first, whether the Ukrainians force the Russians into a flat-out stall...  JOHN DICKERSON: Right.  DAVID MARTIN: .... on the battlefield, or whether these bombardments break the will of the Ukrainian people.  JOHN DICKERSON: So, Mike, what David's suggesting here is, it's Vladimir Putin's pain threshold. How high is that? Or is it the survival instinct of the Ukrainians?  So, what -- how long do you think this takes?  MICHAEL MORELL: So, we should not underestimate the willingness of Russia to accept pain, right? They have shown over their history that they are willing to accept a lot of pain to gain a victory, right?  The Second Chechen War, the combat phase lasted 10 months, and then the insurgency phase lasted eight years. In Syria, their attacks on cities in Syria took a long time. So they're willing to take the time here in a way that I don't think we understand in the West.  JOHN DICKERSON: So, if they're willing to take a long time, give me a sense of some of the pressures that puts on this coalition...  MICHAEL MORELL: Yes. Yes.  JOHN DICKERSON: ... that President Biden is trying put together.  MICHAEL MORELL: So, everybody's facing pressure, right?  So, Putin is facing the pressure of economic pain at home, long lines, empty shelves. It looks like 1980s again in Moscow. He's facing the pain of dead soldiers coming home. Russian mothers don't like that. So that's his pain.  The Ukrainian pain is the death and destruction of their country. The Western pain is the sanctions. They can't do business with Europe. I talk to a lot of companies, both U.S. companies and foreign companies. And their question to me is, when are we going to be able to get back to doing business here, right? So there's that pressure.  And then there's the pressure of the costs to consumers around the world in terms of wheat prices, in terms of energy prices, right? Everybody's facing pressure here.  JOHN DICKERSON: Which is why Biden's over there in Europe trying to keep things together.  David, President Zelenskyy has asked for NATO help, for help from anybody, planes, tanks. Is he going to get it?  DAVID MARTIN: Well, he is not going to get the planes in the short run.  JOHN DICKERSON: Right.  DAVID MARTIN: And that's a -- just basically a risk-reward calculation that NATO has made.  They just don't believe that 20 Polish MiGs in an uncertain state of repair are going to change the tide of battle, so why run the risk of escalating if it's not going to make a difference?  Right now, there are not dogfights going on over Ukraine. There are too many surface-to-air missiles for any plane to operate safely. The Russians aren't really coming into Ukrainian airspace. They're attacking with long- range air-launched cruise missiles from Russian territory and from Crimea.  So, the U.S., for now, is focused on these anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, plus finding some high-altitude anti-aircraft missiles, which the Ukrainians know how to operate. We could give them ours, but they don't know how to operate those.  JOHN DICKERSON: Mike, I want to ask you about President Biden's speech, in which he said that Vladimir Putin cannot remain in power.  He also framed this conflict as totalitarianism vs. freedom. What did you make of those two remarks?  MICHAEL MORELL: So, I think his comment that Putin had to go was an unforced error.  It makes it -- it strengthens Putin at home, makes it difficult for any domestic opposition to coalesce together. And no Russian citizen, none, wants to be told by the leader of Russia's main enemy about what their leadership can look like and not.  The broader framing, I worry about as well. I think we should frame this narrowly, Russia out of Ukraine, and impose so much pain on this man that he never thinks about doing this again. I think framing it as democracy vs. autocracy drives the Chinese closer to the Russians, and makes it difficult for some of our own allies who are autocrats to stand with us.  JOHN DICKERSON: All right, we're going to have to end it there.  Mike Morell, thanks so much. David Martin, thanks for being with us.  We will be back in a moment. Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  JOHN DICKERSON: We go now to Illinois Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. He's a member of the panel investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol. And he's in Houston this morning.  Congressman, welcome.  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER (R-Illinois): Thank you. Good to be with you.  JOHN DICKERSON: Let's start -- before we go to the January 6 Committee, let's start with Ukraine.  President Zelenskyy called for more planes and tanks from NATO, as you heard us just discuss. He said: \"I have talked to the defenders of Mariupol today. If only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to handle -- hand over dozens of jets and tanks had 1 percent of their courage.\"  You have advocated for a no-fly zone. What's your feeling about giving planes and tanks to the Ukrainians?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Look, I mean, I have talked to Ukrainian members of Parliament, those out advocating for what's needed on the ground as well.  And they say they need these. I mean, we can have the Pentagon all they want say, well, we don't think they have the pilots for the MiGs. They do. They have pilots trained and waiting. We can have the Pentagon say, well, we think this is escalatory.  Well, if you don't think Javelins that are killing thousands of Russian soldiers are escalatory, but then sending them an airplane, when, frankly, Ukraine has already flown some airplanes is the, like, escalatory thing, that's just wrong.  And I think it's sending the wrong message. We have to give them everything they need to win this war, because we've made it clear we're not going to intervene directly. And I don't think we should at this point.  JOHN DICKERSON: All right, we're going to move on, Congressman, to the January 6 Committee.  Bob Costa and Bob Woodward, who are both on with me a little bit later, reported on texts to the committee this -- that the committee has from the wife of Clarence Thomas.  And I just want to read little excerpts of them. They are to the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, urging efforts to overthrow the election.  Ms. Thomas wrote: \"Do not concede.\"  And then in another she wrote: \"The majority knows Biden and the left is attempting the greatest heist of our history.\"  Why are these significant?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, look, I can't, as a member of the committee, confirm, deny the existence of those.  I will tell you, though, we have thousands of text messages from lots of people. We have a lot of documents. And we are going to, in a methodical, fact-driven way, get to the answers here. We'll -- we'll call in whoever we need to call in.  I think the bottom line for the committee is this. Was there an effort to overturn the legitimate election of the United States? What was January 6 in relation to that? And what is the rot in our system that led to that? And does it still exist today?  You know, with conspiracy theories, as we've seen reported, this idea of releasing the Kraken, or that the CIA attacked the DOD or was attacked by the DOD in Germany, John, like, half of the country at one point believed some of that stuff.  And this is a road map for how to overturn a legitimately elected government. So, this is important. We're going to get to the bottom of this. And as we're seeing in Ukraine, people are willing to die for democracy. We at least have to be willing to put careers on the line for the same cause.  JOHN DICKERSON: So, no one's disputing the authenticity of these texts, which leads to the question, will the committee subpoena Mrs. Thomas and question her?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Look, I think, again, we want to make sure that this isn't driven -- even though it's in the political realm, it's not driven by a political motivation, it's driven by facts.  So, when it comes to any potential future calling in of Ms. Thomas, we'll - - we'll take a look at what the evidence is and we'll make a decision. And you all will know as soon as we do.  What I don't want to do is get into speculating too much, because I think it is important that we have answers for the American people in a factual way here.  JOHN DICKERSON: You talked about rot in the system. Does the rot reach the Supreme Court?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Look, again, I'm not going to say that.  I'm not going to say that it does or doesn't. We're just going to present the American people what the answer is. And the Supreme Court handles their own ethics. They handle their own internal stuff. But what we need to do is present to the American people where they've been lied to, where they've believed lies, where there are bad actors out there, for instance, that are sympathetic to Vladimir Putin.  That kind of stuff is very important so that, in five or 10 years when kids are reading in the history books about January 6, they're not buying into any of these conspiracies. They're getting the truth.  JOHN DICKERSON: What is wrong with -- you said the Supreme Court has its own ethics, so we'll let them handle that.  Why can't a private citizen send texts, as zany as they may be, to the White House chief of staff? What's -- what's wrong with that?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, again, we're in a position where we're not confirming or denying what's been reported by Costa and Woodward.  But if they're -- you know, look, in any case, if a -- if a private citizen has a conversation, of course, we have a freedom of speech in this country. The question what -- for the committee is, this or any exchange, was there a conspiracy or an attempt to come up with a reason, or how close did we get to overturning an election?  Look, we are not, as the committee, out to throw people in jail. We can have criminal referrals, like we do against Mark Meadows because he has denied legitimate requests from Congress to come in repeatedly. So that's in DOJ. Our job is just to get answers to the American people, and then they can decide.  JOHN DICKERSON: Before -- these texts drop off. They go away in December and January.  Given the passion with which Mrs. Thomas was texting, do you -- are you confident that Meadows has handed over all of his texts?  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: I'm not confident that Meadow's handed over everything at all. I mean, he was cooperating with us for a little bit, and then, in an attempt to make Donald Trump happy, he stopped cooperating.  We gave him plenty of space to come back to resume that. He has not. And, in fact, he's waived executive privilege a thousand times by presenting us what he already has. So, no, I'm not convinced he's handed over everything to us. And that's why it's in the DOJ's hands now whether to prosecute him for contempt.  He has contempt not just for Congress, for his old institution of Congress, and thereby for the American people. I hope DOJ does the right thing, and I hope we get all the information that the -- not -- it's not Congress -- that the American people deserve, John. The American people deserve these answers.  JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Congressman Kinzinger, thank you so much for being with us. We'll see you again.  And we'll be right back with a lot more on FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  JOHN DICKERSON: Senators are usually grouped into two categories, workhorses, who make progress, but not headlines, and show horses, who perform more than produce.  During the confirmation hearing of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, Senator Ben Sasse introduced a third equine category.  (Begin VT)  SENATOR BEN SASSE (R-Nebraska): I think we should recognize that the jackassery we often see around here is partly because of people mugging for short-term camera opportunities.  (End VT)  JOHN DICKERSON: But what kind of behavior fits this category? Is it questioning about an important issue?  (Begin VT)  SENATOR JOHN CORNYN (R-Texas): Do you agree with me that it's important to accommodate the sincerely held religious beliefs of all Americans?  (End VT)  JOHN DICKERSON: Is it concern about the judge's record?  (Begin VT)  SENATOR THOM TILLIS (R-North Carolina): There's at least a level of empathy that enters in to your treatment of a defendant that some could view as beyond what some of us would be comfortable with.  (End VT)  JOHN DICKERSON: Is it interrupting?  (Begin VT)  SENATOR JOSH HAWLEY (R-Missouri): So, you're not going to answer my question?  JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON (Supreme Court Justice Nominee): No, I have answered your question. And my answer is, I have explained...  HAWLEY: You haven't answered my question. I'm sitting here asking you, and you're declining to answer.  JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON: In that chart...  SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): OK, Judge, you said that before.  (End VT)  JOHN DICKERSON: Is it suggesting the witness is a liar?  (Begin VT)  SENATOR TOM COTTON (R-Arkansas): Do you really expect this committee believe that you don't remember what happened in this Hawkins case when it came back before you?  JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON: Yes, Senator, I do expect you to believe. That's my testimony.  SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I don't find it credible, Judge.  (End VT)  JOHN DICKERSON: Is it making things up?  (Begin VT)  SENATOR MARSHA BLACKBURN (R-Tennessee): What's your hidden agenda? Is it to let violent criminals, cop killers and child predators back to the streets?  (End VT)  JOHN DICKERSON: The category is loosely defined as one in which the senator is rude or acts in bad faith to promote themselves or make a political point, instead of honestly examining a judge's qualifications for the bench.  For some, the entire hearing would fit in this category.  Senator Cory Booker grew so exasperated, he tried to summon what had gotten lost in the questioning, that Jackson, whom the Senate had confirmed three times for previous jobs and whose character witnesses included prominent Republican judges, was the first black woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court.  (Begin VT)  SENATOR CORY BOOKER (D-New Jersey): You did not get there because of some left-wing agenda. You didn't get here because of some dark money groups.  You got here how every black woman in America who's gotten anywhere has done, by being like Ginger Rogers said: I did everything Fred Astaire did, but backwards in heels.  (End VT)  JOHN DICKERSON: Senator Booker did not break the fever.  The condition Senator Sasse identified will continue to flower, a new term defined in the end the same way Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart famously defined pornography: You know it when you see it.  And we will be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  JOHN DICKERSON: We will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.  Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.  We are joined now by \"Washington Post\" associate editor Bob Woodward, and CBS chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa. These are the reporters responsible for that scoop about Clarence Thomas' wife's efforts to overturn the 2020 elections.  Good morning to both of you.  BOB WOODWARD (Associate Editor, The Washington Post): Thank you.  ROBERT COSTA: Good morning.  JOHN DICKERSON: Glad to have you here.  Bob Woodward, I'll start with you.  Congressman Kinzinger was not forthcoming. He barely admitted that these exist. Why are these texts so important?  BOB WOODWARD: Well, because they come after the election is over. And the general rule in things like the Constitution and the law say there's going to be one thing that happens after the election is over, and that is the certification before Congress when the vice president, the president of the Senate, presides.  And so this is -- I'm sorry to go back to this. We were talking earlier about Watergate. But Watergate was about tampering with the electoral process at the front. Nixon and his underlings mounted a massive sabotage and espionage campaign against the Democrats.  But this is after the election. And people who believe in the Constitution and the law would say, OK, it's over. You can go to court, but you read when -- Robert and I were reading these texts at the beginning. It was almost unbelievable that you would have somebody in Ginni Thomas' position say -- quote others saying, in war, you know, there is no rule. There are no rule -- that this is warfare. Well, it shouldn't be.  JOHN DICKERSON: And, Bob Costa, this brings in another branch of government into this -- tangentially. I mean she's married to a Supreme Court justice. So, that's part of -- that's -- that's the other element of this as well.  ROBERT COSTA: What Bob Woodward and I have found is this campaign, spearheaded by then President Trump, that played out in the post-election period across all three branches of government in at least tangential ways. You had Congress working with President Trump to try to block the certification of president -- that President-elect Biden at the time. You had the president pressuring state lawmakers. You had the spouse of a Supreme Court justice communicating with the White House chief of staff. And you had the executive branch doing everything possible to have a legal challenge that would maybe go all the way, as Trump said, to the Supreme Court.  This was Trump pulling every lever of power. And one of those levers, it appears to be, which his own chief of staff at least communicating on legal strategy with the spouse of a justice.  JOHN DICKERSON: I want to stay on the Supreme Court issue with you, Bob.  One of your books is about the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts is very concerned about judicial independence. He wrote at the end of last year in his letter from the chief justice, the judiciary's power to manager its internal affairs insulates the courts from inappropriate, political influence and is crucial to preserving public trust.  The idea that if the court is seen as political, its rulings won't have the weight in American life that it should.  BOB WOODWARD: Well, he really has grounds for being worried. Now, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, six months ago, went to the McConnell Center in Kentucky, which is the center Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans, set up, and she made a remarkable speech. She said, I want to prove to you that we are not a bunch of partisan hacks in the Supreme Court. And she said justices -- all justices must be hyper vigilant to make sure they're not letting personal biases creep into their decision since justices and judges are people, too.  So, she made it very clear that this hypervigilance should be the condition in which justices operate. We now have a situation where the wife of a justice has gone on a crusade and has said, this is warfare, do not concede. The White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, himself said, this fight is good versus evil.  JOHN DICKERSON: Yes. And you have an instance where the Supreme Court justice was overseeing cases related to January 6th, in May (ph) again and didn't -- and didn't recuse himself.  Bob Costa, I want to get your sense of these texts. Do they give us a flavor for the kinds of things the committee has? What does this tell us about the work of the January 6th committee in terms of putting together this picture of what President Trump was doing and what those acting in his name were trying to do to overturn the election?  ROBERT COSTA: John, your interview with Congressman Kinzinger referenced how they have Mark Meadows' text messages to a point. And they are frustrated that for at least the Thomas exchanges, based on our reporting they do end in late November. And where are the text messages, if any, from December, or around January 6th?  But, at the same time, it's important to note that based on our reporting that the Meadows' text messages do provide, to a point, a roadmap of sorts of some of the things that were being done by the White House chief of staff, then President Trump during this post-election period.  They've also done hundreds of interviews. They have thousands of pages of documents from different people who are cooperating with the committee, but they still feel in many ways they do not have enough. Steven Bannon has refused to cooperate. Mark Meadows has now refused to cooperate. So the question facing that -- Congressman Kinzinger and others is, where is the John Dean who's going to put the hand in the air and start outlining all of these different facets?  JOHN DICKERSON: Do you think there's any John Dean around, Bob?  BOB WOODWARD: There are always surprises, as we find in this.  And, remember, the January 6th committee, in a filing in California, has said they have a good-faith conclusion that Trump and people around him engaged in a full-fledged criminal conspiracy to overturn the election. They rule this as criminal. And if you go back a hundred years to the Supreme Court, it was Chief Justice Taft, of all people, saying this -- we're not going to let people meddle with things like the certification on January 6th, which is in the law.  So much is hinging on the committee's efforts. I think Robert and I found they're really working hard. They're talking to people that there is an aggressiveness and a sense of expanding the universe of likely witnesses.  JOHN DICKERSON: Last 30 seconds.  ROBERT COSTA: The real test is going to be, will they ask Ginni Thomas to appear first voluntarily. If they don't ask her to appear voluntarily, are they going to the full extent they can to find the truth? Or will they issue a subpoena?  The challenges here is like any investigation, things go in different directions. Will you pursue all leads or not?  JOHN DICKERSON: And Ginni Thomas, it's not just about what she may have said, but what she was on the listening end of. I mean she has material that she can provide about what Mark Meadows was saying and others she was talking to.  ROBERT COSTA: We just don't have the full picture at this point about her relationship with Justice Thomas and his knowledge of her exchanges with the chief of staff.  JOHN DICKERSON: Well, we have a little bit more of the picture because of the two of you. So, thanks so much to both of you for being here.  And we'll be back in a moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  JOHN DICKERSON: We're joined now by Will Hurd. He's a former Republican congressman from Texas, a former CIA officer, and now the author of \"American Reboot.\"  Congressman, welcome.  WILL HURD (Former Congressman, R-Texas): Hey, it's a pleasure to be on.  JOHN DICKERSON: The book begins with a very exciting -- I won't spoil it -- but moment in your CIA career, so I want to use that intelligence to talk about intelligence.  What does your intelligence background tell you about what's happening in Ukraine right now?  WILL HURD: Look, right now, it tells me that -- something I learned in those -- almost decade as an undercover officer where I was responsible for recruiting spies and stealing secrets, when it comes to our foreign policy, we want our friends to love us and our adversaries to fear us.  And when you use that as a metric on looking at what's happening in Ukraine, our allies, President Zelenskyy, is asking us to do more. Our adversaries, our enemies, Vladimir Putin, is launching cruise missiles into the western part of the Ukraine because he's not afraid that we're going to respond. We need to be doing more. And I think that -- because we can help prevent an incredible loss of life.  JOHN DICKERSON: Quickly, doing more meaning what?  WILL HURD: Look, I think we should be giving them as much weaponry as we can. What -- what -- we don't know -- in the earlier segment you talked about, is 20 MiGs going to be enough to do anything? Well, and everybody underestimated the Ukrainians before this happened. Who knows what they're going to be able to do with those kinds of tools? And we have to be prepared to help them prevent significant loss of life.  JOHN DICKERSON: And the other piece of your expertise I want to tap is cyber. You write about it in the book. President Biden, this week, said to American business leaders, be careful, harden your targets more than you already have been.  What could the Russians do?  WILL HURD: Look, the Russians can do a lot of things. They could impact water treatment plants. We've already seen that happen in the United States last summer. They could try to impact our grid. We saw in my home state of Texas, the grid -- you know, it was because -- the grid went down or almost went down because of -- because of weather issues, but you can mimic that similar kind of attack through a digital attack.  And so the world is incredibly interconnected in increasing things, like artificial intelligence is going to be the future of cyber security, where you're going to have bad AI versus good AI. And this is moving at a -- at a -- at a significant speed.  JOHN DICKERSON: Why hasn't the Russian cyber attack happened the way people expect it?  WILL HURD: I think the Russians are not 10 feet tall. I think that's one of the things that we learn from this. They -- they thought that this campaign and this invasion of Ukraine would be going differently. The fact that the S.F.B., which is possible for a lot of their cyber activities, they're rounding some of them up and using them as scapegoats, as why the attacks are going so poorly. So I think they've been consumed and they haven't been able to get to it.  JOHN DICKERSON: All right, let's turn the wheel now and talk about your book.  One of the arguments you make in your book is that the Republican Party needs to reach out to those portions of the electorate that haven't traditionally been Republicans. So with that in mind, as you watched the confirmation hearings of Judge Jackson this week, how do you think the Republican Party fared with its representatives questioning her towards the larger purpose of your book?  WILL HURD: Well, look, I think what's -- what's -- what's -- what's crazy here, this is a seminal moment, all right. And, yes, I disagree with the judge's judicial philosophy, but she's obviously qualified. And the fact that she is, I think, the second most popular justice ever nominated to the bench, that should be -- that should be the story, all right, when it -- when it comes to this.  Of course, a handful of senators acted like jokers in their -- in their -- in their testimony and in their asking questions, similar to other senators have done in -- in other nominations for Supreme Court justices.  But my point in the book is that the Republican Party needs to start looking like America, because we have a real opportunity. The Republicans are going to take back the House in 2022. And we're primarily going to take back the House because of the incompetence of the Democratic Party. Imagine that instead of voting because voters think the other guys are so bad, that they're voting for us because they believe in our ideas. We're going to see some of that happen in my home state in south Texas, where you're going to see Latinos vote for Republicans in probably record numbers.  JOHN DICKERSON: So I want to press on that theory. You're argument is essentially the Republican Party has to catch up with where America is going, a constituency different than the one that they support. And you refer back to the Republican autopsy after the 2012 loss.  Donald -- and in that autopsy they said, Republicans have to embrace comprehensive immigration reform, stop sending the message that we only care essentially about white voters. Donald Trump heard that and said, nuts. I'm going to run the opposite. And he won.  And now, as you say, Republicans are ready to perhaps take over the House and the Senate. That seems like a pretty strong argument against essentially your argument.  WILL HURD: Sure. Well -- well, Donald Trump did win, but then he also lost. He lost the House. He lost the Senate, right? And so there -- there was -- there was -- there -- and then -- and then, if we look at 2020, Joe Biden won and he had absolutely no coat tails because the public said, hey, we don't like some of these things the Democratic Party is going through.  So, yes, a good chunk of the Republican Party is still, you know, blindly loyal to President Trump, but it's not the super majority. And this is the opportunity that we have. And this is where we need to be thinking about this in 2022, and the opportunities that we have in order to -- in order to grow and improve our electoral successes.  JOHN DICKERSON: There is a question about the power that Donald Trump has in the party. You say the first thing that Republicans have to do is admit that the 2020 election was legitimately decided in favor of Joe Biden. That's not the majority position according to polls among Republicans.  WILL HURD: Sure. But when I crisscross the country now in promoting the book, \"American Reboot,\" one of the things that I want -- people say, yes, let's get -- let's get beyond that. Let's -- let's move on. Joe Biden is the president, right? Let's start talking about the next thing.  So, for me, look, I'm talking about where we should be going. We are at a moment where 72 percent of Americans think the country is on the wrong track. And this is not new. This has been going on for some time. And what I'm trying to say is, we don't have to accept the current trajectory. There's different ways of doing things. And I tried to use my time from when I was in the CIA, in business, and in Congress, to outline a different strategy.  JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Congressman Hurd, thank you so much for being with us.  WILL HURD: Thank you.  JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be back in a moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  JOHN DICKERSON: We want to turn back now to the war in Ukraine and welcome the former U.S. ambassador to that country, Marie Yovanovitch. She is the author of a new Memoir, \"Lessons From the Edge.\"  Good morning, Ambassador.  MARIE YOVANOVITCH (Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine): Good morning.  JOHN DICKERSON: President Biden, three days in Europe, Brussels, and then went to Poland. What did you make of that visit?  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: I thought it was a hugely important trip where the president was able to demonstrate not only American leadership but western unity in this hugely important challenge that Russia has inflicted on Ukraine, but more broadly on the west.  JOHN DICKERSON: He talked about unity. How fragile is that unity because it seems like everybody is saying all the right things? How fragile -- is it so fragile the president must go and make a visit to keep it together?  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: I think one month in there was a symbolic effect, but there were also a lot of accomplishments that were cited during the various summits. So this was NATO, but it was also the European Union, it was the G-7. There were -- and then, obviously, the trip to Poland where he met with President Duda, as well as Ukrainian refugees, as well as the 82nd Airborne. And, of course, importantly, the Ukrainian defense and foreign ministers.  So, I think a lot was accomplished there and a lot of announcements were made. You know, more -- more humanitarian assistance, the 100,000 slots for refugees, more military groups going out to Europe, and the list goes on.  JOHN DICKERSON: The 100,000 refugees that Biden said the -- that American would take, how important is that in talking to Europeans who are the one - - I mean Poland is taking the brunt of the refugees -- how important is that in terms of showing that America is pulling its eight for lack of a better term?  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: Yes, shouldering the burden and being supportive.  I think it's important, but I -- honestly, my own opinion is that it's just a start because when you've got up to 10 million -- perhaps the numbers are even higher this morning, 10 million displaced people in -- out of -- our of Ukraine, about 3.5 million in Europe, 100,000 doesn't begin to, you know, really start to approach the kind of figures that we're probably going to need to show.  That said, though, many Ukrainian people aren't looking to come to the U.S. or even to western Europe. They want to stay close because they want to go back and rebuild. I mean it's really inspiring.  JOHN DICKERSON: You have contacts there.  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: I do.  JOHN DICKERSON: You lived there. Tell me what you're hearing from within Ukraine.  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: Well, they're -- you know, they're kind of encouraging me, you know, when I express concerns and worry. They're saying, don't worry, we've got this. We are going to -- we are going to keep on fighting. And they are. And they're asking for our help. And so, just recently, I got an e-mail from one of my former bodyguards who wanted -- he said, you know, Madam Ambassador, you know I would never ask for myself, but I really -- I need equipment for my team. I need, you know, medical kits. I need body armor. I need boots. And so I tried to hook him up with some people who could provide that.  JOHN DICKERSON: How do they read the statements by President Biden and other Americans who say, we're with you, we're with you, we're with you, except to the border?  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: Yes. Well, you can imagine that on the one hand perhaps at a very high level they understand that we have Article Five responsibilities under the NATO treaty. But, on the other hand, they wish that we would do more.  I think we are doing a lot, but I think we need to keep on back-filling when it comes to security assistance because the Ukrainians are using everything that we and other countries are providing, but we need to keep on backfilling it because it's being used.  JOHN DICKERSON: As a career diplomat, how do you read -- and your expertise is not just Ukraine but Russia as well -- how do you read this Donbas move from the Russians, the idea that the public statement is they're going to focus on Donbas.  Does that have an effect in terms of diplomacy. In other words, could some countries say, OK, well, it's not pretty, but we'll give them Donbas just so we can be done with this war.  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: Yes, I think -- so, perhaps, but I think that what we've learned over the last month and a half, or several months, if not the last 20 years, is that we can't always trust what the Russians are saying. So, they made that statement, and then a day or so later they attacked Lviv, in the west -- far west of Ukraine, very far away from the Donbas.  JOHN DICKERSON: Right.  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: So I think we need to wait and see.  JOHN DICKERSON: There is an incredibly prescient moment in your book when you talk about U.S. not really reading Vladimir Putin right. And you predict, this is before any of this happened, quote, we will someday, maybe soon, find ourselves in a serious confrontation, in a context not of our choosing and not to our advantage.  So, building on that platform, how is the interpretation -- the west's interpretation or America's interpretation of Putin -- how -- are we getting him right at this moment and how should we think about the way he sees things?  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: Yes. You know, that is the question at the moment, isn't it? And I think it's hard to know. It was always hard to know. But especially now after COVID and the isolation that he finds himself in, with just a very small group of advisors, people who have been with him, you know, since KGB, you know, Saint Petersburg days. And there's just not -- not a lot we know about what kind of advice he's getting or what he knows.  But I do think that Putin is a man who only understands strength. And so when -- you know, right now the Biden administration is trying to navigate this very narrow lane of supporting Ukraine on the one hand, standing up for our values and our interests, but also doing the utmost not to expand the war.  And when we look at that as a positive thing, that this is restrained and positive, I think sometimes perhaps Vladimir Putin looks at it as a sign of weakness.  And so, again, this is a very difficult lane to navigate. And right now I think the Biden administration's doing a pretty good job of it. But, obviously, it requires constant calibration and re-calibration in terms of what's going on, on the ground.  JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get to something you wrote about in your book. You talked about chauvinism at the State Department, how there were no female role models. This week Madeleine Albright, the first female secretary of state, died. You served under her.  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: Yes.  JOHN DICKERSON: Tell me about that experience and how important it was to have a woman in that role.  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: Well, she -- you know, she broke that glass ceiling. And once you have one, you're going to have another one. And she was a role model, I think, for many of us. I was very junior when she was secretary of state. But she was a pioneer as the first woman secretary of state. She was -- as an immigrant to this country from, in fact, I think a refugee from eastern Europe, war-torn eastern Europe, she was a strong voice for democracy and human rights and for Ukraine. And so I got to know her just a little bit, it was a privilege, when she visited Ukraine while I was there as ambassador. And she, you know, very kindly took time out to speak with me and provide advice and encouragement.  JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Marie Yovanovitch. Ambassador, thank you so much for being with us.  MARIE YOVANOVITCH: Thank you.  JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  JOHN DICKERSON: And that's it for us today. Thanks for watching.

            "article_content": "Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul defied leaders of both parties Thursday and delayed until next week Senate approval of an additional $40 billion to help Ukraine and its allies withstand Russia's three-month old invasion. With the Senate poised to debate and vote on the package of military and economic aid, Paul denied leaders the unanimous agreement they needed to proceed. The bipartisan measure, backed by President Joe Biden, underscores U.S. determination to reinforce its support for Ukraine's outnumbered forces. The legislation has been approved overwhelmingly by the House and has strong bipartisan support in the Senate. Final passage is not in doubt. Even so, Paul's objection was a departure from the overwhelming sentiment in Congress in favor of quickly helping Ukraine, as it fights to withstand Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion and tries to discourage him from escalating the war. It was also a rebellion against his fellow Kentucky Republican, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who on Thursday had called on \"both sides\" to \"help us pass this urgent funding bill today.\"\u00a0 Paul, a libertarian who often opposes U.S. intervention abroad, said he wanted language inserted into the bill, without a vote, that would have an inspector general scrutinize the new spending. He has a long history of demanding last-minute changes by holding up or threatening to delay bills on the brink of passage, including measures dealing with lynching, sanctioning Russia, preventing a federal shutdown, the defense budget, government surveillance and providing health care to the Sept. 11 attack first responders. Democrats and McConnell opposed Paul's push and offered to have a vote on his language. Paul was likely to lose that vote and rejected the offer. White House press secretary Jen Psaki was asked by CBS News' Ed O'Keefe about Paul's insistence on the inclusion of an inspector general \u2014 and whether the Biden administration would establish some kind of watchdog entity to track the spending.\u00a0 \"I would say that we agree oversight is critical,\" Psaki replied. \"That's why the package already includes millions of dollars to support additional oversight measures, including additional funding for existing inspectors general and we encourage all senators to promptly pass the bill as it stands, we feel what's in there sufficient.\" Paul, who unsuccessfully sought his party's 2016 presidential nomination, argued that the added spending was more than the U.S. spends on many domestic programs, was comparable to Russia's entire defense budget and would deepen federal deficits and worsen inflation. Last year's budget deficit was almost $2.8 trillion but is likely headed downward, and the bill's spending is less than 0.2% of the size of the U.S. economy, suggesting its impact on inflation would be negligible. \"No matter how sympathetic the cause, my oath of office is to the national security of the United States of America,\" Paul said. \"We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the U.S. economy.\" Democrats said they were objecting to Paul's plan because it would expand the powers of an existing inspector general whose current purview is limited to Afghanistan. That would deny Mr. Biden the chance past presidents have had to make an appointment to the post, they said. \"It's clear from the junior senator from Kentucky's remarks, he doesn't want to aid Ukraine,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. \"All he will accomplish with his actions here today is to delay that aid, not to stop it.\" Schumer and McConnell stood nearly side-by-side as they tried pushing the legislation forward. \"They're only asking for the resources they need to defend themselves against this deranged invasion,\" McConnell said of the Ukrainians. \"And they need this help right now.\" The House voted 368-57 on Tuesday to approve the measure. All Democrats and most Republicans backed it, though every \"no\" vote came from the GOP. The bipartisan backing for Ukraine has been partly driven by accounts of Russian atrocities against Ukrainian civilians that have been impossible to ignore. It also reflects strategic concerns about letting Putin seize European territory unanswered as his assault on his neighbor to the west grinds into its 12th week. \"Helping Ukraine is not an instance of mere philanthropy,\" McConnell said. \"It bears directly on America's national security and vital interests that Russia's naked aggression not succeed and carries significant costs.\" Biden administration officials have said they expect the latest aid measure to last through September. But with Ukraine taking heavy military and civilian losses and no sense of when the fighting might end, Congress will ultimately face decisions about how much more aid to provide at a time of huge U.S. budget deficits and a risk of recession that could demand added spending at home. The latest bill, when added to the $13.6 billion Congress approved in March, would push American aid to the region well above $50 billion. For perspective, that would total $6 billion more than the U.S. spent on military and economic aid around the world in 2019, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Paul pointed out that if the Senate approves the spending, the U.S. will have authorized $60 billion in total spending for Ukraine. \"Kyiv would become the largest yearly recipient of U.S. military aid over the past two decades,\" Paul said. He added, \"It is more than any other country spends on their entire military expenditures...our total aid to Ukraine will almost equal the entire military budget of Russia.\"\u00a0 The push toward passage came as Russia continued blasting Ukrainian forces and cities in southern and eastern portions of the country. Reflecting international concerns prompted by the assault, Finland's leaders announced their support for joining NATO and Sweden seemed not far behind. Mr. Biden asked Congress for $33 billion two weeks ago. It didn't take lawmakers long to add $3.4 billion to his requests for both military and humanitarian programs. The measure includes $6 billion for Ukraine for intelligence, equipment and training for its forces, plus $4 billion in financing to help Kyiv and NATO allies build up their militaries. There's $8.7 billion for the Pentagon to rebuild stocks of weapons it has shipped to Ukraine and $3.9 billion for U.S. troops in the region. The measure also includes $8.8 billion to keep the Kyiv government functioning, more than $5 billion to provide food to countries around the world that rely on Ukrainian crops devastated by the fighting and $900 million to teach English and provide other services to Ukrainian refugees who have moved to the United States. The biggest hurdle to rapid approval of the assistance was cleared this week when Biden and Democrats dropped their demand to include billions more in the measure to bolster U.S. efforts to counter the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans want separate COVID-19 legislation to be a battleground for an election-season fight over immigration that divides Democrats. Alan He contributed to this report.",

And today on Face the Nation: a powerful show of support for Ukraine from top congressional Democrats, as the Biden administration pushes for tens of billions more in aid for that war-torn country. We will have the latest on the military maneuvers and diplomatic efforts in the war that's now entering its 10th week. The head of U.S. Agency for International Development Samantha Power and Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine will both be here. Then: The committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol is preparing for what they hope to be critical public hearings next month. We will hear from Illinois Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger about what to expect. And, finally, a vaccine for the very youngest may be just weeks away. We will talk with Dr. Paul Burton, the chief medical officer at Moderna. Plus, we will check in with Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator under President Trump. Her new book is entitled \"Silent Invasion.\" It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We awoke this morning to a stunning sight, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi being greeted by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the streets of Kyiv. She and six other Democrats made a surprise visit to the region to show support and discuss the president's proposed additional $33 billion U.S. aid package to Ukraine. (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D-California): We are here to say to you that we are with you until this fight is over. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (Ukrainian President): We will win, and we will win together. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we begin today with CBS News foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata, who has the latest from Eastern Ukraine. CHARLIE D'AGATA: Good morning, Margaret. This is what's left of an industrial site destroyed by the Russians after learning it was being used as a base by Ukrainian forces. It's just an example of the onslaught facing Ukrainians along the front line. (Begin VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice-over): From beneath the smoldering ruins of the steel plant in Mariupol, a hint of hope. Ukrainian fighters said around 20 women and children made it out, of the hundreds of civilians who've been trapped for months. Along the front lines in the east, the fight for the Donbass region has become a battle of artillery and attrition. Russian forces have greater numbers and a longer reach. Places like Popasna have been flattened. The town of Lyman is expected to be among the next to fall. Volunteers shuttled a few remaining residents in a minibus. Alina described the shelling is constant, day and night. Her 87-year-old mother, Lydia, escaped with little more than her wheelchair and her cat, Dasha. Right after we left town, a Russian airstrike destroyed that railway bridge leading out of town. It's part of a wider campaign for Russians trying to stop U.S. and Western weapons from reaching Ukrainian forces fighting on these front lines. And everywhere we have gone, we have found freshly dug defensive positions, fallbacks for retreating Ukrainian forces. It's where we found volunteer Joshua Cropper, an Iraq War Marine veteran from Wasilla, Alaska. JOSHUA CROPPER (U.S. Marine Veteran): It's nothing that I have experienced before. It's a different type of war. CHARLIE D'AGATA: What is it like fighting beside these Ukrainian forces? JOSHUA CROPPER: I wish that they had more NATO experience, more NATO training, but... CHARLIE D'AGATA: More NATO weapons? JOSHUA CROPPER: More NATO weapons. But their heart is in the right place and their conviction is in the right place. CHARLIE D'AGATA: Heart and conviction only goes so far. The battalion commander said they have yet to receive any of America's promised heavy weapons, showing us-supplied Browning .50-caliber machine gun that jams every two rounds. Just up the road from us, battle-weary soldiers take a break after nearly two months of heavy fighting. The Ukrainian government said the Russians have suffered heavy losses for modest gains, yet the intensity of the fight has only worsened by the day. (End VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA: The next few days here will be critical. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said there's evidence that the Russian military is building up troops and weaponry in order to step up the assault on this region -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Charlie D'Agata, thank you. And we have received word this morning from the International Committee of the Red Cross that those evacuations are indeed taking place in Mariupol. And we hope they can continue safely. We turn now to national security correspondent David Martin. David, always great to have you here. This is, on the calendar, at least, supposed to be a key week driving towards May 9, a holiday in Russia that Vladimir Putin apparently puts a lot of weight on. What wins will his military actually be able to deliver to him? DAVID MARTIN: Well, I don't think they're going to get all of the Donbass, which is what he is said he wants, by May 9. On Saturday, Russian forces made no advances on any fronts. Earlier in the week, their progress was being described as plodding, slow, uneven, incremental. Pick your word. But it was progress. And if you look at a map of Ukraine before the war started and the front lines today, Russia has seized a lot of territory in Southern and Eastern Ukraine. Now, he still has a ways to go in order to get all of the Donbass. And he's extremely unlikely to get that by May 9. But if the Russians keep up with these steamroller tactics of using artillery just to level everything in front of them, and then advancing a few kilometers and doing it all over again, the fact that the Russians aren't able to produce a victory for Putin by May 9 is going to be small consolation for the people in the path of that steamroller. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we know U.S. diplomats this week were sharing information about the strategy diplomatically or politically, to go along with the battlefield, of breaking off some of these pieces of territory, holding what the U.S. called sham elections, actually physically moving people out of areas that they decided were key. What do we know about where the focus is? I know we hear a lot about the east, but is it that Kherson area? Is it Odessa? Where should we be focusing most? DAVID MARTIN: In the east. They have -- I think and the Pentagon thinks that the strikes on Odessa are a -- just a diversionary tactic. Nobody believes that Russia has the troops to go and take Odessa. And I think the Russians would be very leery of putting ships in closer to make an amphibious assault on Odessa, simply because that's how they lost their flagship, the Moskva, when it was hit by a Ukrainian anti-ship missile. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have seen a lot of images of the weapons going into Ukraine, not just from the U.S. now, from the U.K., from Poland. They have a lot of equipment going in, and they have some U.S. intelligence as well. This looks more and more like the West is becoming party to this conflict in some way. DAVID MARTIN: They have a lot of U.S. intelligence. The U.S. is basically giving the Ukrainians everything they have on Ukrainian troop movements -- excuse me -- Russian troop movements, Russian battle plans. So, the Ukrainians have a very good picture of what the Russians are up to. And the end of big battles, you usually read a history in which intelligence turned out to be decisive in that battle. I don't think you can say that yet, but you can certainly say that the Ukrainians are going to have an intelligence advantage. The issue is going to be whether that intelligence gets down to the units that need to act on the intelligence. MARGARET BRENNAN: David Martin, great insights and reporting. Thank you. DAVID MARTIN: Sure thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to Senator Tim Kaine, who joins us from Richmond, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-Virginia): Great to be with you, Margaret. Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we woke up to those images of Speaker Pelosi and top congressional Democrats walking around downtown Kyiv. It's a statement of support. I know President Biden has asked for that statement to be backed up with $33 billion of funding from Congress. How quickly do you think this will get done? SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, we'll -- we'll turn to it as soon as we get back to the Senate tomorrow. And I think we need to push it very, very quickly. Obviously, we just did an aid package for Ukraine about a month ago that was about $13 billion. And that is a dramatic escalation over what we did in 2021 and even before that. But this additional aid is -- is necessary to help Ukraine win and beat Russia's illegal invasion of their country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when that last $13 billion package was passed, Republican Leader Mitch McConnell was on this program. And he said, if the Ukrainians want more money, we'll give it to them. You don't hear Republican leaders say, ask me to spend more. But that's exactly what's happening here. So, for Democrats, when you try to push this through, can there be a commitment to just having this be a stand-alone aid package to Ukraine, or does it have to be paired with things like COVID funding? SENATOR TIM KAINE: I don't think it does, Margaret. You know, you follow the Hill pretty carefully. The procedure of where you put bills together or separate them is quirky and sometimes unpredictable. But, no, we don't -- we need COVID aid. We need Ukraine aid. We should do them together or separately, but we shouldn't wait around. And I think that's what May needs to be about for us, is getting both of these done, together with the competitiveness bill. I think those three big bills, Ukraine aid, COVID aid, and the competitiveness bill, are the three big tasks ahead of us in May. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, the bigger it gets, the slower it goes. Ukraine says they don't have time, so why not make this a stand-alone bill? And if it is just a defense-oriented bill, do you need to have food security funding in there? Do you need to have global vaccine funding in there as well? SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, again, we can break it into smaller pieces or larger pieces. We do need to do this quickly. But, remember, Margaret, in the -- in the aid package that we put in a month or so ago, it was about $6.8 billion for military aid and an equivalent amount for humanitarian aid. That aid does not go all out the door at the same moment. Virtually every week, President Biden is releasing $500 million, $800 million of the aid. And we still have more of that first package to release to Ukraine. We need to get it to them when they need it with the weapons they need. And we are -- we still have some time to pass this next package. But I think my -- my colleagues in Congress on both sides, with very few exceptions, they understand how significant this is. There's quite a bit of bipartisan resolve on the Ukraine aid package. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your Democratic colleague Senator Coons was on this program a few weeks ago, and he said there at least needs to be a conversation about when the United States would use force potentially in Ukraine. Do you think there needs to be a discussion of authorization of use of force? SENATOR TIM KAINE: I think that would be premature, Margaret. But I think there's a shared sense that, first, if Russia were to take action against any NATO's ally, Article 5 of NATO's would mandate a military response. And that would be... MARGARET BRENNAN: But why would it be premature if President Biden has already said he won't send troops? He's already set a line. (CROSSTALK) SENATOR TIM KAINE: Yes, but he's also said that use of nuclear weapons or chemical weapons could alter the equation. So, right now, the status quo is, we are providing massive amounts of aid to Ukraine, both the U.S. and NATO allies and others. If there were to be an invasion of a NATO country, a kinetic or even a cyberattack, or if there were to be use of chemical or nuclear weapons in Ukraine, that would change the equation. But, for now, I think the right strategy is to flood the zone with military and humanitarian aid. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. One of the issues when it comes to COVID aid, as you know -- this has gotten fairly tangled, but what may happen at the U.S. border. SENATOR TIM KAINE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... and the potential expiration that's slated for the end of May of Title 42, which is pandemic regulation that allows for asylum-seeking migrants to be denied immediate entry. Is there a way around this roadblock? Do you see it inevitable that there will be a vote on Title 42? SENATOR TIM KAINE: I think -- I think it will, Margaret. We need -- we need a vote on the long -- on the COVID aid package. And Republicans have made plain that they want a vote on Title 42 as part of a discussion about COVID aid. I am a strong believer, whether I'm in the majority or minority, that there ought to be amendments and we ought to allow votes on amendments on the floor. I worry a little bit that sometimes majority parties, Democrat or Republican, slow-walk legislation to try to avoid controversial amendment votes. But I'm elected by Virginians to vote on things, controversial or otherwise. And if, after 28 years in office, I can't explain a vote on something, I'm not very good at what I'm doing. So I think we'll have a COVID aid package vote soon, in May, and I think the Republicans will ask for a Title 42 amendment vote as part of it. And we ought to see what the amendment is, and then vote it up or down based upon whether it's a good amendment or not. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've also been somewhat critical of the Biden administration's plan to allow for that border health restriction to expire at the end of May. When's the right date? SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, what I have said is this. Title 42 needs to expire. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR TIM KAINE: It's an emergency regulation, and it needs to be replaced by more permanent procedures and plans to do a better job at the border. And so I was confused about the timing. We were going to have Title 42 expire on May 23, and then have new asylum and border rules go into place May 31. I was just confused with the administration's messaging about this, but... MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it clear now? SENATOR TIM KAINE: ... DHS laid out a pretty -- DHS laid out a pretty comprehensive plan last week with six pillars, flooding personnel to the border, which they're doing already, preparing for use of expedited removals for individuals who can't make a credible claim for asylum, for example, more work in Central America to help their economies grow, so that the push of poor economic conditions leading to migration will abate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TIM KAINE: DHS has now laid out a plan. And the right answer for the border is not an emergency short-term regulation. The right answer is permanent fixes that will help. That was part of our immigration reform bill in 2013... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TIM KAINE: ... that passed the Senate in a bipartisan way that the Republican House refused to take up. MARGARET BRENNAN: One quick question for you. I know you suffer from long-term effects of your COVID infection. There's already been about a billion-dollar effort underway to study it at the National Institutes of Health. Why is that not enough? And how much more money is needed? SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, I think I would say I'm experiencing long COVID. There are people who are really suffering it. I wouldn't call myself a sufferer. I have a bizarre nerve-tingling sensation that feels like my skin is dipped in an Alka-Seltzer that's just going off 24/7. But I can work. I can exercise. I can do my thing. But, as you know, a lot of people with long COVID have respiratory issues, heart issues, fatigue. You're right. We put a significant amount of money in the American Rescue Plan. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TIM KAINE: And we're beginning to do major research at the NIH and at other institutions. But we need to do more research, spread the results of the research, provide information... MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. SENATOR TIM KAINE: ... to patients, families, providers, employers. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TIM KAINE: And then probably there will be a need to provide support to those who are really suffering under long COVID. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will continue to cover that on this program as well. Thank you, Senator. SENATOR TIM KAINE: OK. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with a lot more. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Samantha Power. She's also the former ambassador to the United Nations. Good morning to you, Madam Ambassador. SAMANTHA POWER (USAID Administrator): Morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the last holdout by Ukrainian forces in that southeastern city of Mariupol has been under constant bombardment. So has the city, roughly 100,000 people believed to be trapped there, running out of resources. Is there truly nothing the U.S. can do, except watch? ADMINISTRATOR SAMANTHA POWER: Well, I don't think that's a fair characterization of what the U.S. has done. It's not my job to talk about the security assistance that has been provided, but that has been the means by which the Ukrainians have been able to fight back and hang on as long as they have. We have exerted all kinds of diplomatic pressure vis-a-vis countries that have retained influence with Putin, everything from Turkey to Israel to India to China. And Putin doesn't care and is defying the will of the world to allow civilians to be evacuated, to allow food and medicine to get in there. And it is a travesty. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. ambassador to the OSCE, Michael Carpenter, said this week Russia is going to intensify those forced transfers of people into so-called filtration camps. That's what he called them. He said they're abducting, torturing, murdering local leaders, journalists, civil society activists, religious leaders. How many people are in these camps? What evidence do you have of what's happening there? ADMINISTRATOR SAMANTHA POWER: We're deeply concerned by the Ukrainian reports of what is happening to civilians in the east. We know some people are escaping Russian bombardment by moving into Russia voluntarily. And the ICRC and other international organizations are gathering lists of those people who families are alleging to be missing, to have gone now without cell phone contact, in some cases, for many weeks. And, again, it is going to be incumbent on those organizations that are working inside Russia to press the Russian Federation, just as we do through our sanctions and through our global pressure, to account for anybody who has traveled inside the Russian Federation. But I don't have any information on that. What I will say is that USAID is working inside Ukraine to help civil society activists, human rights activists who have received death threats or who are vulnerable to relocate, whether to safe houses or to neighboring countries, in order to ensure that they are not subjected to this level of persecution. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president did authorize U.S. diplomats to return to Ukraine this week. They haven't reopened the embassy yet. Are you saying your USAID staff are already inside and working to do this? ADMINISTRATOR SAMANTHA POWER: What we do, Margaret, in circumstances like this especially is, we work through our implementing partners. So we have folks who are, in a sense, indirectly on the ground, but who are receiving U.S. taxpayer resources in order to provide everything from flak jackets and helmets, again, to those safe houses or the kind of training that journalists maybe had not had before about how to work in war zones or work to gather evidence of war crimes or other atrocities. So we're sort of turning our previous programming, which was very extensive all across Ukraine, into programming that is suited for this moment through our Ukrainian partners who are working inside Ukraine. We are super eager to get back into Ukraine to be able to see that work up close and to be in a position again to channel, for example, the new supplemental funding we hope will be coming to those partners who urgently need it. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that funding the president asked for this week is about $33 billion. Congress holds the purse strings here, and it took them about three weeks to get the aid passed last time around. How long can you wait for the funding that the president has asked for here? And what are you doing in the meantime to prevent things like a global famine? ADMINISTRATOR SAMANTHA POWER: Well, first, let me express gratitude to the Congress for the prior supplemental package. We are spending that money now in Ukraine in order to meet humanitarian needs. You're right, not in Mariupol, where the city is besieged, not able to get that food in there. But there are vast swathes of Ukraine that have been newly liberated by Ukrainian forces where there is desperate need, everything from demining, to trauma kits, to food assistance, since markets are not back up and running. And so that assistance is flowing. And it's also flowing to third countries that are feeling these huge cascading effects of Putin's war, like the spiraling food prices, like the lower supplies of fertilizer, wheat, grain. You know, you have as many as 40 million people that could be pushed into poverty now just because of Russia's war. So, we're already spending some of that money, but the burn rate is very, very high as prices spiral inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine. So that's why this supplemental is so important. It entails both humanitarian assistance, $3 billion of humanitarian assistance, to meet those global needs, which are famine-level, acute malnutrition needs. And it includes very significant direct budget support for the government of Ukraine, because what we want to ensure is that that government can continue providing services for its people. Putin would like nothing more than the government of Ukraine to go bankrupt and not be able actually to cater to the needs of the people. That would weaken Ukrainian solidarity. And Putin wants nothing more, of course, than to strengthen his bargaining hand here, as he exerts military pressure and financial pressure at once. We can't let that happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Ambassador Power, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. The chairman for the committee investigating the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol announced a series of public hearings will be held in June, with the very first one scheduled for the 9th. Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois is a member of that committee, and he joins us this morning. Good morning to you, Congressman. Do you expect this to be more of building a public narrative or will new information come to light in these hearings? REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL): Well, I think certainly new information will come to light. I think it's important -- you know, we've been talking about January 6th now for a year and a half. It's important for us to lay the whole story out in front of the American people from both what led to January 6th, the lies after the election, the fundraising, the 187 minutes the president basically sat in the Oval Office and everything since, including the response by DOD. And it's important for us to be able to put that in front of the American people because, ultimately, they have to be the judge. You know, the Department of Justice will make decisions based on information, but the American people are going to be the ones that have to take the work we've done and decide what they want to do with it or what they want to believe after that. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, we keep hearing from the committee, including the chairman, that there will be members of Congress requested to come and speak and answer your questions. And, still, none of them have come really. Are you in favor of subpoenaing members? And, if so, who do you need to talk to? ADAM KINZINGER: Well, I won't say who I think we need to talk to yet. I mean I think everybody needs to come and talk to us. We've requested information from various members in terms of whether we move forward with a subpoena is going to be both a strategic, tactical decision and a question of whether or not, you know, we can do that and get the information in time. And those are decisions we make every day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you favor one? ADAM KINZINGER: Yes, I mean, I think, ultimately, whatever we can do to get that information. I think if that takes a subpoena, it takes a subpoena. But I think the key is, regardless of even what some members of Congress are going to tell us, we know a lot of information around it. We -- right now we're kind of not even building a broader narrative. We're going deeper with richer and more detail to show the American people. MARGARET BRENNAN: A lawyer for Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene said this week she was not a participant in the January 6th violence, she was a victim. There were text messages revealed this week in which she was discussing martial law with Mark Meadows, then chief of staff. Do you need to ask her a few questions? ADAM KINZINGER: Yes, I mean, I would love to ask her a few questions. We know some things. I won't confirm or deny the text messages, of course. But let me just say this, for Marjorie Taylor Greene to say she's a victim, it's amazing how, you know, folks like her attack everybody for being a victim. I mean she assaulted, I think, a survivor's family from a school shooting at some point in D.C. She stood outside a congresswoman's office and yelled at her through a mail slot and said she was too scared to come out and confront her. And then when Marjorie Taylor Greene is confronted, she's all of a sudden a victim and a poor, helpless congresswoman that's just trying to do her job. It's insane. We want the information. Look, history is not going to judge her or people like her that are buying the big lie well. I firmly believe that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Mike Pence did the right thing in terms of certifying the election. He is a central player in this story. As a Republican, do you want to see him come forward and actually speak to you? ADAM KINZINGER: Yes. I would love to see that. And I hope he would do so voluntarily. These are decisions I think that we're going to end up making from a tactical perspective in the next, you know, week or two as we basically pin down what this hearing schedule is going to look like, the content, and as we go into the full narrative of this thing. I would hope and think that the vice president would want to come in and tell his story because he did do the right thing on that day. If he doesn't, then we'll look at the options we have available to us if there's information we don't already have. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. I know you're not a fan of the former president, but he is, in some ways, playing a very large role in some upcoming primaries. In Ohio, in particular, JD Vance he's endorsed, a number of other candidates, Pennsylvania, Herschel Walker, Georgia. If those hand-picked candidates end up winning, is this a sign that indeed Donald Trump is still the leader and kingmaker within the party? ADAM KINZINGER: Yes, I think it would be a sign. And I think, you know, there's -- that's going to be a big -- this primary season is going to be a big moment to figure that out. So, I have this organization, Country 1st, Country1st.com. And our focus is on playing in some of those primaries to bring at least reasonable people to the forefront and encouraging folks that are going to live, for instance, in a guaranteed Republican district. You know, vote in that primary. It matters. And -- so, yes, I do think the primary season is going -- going to tell. But, keep in mind the president's -- the former president's tactic here. If somebody starts falling behind in the polls, he always finds a reason to un-endorse them because he doesn't like having a losing track record. So I think that's important to watch too. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, JD Vance, because that's what, May 3rd. When you say \"reasonable people,\" you don't think reasonable people are voting in the Ohio Republican primary for him? ADAM KINZINGER: Well, I -- you know, look, from what I've seen there's one at least maybe reasonable candidate. But, no. I mean, look, if you -- if you're JD Vance two years ago, you know, you're a totally different JD Vance than you are today. This is a guy that said that he, frankly, doesn't care what happens in Ukraine. It's very similar to what people like Tucker Carlson have said. Look, I mean, that can't -- for me, as a Republican, that doesn't represent what I believe. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ADAM KINZINGER: And the party has to make the decision if they want to be that kind of party or not. MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker Pelosi and top Democrats were in Ukraine overnight, as I'm sure you know. Do you see impediments to getting this $33 billion that the president has asked to be passed? ADAM KINZINGER: I certainly hope not. I mean, look, there's -- we do have outliers of people that seem to show some Putin sympathy. But for the most part, Congress is vastly and largely united on the issue of Ukraine. We recognize Ukraine is fighting for all of us. That $33 billion is significantly less than what we would have to spend if we took Russia on directly. So I hope we don't have any impediments to that at all. I would expect we do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine was with us, and he said it is too soon to begin talking about potential use of force in Ukraine. Do you think he is right? ADAM KINZINGER: No, I don't. I don't think we need to be using force in Ukraine right now. I just introduced an AUMF, an Authorization for the Use of Military Force, giving the president basically congressional leverage or permission to use it if WMDs, nuclear, biological or chemical are used in Ukraine. Doesn't compel the president to do it. It just says, if it is used, he has that leverage. It gives him, you know, a better flexibility, but also it is a deterrent to Vladimir Putin. If Vladimir Putin wants to escalate with the west, he will. It's easy for him to do it. And I think right now what we're doing with suppling, with (INAUDIBLE), with the financing is right, but there may be a point that we have to recognize, you know, look, this is -- world war -- prior to World War II, there were moments nobody ever wanted to get involved and eventually came to realize they had to. I hope we don't get to that point here. But we should be ready if we do. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congressman Adam Kinzinger, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week Moderna asked the FDA to authorize its vaccine for children under the age of six. The company's chief medical officer, Dr. Paul Burton, joins us now from Princeton, New Jersey. Doctor, welcome to FACE THE NATION. PAUL BURTON, M.D., CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, MODERNA: Thank you, Margaret. Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the FDA said Friday it will not delay one vaccine to wait for the other. In other words, they're not trying to put Pfizer and Moderna head to head here necessarily. Each application will be considered when the data is ready. So are you confident that Moderna will be ready for the FDA to review your vaccine at their June meeting? PAUL BURTON: Yes. Absolutely, Margaret. So, we submitted our data last week. I think the FDA now have, you know, all of the core fundamental data they need to be able to begin that application review. So, yes, we're very confident. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have begun it, but you won't have all of it in until May 9th I had read. You're committed to that date? PAUL BURTON: Yes, absolutely. So the data in, you know, the study has been completed. We have the data. Now, typically, what we then do is to package the data electronically, supply to it the FDA so, of course, they can conduct their own views, their own analysis of the data. That's what we'll go in by May 9th. But they have the data that they need now to begin. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, I mean, full disclosure, I have children in this age group. So, as a parent, I'm very interested in the explanations you have for how this vaccine will work. According to the Moderna release, the vaccine is 37 percent effective in kids two to five, roughly 50 percent in those six months to two years. What is your confidence level in that performance? PAUL BURTON: Yes. So, first of all, on safety -- and we can talk about that -- the safety profile we see with this vaccine, in these very youngest kids, was very reassuring. Actual rates of safety events, even lower than we see in the six-year-olds to 12-year-olds. So that's great. But let's think about that number, Margaret, 37, 51 percent vaccine effectiveness. What does that really mean? The vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, symptomatic Covid disease, about 10 weeks after the second dose of vaccine. So, what it means for parents, for caregivers, is that if they give the Moderna vaccine to these little kids, they would basically cut in half the risk of that child getting symptomatic Covid. Now, the number, 50 percent, I know is often lower than we are used to seeing with our vaccine, but it's because this study was conducted during a time of omicron. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. PAUL BURTON: When we look at the U.K. data that was released just last week, when we looked at symptomatic disease, exactly there we see vaccine effectiveness of about 50 percent. But when we look at vaccine effectiveness against hospitalizations, that number is 89 to 95 percent. So, it's why I think we can be very reassured and very confident in this result. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that 50 percent benchmark set by the FDA is key because that's usually, you know, the floor they have for -- for approval. But when you look at the data, you're doing a vaccine that's 25 micrograms, as I understand it, in size. It's a higher dose than Pfizer's vaccine, which was three micrograms. It's still being reviewed. What are the side effects for a toddler of a dose that size? PAUL BURTON: Yes. So, we give two 25 micrograms shots a month apart. And when we looked at the safety, as I say, the safety profile was very reassuring. Lower events of safety in this very young age group, even compared to the six-year-olds to 12-year-olds. Common side effects are injection site pain and some fever. Really a lot of what all of us have after vaccination. But, again, reassuringly, when we look at the rates of very high fever, a fever over 104 Fahrenheit, only 0.2 percent of these little kids experience that. And, typically, in this age range, for other approved vaccines, we would see rates of maybe 1 percent. So, I think, overall, very reassuring. MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned safety, and I'm glad you bring that up because I know your application for the vaccine, for that age group, 6-11, 12-17, that's been pending before the FDA since June of 2021. So why do you feel comfortable putting your vaccine in my three-year-old or someone's four-year-old if the FDA hasn't approved it to be put in the body of a 12- year-old? PAUL BURTON: Yes. Well, so, look, now we've submitted additional safety data to the FDA for the 12 to 18-year-olds. We've also just submitted our application for that six to 12-year-olds as well and now we have the data on the very youngest kids. There was a time, Margaret, that we -- MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you expect the FDA to approve it for those older age groups, is that what you're saying? PAUL BURTON: Yes. I mean those applications are now under active review by FDA. So they have the full spectrum of data with us. And we are, of course, approved for over -- over six-year-olds in many other countries around the world where it's being used safely and effectively to provide protection for those young kids. So I'm very hopefully that the FDA will follow -- follow suit here across that full age range. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I guess the fundamental question here is, when we talk about that benchmark of 50 percent, is -- is putting a vaccine in the -- in the smallest of children who don't have any protection, right, they're too young to even wear a mask, many of them, is just getting some protection worth it, or does it need to meet that standard 50 percent benchmark the FDA says? PAUL BURTON: Yes. So, the 50 percent benchmark, you know, really was in a pre-omicron era. As I say, we know now that 50 percent means to cut in half your risk of symptomatic disease. I think from the antibody levels that we also saw in this study, we can expect high protection against the important thing, which is hospitalization, even death. Omicron is not a mild disease. In kids, we see data from Hong Kong, the rates of admission of kids to pediatric intensive care units, very high. So what I think we can reassure parents, and caregivers here, is that if approved, this vaccine should be able to safely and effectively protect your kids, your youngest kids, against severe disease, hospitalization. That's what counts. MARGARET BRENNAN: And for adults, when do you expect a rebooted version of the vaccine to be available, a booster shot that would work against omicron, for example. PAUL BURTON: Yes. So, look, even the spike vax, which we have now, the Moderna vaccine, does provide protection certainly against severe disease, hospitalization. People are eligible now to get boosted. I would absolutely recommend it. We're still in this BA.2 wave of a variant sweeping now throughout the United States. We announced a couple of weeks ago a new variant-specific booster that we've been tested, and we have an additional candidate, our lead candidate, in testing now that I believe is going to be even more superior. So, Margaret, we are confident that by the fall of this year we should have large amounts of that new booster vaccine that will protect against omicron and other variants and really protect Americans and people around the world as we go into the fall of 2022. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor, thank you very much. And we will be watching closely what happens next. We'll be back in a moment with Dr. Deborah Birx. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: It's been more than a year since we last spoke with Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House Coronavirus Task Force coordinator during the Trump administration, and she told us about her time in the administration, spoke candidly about mistakes that had been made, especially with the CDC. And many of those details are recounted in her new book, \"Silent Invasion.\" Dr. Brix is here with us in studio. Good morning to you, Doctor. AMB. DEBORAH BIRX, M.D., FORMER WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR AND AUTHOR, \"SILENT INVASION\": Good morning, Margaret. Happy to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm glad to see you again. I want to talk about the book, but we did see you last night at the Correspondents Dinner. We were both there as guests of CBS. These indoor gatherings are happening across the country now. Dr. Fauci said it was too dangerous for him to attend. How do you judge risk? DEBORAH BIRX: I have to judge it every day because, like you, I have children under five, unvaccinated grandchildren, and I have a 93-year-old that lives in our house. So I have to constantly be aware of my risk, yet I have to work. So, I completely masked last night because my assessment was there were probably, just by odds and science, probably 15 to 20 people infected, even though everyone was tested in the morning or within 24 hours. And so I just always know and then I keep testing. So I'll test every day for five days after an exposure. And I consider that an exposure. I tested this morning because I knew I was going to see you in person, unmasked. And I think that's just what we need to do. If you have vulnerable people in your household, whether it's children or elderly, you have to continually assess your risk. MARGARET BRENNAN: It -- thank you for the guidance on that. And, as you said, I'm aware of it because of my kids. We're now at close to a million deaths. Infection rates are going up. Hospitalizations are going up. I think it was just about 18 percent on the week. Do you think we are done with these massive waves of infection? DEBORAH BIRX: I like to look at the whole spectrum of the last two years. And so if you look at what we've been through, we went through a mini alpha variant surge in the same locations last year at this time. Then we went into that lull of May, where everybody thought it was over, and in middle of June, and then we had the predictable surge across the south. And what you need to be looking at is global data. So I follow South Africa very closely. They're good about testing. They're good about sequencing and find their variants. They're on an up slope again. Each of these surges are about four to six months apart. That tells me that natural immunity wanes enough in the general population after four to six months that a significant surge is going to occur again. And this is what we have to be prepared for in this country. We should be preparing right now for a potential surge in the summer across the southern United States because we saw it in 2020 and we saw it in 2021. MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow, that's not general consensus right now. That's a warning. You think that's what's coming for the south? Is it this new variant? DEBORAH BIRX: Well, each of these surges have been a slightly different variant because, yes, our immune system wanes. Now, who is carrying the virus that participates in these surges? We are. Vaccinated individuals, as well as unvaccinated individuals. And we have to make it very clear to the American people that your protection against infection wanes. So, if you're going to go see your grandmother or someone that has metastatic breast cancer, or someone under treatment for Hodgkin's Disease or a family member with down syndrome, you need to test before you go. If that area is in a surge, and if you assessed your risk, like we did last night, and make sure that you're negative. MARGARET BRENNAN: And so what you're seeing in South Africa, you do think is a lead indicator of what may be coming here? DEBORAH BIRX: Correct. What has happened each time is we've had a summer surge across the south and a winter surge that cross -- that starts in our northern plains and moves down, accelerated by Thanksgiving and the holidays of Christmas, Kwanzaa and Hanukkah. And that's predictable. So now we have to figure out -- we have tools, better tools that we had a year ago. So, we have the tools now to enable every American to not only survive, but thrive. But that means every American has to have access to these tools. And our rural counties, those red counties that people keep talking about, they have lack of adequate health care. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DEBORAH BIRX: Lack of primary physicians. Lack of individuals to counsel them about vaccines. I went to Elko (ph), Nevada. They are three hours from a hospital that could take care of Covid. So, we have to be attentive to all Americans no matter where they live. MARGARET BRENNAN: You, in your book, talk about some of these institutional issues. You're talking about at the state level, but also at the CDC, and Health and Human Services as well. In your book you say there is no plan b then. And to this day there is still no plan b. There is no early warning system in this country. Why hasn't this administration been able to fix it? Because you're not the only person who's said this. DEBORAH BIRX: You know, I'm thrilled that over the last 12 months people have been giving more and more voice to it. To be frank, that's why I wrote the book because I felt like people weren't understanding what the issues were on the ground that were resulting in Americans not surviving. Every American needs to be able to click on a website that shows them what is happening in their community with test positivity cases. And hospitalizations are great. MARGARET BRENNAN: How do tests throw that off? Sorry, I don't mean to get -- continue your thought. DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hospitalizations, that's what the CDC says focus on. You're saying, don't focus on it. DEBORAH BIRX: Well, if you wait until hospitalizations, there is so much community spread that you cannot prevent it from getting into the nursing homes, into venerable family members, because we interact with each other. And so people are interpreting that the fact that they are vaccinated, or vaccinated and boosted, that they cannot be infected, that they're somehow invincible and they're carrying that virus into hospital rooms, into nursing homes, and into dining room tables where their vulnerable family members sit. And let's be clear, not every vulnerable family member has an effective immune response either to the vaccine or the booster. And so we need to know if they're protected or not. And so we have to be able to utilize those antibody levels in some way. I can tell you today, if your grandmother has no antibody, don't pretend -- don't think that there are cellular or there are other side of their immune system is going to protect them. They're going to need something else. We have those tools now. We have depo (ph), monoclonal antibody Evusheld. There are -- there are tools that we can use. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor, thank you for your insights. We have to leave it there. And we'll be back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Next Sunday, we'll be talking with former Attorney General Eric Holder. That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 For much of the past two years, America has been first in line for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. Now, as drugmakers develop the next generation of therapies, the White House is warning that if Congress doesn't act urgently the U.S. will have to take a number. Already the congressional stalemate over virus funding has forced the federal government to curtail free treatment for the uninsured and to ration monoclonal antibody supplies. And Biden administration officials are expressing increasing alarm that the U.S. is also losing out on critical opportunities to secure booster doses and new antiviral pills that could help the country maintain its reemerging sense of normalcy, even in the face of potential new variants and case spikes. Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong have all placed orders for treatments and vaccine doses that the U.S. can't yet commit to, according to the White House. Months ago, the White House began warning that the country had spent through the money in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that was dedicated directly to COVID-19 response. It requested an additional $22.5 billion for what it called \"urgent\" needs in both the U.S. and abroad. The Senate last month closed in on a smaller $10 billion package focused on domestic needs. But even that deal fell apart as lawmakers objected to an announcement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that it would end Trump-era border restrictions related to the pandemic. The White House this week is mounting a push for doctors to get less stingy about prescribing the antiviral pill Paxlovid, which was initially rationed for those at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19 but is now more widely available. A 20 million-dose order placed last year by the government helped boost manufacturing capacity. Dr. Ashish Kumar Jha, the White House's COVID-19 response coordinator, is appearing in the White House briefing room Tuesday afternoon for the first time since taking the job.\u00a0 Paxlovid, when administered within five days of symptoms appearing, has been proven to bring about a 90% reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among patients most likely to get severe disease. Some 314 Americans are now dying each day from the coronavirus, down from more than 2,600 during the height of the omicron wave earlier this year. The U.S. used similar advance-purchase agreements to boost the domestic supply and manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, through what was known in the Trump administration as \"Operation Warp Speed.\" Now, with a new generation of treatments on the horizon, the U.S. is falling behind. Japan has already placed an initial order for drugmaker Shionogi's upcoming COVID-19 antiviral pill, which studies have shown to be at least as effective as Pfizer's treatment and has fewer drug-to-drug interactions and is easier to administer. Because of the funding delays, officials say, the U.S. has yet to place an advance order, which would help the company scale manufacturing to widely produce the pill. \"We know companies are working on additional, promising life-saving treatments that could protect the American people, and without additional funding from Congress, we risk losing out on accessing these treatments, as well as tests and vaccines, while other countries get in front of us in line,\" said White House spokesman Kevin Munoz. \"Congress must act urgently upon return from recess to provide the funding needed to secure new treatments for the American people and to avoid this dangerous outcome.\" Complicating matters further are the long lead times to manufacture the antiviral and antibody treatments. Paxlovid takes about six months to produce, and monoclonal antibody treatments used to treat COVID-19 and prevent serious disease in the immunocompromised take similarly long, meaning the U.S. is running out of time to replenish its stockpile before the end of the year. Last month, the White House began cutting back shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states to make supplies last longer. Administration officials declined to discuss specific treatments they are stymied from ordering because of contracting requirements. The funding debate is also holding up U.S. purchases of COVID-19 vaccine booster doses, including an upcoming new generation of vaccines that may better protect against the omicron variant. Moderna and Pfizer both are testing what scientists call \"bivalent\" shots \u2014 a mix of each company's original vaccine and an omicron-targeted version \u2014 with Moderna announcing last week it hopes to have its version ready this fall. The Biden administration has said that while the U.S. has enough vaccine doses for children under 5, once they are approved by regulators, and for fourth shots for high-risk people over 50, it doesn't have the money to order the new generation of doses. Earlier this month, former White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients said Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Hong Kong had already secured future booster doses. Republicans have shown no signs of backing down from their insistence that before supplying the 10 GOP votes needed for the COVID-19 funding package to pass the Senate, the chamber must vote on their effort to extend the Trump-era Title 42 order. That COVID-linked order, which requires authorities to immediately expel nearly all migrants at the border, is set to be lifted on May 23. An election-year vote to extend that order would be perilous for Democrats, and many hope no such vote occurs. Many say privately they hope President Biden will keep the immigration curbs in place or that a court will postpone the rules' termination, but Republicans could well force a vote anyway. \"Congress would have to take action in order for the day not to be May 23,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said early this month that he expected legislation this spring that would wrap together funds for COVID-19 and Ukraine. Aid for Ukraine has wide bipartisan support and could help propel such a package through Congress, but Republican opposition has already forced legislators to strip out pandemic response funding once. There are at least six Democrats, and potentially 10 or more, who would be expected to back the Republican amendment to extend the immigration order, enough to secure its passage. Such a vote would be dangerous for Democrats from swing districts, who must appeal to pro-immigration core Democratic voters without alienating moderates leery of the increase in migrants that lifting the curbs is expected to prompt. Republicans haven't said what language they would embrace, but they could turn to a bipartisan bill by Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. It would delay any suspension of the immigration limits until at least 60 days after the U.S. surgeon general declares the pandemic emergency to be over. The administration would also have to propose a plan for handling the anticipated increase in migrants crossing the border. Democrats expressing support for keeping the immigration restrictions in place have cited a lack of planning by the administration as their chief concern although the Biden administration has insisted it is preparing for an increase in border crossings.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with former Rep. Will Hurd that aired Sunday, March 27, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: We're joined now by Will Hurd. He's a former Republican congressman from Texas, a former CIA officer, and now the author of American Reboot. Congressman, welcome. FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN WILL HURD: It's a pleasure to be on. JOHN DICKERSON: The book begins with a very exciting, I won't spoil it, but moment in your CIA career. So I want to use that intelligence to talk about intelligence. What does your intelligence background tell you about what's happening in Ukraine right now? HURD: Well, right now it tells me that something I learned in those almost decade as an undercover officer where I was responsible for recruiting spies and stealing secrets. And when it comes to our foreign policy, we want our friends to love us and our adversaries to fear us. And when you use that as a metric on looking at what's happening in Ukraine, our allies, President Zelensky, is asking us to do more. Our adversaries, our enemies. Vladimir Putin is launching cruise missiles into the western part of the Ukraine because he's not afraid that we're going to respond. We need to be doing more. And I think that we can help prevent an incredible loss of life. JOHN DICKERSON: Quickly doing more meaning what? HURD: Look, I think we should be giving about as much weaponry as we can. What we don't know in the earlier segment you talked about, is 20 MiGs going to be enough to do anything? Well, everybody underestimated the Ukrainians before this happened. Who knows what they're going to be able to do with those kinds of tools? And we have to be prepared to help them prevent significant loss of life. JOHN DICKERSON: And the other piece of your expertise I want to tap is cyber. You write about it in the book. President Biden this week said to American business leaders, be careful, harden your targets more than you already have been. What could the Russians do? HURD: Well, the Russians can do a lot of things. They could impact the water treatment plants. We've already seen that happen in the United States last summer. They could try to impact our grid. We saw in my home state of Texas the grid. You know, it was because- the grid went down or almost went down because of- because of weather issues. But you can mimic that similar kinds of attack through a- through a digital attack. And so the world is incredibly interconnected in increasing things like artificial intelligence is going to be the future of cybersecurity, where you're going to have bad, bad A.I. versus good A.I.. And this is moving at a rather significant speed. JOHN DICKERSON: Why hasn't the Russian cyberattack happened the way people expect it? HURD: I think the Russians are not ten feet tall. I think that's one of the things that we learn from this. They've- they thought that this campaign and this- this- this invasion of Ukraine would be going differently. The fact that the FSB, which is responsible for a lot of their cyber activities, they're rounding some of them up and using them as scapegoats, says as why the- the attacks are going so poorly. So I think they've been consumed and they haven't been able to get to it. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Let's turn the wheel now and talk about your book. One of the arguments you make in your book is that the Republican Party needs to reach out to those portions of the electorate that haven't traditionally been Republicans. So with that in mind, as you watch the confirmation hearings of Judge Jackson this week, how do you think the Republican Party fared with its representatives questioning her towards the larger purpose of your book? HURD: Well, look, I think what's what's what's what's crazy here. This is a seminal moment, right? Yes. I disagree with the judge's judicial philosophy, but she's obviously qualified. And the fact that she's, I think, the second most popular justice ever nominated to the bench, that should be- that should be the story, right when it comes- when it comes to this. Of course, a handful of senators acted like jokers in their- in their in their testimony. And they're asking questions similar to other senators have done in-in other nominations for Supreme Court justices. But my point in the book is that the Republican Party needs to start looking like America because we have a real opportunity. The Republicans are going to take back the House in 2022, and we're primarily to take back the House because of the incompetence of the Democratic Party. Imagine that instead of voting because voters think the other guys are so bad that they're voting for us because they believe in our ideas. We're going to see some of that happen in my home state in south Texas, where you're going to see Latinos vote for Republicans and probably record numbers. JOHN DICKERSON: So I want to press on that theory. Your argument is essentially the Republican Party has to catch up with where America is going, a constituency different than the one that they support. And you refer back to the Republican autopsy after the 2012 loss. Donald- And in that autopsy, they said Republicans have to embrace comprehensive immigration reform. Stop sending the message that we only care essentially about white voters. Donald Trump heard that and said, nuts. I'm going to run the opposite. And he won. And now, as you say, Republicans are ready to perhaps take over the House and the Senate. That seems like a pretty strong argument against essentially you're. Are you sure? HURD: Well well, Donald Trump did won-win, but then he also lost. He lost the House. He lost the Senate. Right. And so there was- there was- there was. And then and then if we look in 2020. Joe Biden won and he had absolutely no coattails because the public said, hey, we don't like some of these things the Democratic Party is going to. So, yes, a good chunk of the Republican Party is still, you know, blindly loyal to President Trump. But it's not the supermajority. And this is the opportunity that we have and this is where we need to be thinking about this in in 2022, when the opportunities that we have in order- in order to grow and improve our electoral successes. JOHN DICKERSON: There is a question about the power that Donald Trump has in the party. You say the first thing that Republicans have to do is admit that the 2020 election was legitimately decided in favor of Joe Biden. That's not the majority position, according to polls, among Republicans. HURD: Sure. But when I criss-cross the- the- the country now and in promoting the book American reboot one of the things that I've watched people say, yeah, let's get- let's get beyond that let's-let's move on. Joe Biden is the president's right. Let's start talking about the next thing. So, so, so for me, look, I'm talking about where we should be going. We are at a moment where 72% of Americans think the country is on the wrong track. And this is not new. This has been going on for some time. And what I'm trying to say is we don't have to accept the current trajectory. There's different ways of doing things. And I try to use my time from when I was in the CIA, in business and in Congress to outline a different strategy. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Congressman Hurd, thank you so much for being with us. Thank you. And we'll be back in a moment.",

            "article_content": "The number of migrant arrivals along the U.S. southern border soared in March to the highest levels since 2000, surpassing 200,000 for only the third time during the Biden administration, according to government statistics submitted to a federal court Friday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported processing migrants 221,303 times along the Mexican border last month, which overtook the previous peak under the Biden administration in July 2021, when U.S. officials recorded 213,593 migrant encounters, agency figures show. Nearly 210,000 of the migrant encounters last month were recorded by Border Patrol, which arrests migrants who entered the U.S. illegally. The last time monthly Border Patrol apprehensions were higher was in March 2000, when the agency reported 220,063 migrant arrests, according to historical CBP data. The increase in border arrivals comes as the Biden administration prepares to wind down the Title 42 pandemic-era rules, which have allowed U.S. authorities to swiftly expel migrants without processing their asylum claims. The policy, first instituted under the Trump administration, is set to expire on May 23. U.S. immigration authorities carried out 109,549 expulsions under Title 42 in March, representing nearly 50% of all migrant apprehensions. Roughly 111,000 migrants and asylum-seekers who arrived last month were processed under regular immigration procedures, which allow them to request asylum. The encounters recorded by CBP do not represent the number of migrants processed by the agency because many border-crossers attempt to enter the U.S. multiple times. Since the start of the pandemic, the rate of repeat crossings has soared, as some migrant adults try to re-enter the U.S. after being expelled. Single adults who are not expelled are either detained, deported under a process known as expedited removal or released with a notice to appear before a judge. In March, U.S. officials deported or returned 12,070 migrants who were processed under regular immigration procedures, the government data shows. Migrant families traveling with minor children who are not processed under Title 42 are generally released with court notices, sometimes with tracking devices, such as ankle monitors. Most unaccompanied children, who are exempted from Title 42, are transferred to government shelters in the U.S. interior. In March, U.S. border officials released 65,771 migrants with a court notice or under a process known as parole, which allows them to admit foreigners on humanitarian grounds. Just over 24,000 migrants were sent to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. Roughly 9,000 migrants remained detained by ICE as of April 3. The planned termination of Title 42 in late May has alarmed Republicans and some centrist Democrats, many of whom have tough re-election contests this November.\u00a0 On Thursday, 18 states joined a lawsuit filed by Republican officials in Arizona, Louisiana and Missouri seeking to block Title 42's rescission. Texas' Republican Governor Greg Abbott has launched additional moves to challenge the Biden administration following the Title 42 announcement, directing state officials to bus migrants to Washington, D.C., and inspect commercial trucks entering the U.S. In Congress, four moderate Democratic senators joined a group of Republicans to introduce a bill earlier this month that would force the administration to delay ending Title 42 until after the national public health emergency over COVID-19 is lifted. The Democratic critics of the decision to lift Title 42 have said they don't believe the Department of Homeland Security is adequately prepared to respond to a potential spike in border arrivals when the Title 42 expulsions are halted. But DHS officials have said they've started making preparations for the policy's end, deploying additional Border Patrol agents, expanding capacity at migrant holding sites and securing more buses and aircraft to transport migrants and prevent overcrowding at processing facilities. According to a DHS contingency plan, the department is preparing for worst-case scenarios in which between 12,000 to 18,000 migrants enter U.S. border custody per day, an unprecedented increase from the current 7,000 daily apprehensions average. While some more centrist Democrats have joined Republicans in criticizing the end of Title 42, many Democrats have called for the policy's termination for months, citing the end or relaxation of other pandemic restrictions. Progressive advocates have also pointed out that the Trump administration first implemented Title 42 in March 2020 over the objections of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's public health experts who did not believe the extraordinary measure was needed to control the spread of the coronavirus. In her termination order earlier this month, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Title 42 was no longer necessary to protect public health because of the availability of coronavirus mitigation tools, the drop in infections since the winter Omicron surge and increased vaccination rates in the U.S. and abroad.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Novak Djokovic faces deportation again after the Australian government revoked his visa for a second time, the latest twist in the ongoing saga over whether the world's top-ranked tennis player will be allowed to compete in the Australian Open despite being unvaccinated against\u00a0COVID-19.                  Immigration Minister Alex Hawke said Friday he used his ministerial discretion to cancel the 34-year-old Serb's visa on public interest grounds - just three days before play begins at the Australian Open, where Djokovic has won a record nine of his 20 Grand Slam titles. Djokovic is the Open's defending champion and is seeking a men's record 21st Grand Slam singles title overall.   Three hours later, Djokovic's lawyers began their appeal against the visa cancellation in an after-hours hearing at the Federal Circuit and Family Court. The same judge at that hearing, Anthony Kelly, ruled in favor of Djokovic last week on procedural grounds after his visa was first canceled when he landed at a Melbourne airport. \u00a0   His lawyer, Nick Wood, told Kelly he hoped an appeal will be heard Sunday and that Djokovic would have his visa returned in time for him to play Monday.  Under terms spelled out by the government, Djokovic would remain free on Friday night but would effectively return to immigration detention when he meets with Australian Border Force (immigration) officials at 8 a.m. local time Saturday (4 p.m. Friday EST). He would spend the morning at his lawyers' offices under Border Force guard and return to hotel detention on Saturday afternoon.  Deportation from Australia can lead to a three-year ban on returning to the country, although that may be waived, depending on the circumstances. Djokovic's lawyers need to get him two urgent orders. One is an injunction preventing his deportation, like the order he gained last week. The second would make Hawke grant Djokovic a visa to play. \"That second order is almost not precedented,\" Melbourne-based immigration lawyer Kian Bone said. \"Very rarely do the courts order a member of the executive government to grant a visa.\"\u00a0 Hawke said he canceled Djokovic's visa on \"health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so.\"  \"The Morrison Government is firmly committed to protecting Australia's borders, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Hawke said in a statement, referring to Prime Minister Scott Morrison.\u00a0 Morrison welcomed Djokovic's pending deportation, saying Australia had achieved one of the lowest pandemic death rates, strongest economies and highest vaccination rates in the world. \"Australians have made many sacrifices during this pandemic and they rightly expect the result of those sacrifices to be protected,\" Morrison said in a statement. \"This is what the minister is doing in taking this action today.\" Deportations usually come with a three-year-ban on returning to Australia. Despite the uncertainty hanging over Djokovic, Open organizers included the tournament's top seed in the draw. He's slated to play fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic, who's ranked No. 78 in the world, in the opening round and has been practicing, including a session Friday a few hours before Hawke's decision was announced. \u00a0 Djokovic's exemption from a COVID-19 vaccination requirement to compete was approved by the Victoria state government and Tennis Australia, the tournament organizer. That apparently allowed him to receive a visa to travel.  But the Australian Border Force rejected the exemption and canceled his visa upon arrival in Melbourne. Djokovic spent four nights in an immigration detention hotel before the judge overturned that decision Monday. Djokovic's status is itself part of a larger, worldwide debate over the rights of the unvaccinated. Morrison is running for re-election and his government's handling of the Djokovic visa situation has, in some quarters, tarnished what had been general praise for its tough stand on border security during \u2013 and before the pandemic.",

            "article_content": "With Election Day just around the corner, thoughts from historian Jon Meacham, whose new book chronicles the life and evolution of President Abraham Lincoln: He thought everything was over.  It was the summer of 1864, and Abraham Lincoln believed his campaign for re-election amid the Civil War was doomed: The president was to be defeated, his policies repudiated by the people, his vision of America lost; but if the Democratic nominee, George McClellan, was in fact the choice of the electorate, then so be it.  \"This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected,\" Lincoln wrote. \"Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President-elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration.\" A president devoted to justice and to the rule of law. A president willing to cede power graciously should he lose. A president who put the Constitutional experiment and the good of others above his own self-interest.  Such words can seem nostalgic, even na\u00efve, in our own time.  On Tuesday, Americans will go to the polls in the first national election since the Insurrection of January 6, 2021. Perhaps 300 election deniers are on the ballot across America. At stake is not only the policies of ordinary times, but the viability and the durability of American democracy itself. I wish this were hyperbolic. I wish it were hypothetical. But it's neither. Democracies are always contingent and conditional enterprises; they depend not only on the substance of laws and of institutions, but on the characters of leaders, and of the led. In a democracy, the pursuit of power for power's sake, devoid of devotion to equal justice and fair play, is tempting, but it's destructive.  This is why the unfolding voting in the midterm elections is so important.  There are forces abroad and in the land that are choosing to put their own power ahead of everything else. To them, politics is not a mediation of differences but an occasion for total war.  Usually a vote is about policy \u2013 a tax rate, say, or immigration reform. This year's vote is about more than that; it's about whether elected Republican officials will obey the law, fairly count the votes in 2024, and obey the will of the people. A world in which power is all, in which the assertion of a singular will trumps all, in which brute force dictates all, is not moral but immoral, not democratic but autocratic, not just but unjust.  The task of history is to secure advances in a universe that tends to disappoint. That was Lincoln's task. And it is ours. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info: \"The Penny Image of Abraham Lincoln\" by William Willard, courtesy National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Gift of Mr. and Mrs. David A.

            "article_content": "Laredo, Texas \u2014 Beto O'Rourke returned to the campaign trail Friday night in Laredo, Texas, a crucial spot for the Democratic nominee for governor and for the party statewide. \u00a0 After being away for over a week as he recovered from a bacterial infection, O'Rourke returned to a cheering crowd of hundreds of supporters. Since the beginning of July, O'Rourke has been on a 49-day, 70-stop tour through Texas, which is set to wrap up next week in the central Texas town of Lockhart.\u00a0 O'Rourke stuck to issues pertaining to Texas, calling Gov. Greg Abbott \"the worst governor in the United States,\" and touched on the 2021 power grid failure, abortion and immigration, a huge issue in Laredo, a border town. He did not mention President Joe Biden or the president's speech on Thursday night that called out \"MAGA Republicans.\"\u00a0 But O'Rourke did acknowledge what he called \"some dark days for the people of Texas.\" \"In Abbott's Texas, it is you or me. I know that in our Texas, it is you and me,\" he said. With no Democrat having won a statewide race in Texas since 1994, O'Rourke has instead tried to highlight what he calls Abbott's extremism and flip moderate Republicans. On Friday, he told the crowd that \"we need to make up this ground right now.\"\u00a0 O'Rourke hit Abbott's border policies especially hard. Republicans have aggressively targeted South Texas, buoyed by record GOP turnout in the March primary and winning a special election in June in the neighboring 34th Congressional district. Abbott has agreed to one debate so far with O'Rourke on Sept. 30 in Edinburg. O'Rourke has proposed four town hall-style debates with the governor, who has not yet agreed to participate, according to the Austin-American Statesman.\u00a0 Abbott hit the campaign trail this week in Dallas' suburban Collin County, a once solidly Republican stronghold that has become more competitive in recent years.\u00a0 Abbott has steadily shown a lead in the polls and while O'Rourke outraised him last quarter, the governor maintains a cash-on-hand advantage. Abbott began running television ads the week of Aug. 16, according to the Texas Tribune, while O'Rourke's campaign told the Tribune they had begun reserving $10 million in ads this week.\u00a0 O'Rourke called immigration \"the governor's favorite issue\" that he \"wants the rest of the world to know about and that's a problem.\"\u00a0 \"Well, let me tell you what, he's had seven and a half years to do something about it. And what we have today is far more chaotic than what we had when he first took office,\" O'Rourke said.\u00a0 This summer Abbott has undertaken a controversial busing program to send migrants to New York, Washington and now Chicago, all Democrat-run cities. O'Rourke called the busing a \"stunt.\"\u00a0 During the speech, Customs and Border Protection confirmed that nine migrants had drowned at a border crossing in Eagle Pass, Texas, where O'Rourke plans to stop on Saturday. CBP said it rescued 37 migrants from the group.\u00a0 O'Rourke also touched on the shooting in Uvalde, which left 19 children and two teachers dead. O'Rourke, who has long been an advocate for stricter gun control laws, made national headlines in May when he confronted Abbott at a press conference in Uvalde the day after the shooting.\u00a0 O'Rourke has been pushing for Abbott to call a special session of the state legislature to address the issue. Abbott said at a campaign stop on Wednesday that raising the age to buy assault weapons would be unconstitutional.\u00a0 Ricky Longoria said he was attending for the children and teachers of Uvalde. O'Rourke had to cancel an event in Falfurrias and Longoria, 21, said he traveled the 90 minutes to see him because it could be one of the last stops in South Texas.\u00a0 Been coming to Laredo for a long time. Never seen this many people come out or this much energy.Big thanks to everyone who\u2019s putting in the work to make sure we win. pic.twitter.com/ERxmtIUYfr",

            "article_content": "A butterfly sanctuary caught in the crossfire of polarizing conspiracy theories on illegal immigration to the United States says it's shutting its doors Thursday due to security concerns after threats from supporters of former president Donald Trump.  The National Butterfly Center in Texas, located on the banks of the Rio Grande that separates the United States from Mexico, had filed a complaint to block construction of the border wall that became a centerpiece of Trump's presidency, saying it threatened the winged insects' habitat.  The private sanctuary's gardens are home to more than 200 species of butterfly as well as bobcats, coyotes, peccaries, armadillos and Texas tortoises.   But it will now be closed until further notice because \"the safety of our staff and visitors is our primary concern,\" Jeffrey Glassberg, president of the North American Butterfly Association, which runs the organization, said in a statement Wednesday.   Conspiracy theories linked by U.S. media to the far-right group QAnon have claimed the sanctuary was helping to bring illegal migrants to the U.S.  The facility already closed between January 28 and 30 because of \"credible threats\" related to an event held by supporters of the former president in nearby McAllen, Glassberg said.   Photos purporting to be from the center had been circulating along with messages accusing the organization of helping smugglers bring migrants to the U.S.  Several right-wing activists have posted videos on social media of themselves in front of the sanctuary.  \"We don't think the threat has passed,\" sanctuary Executive Director Marianna Trevino Wright told AFP on Wednesday, citing repeated \"provocations\" from these individuals.  Wright said she feared the allegations against the center would eventually push someone to \"take action.\"  \"We look forward to reopening, soon, when the authorities and the professionals who are helping us get past this situation give us the green light,\" Glassberg said, noting that employees would continue to receive their salaries during the closure.   The QAnon far-right conspiracy movement began in 2017 with claims that Democrats ran a satanic child-kidnapping sex-trafficking ring, and it's been blamed for fueling the riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 last year.  Trump has never condemned the movement, and even fed QAnon fever before the U.S. presidential election in 2020, floating his own conspiracy theories about a planeload of black-clad saboteurs disrupting his party convention.",

Anzalone said that he, like many Democratic strategists and pollsters, was far more worried than Mr. Biden about widespread Democratic loses in House, Senate and gubernatorial races. \"Joe Biden was right and I was wrong,\" Anzalone said. \"A bunch of things happened that we haven't seen happen in a long time. All the rules have been thrown out since 2016.\" Anzalone described these midterm surprises: \"The other thing is that those people who had a soft unfavorable view of him broke big towards the Democrats,\" Anzalone said. \"He wasn't a part of the bad part that people thought was going to happen.\" Democrats also had unexpected help, Anzalone said. \"Republicans gave us an assist,\" he said. \"One of the reasons those late deciders decided for Democrats is that there was just nominees that they couldn't vote for. This election cycle was between headwinds and head cases.\" As for Trump, who announced a third bid for the White House this week, Anzalone said nothing about his candidacy will deter Biden \u2014 who has said he intends to run for re-election but will not make a final decision until early 2023. \"I know enough about President Biden and his team that he believes he can beat Donald Trump, and I think he can beat Donald Trump like a drum,\" Anzalone said. \"I think Donald Trump is weakened right now. And I think that people have always underestimated the strength of Joe Biden.\" Anzalone, known in Democratic circles for his candor, said Democrats cannot afford to overlook their weaknesses. \"We still have a branding problem,\" Anzalone said. \"The American people think we are more interested in prioritizing social problems than economic problems. We also have a problem with rural America. We have to work on crime and immigration.\" Florida was a bright spot for Republicans, and Anzalone conceded the state's 30 electoral votes may be out of reach in 2024. \"Florida is a reclamation project,\" Anzalone said. \"Florida is really expensive.

            "article_content": "A court hearing for tennis star Novak Djokovic's appeal against a deportation order that threatens his participation in the Australian Open ended Sunday and a verdict was expected within hours. Federal Court Chief Justice James Allsop said he and two fellow judges hoped to reach a verdict later Sunday. The top-ranked male tennis player needs to win the appeal to defend his Australian Open title in play that begins on Monday. Tennis Australia, the tournament organizer, said it planned to release the schedule for Monday's matches about 75 minutes after the court adjourned. Djokovic is supposed to play on Day 1. Djokovic fought in a daylong urgent hearing the government's attempt to deport him based on Immigration Minister Alex Hawke's assessment that the top-ranked player is considered a \"talisman of a community of anti-vaccination sentiment.\" Hawke's lawyer Stephen Lloyd took aim at Djokovic's anti-vaccination stance and his \"history of ignoring COVID safety measures.\" Lloyd pointed to Djokovic testing positive for COVID-19 last month and attending a French media interview while infectious and removing his mask for a photo shoot. Djokovic has acknowledged that he made an error of judgment in those actions. \"The minister took the view that his presence in Australia would encourage people to emulate his apparent disregard for ... safety measures,\" Lloyd said. Lloyd said that Djokovic's \"presence in Australia was seen to pose an overwhelming risk.\" The minister canceled Djokovic's visa on Friday on the grounds that his presence in Australia may be a risk to the health and \"good order\" of the Australian public and \"may be counterproductive to efforts at vaccination by others in Australia.\" Australia has one of the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the world. Djokovic's lawyers argued that the minister provided no evidence that Djokovic's presence in Australia may \"foster anti-vaccination sentiment.\" Djokovic's lawyer Nick Wood also said the minister had failed to take into account how deporting Djokovic might \"galvanize anti-vax activists,\" as happened when the 34-year-old Serb faced deportation shortly after arriving in Melbourne on January 5. Djokovic supporters had called for a boycott of the Australian Open. Hundreds of activists held a peaceful rally outside the Melbourne Park complex that hosts the Australian Open on Saturday and planned another for Monday over Djokovic's treatment. \"We're at Rod Laver Arena to support Novak. He's won nine (Australian Open) titles here. Hopefully this will be No. 10 \u2014   if he can get out of quarantine and get his visa back,\" said Harrison McLean, one of the rally organizers. \"We're a peaceful movement, here to raise awareness and support everyone's freedom of choice.\" Lloyd said Hawke realized that canceling Djokovic's visa \"would result in some level of unrest.\" But the minister's concerns about the consequences of the Serb staying were greater. Djokovic spent Saturday night in an immigration detention hotel after he and his lawyers met with immigration officials earlier in the day. He was permitted to leave the hotel to spend Sunday in his lawyers' offices, under the guard of two immigration officials, while the challenge was heard via video conference. Djokovic had spent four nights confined to a hotel near downtown Melbourne before being released last Monday when he won a court challenge on procedural grounds against his first visa cancellation. Deportation from Australia can lead to a three-year ban on returning to the country, although that may be waived, depending on the circumstances. The Health Department advised that Djokovic was a \"low\" risk of transmitting COVID-19 and a \"very low\" risk of transmitting the disease at the Australian Open. Djokovic, who has won the last three Australian Open titles, is seeking a record 21st Grand Slam singles title. He is currently tied with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer for the most by a man in history. In a post on social media Wednesday that constituted his most extensive public comments yet on the episode, Djokovic blamed his agent for checking the wrong box on his travel document in a declaration on arrival in Australia, calling it \"a human error and certainly not deliberate.\" Hawke downplayed Djokovic's failure to disclose his travels to Spain and Serbia in the 14 days before he landed in Australia. Hawke said he was \"minded to give it some weight in favor of cancellation\" of his visa. The episode has touched a nerve in Australia, and particularly in Victoria state, where locals went through more than 260 days of lockdowns during the worst of the pandemic. Australia faces a massive surge in virus cases driven by the highly transmissible omicron variant. On Friday, the nation reported 130,000 new cases, including nearly 35,000 in Victoria state. Although many infected people aren't getting as sick as they did in previous outbreaks, the surge is still putting severe strain on the health system and disrupting supply chains. Djokovic's supporters in Serbia have been dismayed by the visa cancellations. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic accused the Australian government of \"harassing\" and \"maltreating\" Djokovic and asked whether Morrison's government is just trying to score political points ahead of upcoming elections. \"Why didn't you return him back right away, or tell him it was impossible to get a visa?\" Vucic asked the Australian authorities in a social media address. \"Why are you harassing him and why are you maltreating not only him, but his family and an entire nation that is free and proud.\" Everyone at the Australian Open is required to be vaccinated. According to Grand Slam rules, if Djokovic is forced to pull out of the tournament before the order of play for Day 1 is announced, No. 5 seed Andrey Rublev would move into Djokovic's spot in the bracket. If Djokovic withdraws from the tournament after Monday's schedule is released, he would be replaced in the field by what's known as a \"lucky loser\" \u2014 a player who loses in the qualifying tournament but gets into the main draw because of another player's exit before competition has started.",

            "article_content": "With midterm primaries helping set the direction for the Democratic and Republican parties, most Americans, including many of the parties' own voters, aren't terribly happy with the parties or what they're talking about. Given that Sunday's CBS News poll finds most aren't happy with the direction of the country either, the major political parties aren't providing much solace. For starters, the Democratic Party \u2014 which controls Congress and the presidency \u2014 is not seen by a majority as either \"effective\" or \"in touch,\" which are, no doubt, important measures for a party in power. The Democratic Party is more apt to be described as \"weak,\" a label applied by a slight majority of Americans, than it is \"strong.\"\u00a0 The Republican Party, for its part, is described by a slight majority as \"extreme,\" a term Americans apply to the GOP more so than to Democrats, though neither really escapes the label. Independents are more likely to call the GOP extreme. The GOP is described as \"strong\" more often than as \"weak,\" but it is also described by Americans more often as \"hateful\" than as \"caring\" \u2014 by double digits. Primaries tend to find candidates arguing over matters that appeal to their bases, but as different as each side's campaigns are, there is something voters of each side share: a desire for candidates to focus on inflation. Perhaps that's no surprise, given how large it looms for most Americans.\u00a0 Among Democrats, who also want a focus on taxing the wealthy and racial justice, many also want their candidates to focus on protecting abortion rights. In fact, especially among those who care a lot about the potential overturning of Roe v. Wade \u2014 almost all say they want the party's nominees to focus on abortion rights.\u00a0 Republicans want their nominees to focus on stopping illegal immigration and talk about traditional values. Illegal immigration is especially a priority among self-described conservative Republicans. A majority of independents also want the Democrats to focus on abortion rights.\u00a0 And there's an asymmetry on abortion focus between the parties: even more Democrats want their candidates to focus on supporting abortion rights than Republicans want their candidates to talk about opposing it. But despite being in power during a time of inflation, Democrats don't cede that much ground to Republicans on who's trusted to deal with it. It's 51% of Americans who trust the GOP, not much more than the 49% who trust the Democrats on inflation. It's the same nearly even gap on the economy. And that may be because the parties' candidates aren't talking about it enough. Democrats have an advantage being trusted on abortion and coronavirus. Within the Republican rank-and-file, there's a divide over how much they want to hear about loyalty to former President Donald Trump, some of which we're seeing play out in the primaries right now. A slight majority of Republicans do want their candidates to focus on showing loyalty to Trump, but nearly half don't. Related to this, four in 10 Republicans want the nominees focused on the 2020 election, but most don't. We also see such dramatic differences in which people Americans think the parties support \u2014 or don't. The overall picture reminds us of how much Americans see the parties dividing them, not only on policy, but by demographic groups. Americans overall are more likely to see the Republican Party as fighting for White people than for Black people \u2014 by more than two to one. In fact, more say the Republican Party fights against the interests of Black Americans than is neutral toward them. It's similarly true for views of the Republican Party's approach to Hispanic people, with more feeling it works against them, rather than for them, and by more than two to one, against LGBTQ people than for them. Americans do think the GOP fights more for people of faith than do Democrats. Conversely, they see the Democratic Party as fighting for Black and Hispanic Americans more so than for White Americans. Americans are more likely to believe the GOP fights more against the interests of women than for women, and women overall describe things this way.\u00a0 Men, meanwhile, are much more likely to think the Democrats fight more for women than for men, but a majority of men think the Republican Party fights for them (and more so than for women). Echoing some of these perceptions are big differences in how partisans within the parties approach the country's racial diversity \u2014 and each group's partisans tend to think they're not being treated fairly. Big majorities of Democrats think immigrants make America better in the long run; a majority of Republicans say they make America worse. Republicans are more likely to say White Americans suffer \"a lot\" of discrimination than they are to say Black Americans do. Democrats see quite the opposite. And Democrats are more likely to say it's very important for political leaders to condemn White nationalism. Republicans tend to see America's changing diversity as neither good nor bad, but those who take a position tend to say bad. Democrats (whose ranks are made up of more people of color) say it's a good thing.

            "article_content": "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 Novak Djokovic remained in limbo even after he was included in the draw for the Australian Open on Thursday, as the world's top-ranked men's tennis player awaited a government decision on whether to deport him for not being vaccinated against COVID-19. The stakes are particularly high since he's seeking a men's record 21st Grand Slam singles title.  Despite the cloud hanging over Djokovic's ability to compete, Australian Open organizers included the tournament's top seed in the draw. He's slated to play fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic, who's ranked No. 78 in the world, in the opening round next week. Djokovic's visa was canceled after he arrived in Melbourne last week when his vaccination exemption was rejected, but he won a legal battle on procedural grounds Monday that allowed him to stay in the country.  Immigration Minister Alex Hawke has been considering whether to deport Djokovic since Monday's court ruling. Expectations of a pending decision were raised when Prime Minister Scott Morrison called an afternoon news conference after a national Cabinet meeting. Speculation heightened when the tournament draw was postponed by 75 minutes to a time after Morrison's news conference.  The wait continued after both events concluded, with Morrison referring questions on Djokovic to his immigration minister.  \"These are personal ministerial powers able to be exercised by Minister Hawke and I don't propose to make any further comment at this time,\" Morrison said.  Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley also declined comment after the draw ceremony for the tournament, which starts Monday. Agence France-Presse reports that Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper is citing an unnamed government source as saying that letting Djokovic remain in Australia without being vaccinated would set a dangerous precedent. The 34-year-old Djokovic has been trying to focus his attention on the playing court in the four days since he was released from immigration detention. He held a practice session at Rod Laver Arena, his fourth this week, in the mid-afternoon.  He was on the practice court Wednesday when a statement posted on his social media accounts acknowledged that his Australian travel declaration form contained incorrect information.  In the statement, Djokovic blamed \"human error\" by his support team for failing to declare that he had traveled in the two-week period before entering Australia.   Giving false information on the form could be grounds for deportation. That could result in sanctions ranging up to a three-year ban from entering Australia, a daunting prospect for a player who's won almost half of his 20 Grand Slam singles titles here.  Djokovic acknowledged the lapses when he sought to clarify what he called \"continuing misinformation\" about his movements after he became infected last month. It also raised questions about his public appearances in Serbia last month, particularly a media interview he attended despite knowing he was positive. It was another twist in a saga over whether the athlete should be allowed stay in Australia despite not being vaccinated \u2013 itself part of a larger, worldwide debate over the rights of the unvaccinated.  The initial news that Djokovic was granted an exemption to strict vaccination rules to enter the country provoked an outcry and the ensuing dispute has since overshadowed the lead-up to the Open.  Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said most Australians disapproved of the nine-time and defending Australian Open champion coming to Melbourne to compete in breach of the nation's tough pandemic quarantine rules.  \"Most of us thought because Mr. Djokovic hadn't been vaxxed twice that he would be asked to leave,\" Joyce said. \"Well, that was our view, but it wasn't the court's view.\"  \"The vast majority of Australians ... didn't like the idea that another individual, whether they're a tennis player or ... the king of Spain or the Queen of England, can come up here and have a different set of rules to what everybody else has to deal with,\" Joyce added. Morrison is running for re-election and his government's handling of the Djokovic visa situation has, in some quarters, tarnished what had been general praise for its tough stand on border security during \u2013 and before the pandemic.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers are returning to Washington this week for the final sprint before the end of the 117th Congress, and the House and Senate face a laundry list of legislative items before the year's end, ranging from a must-pass bill to keep federal agencies operating to a plan to reform how Congress counts electoral votes. In the House, the lame-duck session marks Democrats' final opportunity to act on their legislative priorities before Republicans take control of the lower chamber with a narrow majority in January. But the December work period will also be filled with standard bills that Congress must take up, which will take up floor time. \"Whether it's strengthening our economy, improving our immigration system, protecting our national security, or safeguarding democracy around the world, we have important work ahead of us in December,\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer wrote in a letter to his Democratic colleagues Sunday. \"We must take full advantage of the coming weeks to deliver results for the people.\" Here is a look at the items on Congress's legislative to-do list for the lame-duck session. The Senate is poised to vote this week on final passage of the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would provide federal protections for same-sex and interracial marriages. Twelve Senate Republicans voted to advance the bill earlier this month, effectively ensuring it will win approval in the 50-50 Senate. Once the marriage equality legislation clears the Senate, it will head back to the House and, if passed, to President Biden's desk for his signature. An earlier version of the Respect for Marriage Act passed the House with support from 47 Republicans this summer. The Senate-approved plan includes protections for religious liberty, which could attract more GOP support. Congress is staring down a Dec. 16 deadline to pass legislation that funds the federal government. If lawmakers are facing a time crunch in reaching an agreement to keep agencies' lights on, they could vote on a short-term bill that would push the deadline to pass a government funding bill closer to the holidays. When appropriations leaders announced a stopgap measure in late September to fund the government through Dec. 16, they said the bill, known as a continuing resolution, afforded them more time to complete work on an omnibus package. But it's unclear whether they are near consensus on the spending plan for fiscal year 2023, and failure to reach agreement could force lawmakers to approve another short-term continuing resolution. The annual defense authorization bill is another piece of legislation that Congress must pass before the end of the year. The measure, which sets defense policy, has been passed every year for more than six decades. Former President Donald Trump's announcement this month that he is running for president for a third time added urgency to reforming the Electoral Count Act. Lawmakers in both chambers have proposed changes to the law after it served as the basis for Trump's legal strategy to overturn the results of a presidential election. The House passed its own reforms to the 1887 law in September. Called the Presidential Election Reform Act and sponsored by Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Zoe Lofgren of California, the measure ensures that Congress receives an electoral certificate from each state that accurately reflects the will of the voters, requires Congress to count electoral votes as the Constitution stipulates and reaffirms that the vice president's role in approving electoral votes is merely ministerial. The Senate has its own version, introduced by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia last month. Their proposal has more than three dozen co-sponsors, including 14 Republicans.\u00a0 The amount of support from GOP senators should clear the way for the bill to overcome a filibuster, though many of the Republicans who signed on to the plan are leaving Congress at the end of the year. In his letter to his fellow House Democrats, Hoyer acknowledged the House may need to take up the Senate's bill, writing the House's Democratic majority \"ought to take swift action to ensure that we secure reforms to our electoral count system.\" The White House asked Congress this month to provide an additional $10 billion to help respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious diseases, as well as another $37.7 billion in assistance for Ukraine. It's unclear, though, whether there is enough Republican support for emergency supplemental funding for the pandemic, and earlier requests from Mr. Biden were rebuffed by GOP lawmakers. Republicans have largely supported providing more money to Ukraine as it continues to defend itself from Russia, but such a request from the Biden administration could face new resistance from a GOP-led House, as some congressional Republicans have begun to question the need for more assistance to Ukraine. Amid stalled contract talks between rail workers' unions and railroads and a Dec. 9 strike deadline looming, Mr. Biden asked Congress on Monday to intervene to head off a rail shutdown by passing legislation \"immediately\" adopting a tentative agreement agreed to by the two sides' leaders\u00a0in September. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi then said lawmakers would take up this week a measure adopting the September deal, which the Biden administration helped broker.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape that aired Sunday, Sept. 18, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to democracy and politics. University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape studies political violence. And Professor Pape, Good morning to you.\u00a0 UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PROFESSOR ROBERT PAPE: Good morning.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here in person. When we spoke back in January, about the research you've done at that point, you issued a warning that stuck with us because you talked about the threat of political violence around the midterm elections. We are 50 days away. What are you worried about now? PAPE: Margaret, we have not just a political threat to our democracy, we have a violent threat to our democracy. It's important to remember that January 6, wasn't just trespassing and going into a federal building. Thousands of individuals used violence to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power. What we have been tracking at our center at the University of Chicago, the Chicago Project on Security and Threats, for a year and a half is the violent portion of that insurrectionist movement. Today, there are millions of individuals who don't just think the election was stolen in 2020; they support violence to restore Donald Trump to the White House. In fact, just over the weekend, that is just a few days ago, we conducted our most recent nationally representative survey. Today, there are 13 million individuals, the equivalent, I should say, of 13 million individuals who support the use of force to restore Donald Trump to the presidency. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's about five percent of the US population. PAPE: Five percent. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have extrapolated out from your research. That's obviously disturbing. I want to ask you about the context we are in right now, because we're seeing a lot of stressors, the economy clearly one of them, and what we've been talking about today, immigration and migration. You were on last time talking about something called the Great Replacement Theory, and that is the belief among some of these insurrectionists that the Democratic Party is trying to replace voters with new people, more obedient voters. How widespread is that conviction and does what is happening now in cities up and down the east coast trigger this? PAPE: It likely could Margaret reinforce these fears of the Great Replacement. To be clear, we're focusing on not just support for Trump, but the violent support for Trump that overrides democracy. And when you look at that, what you see is there are two big drivers among those 13 million individuals. The first driver is this fear of the Great Replacement, the idea that the Democratic Party is replacing the current electorate the current White electorate, with more minority voters from the third world. MARGARET BRENNAN: And to be clear, non-U.S. citizens cannot vote in federal elections in the midterm races just to be abundantly clear. PAPE: That's right. That is correct. It is a conspiracy theory but it's not just on fringe social media like Parler or Gab, 4chan, 8chan. This is every day on Fox News, it's on Newsmax, it's on One America, it's on talk radio. So this is driver number one. Driver number two is a belief in the Qanon cult idea, which at first blush sounds a little, almost laughable, that said they would believe a satanic group of pedophiles, runs the US government. But we've done focus groups with these folks. And what they really mean by that, Margaret, is that there are politicians that have gotten on the Lolita Express with Jeffrey Epstein, and have taken money for foundations, for political support-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Corruption. PAPE: For corruption. That's what's really going on. So if you marry those two together, you have a dangerous cocktail. You have the fear of this Great Replacement happening by a Democratic Party, and then you have the fear of corruption and immorality, and that's that dangerous combination that's leading to violent support against our democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you just mentioned Qanon. And as you just explained, it's a set of conspiracy theories involving sex trafficking, and there is this belief that President- former President Trump is the one person or one of the people who can end it all. And I want to play some video here because at a political rally last night, Mr. Trump used a song titled after a Qanon slogan. I'm going to play the sound, and and listeners will have to listen to the music, not necessarily what the President is saying, listen to the background music. DONALD TRUMP SOT: It would never have happened with me as your Commander in Chief. And for four long years, it didn't happen. and China, with Taiwan is next. MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a QAnon song. The former president has posted images of himself wearing a Q on his lapel on social media with the phrase, \"The storm is coming.\" That's another one of their slogans. What- what does all of this mean, and is it threatening? PAPE: First, it is threatening, just to cut right to the heart of it. What it means is that the former president is willing to court not just supporters of his but those who support violence for his goals, number one of which is being restored to the White House. This is extremely disturbing, because well, in the fall of 2020, in a presidential debate, Donald Trump could be asked, 'Well, do you know what a proud boy is, or do you know what QAnon is?' And he could say, 'Oh, I'm not so sure.' That's not the case today. Today, it's quite clear. And the problem that we face is that over and over in tweets by the former president, he is deliberately stoking not just the fires of anger getting him political support, but the fires that are leading to that violent 13, the equivalent of 13 million. And that is really the heart of our problem that we face as a threat to democracy. Because if it's just a political threat, well, then we can have elections, but once it's not just denying an election, but using violence as the response to an election denial, now we're in a new game. And that's why it's so important we have this conversation. MARGARET BRENNAN: What has the FBI search of the former president's home done to the people you are tracking? PAPE: So, what we've done in our poll, the one that we just recently did over the weekend, is we asked an additional question, which is, 'Do you believe that the use of force is justified to prevent the prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information?' And the numbers go up a bit. Not huge- goes from 13 to 15 million. But interestingly, when we pull apart the data, you get a slightly different set of supporters. So, what's really concerning is there's a little bit of ebb and flow that goes up as we see new issues come on the horizon and that means that we need to just realize this is really important, and we need to have this national conversation about what we really want in our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's why we have you here today to- to start that conversation sir. Thank you for sharing your information. We'll be back in a moment.",

            "article_content": "A group of Democratic senators on Thursday joined Republican lawmakers in introducing a measure that would temporarily block the Biden administration's plan to end pandemic-related restrictions that allow border authorities to quickly expel migrants. The proposal, co-sponsored by six Republican senators and five moderate Democratic senators, would prevent the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from following through with an order published last week that will stop authorizing the border rule, known as Title 42, in late May. Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly of Arizona; Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire; Jon Tester of Montana; and Joe Manchin of West Virginia co-sponsored the bill, alongside Republican Sens. James Lankford of Oklahoma; John Thune of South Dakota; John Cornyn of Texas; Thom Tillis of North Carolina; Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Rob Portman of Ohio. The measure is expected to be proposed as an amendment to the latest COVID-19 relief package that Congress is debating, according to a person familiar with the plan. Axios first reported the details of the bill Wednesday evening. Since it was enacted in 2020 as a temporary pandemic response measure by the Trump administration, Title 42 has allowed U.S. border officials to summarily expel migrants to Mexico or their native countries, bypassing laws that require the government to interview asylum-seekers to ensure they won't face harm if deported. For over a year, the Biden administration said the expulsions were needed to contain the spread of COVID-19 inside border processing facilities. But after judicial setbacks and political pressure from liberal Democrats, the CDC announced last week it would stop authorizing the migrant expulsions on May 23.\u00a0 CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the expulsions were no longer necessary because of improving pandemic conditions, including the drop in coronavirus cases since the Omicron surge this winter and increased vaccination rates in the U.S. and migrants' native countries. But the measure introduced Thursday would require the administration to first end the national COVID-19 public health emergency declaration and then notify Congress about a planned termination of Title 42. After such a notification is made, the CDC would have to wait at least 60 days before rescinding Title 42. During that 60-day timeframe, the CDC would be required to consult with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees border agents, to submit a plan to Congress about how the government would address a potential spike in migrant arrivals once Title 42 is lifted. If that plan is not submitted within 30 days of the original notification, any effort to end Title 42 would need to be delayed by 30 days after the plan is sent to Congress. The Democratic support for Thursday's bill illustrates the intra-party dispute among Democrats triggered by the CDC's decision to wind down the Title 42 expulsions, which is already being used by Republican campaigns to attack President Biden and vulnerable Democrats ahead of the November midterm elections.\u00a0 Two of the bill's co-sponsors, Kelly and Hassan, are up for reelection in swing states. Other Democrats facing reelection fights have criticized the planned Title 42 rescission, including Senators Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, although they did not co-sponsor Thursday's bill. Like their Republican colleagues, Democratic critics of the Title 42 announcement have said DHS is not ready to respond to the expected sharp increase in border arrivals that officials are preparing for once the expulsions stop. \"The Biden administration was wrong to set an end date for Title 42 without a comprehensive plan in place,\" Kelly said in a statement Thursday. \"We need a secure, orderly, and humane response at our southern border and our bipartisan legislation holds the Biden administration accountable to that.\" DHS officials have said they are mobilizing additional personnel, including Border Patrol agents; securing more buses and aircraft to transport migrant families; and erecting new migrant processing facilities along the southern border in anticipation of the expected increase in migration. A White House official said Congress should not delay passage of the coronavirus relief package by trying to add \"unrelated issues,\" noting the funding is \"needed right now to protect the American people.\" \"If we do not have treatments, if we do not have the medicine people need, Americans will die from COVID whether they support or oppose the administration on immigration, or child care, or environmental rules,\" the White House official told CBS News. In an interview with \"CBS News Evening News\" anchor and managing editor Norah O' Donnell on Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the U.S. could \"very well\" see a spike in border arrivals, but noted his department is preparing for different contingencies, including by surging resources and expanding transportation capabilities. \"What distinguishes us from the past is the fact that we will not implement policies of cruelty that disregard our asylum laws,\" Mayorkas said. \"We are rebuilding a system that was entirely dismantled.\" While some moderates have expressed skepticism about Title 42's end, many Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have been calling for the policy's termination for months, saying the expulsions were part of a Trump administration effort to gut the U.S. asylum system.\u00a0 On Wednesday, Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, posted a \"reminder\" on Twitter regarding U.S. border policy. \"Responsible stewardship of our border, and honoring our moral and legal obligations to treat immigrants and refugees with dignity, are not mutually exclusive,\" he wrote. \"We can, and MUST, do both.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "Andy Ogles, a far-right county mayor, won Tennessee's crowded Republican primary on Thursday in a reconfigured congressional district in left-leaning Nashville that the party is hoping to flip in November. In a warning ahead of the general election, he said, \"Liberals, we're coming for you.\" Ogles, the Maury County mayor and onetime leader of the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity's state chapter, emerged among nine candidates after a hard-fought primary for the state's 5th Congressional District. The seat drew heavy interest from Republicans after GOP state lawmakers carved Nashville into three districts, leading incumbent Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper to announce his retirement. \"We're at war. This is a political war, a cultural war, and it's a spiritual war,\" Ogles said in his victory speech. \"And as we go forward, we've got to get back to honoring God and country.\" Ogles will face Democratic state Sen. Heidi Campbell in November. The new district favored Donald Trump over Joe Biden by 12 percentage points in 2020. Voters in Tennessee's primary elections also cast ballots for a Democratic gubernatorial nominee to take on Republican Gov. Bill Lee in November. The Democratic primary remained too early to call Friday morning between Nashville physician Jason Martin and Memphis City Councilman JB Smiley Jr. Smiley would be the state's first Black nominee for governor. Martin, a political newcomer, said he was spurred to run by Lee's hands-off response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lee will have a strong advantage in November in a state that has not elected a Democrat to statewide office since 2006. He defeated a Democratic opponent by 21 percentage points in 2018.  In the congressional race, Ogles won Republican Sen. Ted Cruz's endorsement and overcame a fundraising advantage from his top opponents, former Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell and retired Tennessee National Guard Brig. Gen. Kurt Winstead. He also benefited the most from third-party groups, which ran TV ads touting his opposition to COVID-19 mandates and dragging down his opponents as insufficiently conservative. Ogles described the GOP primary as \"establishment versus the conservative wing of the party,\" saying voters were getting a \"true conservative\" in his nomination. He didn't shy from inflammatory comments during his victory speech, calling for the impeachment of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as treason charges against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas over the administration's handling of immigration issues. At a debate in July, Ogles accused the Biden administration of \"deliberately and intentionally\" attacking Americans \"by weaponizing COVID\" and \"destroying our energy policy.\" \"It's time we impeached 'Slow Joe.' It's time we impeached Kamala Harris, and it's time we get rid of Nancy Pelosi,\" he said. Campbell, who was unopposed in her Democratic primary, said the race was \"symbolic of the crossroads\" the country finds itself at. \"One where we move forward together, protecting working families, our freedoms, and future \u2014 or one where extreme politicians turn us backward, controlling our lives and ruling for the wealthy few,\" she said before the GOP primary was called for Ogles. Redrawn congressional districts helped put Tennessee among the states where Republicans hope to flip a seat in a push to reclaim control of the U.S. House. Tennessee held the only statewide elections in the nation Thursday. In the other two Nashville-area districts, the Republican incumbents had no primary opponents. The new maps weight their districts in their favor. In the new 6th District, which includes more of the city, Republican U.S. Rep. John Rose brings a huge fundraising edge into a general election against Democrat Randal Cooper, who defeated a primary opponent. Over in the new 7th District, Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green ran unopposed and will face Democrat Odessa Kelly, who also didn't face an opponent. But at least in Nashville, anyone who turned on a TV was more likely to see ads for a Republican running for the 5th Congressional District than a candidate for anything else.  The election marked the first time voters get a say over a seat that had been subject to months of Republican political brokering. Political infighting over the carefully crafted district that meanders through six counties led the state Republican Party to boot three candidates off the ballot, including Trump's pick, former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus. One of the booted candidates, video producer Robby Starbuck, was attempting a write-in campaign. One local contest stood out Thursday. In the Shelby County district attorney's race, Democratic challenger Steve Mulroy was leading incumbent Republican Amy Weirich, who drew national attention when she prosecuted Pamela Moses, a Black woman, for registering to vote erroneously, resulting in a six-year prison sentence that was later discarded. Weirich has been criticized for failing to say outright whether she will or won't prosecute doctors who perform abortions. Mulroy said he would make abortion prosecutions \"extremely low priority.\" Lee, meanwhile, is the first governor to avoid a primary challenge since Democratic Gov. Ned McWherter in 1990, said Tennessee legislative historian Eddie Weeks. Weeks said he could not find an African American nominee for governor, Democrat or Republican, in state history. Yet, he noted that in 1876, William Yardley, an African American Knoxville official later elected to the county court, ran as an independent when the Republican Party declined to nominate a candidate for governor. Democratic Gov. James Davis Porter won reelection that year. Tennessee had a Black Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate as recently as 2020.",

            "article_content": "Generation Z now has two candidates with a chance of heading to Congress. On Tuesday, 25-year-old Karoline Leavitt won the Republican nomination in New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District, CBS News projected, propelling her to face off against Democratic incumbent Rep. Chris Pappas in November.\u00a0 \"We were outspent, but we were NOT outworked,\" Leavitt tweeted after her victory. \"Thank you to the people of my home district for believing in me! I am humbled by the outpouring of support. ... Tonight, we celebrate. Tomorrow, the work continues.\"\u00a0 VICTORY! \u2705We were outspent, but we were NOT outworked. Thank you to the people of my home district for believing in me! I am humbled by the outpouring of support and honored to be your #NH01 Republican Nominee.Tonight, we celebrate. Tomorrow, the work continues. Leavitt's projected win comes less than a month after Gen Z got its first member past the primaries. In August, Florida Democrat Maxwell Frost won a crowded primary in Florida's 10th Congressional District. The 25-year-old is set to run against Republican Calvin Wimbish in November in the heavily Democratic district. While they both represent the same generation, they are running on vastly different platforms. Frost is working to advocate for stronger gun laws, better health care and improved focus on environmental justice. Leavitt's campaign has heavily focused on increased police funding and the protection of qualified immunity, more immigration laws, opposition to \"red flag\" gun laws, and anti-abortion policies. According to her website, she worked as a presidential writer under former President Donald Trump in 2018 and later served as an assistant press secretary in the White House press office.\u00a0 \"I helped prepare Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany for high-pressure briefings, fought against the biased mainstream media, and proudly helped message President Trump's America First agenda that uplifted the forgotten men and women and small business families like my own,\" she says on her website.\u00a0 After the 2020 election, she said she worked as communications director for Rep. Elise Stefanik, the House GOP conference chair, to help lead messaging \"against President Biden, Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats' radical agenda.\" She is also known to have repeated Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, The New York Times reported.\u00a0 Leavitt received support from some significant conservative leaders, including Stefanik, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Utah Rep. Jim Jordan. But House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy backed one of her opponents in the GOP primary, Matt Mowers. Gail Huff Brown, whose husband is former moderate GOP Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts, was also in the race. Trump congratulated Leavitt on her win, posting on his Truth Social site that she did an \"amazing job.\"\u00a0 \"Against all odds, she did it \u2014 and will have an even greater victory on November 8th. Wonderful energy and wisdom,\" he wrote, later adding, \"The 'Trumpiest' people ALL won in New Hampshire last night.\"\u00a0 Thank you, President Trump!\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/yHyYO7BSdI Li Cohen is a social media producer and trending content writer for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "At the Smithsonian Institution, historian Jon Grinspan is a curator in charge of that part of the \"Nation's Attic\" that holds the objects of American democracy and politics. \"I call this the fossil record,\" he said, \"that just as the Smithsonian is known for its dinosaurs, these are the fossils of democracy.\" He showed CBS News' John Dickerson artifacts of America's political life: \"These are objects from both the deep history of American democracy and recent events, from elections, protests, what have you. And you start to see techniques and devices reappear over time. These things kind of rhyme with each other. These objects almost talk to each other across different periods.\" Grinspan is also an author, who was working on his latest book about the violence in American politics at the end of the 19th century, \"The Age of Acrimony,\" when his work started to feel increasingly like a study of our own time.  Dickerson asked, \"When you were writing about these themes from the late 19th century, you're also seeing it out your window in American democracy at that present moment.\" \"Seeing these things from our past, these really ugly trends that I had thought we'd put away, be kind of reverse-engineered and come back, it's eerie,\" Grinspan said. \"It's too relevant all of a sudden.\" Torches carried five years ago by white supremacists in Charlottesville recall torches carried by advocates of the opposite position in the 1860s \u2013 anti-slavery marchers, the \"Wide Awakes.\" After the Civil War, blacks were attacked for exercising their newfound right to vote. Opponents of immigration questioned what it meant to be a \"real\" American. The recession of 1873 was followed by a hotly-contested presidential election. Whether it's 150 years ago or today, when political affiliations become so closely associated with people's identities, conflict is no longer about ideas; it's personal.  A recent Pew Research Center poll found that growing shares in each party now describe those in the other party as more closed-minded, dishonest, immoral, and unintelligent \u2026 just like in the 19th century.  Dickerson asked, \"Is that basically the most important distinction for us to pay attention to, which is not the strength of your beliefs, but the strength of your fear of the other side?\" \"When American politics is at its ugliest, there's a sense among perpetrators of violence that the other side should not be participating, [and] has no right to be engaged,\" Grinspan said.  To bring us back from the brink today, Grinspan suggests we look at how 19th century leaders cooled the passions of their times.  \"How did they do it in a system that was rewarding acrimony?\" asked Dickerson.  \"One of the things that drives this is that there's always a sense that a certain class of politicians should be removed from the ugliness of politics, that presidents in particular are supposed to be a friendly national grandfather,' Grinspan said.  \"So, there was a wall between politics and the presidency. And that wall has been eroded.\" \"It's fascinating from a historian's perspective, to see how many things that seemed set, that seemed like the norms of democracy, are just because people follow them until they don't.\" \"How do we survive this period where it seems only to be escalating towards something dangerous?\" Grinspan replied, \"That's the fundamental question, and there's a big transition from a political system that's deeply public and fought out in the public square to one that's private, where you don't talk about politics at the dinner table. And this sense that restraint is the key value in democracy? It sounds too easy. You say restraint and it works. But if you say something enough in the culture, that's how you make change.\"  READ AN EXCERPT: \"The Age of Acrimony\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For more info: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Story produced by Ed Forgotson.

And this week on FACE THE NATION: The U.S. faces some tough questions on public health and public safety. Americans are gathering for the holidays, some for the first time in years, but health officials are warning a pandemic-weary populace of the dangers posed by a triple threat of respiratory viruses. (Begin VT) DR. ANTHONY FAUCI (Outgoing Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases): Masking, vaccine, boosting, testing, all of that is part of the spectrum of protecting yourself and your family. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will check in with President Biden's chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, as he prepares to step down next month. Then, after a string of deadly mass shootings, a new reckoning with a familiar question: What can America's leaders do to stop them? (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): The idea we still allow semiautomatic weapons to be purchased is sick. It's just sick. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will ask a top Democratic leader, South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn, whether Capitol Hill can deliver on President Biden's push to ban assault weapons. And we will speak to Colorado Governor Jared Polis about the challenge of enforcing existing gun laws. He will share the latest on that shooting at an LGBTQ nightclub. Plus, former Homeland Security Secretaries Jeh Johnson and Michael Chertoff on what Democrats and Republicans can do together to stem the violence and prepare our immigration system for a change at the Southern border. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. For many Americans, Thanksgiving felt almost normal this year. But a year after the deadly surge of COVID's Omicron variant, we are not out from under the virus just yet. The CDC says a new COVID variant of concern, XBB, has surfaced in the U.S. And on the other side of the world, China is reporting a fourth daily record of new COVID infections, as an unprecedented wave of protests ripples across the country. Demonstrators from Shanghai to Beijing are taking to the streets in anger over China's zero COVID policies that have kept much of the country under pandemic quarantine for years. Those restrictions are weighing on the global economy and threaten to snarl supply chains ahead of the holidays. But we begin this morning in the U.S. with the danger posed by three respiratory viruses. We spoke with President Biden's chief medical adviser earlier and asked him about the risks for people congregating this season. (Begin VT) ANTHONY FAUCI: The risk depends on what your status of vaccination is. We have two of the three of the trifecta that you're talking about. We have vaccinations for, clearly, COVID, particularly with the updated boosters that are now available. We have vaccinations for influenza. We're already starting to see an early surge of both flu and RSV. We don't have a vaccine for RSV, this particularly problematic for children 5 years of age and younger and for the elderly. But there are things you can do with RSV, is avoid congregate settings, and particularly if you have a cold or if you are sneezing, and stay home, wear a mask, wash your hands. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said last time test going in and test coming out. ANTHONY FAUCI: Test yourself before you congregate with people, particularly when you're having someone over the dinner, five, 10, 15, 20 people. It's easy to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about RSV, though, specifically with little kids. These infections are overwhelming pediatric hospital wards around the country. ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Children's Hospital Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics say it's a public health emergency. Is it an emergency? ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes. In some regions of the country, we're seeing that the hospital system for pediatrics are at the point of almost being overwhelmed. When you have like almost all the intensive care beds that are occupied, it's bad for the children who have RSV and need intensive care. But it also occupies all the beds. And children who have a number of other diseases that require intensive care or ICU, they don't have the bed for it. Hopefully, we're going to see that peak come down, because, if you look at other countries that have had those kinds of peaks with flu and RSV, it's peaked early, but come down. MARGARET BRENNAN: More than 100,000 parents last month had to stay home from work to care for kids, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And we've seen schools in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee cancel classes because of these large numbers. ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, coming out of the holidays, should parents expect schools to shut down? ANTHONY FAUCI: I don't know, Margaret. I'm not sure. When -- when you talk about shutting down schools, there's always the collateral effects. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's also radioactive to talk about. (LAUGHTER) ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes, exactly. There's always the collateral issue. So, you have to balance. And you do it in real time, depending upon the viral load of disease in your region. MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of these places just didn't even have teachers. (CROSSTALK) ANTHONY FAUCI: Exactly. Well, that's the local decision you're going to have to make. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ANTHONY FAUCI: It's a local issue. That's the thing that gets lost in the discussion. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how do people -- knowing everything you just laid out, how do they calculate their risk and protect themselves? I mean, for an older person, is it something they need to think twice about when it comes to sitting across from their grandchild at Christmas? ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes, I mean, it is a judgment call. And one of the things you have to be careful of is that look around, not only for your own protection, but for the protection of the people that you're going to be in contact with, particularly, as you mentioned quite correctly, the elderly, those with underlying conditions. But there's also something that is even more risky, people who are profoundly immune-compromised, people who are on cancer chemotherapy, people who have a variety of other diseases. So, you got to use common sense. I mean, the idea of coming into a crowded place and you're going home to someone who's immune-compromised, it just makes sense to put a mask on. MARGARET BRENNAN: You recently had COVID. ANTHONY FAUCI: I did. MARGARET BRENNAN: I wonder how that changes when you calculate your risk these days. And how long do you think immunity actually lasts? ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, we know how much antibody immunity lasts, because you can measure antibodies. They go up, and they come down pretty quickly. It is entirely likely that although you may get infected with mild symptoms, the degree of protection against severe disease may be much more prolonged than the very transient degree of protection against infection. Let me give you an example. You measured me, I'm an elderly person, so my immune system isn't as robust as it was 30, 40 years ago. I was vaccinated, doubly boosted, and I got infected. Now, the -- the antibodies that were circulating in my body were not enough to protect me from getting infected, but it is very likely that the vaccination and double-boosting that I had protected me from getting a severe outcome that, if I didn't have that, I very well might have gotten very seriously ill. And I had a very mild infection. What I want people to understand is that although you may get infected with these new variants that are related to the Omicron, you may not be protected against infection. You're doing a pretty good job of protecting you against severe disease. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're making a case for vaccination, at least. ANTHONY FAUCI: I'm totally making a case. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: But I'm not seeing -- but people think: Oh, I got a three-month free pass, I just had COVID. ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But they can still get new variants. ANTHONY FAUCI: They -- MARGARET BRENNAN: They can still get sick in that window of time. ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes, exactly. Exactly. So, what you really want is, keep up on your boosters, because the -- the protection clearly wanes. It wanes much more for -- for infection than it does for severe disease, but it does wane. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what is the prevalent strain that you think we're going to be facing this winter? And does the recent booster shot, the bivalent, protect against it? ANTHONY FAUCI: OK. The ones that are on our minds right now that you do remember is the BQ.1 and the BQ.1.1. The reason you keep an eye on those is that they have what's called a transmission advantage, in that they are evasive of the protection that you have. Those viruses evade the protection of the monoclonal antibodies, Evusheld and some of the other monoclonal antibodies that are used for treatment, as well as prevention. It also diminishes the protection that is induced by vaccination and by prior infection. It doesn't disappear, but it brings it down a few fold. MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you envisioning that, in the spring, we're going to have to get a new sort of cocktail of booster shots to match this new threat? ANTHONY FAUCI: I don't know, because it really depends on what is going to happen in the spring. If we get -- and this is what I'm hoping for -- I'm a cautious optimist -- is, by the time we get to the spring, the level of immunity that's induced by infection, with or without vaccination, with or without boosters, among the entire population is such that the level of severe disease and infection is going to go way, way down, and you won't require having every four months or so giving somebody a boost. You heard us, we in the public health arena, talk about the likelihood of getting a cadence of maybe once a year -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ANTHONY FAUCI: -- that you get it with the flu shot. MARGARET BRENNAN: Like a flu shot. Mm-hmm. ANTHONY FAUCI: Just like the flu shot, but it's a little bit iffy about that. That's good, because there's a neatness to that. Once a year, you get it in the fall. But that doesn't take into account that you have to keep up the possibility that we will get a variant that's very different than the variants we have right now that might require a springtime or some summertime boost. If it stays the way it is now, I hope it just gets down to that very low level. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will have more of our conversation with Dr. Fauci ahead in the program. But, right now, I want to speak to House Majority Whip Democratic Congressman Jim Clyburn, who joins us from Santee, South Carolina, this morning. Congressman, it's good to have you on the program. I want to start with what has happened in the past two weeks. We've had these three mass shootings. Back in June, you helped to push through this bipartisan investment in shoring up red flag laws and background checks, $13 billion expansion. And yet, in Virginia, both of the gun buyers legally purchased their weapons, allegedly. So did the one in Colorado. What does that tell you about the efficacy of the federal law? REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC): Well, thank you very much for having me. It tells me all I need to know. And that is, just because it's legal does not make it the right thing. I tell people all the time, the institution of slavery was legal, but it was not right. Just because they purchased these weapons legally does not mean that's what the law ought to be. We need to change these laws. Unfortunately, I'm going to be here in my district on Wednesday speaking at the funeral service of one of those young football players from the University of Virginia who died at the hands of the weapon that was, from all indications, legally purchased. That's not the problem. Chesapeake, Virginia, that gun was purchased legally the morning of the event. We have to visit these laws and do what's necessary to keep these guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. And that is what we need to do in this lame-duck session, and in a bipartisan way. Let's protect the American people from demented people and make sure that we put some safety and security in peoples when they're shopping, when you're sitting in churches. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, yes. Well, what about that lame-duck session? Because Democrats have control for a few more weeks. President Biden came out and said he wants to institute an assault weapons ban. An assault weapon, an AR-15 style, was used in Colorado, but not in those two Virginia shootings. So, is the problem that type of weapon? And, if that is the solution you're putting forward, how do you get 60 votes in the Senate? JAMES CLYBURN: Well, I don't know how you get 60 votes in the Senate. And that's why I always take issue with the fact we do not control the Senate. It's 50/50 in the Senate. And that is a problem for us. We need to sit down in a bipartisan way and say, look, what can we do to protect the public? Nobody wants to take anybody's guns away. Your Second Amendment is there to protect everybody. But so is the First Amendment. But it's not unfettered. It's very clear. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, so what are you going to do in the lame-duck? You just said, in the lame-duck, you have to take action? What does that mean? What are Democrats going to do? JAMES CLYBURN: Well, we've already passed the bills in the house. We're trying to get the Senate to act. We've done this on the House side. And so that's the problem. Democrats control the House. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JAMES CLYBURN: And we passed the bill. We do not control the Senate. MARGARET BRENNAN: And -- JAMES CLYBURN: And that's where the filibuster is causing us problems. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And in the new Congress after January, is the prospect of any kind of gun reform dead on arrival, or can you pick off some votes from Kevin McCarthy's caucus here to help move something when Democrats are in the minority? JAMES CLYBURN: Well, if you look at the results of the election, and you go to California, you go to New York, even in two districts in North Carolina, when we picked up seats, we do have a more moderate electorate coming in. And we need to appeal to a sense of fundamental fairness and what is right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. JAMES CLYBURN: I have no idea whether or not they will buck what seems to be controlling the Republicans, but we're going to give it a shot. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, White House adviser Anita Dunn was on this program a few weeks ago, and she said, in the next few weeks, while Democrats have the majority, priority number one is just keeping the government funded. Exactly what is your top priority? I mean, what can Democrats get done before Republicans take control? JAMES CLYBURN: Well, I would agree with Anita Dunn. It's always the top priority keeping the government funded and keeping it open. (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: That seems the bare minimum. JAMES CLYBURN: At a minimum, absolutely, but we need to go further than that. We need to look at the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. I'm not going to get off of that. I do believe that we need to do something about the Electoral Count Reform Act. These two things are fundamental to our democracy. And we need to keep them in the forefront. Yes, keep the government open, but let's also keep fundamental rights protected. And that, to me, would be one and two, and these gun safety laws would be closely thereafter. MARGARET BRENNAN: Democrats are holding leadership elections in the coming week. You're already in leadership. I know you will be standing for election to a different position. But if it is time for a new generation, as Speaker Pelosi had said, Why do you think it's necessary for you to stay in power? Do you think the next generation needs you to guide them? JAMES CLYBURN: Well, I have always said there is a healthy respect. It's Biblical with me. We need to have a healthy blend of strength and knowledge. And look at our leadership. The South is left out of it. And what I'm doing is trying to make sure that we do not tilt too far to the East or too far to the West, but maintain what we have here. There's no other Southerner among the leadership ranks, and we need the South. We need these historically black colleges and universities. But for Georgia, where would the Senate be today? And the last time I checked, Georgia is south of South Carolina. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. All right. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Whip, for joining us today. And we want to continue that conversation about some of the national security risks, including gun violence. We're going to do that now with two former homeland security chiefs. I have got Jeh Johnson, who served under former President Obama. He's in Montclair, New Jersey, this morning. And Michael Chertoff held the job under former President George W. Bush. He's at home in Washington, D.C. Good morning to you both, gentlemen. You just heard the conversation. Representative Clyburn says you got to work together, but also said they can't get anything done in the Senate. So, where does that leave us in the wake of three shootings? Is further legislation just not something we should even be talking about at this point? JEH JOHNSON (Former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security): Well, Margaret, I will start. (CROSSTALK) MICHAEL CHERTOFF (Former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security): Well, I think we could get some legislation on assault weapons. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. MICHAEL CHERTOFF: And that would be helpful. But recognize, no law is going to deal with the problem entirely. As you pointed out, you have people who legally bought guns and then committed these horrible acts. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MICHAEL CHERTOFF: So, although legislation is part of the solution, another part of the solution is dealing with what is emerging to be a -- almost a mental health crisis leading to violent acts. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeh, sorry. Jeh Johnson there, I want you to jump in. I mean, the -- it was a handgun in Charlottesville, Virginia. It was a handgun in Chesapeake, Virginia. It was an AR-15 style in Colorado Springs. So is it that -- a gun crisis? Is it a mental health crisis? Which is it? JEH JOHNSON: Well, first and foremost, Margaret, I believe that the problem, the central problem, the common thread through all of these incidents is the prevalence of guns in America. The individual circumstances of each episode tend to be a little different. The motive tends to be different. The location is different. The weapon is different. But the problem we have in this country nationwide is the prevalence of guns in America. I do not for a second give up on the possibility of further gun safety legislation. We have to get off this point of view of the NRA that, if they give an inch, we're going to take a mile. We can regulate guns in America, consistent with the Second Amendment, consistent with the constitutional right of a responsible gun owner to own a gun for hunting, for their own personal safety of their family. And Mike is also right. There's more to do on the mental health front. There's more to do to raise awareness among co-workers, families, people in school -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JEH JOHNSON: -- about the warning signs of someone heading toward violence, so that the signs are undeniable at some point. MARGARET BRENNAN: But how do you solve for a mental health crisis, Secretary Chertoff? I mean, where do you begin? MICHAEL CHERTOFF: Well, I know we begin with what we call red flag laws, in which someone's guns can be taken away if there's a report that they have a propensity to violence or they have been talking about doing something that would involve killing people. So, certainly, enforcing those red flag laws is a positive step. More generally, I think we need off-ramps for people who are troubled and prone to be violent that do not involve the criminal justice process, so we encourage family members to step forward and get help for someone who might, given the passage of time, pick up a gun and do an act of violence. And, finally, I do think the social media have a responsibility to monitor for violent, inciting rhetoric on public platforms. Unfortunately, we see a lot of the people who've carried out these attacks literally announced them in advance, and the tragedy is, nobody intervenes to stop it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Secretary Jeh Johnson, I mean, you just heard me talk about with Jim Clyburn the fact that there were red flag laws in place in, for example, Colorado. Each state has sort of different attributes to their laws and who can call in a worry to remove guns from the household of someone. Is this just going to continue to be a patchwork of different problems because of the federal system? JEH JOHNSON: I think Mike and I both know that, in these cases, it is almost always certain that the warning signs are apparent. People often don't want to see them, however. The parent doesn't want to see them. The good friend in school doesn't want to see them. The co-worker doesn't want to see them, doesn't want to report. And so, as I said before, I think it's important that we raise awareness about what these warning signs are, in fact. Could we better enforce our red flag laws? Could we encourage people to invoke them, to utilize them more often? Absolutely. I agree with Mike on that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK. JEH JOHNSON: But the warning signs are almost always there. They're undeniable. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk more about this with both of you in a moment, but I have to take a quick break, so please stay with us. And, all of you, please stay with us as well. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: A pair of numbers this weekend offered some perspective on two American holiday traditions, traveling and spending; 55 million people were in transit this week, the third busiest Thanksgiving travel season in more than 20 years, according to AAA. And consumers spent more than $9 billion online on Black Friday, according to Adobe Analytics. That's a record high, but up just over 2 percent from last year. Important caveat to note: Due to soaring inflation, many spent more, but received less. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR, or we're available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. And we're replayed on our CBS News Streaming Network throughout the day on Sundays. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE) conversation with former Homeland Security Secretaries Jeh Johnson and Michael Chertoff. Gentlemen, I like being able to have you both here because you've both dealt with a very hard problem set. And so a lot of people have opinions but you actually know what it's like to be in the job. So, let me give you a really hard one, which is what to do about the southern border. In the last year, 2.5 million migrants, roughly, have been encountered. That is a record high. The governor of Texas is boasting that he's sent more than 13,000 immigrants to New York, to Chicago, to Washington and now to Philadelphia, where bus loads arrived this week. Secretary Chertoff, these migrants have legal status because they're going through asylum. Are the asylum laws too generous in this country? MICHAEL CHERTOFF: Well, I mean, we can certainly take a look at the asylum laws, but generally we obey international law, which talks about the obligation to receive refugees. And, in fact, now we have the issues of Ukrainians who were fleeing what is going on with the war in Ukraine. So, certainly you can understand why people seek asylum. One of the things the administration has done, which I think is helpful, is they've moved the evaluation process down to those agents who are actually in the field, to speed it up, to make sure you can determine whether there's a colorable claim and, if not, send people back. And they're also working to resource and streamline the process of making final adjudications. So that's all to the good, but it's not going to happen overnight. Also, I know the administration is working with nonprofits to create safe locations that people can stay while their claims are being adjudicated. I think stunts like what Governor Abbott has done really don't address the problem. They're simply a way of getting attention over the backs of people who are fleeing genuine crises in other parts of the world. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because to get asylum, you need to show fear of persecution, torture because of race, religion, nationality, political opinions, other reasons. That's what these people did and were allowed in, just to be clear. Former Secretary Johnson, you know, one of the things the Biden administration just lost, though, is one of the tools they were using to turn people away. And over 1 million of those encounters I talked about were -- people were expelled under Title 42, according to Custom and Border Protection. This was a pandemic-era policy that said because of COVID people didn't necessarily need to get in to the country. That goes away at the end of December. What then happens? JEH JOHNSON: Well, first, Margaret, I have to be honest about the asylum laws and the processes. It takes six years right now to process an asylum claim once someone has entered this country. And one of the problems is that the bar to qualify initially and establish a case of credible fear is relatively low, something like 70 percent of migrants qualify who seek it. And the ultimate qualification for asylum, the percentage there, is only about 20 percent, and it's six years in between. Migrants know this. And so we've got to develop a system where we can more expeditiously deal with these claims, but also take a look at the credible fear standard itself. I know my friends on the left won't be to happy to hear that, but it does exist and it's a phenomena. MARGARET BRENNAN: No politician is going to take that vote. JEH JOHNSON: Well, it can be done possibly through regulation. And I think it's something that ought to be looked at. Now, in terms of Title 42, when CDC first announced in May that it was going to lift this, I and others were opposed to it. We thought there needed to be a more orderly transition. It is an extraordinary authority. And it's probably time now for it to go away in December. But the ability to send people back expeditiously like the administration has been doing needs to now be replaced with something else. And I think there the discussion is going to have to take place with Mexico to more expeditiously accept people back. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JEH JOHNSON: We sent back something like 1.4 million last year using, in part, Title 42. We need something to replace that. And I think working with the government of Mexico and, frankly, getting them to do more to step up on this is part of that answer. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd like for you both, very quickly, to weigh in on what happens if the Republican-led Congress goes ahead with this vow to impeach or try to impeach the current secretary of Homeland Security. Does that mean all the things you suggested don't happen and Congress is just tied in knots? Secretary Chertoff? MICHAEL CHERTOFF: Well, it would be a very sad day if -- in - in search of what is, again, a political stunt, you know, threatening to impeach Secretary Mayorkas, Congress didn't do the things, for example, that Secretary Johnson just suggested. Maybe adjust the standard with respect to asylum, create more resources that are available to adjudicate, and work out additional ways to fund the effort to undermine the cartels and the smugglers, which are a big part of this. So, it would be basically putting form over substance to go through a big performance on impeachment that's never going anywhere, rather than actually working with the administration to solve the problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Secretary Johnson, I imagine you agree? JEH JOHNSON: Margaret, what people need to know, and Michael and I know this, the secretary of Homeland Security is focused on border security, maritime security, aviation security, cyber security, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service and a host of other things. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. JEH JOHNSON: We can't have a secretary who's distracted by - by a stunt in Congress at attempt at impeachment (INAUDIBLE). MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thanks very much to both of you, secretaries, for weighing in. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back for more with Dr. Anthony Fauci. So, the White House just asked Congress for another $10 billion in funding. ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're still technically still in the middle of a pandemic, even though the president said the pandemic's over. ANTHONY FAUCI: Right. We really do need that money for any of a number of reasons. One of which is a practical thing of - of outreach and PSA campaigns to get people to be vaccinated. We have a long way to go to optimize our protection against COVID, which is really a shame, somewhat paradoxical, that a rich country with all the vaccines that we need and we're utilizing them at a much lower level than we should be. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you're planning to retire. And I asked you when you would feel comfortable retiring. And you said, not until COVID is in the rearview mirror. You said, when COVID doesn't dominate the mental framework of our society. What you're saying is we're choosing not to let it dominate our mental framework - ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it is still very much a risk. ANTHONY FAUCI: But it's still there. I mean there's a difference. And that - and that's an important point that I want to make. If you look at where we were a year ago at this time when omicron started to surge, we were having 800,000 to 900,000 infections and 3,000 to 4,000 deaths. I don't like reading in the newspapers or getting my report from the COVID team, today we lost 400 people, today we lost 350 people. So, it's much, much better than it was, but it is not at a level low enough where we should feel we're done with it completely, because we're not. MARGARET BRENNAN: There have been all these House Republican calls for investigations into the origins of COVID - ANTHONY FAUCI: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: And saying they're going to bring you up to Capitol Hill. Do you think that wanes as you step down? ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, I don't think it's going to wane for me. The Republican House has -- has said that they're going to. And that's fine with me. I mean -- MARGARET BRENNAN: You'll appear? ANTHONY FAUCI: Oh, of course. I mean, I - I'm very much in favor of - of legitimate oversight. Absolutely. I mean I've testified before Congress, given the 38 years that I've been director, literally hundreds of times in many oversight hearings. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's never been this personal for you, though. And I know when I talked to you a year ago, you -- you were angry. You said, I'm just going to do my job and I'm going to be saving lives, and they're going to be lying. ANTHONY FAUCI: They've clearly politicized it. I'm not political at all, period. I've never been. And anybody who knows anything about me knows that that's the case. But it is very clear, when people are running their campaigns with an anti-Fauci element to it, I mean, that's ridiculous. I mean, this is a public health issue. I'd be more than happy to explain publicly or otherwise everything that we've done. And I can defend and explain everything that we've done from a public health standpoint. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said the United States is asking China for more data about the origins. ANTHONY FAUCI: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you seen anything that Beijing has produced? ANTHONY FAUCI: No. You know, one of the - one of the problems is that -- and this is historic. It goes way back to bird flu, the H5N1, the H7N9, the original SARS COV1, that the Chinese, not necessarily the scientists that we know and we have dealt with and collaborated with productively for decades, but the whole establishment of political and other establishment in China, even when there's nothing at all to hide, they act secretive, which absolutely triggers an appropriate suspicion of like, what the heck is going on over there? So, right now, what we would really like to know is all of the details of what went on with the original people who were infected? We keep a completely open mind as to what the origin is. Having said that, if you look at the examination by highly qualified international scientists, with no political agendas, they've published in peer-reviewed journals that the evidence is quite strong that this is a natural occurrence. Does that mean we've ruled out that there was something funny going on, a leak? Absolutely. And I and all of my colleagues keep an absolutely open mind. We've got to investigate every possibility because this is too important not to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you seen anything that Beijing has produced at all in terms of explanation or data? ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, their explanation is an explanation that they will not allow us to look at the primary information. The WHO went in and - and saw some of the data, which -- some of which was actually quite helpful. But we -- you know what we need, Margaret, we need a - a - a-- a transparency and a collaboration to open things up so that we can discuss it in a non- accusatory way. MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. ANTHONY FAUCI: What happens is that if you look at the anti-China approach that clearly the Trump administration had right from the very beginning, and the accusatory nature, the Chinese, they're going to flinch back and say, no, I'm sorry, we're not going to talk to you about it, which is not correct. They should be. MARGARET BRENNAN: But they're not talking to the Biden administration about it either is what you're saying. ANTHONY FAUCI: Exactly. I think that horse is out of the barn and they're very suspicious of anybody trying to accuse them. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the other things that's interesting to us when we watch how the world deals with COVID is that zero COVID policy in China, where they shut down almost fully cities and things. That impacts the global economy. It's why we're still dealing with this in many ways. ANTHONY FAUCI: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why hasn't Beijing been able to get a really effective vaccine? Why do they still struggle with this like that? ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, it's the combination of not having an effective vaccine that they themselves made, it just is not nearly at the level of many of the other vaccines. It's just not. And that's unfortunate. And not wanting to bring in vaccines from the very beginning that were highly effective, 94 percent 95 percent effective -- MARGARET BRENNAN: The Moderna or Pfizer. ANTHONY FAUCI: The Moderna, the Pfizer, as well as locking down almost without a purpose. When you put restrictions, you do it to give you time to be able to do something productive so you can unloosen or loosen up the restrictions. They, at least from what we were seeing, were just rigidly closing things down, which unless you have a really, really good purpose of preparing yourself for opening, it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you plan to do after you leave NIH in December? What's next for you? ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, I don't know, Margaret. And - and the reason I don't know is I want to strictly stick to the - to the ethical guidelines of not negotiating what my next position, wherever that may be, in a university or in a foundation or in a whatever until I actually step down. I want to continue to write and to lecture and utilize what I will have outside of a government position. What do I have? I have 54 years of experience as a scientist with the NIH. I have 38 years of experience leading the largest and most important infectious disease research institution in the world. And I've had the privilege of advising seven presidents. I could use that experience, that know-how, that judgment to help others, to write about it, to - to lecture about it, and, perhaps, to encourage at a time of anti-science the best and the brightest among the young to at least consider a career in science and public health and, importantly, in public service. If I can do that after I step down, I think that will be, you know, something that I would be pleased with. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be watching. ANTHONY FAUCI: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Fauci, thank you for your time today. And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Colorado's Democratic Governor Jared Polis who joins us this morning from Boulder, Colorado. Governor Polis, I want to ask you about the shooting in Colorado Springs that you recently went through. I'm hoping the governor can still hear me. It looks like we just lost that feed. So, we'll be back with you in a moment. We're going to take a quick commercial break. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Colorado's Democratic Governor Jared Polis, who has stuck with us through some technical difficulties. And, Governor, I understand you hear me now, so let's get straight to it. I'm sorry for what your state has recently gone through with this horrendous shooting at Club Q. It sounds like the shooter had a handgun and an AR-15 style rifle. Can you confirm that he legally purchased them or were these unregistered ghost guns? GOV. JARED POLIS (D-CO): It has been reported that at least one of the guns was - was a ghost gun by different media outlets. All of these facts will emerge in the coming days and weeks. Obviously right now our - our heart is with the victims, five people who lost their lives, their families, dozens of others injured and, of course, many traumatized. Another example of a law that could have been used in this instance successfully is a red flag law, which we have in Colorado, but it's really up to the local law enforcement entity how to use it. In cases like this, where somebody can potentially be a danger, and there are signs that they are a danger, we have a legal way to temporarily remove custody of any weapons they might have. And this is an example of a case where it might have been used. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to ask you about that because President Biden said it was ridiculous that red flag laws are not being enforced just based on the knowledge of this shooter rather than relying on his or her parents. Is the president correct? And are you saying right now that your local law enforcement was choosing not to enforce the law? JARED POLIS: So, right now in Colorado, you can have parents or family members go for an extreme risk protection order, or red flag law. That's fairly common. It wasn't pursued in this instance by the mother. You can also have a local sheriff agency do it. In this case, it wasn't pursued by the local sheriff agency. I'm sure what will be looked into is why wasn't it pursued. What - what I think we're going to look at in Colorado is potentially expanding that, for instance. So, DAs can also seek extreme risk protection orders. We also need to make sure that we publicize the law and make sure that the tools are in people's hands when they need it to remove dangerous weapons that could be used for self-harm or harming others, from somebody who's in a mental health crisis. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said last week you didn't know yet if the shooter was motivated by anti-LGBTQ rhetoric or if it was a personal motive. Have you seen any evidence it was a hate crime? And does the fact that the shooter identifies as nonbinary influence this in any way? Does this suggest anything to you? JARED POLIS: Well, no. On the second point of the - the shooter's identity has nothing to do with whether a hate crime was committed or not. I want to be clear, in Colorado, if you kill five people, you're behind bars for the rest of your life. This young man, once convicted, and I believe he will be convicted because the evidence is overwhelming, will never be able to be freed from a jail cell. He'll spend the rest of his days behind bars. The hate crimes on top of that can be used to augment the sentence. They can be used for acknowledging the fact that a -- the LGBTQ community was traumatized. But, again, the murder alone will send this person behind bars for the rest of his life. MARGARET BRENNAN: The - the president has also renewed his call for an assault weapons ban. It sounds like the details of this case may be more complicated than that if part of this was not a registered gun at all. In the past you were against an assault weapons ban when you were in Congress back in 2013. You changed your position in 2018. Given that you're the chief executive of the state now, would you like to see an assault weapons ban? JARED POLIS: Well, I would say, look, we learn from each instance. But you also have to look at all the causes. So, is there a way to improve gun safety out of this, to make sure that red flag laws are used? Not only he had a pistol and a semi-automatic weapon, do we need better laws on -- on ghost guns, do we need to make sure that we have a better process around semi-automatic weapons. Open to all of those. We also need to pursue the mental health aspect of this in other shooting incidences. What and how did this fall through the cracks. We need to pursue the anti-LGBT rhetoric aspect of this. I think whether it will be the case in this case or not, clearly the type of rhetoric out there that divides one group of Americans against another can send somebody over the top and - and - and tragically inspire them to an act of violence. We need to focus on national healing, bringing people together and really treating one another as brothers and sisters. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think people can agree, I hope, with at least that. Governor, thank you for your time today. And thank you for sticking with us through those technical difficulties and the delay that you all heard. We want to turn now to the war in Ukraine, where residents of Kherson are fleeing the city this weekend after a sustained Russian bombardment knocked out power and water supplies. The latest in Moscow's effort to undermine Ukrainian morale after more than nine months of brutal assault. CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Livesay is in Kyiv with this report. (BEGIN VT) CHRIS LIVESAY (voice over): Ukraine has already proven it can withstand the Russians. But what about the winter? At the front line, the cold and relentless artillery may be Russia's only hope to weaponize winter and freeze Ukraine's momentum. LIVESAY (on camera): Trenches like these become more and more common place the closer you get to the front line. And there's a really good reason for it. You don't just see and hear the flashes of artillery. But you can feel the thuds deep in your gut. LIVESAY (voice over): Ukrainians can also feel it right at their doorstep. Natali Krestenko (ph) was coming home after drinking tea in Kherson. Medics overwhelmed throughout a night of bombardment didn't arrive until morning. Their city only recently the scene of dancing after Russia's retreat, now limps through the dark and cold. Much like the capital Kyiv, the scene of a deadly missile attack this week. Inan (ph) and her son, Artu (ph), have to shelter in a community tent. FEMALE (through translator): We have no electricity and no water. Our phones and devices are out of battery. We do everything we can to distract Artu from what's really going on. LIVESAY: Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, is fuming. VITALI KLITSCHKO (Kyiv Mayor): Right now, before the winter, the people, Putin and Russians, want to let us be without electricity, without heating, without water, it's genocide. It's actually terrorism. The main goal of Russians to bring depression of society. I talk to the people, no negotiations with Russians. We, people is angry. (END VT) LIVESAY: And the mayor says he never stops worrying about a nuclear disaster. In fact, the shelling has been so severe, the country had to disconnect all of its nuclear power plants temporarily. It was the first time in 40 years. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris Livesay, thank you. That's going to be it for us today. Thank you all for watching. And until next week, for \"FACE THE NATION\" I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

            "article_content": "Bangkok \u2014\u00a0Myanmar's military-controlled government announced Thursday it was releasing and deporting an American, an Australian academic, a Japanese filmmaker, and a former British diplomat as part of a broad prisoner amnesty marking the country's National Victory Day. \u00a0 U.S. national Kyaw Htay Oo, Australian Sean Turnell, Japan's Toru Kubota, Briton Vicky Bowman and 11 local Myanmar celebrities were among a total of 5,774 prisoners who were being released, Myanmar's state-run MRTV reported. \u00a0 The imprisonment of the foreign nationals had been a source of friction between Myanmar's leaders and their home governments, which had been lobbying for their release. Kyaw Htay Oo, a naturalized American, returned to Myanmar, the country of his birth, in 2017, according to media reports. He was arrested in September 2021 on terrorism charges and had been in custody since then. U.S Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking at a news conference on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Bangkok, welcomed the release of the prisoners, calling it \"one bright spot in what is otherwise an incredibly dark time where we see things going from bad to worse in Burma, including terrible violence that's being done to innocent Burmese.\" In a tweet, U.S. national security advisor Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration was \"pleased to share\" that Kyaw Htay Oo was \"on his way home from prison in Burma, where he was wrongfully detained for more than 14 months.\"  We are pleased to share that U.S. citizen Kyaw Htay Oo is on his way home from prison in Burma, where he was wrongfully detained for more than 14 months.\u202fWe will continue to call for the release of thousands of political prisoners who remain unjustly imprisoned in Burma. \"We will continue to call for the release of thousands of political prisoners who remain unjustly imprisoned in Burma,\" added Sullivan, referring to Myanmar by its former name, which was used before the junta took over and has been maintained by the U.S. government since then. According to Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a rights monitoring organization, 16,232 people have been detained on political charges in Myanmar since the army ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February last year. \u00a0 Of those arrested, 13,015 were still in detention as of Wednesday, AAPP reported. At least 2,465 civilians have been killed by security forces in the same period, the group says, though the number is thought to be far higher. Amnesty International Australia's Tim O'Connor welcomed the decision to release Turnell, saying like many others, he should never have been arrested or jailed. \u00a0 \"Amnesty continues to call for the release of all those arbitrarily detained for peacefully exercising their human rights,\" he said. \"Thousands of people jailed since the coup in Myanmar have done nothing wrong.\" \u00a0 Japan's government spokesperson, Hirokazu Matsuno, said officials have been in touch with Kubota, and the 26-year-old Tokyo-based documentary filmmaker was believed to be in good health. He left Myanmar on a flight to Bangkok on Thursday and was due back in Japan on Friday morning, the Japanese Embassy in Yangon said. \u00a0 Bowman and Turnell were also expected to fly out of Myanmar on Thursday. \u00a0 Turnell, 58, an associate professor of economics at Sydney's Macquarie University who had been serving as an adviser to Suu Kyi, was arrested by security forces in Yangon just days after last year's military takeover. He was sentenced in September to three years in prison on charges of violating the country's official secrets law and immigration law. Suu Kyi and three of her former Cabinet members were convicted in the same trial, which was held in a closed court, with their lawyers barred by a gag order from talking about the proceedings. \u00a0 Fellow Australian economist Tim Harcourt said in an email that he was delighted to hear of his longtime friend Sean Turnell's release. He thanked the Australian government, activists and Turnell's friends and colleagues who had lobbied for his release. \u00a0 \"Sean's heart was with the people of Myanmar to help lift them out of poverty and help Myanmar reach its economic potential. He should never have been imprisoned for doing his professional duty as an economist involved in development economics,\" he said. \u00a0 Myanmar has been in turmoil since the takeover, which led to nationwide protests that the military government quashed with deadly force, triggering armed resistance that some U.N. experts now characterize as civil war. \u00a0 Kubota was arrested July 30 by plainclothes police in Yangon after taking images and videos of a small flash protest against the military. He was convicted last month by the prison court on incitement and other charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison. \u00a0 Since seizing power, the military has cracked down on the coverage of protests, raided media companies, detained dozens of journalists and revoked the licenses of at least a dozen outlets. \u00a0 Most of those detained are being held on the incitement charge for allegedly causing fear, spreading false news, or agitating against a government employee. \u00a0 Some of the closed media outlets have continued operating without licenses and many Myanmar journalists are working underground, moving from one safe house to another, hiding in remote border regions, or basing themselves in exile. \u00a0 Kubota was the fifth foreign journalist detained in Myanmar, since the military seized power. U.S. citizens Nathan Maung and Danny Fenster, who worked for local publications, and freelancers Robert Bociaga of Poland and Yuki Kitazumi of Japan were deported before serving their full prison sentences. Bowman, 56, a former British ambassador to Myanmar who was running a business consultancy, was arrested with her husband, a Myanmar national, in Yangon in August. She was given a one-year prison term in September by the prison count for failing to register her residence. \u00a0\u00a0 Myanmar did not release many details of the other prisoners who were being freed, but many were held on charges related to the protests, including Section 505(A) of Myanmar's penal code, which makes it a crime to spread comments that create public unrest or fear or spread false news, and carries a penalty of up to three years in prison. \u00a0 Those being released included Kyaw Tint Swe, a former minister for the office of the State Counsellor, Than Htay, a former member of the Union Election Commission, and Lae Lae Maw, a former chief minister of Tanintharyi region who was sentenced to 30 years for alleged corruption under Suu Kyi's government, MRTV announced. \u00a0 Among the first set free from Yangon's Insein prison were prominent author Maung Thar Cho, pro-democracy activist Mya Aye and Myo Nyunt, the spokesperson of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party, all of whom were arrested on Feb. 1, 2021, the day the military seized power. \u00a0 \"I will always stand together with the people of Myanmar,\" Mya Aye defiantly told the crowd outside the prison after he was released.",

            "article_content": "Rome \u2014 Italians have voted in the country's most right-wing government since World War II. Giorgia Meloni is the leader of the Brothers of Italy party, and after the weekend vote she's set form a coalition government and become Italy's first female prime minister.  As CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay reports, given Italy's disastrous history the last time a hard-right party rose to power, it was a stunning victory for the Brothers of Italy \u2014 and more so because only a few years ago, it was just a fringe party. For the members of the party and their supporters, Meloni represents a chance to put traditional Italians and their values first. Her opponents, however, are concerned that her far-right policies go too far. \"The fundamental problem in Italy is becoming the illegal immigration, too many immigrants,\" said one party supporter at an event over the weekend, arguing that an influx of foreign nationals has brought \"only disorder\" as immigrants have not integrated with Italian society. \"She wants, for example, to protect the traditional family, or family encompassed by mom or dad and sons,\" said another backer. How does she do that, Livesay asked the Meloni voter? By \"not admitting the marriages between people from the same, the same gender,\" she responded.  Italy's conservative superstar fiercely opposes adoptions and surrogacy for same-sex couples \u2014 people like Alessandro Valera and his husband, who have a little girl. \"She's trying to delete us and send a message that we are the\u2026 reason why Italy doesn't have enough children. We are the reason why we have demographic problems. We are the reason why the family is not holding strong,\" Valera told CBS News. \"And we are scared.  Meloni, a 45-year-old firebrand politician, insists she's no fascist, just a proud conservative and nationalist. She is comfortable, nevertheless, with some of the hallmarks of Italian fascism, including a motto she often utters from podiums: \"Dio, patria, e famiglia!\" Or in English, \"God, fatherland, and family.\" Exactly 100 years ago this fall, dictator Benito Mussolini, as the leader of Italy's National Fascist Party, staged his historic March on Rome. He eventually marched the country straight into two decades of dictatorship and, alongside Adolf Hitler, into World War II. Neither \"Il Duce\" nor his fascist party survived, but several descendants remain active in Italian politics today, including his granddaughter, Rachele Mussolini. She is a member of the Brothers of Italy.  Livesay asked her if her family name had been a hindrance or a help in the run-up to this weekend's election.  \"It's been both,\" she said. \"Certainly, when I entered politics, my last name was a springboard.\"  A springboard in a party whose official flag bears a flame symbol, which also appears on Benito Mussolini's tomb. Livesay asked one of the party supporters at the weekend rally about that symbol, after they insisted there was no connection between the Brothers of Italy, and fascism. She insisted there's no link. But to renowned poet and Holocaust survivor Edith Bruck, it's a red flag, if there ever was one. Meloni insists regularly that there's nothing for people in her country or across Europe to worry about, and that Italy is not about to reprise it fascist past. But Bruck told Livesay she was \"very, very worried.\"  She believes Italian democracy is in peril, and \"that she is fascist.\" To be clear, Meloni ardently rejects the fascist label. Regardless, she's poised to become Italy's first female prime minister. That another reason these elections have been historic - but one that has largely been overshadowed by her politics.",

            "article_content": "Robstown, Texas \u2014 At his first public rally since being subpoenaed by the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, former President Donald Trump on Saturday complained again about that panel's investigation and did not indicate whether he'll comply with the demand to turn over documents and testify.\u00a0 Democrats have an uphill battle in Texas \u00a0\u2014 a poll released Friday by UT Austin and Texas Politics Project showed Texas Gov. Greg Abbott well-positioned to win his reelection bid. The poll had his lead up to 11 points \u2014 by far his largest lead so far. Lt. Gov Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton also held double-digit leads in the same poll.\u00a0 Trump described the Democratic candidates as \"against guns, God and oil\" and added, \"and they say they're going to do well in Texas? I don't think so.\"\u00a0 But the rally was held in South Texas, a critical part of the state for both Republicans and Democrats on Election Day, and Trump's appearance there could help drive up support for the GOP here. Just 120 miles south is the district represented by Democrat Henry Cuellar, who is in the fight of his political life against Republican opponent Cassy Garcia, a former Sen. Ted Cruz aide. Garcia appeared at Saturday's rally with Trump. Although Trump talked at length about the Jan. 6 committee, he said little that he hasn't said before, and he offered no comment about whether or not he would be interviewed by the panel. As Trump started discussing Jan. 6 at the Richard M. Borchard Regional Fairgrounds in Robstown, the crowd interrupted him by breaking out into the national anthem. Trump called it \"beautiful,\" before saying he had initially thought he had been interrupted by protesters. He went back to it later, calling it a \"beautiful moment\" and said, \"We haven't had that in two years.\"\u00a0 Trump mainly railed about the \"unselect committee,\" his nickname for the House Jan. 6 committee, and complained that they \"don't talk about\" how the size of the crowd at his rally at the Ellipse that day. He also alleged that he authorized 10,000 to 20,000 National Guard troops, a claim that has been disputed by then-acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller's testimony before the committee. Miller said he was \"never given any direction or order or knew of any plans of that nature.\" Trump railed against the many investigations against him, even joking at one point that his wife, Melania Trump, says \"every day you get a subpoena.\"\u00a0 In what was likely the last public hearing by the House Jan. 6 committee, the committee voted last week to subpoena Trump, with committee vice chair Rep. Liz Cheney calling him \"the one person at the center\" of what happened on Jan. 6.\u00a0 The subpoena was issued Friday, with the committee demanding that the former president submit documentary material by Nov. 4, which would be followed by \"one or more days\" of his deposition under oath \"on or about\" Nov. 14, according to the panel's letter. Trump did not say if he would comply with the subpoena.\u00a0 Trump insisted the Justice Department had been \"weaponized\" against him, starting with the \"Russia hoax,\" which he spent a significant amount of time discussing. Trump only briefly touched on the investigation into his handling of documents after he left office, calling it the \"boxes hoax.\"\u00a0 In his nearly two hours on stage, he also teased a possible 2024 run, saying, \"I will probably have to do it again,\" similar to his comments at his last appearance in Texas, at CPAC in Dallas.\u00a0 The 27th Congressional District, where the rally took place, went for former President Barack Obama in 2008 but has trended more heavily Republican since then \u2014 and Trump won the region by double digits in both 2016 and 2020. Richard Vallejo, of Corpus Christi, said he had never voted before casting a ballot for Trump in 2020 \u2014 and he said he is ready to vote for Republicans this time too.\u00a0 \"I feel like he's stood more for the people of color \u2013 people don't see that, more people of color were graduating from school, we had the biggest economy in the world, we had a secure border,\" Vallejo said. \"It's not about race, but uniting the American people, no matter what the color of our skin was.\" Another attendee, Scott Graham of Robstown, said he had voted for Democrats in the past, but he feels that it's Republicans who are now \"for the people.\" He said he had supported Trump \"since Day 1.\"\u00a0 Immigration remains one of the top issues for Texans \u2014 especially in this region. Trump kicked off the rally by talking about undocumented migrants crossing the border and drugs. He also thanked ICE and Border Patrol - two major employers in the region. Trump called for doubling the amount of ICE and Border Patrol agents. Abbott, who was in Florida at a fundraiser on Saturday, has made immigration and crime key to part of his campaign, especially since his locally popular busing of migrants to Democrat-run cities has gotten national attention. \u00a0\u00a0 Although Abbott wasn't at the rally, Trump called him a \"wonderful man\" and blasted his Democratic opponent Beto O'Rourke for being against \"God, guns and oil.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "More than a list of numbers, President Biden's budget documents what he'd most like to accomplish this year, and it offers a glimpse into how his administration plans to confront some of the bracing political realities he faces right now.\u00a0 His $5.8 trillion proposal is coming up against the headwinds of a divided Congress, high inflation, low presidential approval ratings and midterm elections that threaten Democratic majorities in the House and Senate later this year.\u00a0 \"What he faces this particular year is very daunting\" \u2014 since Democrats are the \"odds-on favorite to lose the majority in at least the House, and quite possibly, the Senate,\" said Mark Harkins, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute. \"It will surprise me greatly if anything of note really made it out of this particular Congress,\" Harkins added.\u00a0 The president's proposal includes a tax hike of $2.5 trillion on the wealthy and corporations, $30 billion in funding for state and local police, about 4% more for military spending, $45 billion to combat climate change and funds to ease supply chain issues.\u00a0 The White House also claims the budget would reduce the deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next decade. It contains some elements of the president's signature Build Back Better agenda, like climate change. But it does not include some of the key provisions, including funding for programs like universal pre-K and paid family leave because he was unable to convince all the Democrats in the Senate to support it.\u00a0 Each year, the president's budget sets non-binding spending levels for the government, while Congress passes individual appropriations bills that provide the actual funding. Thomas Kahn, a distinguished faculty fellow at American University's Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies, said he thinks many elements of the president's budget \u2014 including funding for additional police officers \u2014 are designed to appeal to Republicans as well as Democrats. He doesn't think the president's proposal is necessarily dead on arrival, as presidents' budgets often are.\u00a0 But it's unlikely 10 Senate Republicans would join the Senate's 50 Democrats in supporting major appropriations bills ahead of an election in which Democrats are projected to do poorly, Harkins and Kahn agree. Republicans, they said, will want to wait to see whether they will take majorities in the House and possibly Senate, which would give them control of the nation's purse strings.\u00a0 More likely than not, Harkins said, the Congress will keep funding the government at the same levels once the fiscal year ends in September. Republicans \"have no reason to help to get anything done because they believe they will have a stronger hand negotiating\" next year, Harkins said.\u00a0 Mr. Biden's expected difficulty in getting some of his agenda enacted through the appropriations process is not unusual. In fact, in recent decades, it's been rare for Congress to pass all of the necessary appropriations bills before October 1. A Pew Research Center analysis dating back to 1977 found 100% of Congress' appropriations bills were only passed in four years \u2014 1977, 1989, 1995 and 2000 \u2014 none of which were years when midterm elections took place, and only one of which, 2000, was a national election year. Most years, especially recently, Congress passed few, if any, of the bills that fund the government's agencies and programs by the fiscal deadline.\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor Monday, alluded to the upcoming midterm elections as he criticized the president's proposal.\u00a0 \"From a president that's decided not to pivot, from a Democratic party that has chosen not to correct course on its own, every data point suggests the American people want and need a major course correction,\" McConnell said Monday. \"It appears that in about seven months, they may have to provide it themselves.\"\u00a0 Mr. Biden likely faces some challenges in corralling members of his own caucus, too, particularly moderate Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.\u00a0 Kahn said tax increases \"in general\" are difficult to pass, more so in an election year. But he thinks this tax increase could have a better shot because it's targeted at the wealthy, and it's tied to deficit reduction, something Manchin wants. And Kahn observed the budget contains spending priorities that will be helpful to moderate Democrats running for reelection \u2014 like that boost in defense spending, as well as more funding for policing, immigration enforcement and deficit reduction measures.\u00a0 Manchin has signaled he's open to some measures to address the growing threat of climate change, too, though he has resisted some approaches that he believes would hurt the energy industry or increase the nation's deficits.\u00a0 His communications director, Sam Runyon, said that Manchin's approach emphasizes U.S. energy independence and favors an energy policy that combines renewable and non-renewable domestic sources of energy. Many liberals in Congress and the administration would prefer to be more aggressive about weaning the country off greenhouse gas-emitting energy sources, like coal.\u00a0 Manchin \"remains seriously concerned about the financial status of our country and believes fighting inflation by restoring fairness to our tax system and paying down our national debt must be our first priority,\" Runyon said.\u00a0 Sinema's office has not commented on the president's budget proposal.\u00a0 But, as Harkins said, Congress is unlikely to complete its appropriations process this year.\u00a0 Continuing resolutions are problematic because they create uncertainty and make it more difficult for agencies and departments to plan well for the months ahead, and this makes them less financially efficient, Harkins said.\u00a0 \"The game is gonna be in January and February, and that's really unfortunate, because government doesn't work well when we're doing continuing resolutions for a quarter to a half of a year,\" Harkins said.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Five years after Neil Gorsuch joined the Supreme Court, nearly four years after Brett Kavanaugh replaced a retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy and 20 months after Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed days before the 2020 election, the Supreme Court's expanded conservative majority exerted its power across a blockbuster term marked by major decisions on abortion, the Second Amendment and religious rights. The term that kicked off in October officially came to a close Thursday, with the justices issuing its final two decisions \u2014 one curbing the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and a second paving the way for the Biden administration to roll back the so-called \"Remain in Mexico\" immigration policy \u2014 before recessing for the summer. But it was the rulings issued on successive days last week to wipe away the constitutional right to an abortion and expand gun rights for the first time in more than a decade that underscored how the Supreme Court's conservative majority is making its mark on the law. \"What we saw this term, at least in the guns and abortion and religion cases, is a bold court, a court that's bold in tone and also in agenda. They're overruling precedent and they're making big changes, including to existing methodology, where we look for rights or how we evaluate gun regulations \u2014 they changed what the lower courts are doing,\" Allison Orr Larsen, a law professor at William & Mary, told CBS News.\u00a0 \"When a court takes big bites like that, big changes in doctrine, it's hard to characterize that as 5-4 or 6-3. It feels different than what we've seen in the past. The tone of the opinions seem different. Dramatic, consequential,\" she continued. \"It doesn't seem to be completely aligned with what we think of as Chief Justice Roberts's court. He prefers conservative steps, but not big steps at a time, big jolts. These decisions are big-jolt decisions.\" In their decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark decision that legalized abortion nationwide, in particular, the court's conservatives cast aside Roberts' approach of seeking incremental changes to the law rather than major shifts.\u00a0 In a concurring opinion, Roberts said he would uphold the Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks at the crux of the court fight, but called the decision to overrule Roe a \"serious jolt to the legal system.\" A \"narrower decision,\" he said, \"would be markedly less unsettling.\" \"When Chief Justice Roberts was the fifth conservative vote, it was not such a headlong rush, partly because he is an incrementalist and partly because he cares about the legitimacy of the court, particularly a court with his name on it,\" said Caroline Mala Corbin, a constitutional law professor at the University of Miami. \"He is no longer a deciding vote. His vote is no longer necessary.\" In addition to reversing Roe and invalidating New York's restrictions on carrying a handgun outside the home, the Supreme Court also ruled in favor of religious rights in four disputes: siding with a Texas death row inmate who wanted his pastor to audibly pray and lay hands on him during his execution; finding the city of Boston violated the First Amendment when it rejected a request from an organization to fly a Christian flag outside of City Hall; striking down a Maine tuition assistance program that excluded schools that provide religious instructions; and backing a former high school football coach who lost his job after praying on the 50-yard-line after games. In the cases involving the Texas inmate and Boston City Hall, the court ruled 8-1 and 9-0, respectively, while it broke along ideological lines in the other two disputes. Corbin said the decisions in the religious liberty cases indicate the Supreme Court's conservative majority will \"eviscerate\" rights they dislike. But Mark Rienzi, president of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, believes the latest rulings in favor of religious rights are a course-correction rather than an indication that the court's conservative majority is pro-religion. \"The court is engaged in a long clean-up enterprise of decades of religious liberty law that went far astray,\" he told reporters this week. \"I think they really are committed to pluralism and to respecting people's ability to live out a different life and not always go where the majority wants them to go.\" Rienzi lamented that the nation is in an era that is \"unfortunately tending to be intolerant of differences.\" \"If I were governments or I were opponents of religion or religious people, I might look at it and say, maybe I should stop picking those fights because it's pretty clear that the court actually believes in the First Amendment,\" he said. According to an analysis of the court's term by Adam Feldman, founder of the website Empirical SCOTUS, 17 decisions were unanimous, while the three liberal members of the court \u2014 Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2014 dissented together in 13 decisions. Roberts and Kavanaugh, meanwhile, were in the majority most often, at 94.9% of the time. While the term was packed with significant, earth-shaking decisions, the justices are already poised to hear blockbuster disputes involving religious liberty, affirmative action, voting rights and state legislatures' power to set federal election rules when they convene for their next term in October. One of the cases involves a web designer from Colorado who does not want to offer services for same-sex weddings because of her religious beliefs, in violation of a state anti-discrimination law. The web designer, Lorie Smith, argues the law violates her free speech and religious rights, and the justices will weigh whether applying a public-accommodation law to compel an artist to speak or stay silent violates the First Amendment. The Supreme Court is expected to continue its trend of bolstering religious rights, but Larsen said the case could be one where the justices take a more incremental approach. \"Instead of overruling Obergefell, they might increase accommodations for people with religious objections to participating or using their services at a wedding between a gay couple,\" she said, referencing the landmark 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage. \"That's an example where we could return to that step to the right for sure, but not a leap to the right.\" The court's membership is also changing with the retirement of Breyer, which took effect Thursday, and appointment of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was sworn in just hours after the final opinions were issued. Jackson is the first Black woman to serve on the high court. She is joining the Supreme Court at a time when the secrecy surrounding it has been pierced and the trust among its members breached with the leak of the draft majority opinion in the abortion case. Roberts ordered an investigation into the source of the disclosure, but the identity of the person who shared the document with reporters from Politico still remains unknown to the public. \"She is entering a new family at a time when the family dynamics are quite tense,\" Larsen said of Jackson. Jackson filling Breyer's seat will not change the ideological makeup of the court, and the Supreme Court's conservative majority is expected to endure for years.\u00a0 \"The dissenting justices have to take the long view and realize that they will not always be in the minority, and at some point their dissenting opinions will become a blueprint for a majority opinion,\" Corbin said. \"They continue to point out the weaknesses of the majority's reasoning and the ways they deviate from acceptable practices, and to write the blueprint for decisions that may be far in the future, but may nonetheless become a majority opinion.\" While Mr. Biden has put his own historic stamp on the court with Jackson's appointment, the reversal of Roe and expansion of Second Amendment rights demonstrated the transformation of the court made possible by Senate Republicans and former President Donald Trump. \"Had President Obama been able to appoint the Supreme Court justice that he was entitled to appoint, they would not have had a majority [to overturn Roe], because Chief Justice Roberts would have written the majority in Dobbs and perhaps the court would have eliminated abortion rights eventually, but it wouldn't have done it on Friday,\" Corbin said. \"Whose legacy is it really? Is it Mitch McConnell's or is it Donald Trump's?\"",

            "article_content": "A recount in Texas has affirmed Democrat Michelle Vallejo as her party's nominee for a new congressional district that Republicans are aggressively targeting this November as they demonstrate new strength with Hispanic voters along the U.S.-Mexico border. Vallejo defeated Ruben Ramirez by 35 votes, according to results of a recount announced Friday by the Texas Democratic Party. Ramirez had requested the recount after trailing by just 20 votes in a May 24 runoff. The Associated Press had not previously called the race, pending the outcome of the recount. The victory by Vallejo sets up a significant test this fall for progressive Democrats who backed her in the 15th Congressional District, one of two new U.S. House seats awarded to booming Texas after a decade of explosive growth driven by new Latino residents. Vallejo's supporters from the left flank of the party including Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. She will face Republican Monica De La Cruz, who won the GOP nomination. For decades, South Texas has been a Democratic stronghold where Republicans put in little effort and struggled to even find candidates. But that is rapidly changing after several border counties showed big swings toward former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.  The GOP has already notched one victory in South Texas earlier this month when Republican Mayra Flores won a special election to fill the remaining term of former Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela, who left Congress early to take a lobbying job. ",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence told some of the Republican Party's top donors on Friday night that the party cannot offer any support for Russian President Vladimir Putin, drawing a contrast with former President Trump, who called Putin \"smart\" and \"savvy\" during an interview last week. \"There is no room in this party for apologists for Putin,\" Pence said, according to excerpts of the speech obtained by CBS News. \"There is only room for champions of freedom.\" Trump has been criticized by some members of his own party for those comments. But in an address at the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend, even after Putin's invasion of Ukraine had begun, Trump reiterated his praise for Putin and disparaged U.S. leadership.\u00a0 \"The problem is not that Putin is smart, which of course he's smart, but the real problem is that our leaders are dumb,\" Trump said to the crowd.\u00a0 Trump addressed donors at the retreat on Saturday night.\u00a0 A significant portion of Pence's remarks focused on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He told the donors he has been \"deeply inspired\" by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and he criticized some of President Biden's foreign policy decisions, including the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u00a0 Pence also asserted that NATO's expansion is not responsible for Russia's invasion. Trump frequently bashed NATO while he was in office and last week at CPAC slammed leaders of NATO nations as \"not so smart\" for their handling of the run-up to Russia's invasion.\u00a0 \"Where would our friends in Eastern Europe be today if they were not in NATO?\" Pence said. \"Where would Russian tanks be today if NATO had not expanded the borders of freedom?\" Pence also encouraged Republicans to look towards the future rather than back at the 2020 election if they are to be successful in the upcoming midterms. That vision also marks a clear departure from Trump's view; he still speaks at length about his 2020 loss and continues to baselessly assert that the election was rigged.\u00a0 \"We cannot win by fighting yesterday's battles, or by relitigating the past,\" Pence said. \"Elections are about the future. My fellow Republicans, we can only win if we are united around an optimistic vision for the future based on our highest values.\" Pence is staking out his differences with Trump about a week after the former president told attendees at a private reception at CPAC that they would be \"very happy,\" in response to a question about a 2024 run. Trump also told the crowd that he knew who they \"don't want as your V.P.\" This isn't the first time that Pence has criticized his former boss. Last month, he said that \"Trump is wrong\" for claiming Pence had a right to overturn the election. Last June, Pence said he doesn't know whether he and Trump would \"ever see eye-to-eye\" about the January 6 attack at the Capitol.\u00a0 As Pence continues to plot his future, the former vice president is expected to soon unveil what he calls a \"freedom agenda\" that he developed with nearly 50 fellow conservatives. \"Our goal is to help unite conservatives around an agenda that is optimistic, forward-looking and thoroughly conservative and can save our country from the radical left,\" Pence said.\u00a0 Pence accused Mr. Biden of \"singing from the Republican hymnal\" during his State of Union address this week by focusing on a secure border, funding the police, keeping schools open and buying American. He also criticized the president's remarks on immigration reform, transgender children and raising taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans.\u00a0 And he also took issue with the president's handling the Ukraine crisis, saying Mr. Biden \"squandered the deterrence that our administration put in place to keep Putin and Russian from even trying to redraw international boundaries by force.\" He believes the Biden administration should take further steps to sanction Russia, including sanctioning all Russian oil exports worldwide. Like other Republicans, Pence paints an optimistic vision of what's at stake in 2022, stressing that the midterms provide a rare opportunity to win a large share of seats. He said the \"smart (Democrats) are heading for the hills,\" citing the more than 30 House incumbents who are retiring at the end of this term. \"Let's be clear-eyed about the opportunity before us,\" Pence said. \"We are looking at a tidal wave of Republican victory on a scale we haven't seen since 2010, or even since the Republican Revolution of 1994. It is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Incumbent Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar and progressive Jessica Cisneros are heading to a runoff in late May in Texas' 28th District, after neither candidate cleared the 50% mark in their highly contentious primary race on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press.\u00a0 Cuellar, who has represented the district since 2005, recently had his home raided by the FBI in January, as part of an investigation related to Azerbaijan and several U.S. businessmen.\u00a0 Cuellar led the pack with 48.5% of the vote, with Cisneros capturing 46.8%. Tannya Benavides, a progressive educator and first time candidate, got about 4.7% of the vote. Cuellar's base of support in Laredo, as well as strong showing in the district's rural counties, put him in the lead early Wednesday morning. Cisneros was able to keep Cuellar under 50% due to her turnout in Bexar County and San Antonio, as well as Guadalupe and Atascosa counties. Cisneros, who interned for Cuellar in 2014, lost to him by less than 3,000 votes in her primary challenge in 2020. \"No matter what happens, whether again, the victory is coming today, later tonight, or tomorrow or maybe even in May. We are going to win because all of you are standing behind me,\" Cisneros told supporters on Tuesday night.\u00a0 This is Cuellar's first primary runoff election. Cisneros and her allies see the runoff is a victory for the campaign, after Cuellar won the 2020 primary outright. \"The fact that we are still waiting for results against an 18-year entrenched incumbent with millions of dollars in his war chest from corporate interest, and we're standing here with people power is a testament how powerful those people [are],\" Cisneros added.\u00a0 \"This is a win for progressives and a rebuke of one of the worst Democrats in the House. It's a moment Our Revolution members have worked hard for,\" added Our Revolution Political Director Aaron Chappell. \"Congressman Cuellar has continually fought for subsidies for fossil fuel companies while standing against workers' right to organize. We hope tonight is the start of a new day in South Texas.\" Meanwhile, Cuellar has survived his toughest primary yet, despite the fact that his home was raided by the FBI weeks before the primary election.\u00a0 Cuellar currently serves on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, a role that voters in the district have cited as reason for their support. Cuellar's stance on immigration, and advocacy for more border security resources, has also been a factor. Republicans Cassie \"Cassy\" Garcia, a former deputy state director for Republican Senator Ted Cruz, and Sandra Whitten, the party's only candidate on the ballot in 2020, are heading toward a runoff as well. Seven Republican candidates were on the ballot in this year's primary for Texas' 28th district, compared to just one in 2020.\u00a0 Also in south Texas, Democrats in Texas' 15th district are also primed for a runoff. Veteran and educator Ruben Ramirez and progressive small business owner Michell Vallejo have moved forward to a runoff election. The winner will face Republican candidate Monica De La Cruz in a highly targeted district for national Republicans.\u00a0 In Texas' 3rd District in the Dallas suburbs, Republican incumbent Van Taylor is heading towards a runoff with former Collin County Judge Keith Self. Taylor was facing four challengers from the right this year, after voting for a commission to investigate the January 6 attacks. The commission Taylor voted for didn't make it out of the Senate, and was later replaced by the current January 6 select committee, which he voted against.\u00a0 In Texas' 35th District, which stretches from San Antonio to Austin, former Austin City Councilmember Greg Casar has won the Democratic primary and will be the party's nominee in November. Casar is a progressive backed by the Justice Democrats group, which has also backed Cisneros.\u00a0 Runoff elections in Texas will take place May 24.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "Seeking to capitalize on Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's historic confirmation as a Supreme Court associate justice, a coalition of progressive organizations are investing $1 million in a new ad campaign targeting Black audiences. Building Back Together, the Black Women's Leadership Collective and She Will Rise are spearheading the seven-figure ad buy, the largest to date by the groups.\u00a0 \"For Black women, for Black Americans, but for all Americans, I mean, my hope is that all Americans feel pride in this moment and what it says about what is possible in our country,\" said Karen Finney, co-convenor of the Black Women's Leadership Collective.\u00a0 The campaign features an ad, entitled Changed, that will air in Georgia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania as well as on digital and social media platforms primarily via Black-owned outlets and publications, according to a Building Back Together spokesperson. CBS News exclusively viewed the ad,\u00a0which highlights the fulfillment of President Biden's 2020 campaign pledge to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court.\u00a0 \"In 233 years, not a single Black woman has served on the Supreme Court. President Biden changed that,\" a female narrator states at the beginning of the 30-second spot, which features a montage spliced with images of Jackson throughout the confirmation process. \"President Biden has fought to ensure the doors to opportunity are open to every person in this country, and we're wasting no time to communicate that the President is delivering on his promise to make our government look more like America,\" said Mayra Mac\u00edas, Chief Strategy Officer for Building Back Together.\u00a0 The campaign will also include in-person grassroots events, such as block parties, to amplify the coalition's message with local partners in Atlanta, Milwaukee and Philadelphia. In Washington D.C., She Will Rise collaborated with several groups and the city to host a block party and the unveiling of a mural showcasing Jackson alongside her personal heroine Constance Baker Motley, who was the first Black woman to become a federal judge. \"Black women make up less than two percent of the federal judiciary currently so we have a lot of work to do, but I want to commend this administration,\" She Will Rise co-founder Kim Tignor told CBS News earlier this year. \"This woman's work will impact generations. And I think that a lot of times it goes unsaid or unnoticed, the impact that the Supreme Court has on your day-to-day life.\"\u00a0 The campaign builds on previous investments by the coalition, which released TV, digital and radio ads during the confirmation process to promote Jackson's qualifications and personal story. The 51-year-old mother of two and Harvard graduate served on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals prior to her nomination. She was confirmed by the Senate Thursday in a bipartisan vote of 53-47.\u00a0 The latest push comes just over six months before the midterm elections. A new CBS News poll shows President Biden's approval rating hit a low of 42 percent. A majority of respondents gave the president low marks for his handling of issues ranging from the economy to crime and immigration. Finney, who is also a Democratic consultant, points out that Black women were integral to Biden's election. She said the alliance aims to continue the conversation around Jackson's confirmation and believes it will resonate with voters come November.\u00a0 \"When the Supreme Court starts that first Monday in October and she comes out and we see her there among her colleagues, that's just a few weeks before Election Day,\" Finney noted. \"So there will be a powerful reminder to say your vote matters, you made this happen, that's why you've got to come out and vote.\" Nikole Killion is a congressional correspondent for CBS News based in Washington D.C.",

            "article_content": "Just over a year since the assault on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Republicans mostly still support Donald Trump, but it appears as if many would have their party put that day behind them and talk about other issues. Many in the GOP don't want the party to take a position on it at all. And while the former president remains a popular figure among the base, the entire rank and file isn't entirely falling into line. In fact, a sizable majority approve of former Vice President Mike Pence's adherence to constitutional procedure that day, and few want to see the party punish Republicans it considers disloyal to Trump. Rather than directly punish Republicans perceived to be disloyal to Trump, Republicans say the party should perhaps take a different approach \u2014 like supporting these incumbents' opponents in primaries. And about half would simply accept these other views within the party, rather than punishing them. Few Republicans want to see the party take a position of outright support of those who forced their way into the Capitol. A 44% plurality of Republicans say the party shouldn't take a position on these January 6 participants, and a similar number say it should be critical of them. In addition to staying neutral, Republicans by and large simply don't want political leaders to talk about January 6. Instead, it's the economy, inflation, crime and policing, and immigration that top their list of issues leaders should be discussing. Seven in 10 Republicans say Congress should drop their investigation into whether public officials had a role in the events of January 6. This number has grown somewhat since just six weeks ago \u2014 a mirror image of other Americans, seven in 10 of whom want Congress to investigate. At the same time, a large majority of Republicans approve of the actions taken by former Vice President Pence in following the procedure described in the Constitution for opening and counting states' votes. There's some ambivalence here, with half saying they approve of Trump's pressuring him to overturn the election (those who do are split on Pence's actions). That said, a four-in-10 plurality more clearly take the former vice president's side, both approving of his actions and disapproving of the pressure Trump exerted on him. About seven in 10 Republicans say Trump should run for president again in 2024. Among the most common reasons they cite are that he's the best candidate Republicans have and that he would win. Fewer, but still about half, say he deserves another chance. The former president's influence extends to the kinds of candidates Republicans want in future elections. A large majority would prefer candidates similar to him in their policies and proposals. Solid majorities would like compatible views on coronavirus vaccines and the 2020 election. On the other hand, only half say they would want candidates similar to Trump in how they handle themselves personally. One of Trump's ideas that finds favor within the party is his recent suggestion about pardoning people who forced their way into the Capitol on January 6. Six in 10 Republicans would support such pardons, putting them starkly at odds with the rest of the country. Republicans' sympathetic stance to the January 6 protesters is very much connected to lasting concerns about the election. Many Republicans still say widespread voter fraud and irregularities occurred, a false and debunked claim that at least six in 10 have nevertheless endorsed over the\u00a0past\u00a0year. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,578 U.S. adult residents interviewed between February 8-11, 2022.

            "article_content": "Republicans on Tuesday issued a stark warning to President Joe Biden and Senate Democrats: change the Senate rules at your peril.\u00a0 Mr. Biden on Tuesday endorsed changes to the Senate filibuster, the rule that requires 60 votes to advance legislation, so that just a simple majority of votes would be needed to pass two pieces of voting rights legislation that have been a top priority for national Democrats.\u00a0 \"To protect our democracy, I support changing the Senate rules whichever way they need to be changed to prevent a minority of senators from blocking actions on voting rights,\" Mr. Biden said.\u00a0 Ahead of the Mr. Biden's visit to Georgia, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell accused Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of \"trying to bully his own members into breaking their word, breaking the Senate, and silencing the voices of millions of citizens so that one political party can take over our nation's elections from the top down.\"\u00a0 McConnell also issued a stern warning to Democrats if they continue to push for the\u00a0 rules change. \"If my colleague tries to break the Senate to silence those millions of Americans, we will make their voices heard in this chamber in ways that are more inconvenient for the majority and this White House than what anybody has seen in living memory,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. Senate Republicans argued Tuesday that changing the Senate rules would fundamentally change the institution. \"This is more than just about one issue,\" said Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia. \"This is about fundamentally changing the fabric, the fence that the Senate provides by having the filibuster in place to make sure that we don't have the dramatic swings from administration to administration, from majority to minority, [from] Republican to Democratic, and that we keep the ship sort of going in the right direction and working together at the same time.\" Florida Senator Rick Scott, who serves as chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign arm, said he would be eager to force vulnerable incumbent Democrats to cast votes on issues like immigration, law enforcement funding, the withdrawal from Afghanistan and education.\u00a0 \"I think there's going to be some Democrats who are going to want to be on our side,\" Scott said Tuesday, referring to votes that Republicans may force if the filibuster is eliminated.\u00a0 Schumer said Tuesday that the Senate will act \"as soon as [Wednesday]\" on voting rights legislation. He cautioned if Republicans continue to block passage of voting rights and election reform bills, including the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, the Senate will consider \"the necessary steps\" to advance the measures. It is unclear what type of rules changes will receive a vote. \"If Republicans continue to hijack the rules of the Senate to prevent voting rights from happening, if they continue paralyzing this chamber to the point where we're helpless to fight back against the Big Lie, we must consider the necessary steps we can take so the Senate can adapt and act,\" Schumer added. But it's hard to see how the majority leader will be able to move the measures forward. Changing the Senate filibuster rules will require the vote of every single Democrat, and two of them,\u00a0 Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, have repeatedly said they oppose major changes to the rule. \"We need some good rule changes to make the place work better, but getting rid of the filibuster doesn't make it work better,\" Manchin said Tuesday. Schumer, when asked why he's planning a vote when not all 50 Democrats are united behind a plan,\u00a0 responded, \"First, we're still working to get it done, and we are still having, as we speak, active discussions with both Senators Manchin and Sinema. There's a 50-person discussion here. That's number one. Number two, this is so important. A job of a senator is to vote and the more important and pressing the issue is, the more that plays. We are going to vote.\" Georgia has a long history of battles over voting rights and has become a hotly contested political battleground in the past few years.\u00a0 Mr. Biden narrowly won the state in 2020, becoming the first Democrat to do so since 1992. Victories by two Democratic U.S. Senate candidates in January 2021 gave Democrats control of the Senate. Last year, Georgia lawmakers overhauled the state's election laws. The Department of Justice is among the plaintiffs who have filed lawsuits challenging Georgia's new law.\u00a0 Republicans in Georgia have fiercely defended its election law. \u00a0 \"We have secured the ballot box, restored confidence in our elections and made it easy to vote and hard to cheat,\" Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp said.\u00a0 Georgia is one of at least 19 states that passed bills restricting voting access in 2021, according to the progressive Brennan Center for Justice. Dozens of similar bills are being carried over into 2022 legislative sessions or have been filed ahead of those sessions.\u00a0 Mr. Biden and Democrats have argued that those laws increase the urgency to set federal standards over early voting, mail voting and voter ID and to restore the Justice Department's ability to approve changes to election laws in states with a history of discrimination.\u00a0 \"The defeated former president and his supporters use the big lie about the 2020 election to fuel torment and anti-voting laws,\" Mr. Biden said in his speech.\u00a0 Republicans have rejected those efforts.\u00a0 \"(Democrats) are trying to seize more power for themselves and federalize elections,\" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told reporters on Tuesday.\u00a0 Mr. Biden's trip to Georgia was not universally celebrated by voting rights activists in the state. Some groups chose not to attend the speech, saying it's time for Democrats to take action rather than make speeches.\u00a0 \"Unless President Biden applies the same level of urgency around voting rights as he did for BBB and infrastructure, America may soon be unrecognizable,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement. \"While President Biden delivered a stirring speech today, it's time for this administration to match their words with actions, and for Congress to do their job. Voting rights should not simply be a priority \u2014 it must be the priority.\" CBS News reporter covering the Senate.",

            "article_content": "The president of Sri Lanka fled the country early Wednesday, days after protesters stormed his home and office and the official residence of his prime minister amid a three-month economic crisis that triggered severe shortages of food and fuel. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards left aboard a Sri Lankan Air Force plane bound for the city of Male, the capital of the Maldives, according to an immigration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. Rajapaksa had agreed to step down under pressure. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he would leave once a new government was in place. Lawmakers agreed to elect a new president next week but struggled Tuesday to decide on the makeup of a new government to lift the bankrupt country out of economic and political collapse. The promised resignations brought no end to the crisis, and protesters have vowed to occupy the official buildings until the top leaders are gone. For days, people have flocked to the presidential palace almost as if it were a tourist attraction \u2014 swimming in the pool, marveling at the paintings and lounging on the beds piled high with pillows. At one point, they also burned the prime minister's private home. While lawmakers agreed late Monday to elect a new president from their ranks on July 20, they have not yet decided who will take over as prime minister and fill the Cabinet. The new president will serve the remainder of Rajapaksa's term, which ends in 2024 \u2014 and could potentially appoint a new prime minister, who would then have to be approved by Parliament. The prime minister is to serve as president until a replacement is chosen \u2014 an arrangement that is sure to further anger protesters who want Wickremesinghe out immediately. Sri Lankan presidents are protected from arrest while in power, and it is likely Rajapaksa planned his escape while he still had constitutional immunity. A corruption lawsuit against him in his former role as a defense official was withdrawn when he was elected president in 2019. Corruption and mismanagement have left the island nation laden with debt and unable to pay for imports of basic necessities. The shortages have sown despair among the country's 22 million people. Sri Lankans are skipping meals and lining up for hours to try to buy scarce fuel.  Until the latest crisis deepened, the Sri Lankan economy had been expanding and growing a comfortable middle class. The political impasse added fuel to the economic crisis since the absence of an alternative unity government threatened to delay a hoped-for bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The government must submit a plan on debt sustainability to the IMF in August before reaching an agreement. In the meantime, the country is relying on aid from neighboring India and from China. Asked whether China was in talks with Sri Lanka about possible loans, a Chinese Foreign Ministry official gave no indication whether such discussions were happening. \"China will continue to offer assistance as our capability allows for Sri Lanka's social development and economic recovery,\" said the spokesman, Wang Wenbin. On Tuesday, Sri Lanka's religious leaders urged protesters to leave the government buildings. The protesters have vowed to wait until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe are out of office. After the storming of the government buildings, \"it was clear there is a consensus in the country that the government leadership should change,\" said Jehan Perera, executive director of the National Peace Council of Sri Lanka, a think tank. Months of demonstrations have all but dismantled the Rajapaksa political dynasty, which has ruled Sri Lanka for most of the past two decades.  The protesters accuse the president and his relatives of siphoning money from government coffers for years and Rajapaksa's administration of hastening the country's collapse by mismanaging the economy. The family has denied the corruption allegations, but Rajakpaksa acknowledged some of his policies contributed to the meltdown. The president had not been seen nor heard from since Saturday, though his office issued statements indicating that he continued to carry out his duties.",

            "article_content": "Paris \u2014 France's top administrative court on Tuesday blocked a bid to allow the \"burkini\" at municipal pools in the city of Grenoble, upholding a government challenge against a move that revived France's intense debate on Islam. The all-in-one swimsuit, used by some Muslim women to cover their bodies and hair while swimming, is a controversial issue in France where critics see it as a symbol of creeping Islamization.  The \"very selective exception to the rules to satisfy religious demands... risks affecting the proper functioning of public services and equal treatment of their users\" the Council of State ruled Tuesday.  Its judgment backed a lower court ruling in May that was prompted by a challenge by the national government to the council's decision. Led by Green party mayor Eric Piolle, Grenoble had in May changed its swimming pool rules to allow all types of bathing suits and for women to bathe topless.  Previously, only traditional swimming costumes for women and trunks for men were authorized.  \"All we want is for women and men to be able to dress how they want,\" Piolle said at the time.  But the judges disagreed.  They ruled Tuesday that \"contrary to the objective declared by the city of Grenoble, the change to the pool rules aimed only to authorize wearing of the 'burkini.'\" The city council in Grenoble said in a statement Tuesday evening that it took note of the court ruling, while regretting that the court had attributed views to the council that it did not hold.  The changes it had tried to implement had been about allowing equal access to all users to public services, it argued.  Interior Minister Gerard Darmanin welcomed the ruling, describing it on Twitter as \"a victory for the law against separatism, for secularism and beyond that, for the whole republic\".  France's treatment of Islam is likely to remain a political battlefield following Sunday's inconclusive parliamentary election, which denied President Emmanuel Macron an absolute majority in parliament.  Voters handed the anti-immigration, anti-Islam National Rally an unprecedented 89 seats.  The more mainstream Republicans conservative party is seen as the only possible partner for Macron to reach a governing deal or pass laws on a case-by-case basis.  Republicans lawmaker Eric Ciotti called on Twitter Tuesday for the burkini to be \"clearly banned by law.\" Attempts by several local mayors in the south of France to ban the burkini on Mediterranean beaches in the summer of 2016 kicked off the first row around the bathing suit. The restrictions were eventually overturned\u00a0\u2014 also by the Council of State \u2014 for being discriminatory.  But Tuesday's ruling did not call that previous one into question, said Patrice Spinosi of the Human Rights League (LDH).  \"This decision is only relevant to the specific situation in Grenoble and shouldn't be generalized,\" he said. The LDH had backed Grenoble's rule change over swimwear.  Burkinis are not banned in French state-run pools on religious grounds, but for hygiene reasons. Swimmers are not under any legal obligation to hide their religion while bathing.  Grenoble is not the first French city to change its rules.  The northwestern city of Rennes quietly updated its pool code in 2019 to allow burkinis and other types of swimwear.",

            "article_content": "President Biden is naming Julie Chavez Rodriguez to serve as a White House senior adviser, putting her on par with some of his most senior and longest-serving aides and making her one of the rare Latinas to hold a top West Wing staffing role. Rodriguez  currently serves as director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and the White House is set to announce Wednesday that she will retain that position and become a  senior adviser and assistant to the president, serving alongside  other longtime Biden  aides  Mike Donilon, Steve Ricchetti and\u00a0Anita Dunn, who recently returned to the White House.\u00a0 Rodriguez will now be part of a wider clutch of aides, including chief of staff Ron Klain, deputy chief of staff Jennifer O'Malley Dillon and communications director Kate Bedingfield, who consult with the president daily on a wide range of domestic, foreign, communications and political issues.\u00a0 When the president consults his senior team in the Oval Office, there's a 22-inch-tall bronze bust of Cesar Chavez peering at them. Chavez is the late civil rights and farm worker leader who founded the union that eventually became known as the United Farm Workers \u2014 and Julie Chavez Rodriguez is his granddaughter. That she'll be sitting in on big meetings with the likeness of her grandfather watching \"is pretty remarkable and speaks to both what I see as the important opportunities in this country but also that this administration continues to create,\" Rodriguez told CBS News on Tuesday night. \"That in two generations we can go from a farmworker to a senior adviser in the Oval Office sitting together.\"\u00a0 Her new role comes amid other staff changes set to be formally announced Wednesday, including the addition of Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former mayor of Atlanta, who will lead the White House Office of Public Engagement, a job recently vacated by Cedric Richmond, who is now serving as an outside political adviser to the president.\u00a0 The changes come as the White House is staffing up again for what is poised to be a rocky season for an increasingly unpopular president trying to stave off widespread Democratic Party losses in the midterm elections. Several senior staffers, many of whom worked on Mr. Biden's 2020 campaign or with him during the Obama administration, have departed for the private sector in recent weeks, others are expected to continue shifting into new roles and others may eventually move to the president's 2024 anticipated reelection campaign.\u00a0 Rodriguez's current role keeps her in constant touch with lawmakers and the nation's mayors, county executives and governors regarding Biden administration policies and in the aftermath of natural disasters or other emergencies.\u00a0 Much of her work has focused on selling and explaining the bipartisan infrastructure plan and the American Rescue Plan, and how local and state leaders can apply for or reap the benefits of the record levels of federal funding established by the laws. But colleagues also noted that she relaunched the White House Working Group on Puerto Rico and ensured that her office's director for Puerto Rican affairs was someone born and raised in Puerto Rico.\u00a0 In the new role, Rodriguez said she expects to focus on those same issues, plus immigration reform and \"the important impact that we're having in the Latino community and making sure that that impact is understood and felt in communities across the country.\" Rodriguez served as deputy of the intergovernmental affairs office during the Obama administration after working on the Obama-Biden 2008 campaign. She credited the office's then-director, Cecilia Munoz, who \"served as a mentor and adviser to so many people like me that are continuing to impact and influence both government inside and outside in remarkable ways.\" As the Obama administration ended, Rodriguez was hired by then-Sen. Kamala Harris to serve as the new senator's state director. She later worked on the Harris presidential campaign as a traveling chief of staff, a connection that eventually brought her back to Biden. While there are four Latinos in the Biden Cabinet \u2014 the most to ever serve a president concurrently \u2014 those in senior West Wing positions are rare. Maria Echaveste served as a deputy chief of staff for policy in the final years of President Clinton's term. Rodriguez will be the first since to reach the senior adviser and assistant role. It's a decision likely to help assuage at least some concern among Latino lawmakers and civil rights organizations \u2014 usually expressed only privately but often directly to the president's top aides \u2014 that Mr. Biden is missing valuable and important real-world and political perspective by not placing more Latinos in senior roles. Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Rodriguez would be the first Latina to hold a top West Wing staffing role.

            "article_content": "A global computer chip shortage has made it harder for consumers to get their hands on cars, computers and other modern-day necessities, so Congress is looking to boost chip manufacturing and research in the United States with billions of dollars from the federal government. Both the House and the Senate have passed major legislation on the matter, and the effort is one of lawmakers' final opportunities before the November elections to show voters they are addressing the nation's strained supply chains. Now they have to work out considerable differences in the two bills. And Senate Republicans are already digging in before the negotiations formally begin. President Joe Biden has made the semiconductor legislation a top priority, but he'll need the support of 10 Senate Republicans, and perhaps more, to get a bill to his desk. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell emphasized that point when congressional leaders recently announced which lawmakers will serve on the committee that works to reconcile the two bills. \"Without major concessions and changes from House Democrats, this legislation has no chance of becoming law,\" McConnell said. House Democrats say their voices need to be heard during negotiations. \"We need to make sure that everyone has input,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of the New Democratic Coalition, a group that has 19 members participating in negotiations. \"We have a strong bill in the House, and I think there's important components there that the Senate should also consider.\" House and Senate leaders have selected lawmakers to join a committee tasked with merging the two bills into one. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi chose 49 Democrats and one Republican, Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the only GOP member to vote for the House bill. Republican House leader Kevin McCarthy selected 31 Republicans for the committee. McConnell and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer each picked 13 senators. The House has approved its participants, while the Senate still has some procedural work to do before it can do that. The Senate bill is projected to increase spending by about $250 billion over 10 years. The House bill would boost spending by more than $400 billion over the period. The Senate and House bills allot more than $52 billion for semiconductor production and research. Grants and loans from the federal government would subsidize some of the cost of building or renovating semiconductor plants. \"The chips funding is absolutely the foundation of this bill \u2014 it's a bipartisan foundation,\" said Josh Teitelbaum, senior counsel at Akin Gump, a law and lobbying firm. \"I think it is what is driving this toward the finish line.\" Both bills authorize a big boost in spending for the National Science Foundation, but they have different priorities for the research receiving funding. The Senate bill provides $29 billion over five years to a new directorate focused on strengthening U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, robotics and other cutting-edge technologies. The House bill provides $13.3 billion over five years to a new directorate for science and engineering solutions. It lists climate change, environmental sustainability and social and economic inequality as part of the directorate's focus. The two sides will have to hammer out their competing visions for the National Science Foundation and the new tech directorate. The two bills also establish regional technology hubs \u2014 with the Senate dedicating $10 billion to the program and the House dedicating $7 billion. The Senate bill calls for 20 such hubs, while the House bill authorizes at least 10. The seed money would go to regional organizations seeking to advance a variety of economic and national security priorities. The approach has bipartisan support from lawmakers with big rural and minority constituencies who want to ensure the money is not concentrated in universities or communities where a lot of tech research is already done. The bills diverge on supply chain issues, trade, immigration and climate change, to name a few areas of disagreement. One of the big-ticket items is a $45 billion program in the House bill to enhance supply chains in the U.S. There was no such provision in the Senate bill. The money would provide grants, loans or loan guarantees to companies, local governments and tribes trying to build or relocate manufacturing plants producing critical goods. \"This is a real area of focus for companies and for communities who want to try to bring back manufacturing,\" Teitelbaum said. \"There's a lot of interest in including this funding in the final package.\" Another stark difference is on trade. The House reauthorizes a program that provides training and financial assistance for those who lose their jobs or have their hours cut because of increased imports. The Senate has no such provision. \"It's not going to move without trade adjustment assistance,\" Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., said of the bill. Meanwhile, the Senate bill includes a trade provision that would exclude more products from tariffs the Trump administration put in place on goods imported from China. Those exclusions have almost all expired. The Senate bill reinstates them, a priority of business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The House bill addresses immigration, while the Senate bill does not. It would create a new visa category for entrepreneurs and would allow those with an ownership interest in successful ventures to apply to become lawful permanent residents. The House bill, unlike the Senate bill, also touches on climate change. It dedicates $8 billion to a fund that helps developing countries adjust to climate change. That could be a nonstarter for Republicans, who object to using U.S. taxpayer money for that purpose. No one expects the negotiations to be easy. \"I have a hard time explaining to my friends and constituents,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, \"that when the White House is in favor of something, when Democrats are in favor of something, Republicans are in favor of something, the House is in favor of it, and the Senate is in favor of it, we still can't seem to get it done. But I hope that we will take advantage of this opportunity.\"",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday evening, former Vice President Mike Pence praised Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy, criticized President Biden and \"cancel culture\" and said he would tell his child \"I love you\" if his son or daughter came out as gay.\u00a0 His remarks at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, more than four years removed from a violent white nationalist rally in 2017, revealed a political figure trying to at once embrace and set himself apart from former President Donald Trump, as he begins to chart a course for his own potential presidential bid in 2024. While his visit was centered around free speech and was billed as \"How to Save America from the Woke Left,\" he also advocated supporting the Ukrainian people and called Russia's invasion an \"unconscionable war of aggression.\"\u00a0 He encouraged attendees to contribute to humanitarian efforts in and around Ukraine, while praising Zelenskyy, whose refusal to surrender to Russia has won bipartisan admiration, with the exception of Republican North Carolina Congressman Madison Cawthorn, who previously called Zelenskyy \"corrupt\" and a \"thug.\"\u00a0 \"Putin only understands strength and America must meet this moment with American strength,\" Pence said, adding that he wants more military aid sent to Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia and President Vladimir Putin. During the Trump administration, it fell to Pence to inform Zelenskyy that hundreds of millions in aid would be withheld because Ukraine was falling short on fighting corruption, the Washington Post noted. Pence embraced the Trump agenda as he touted its accomplishments, and he compared Trump to Republican icon Ronald Reagan by saying both challenged the political establishment.\u00a0 \"Under the Trump-Pence administration, we actually achieved things that conservatives had only talked about for generations,\" he said. \"We did it all by standing strong for freedom.\" Pence's speech with the Young America's Foundation in Virginia is part of a series of college visits he's taken in recent months. He's also been active with congressional and state races in 2022 through endorsements and ad buys for targeted districts.\u00a0 \"Politically, his focus is on the midterms and making sure we win back both chambers of Congress and more governors' mansions,\" former Pence chief of staff Marc Short told CBS News when asked if Pence's visit is the prelude to a 2024 presidential campaign. \"This is not part of a presidential run.\" He added that Pence would be traveling a lot this summer, for House races primarily, but he would stay out of GOP primaries. Trump, in contrast, has made a number of endorsements in the Republican primaries, even those involving GOP incumbents. Short says he doesn't think Pence will be subpoenaed by the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol. Short, who was subpoenaed and testified before the committee, said it would be \"incredibly unprecedented for a vice president to be called in front of a separate branch of government to talk about private conversations with the president.\"\u00a0 Pence has defended his decision to follow the U.S. Constitution by certifying the Electoral College vote on January 6, 2021 \u2014 over Trump's public and private objections, in hopes that Pence would help overthrow the election and keep Trump in power, despite his loss to Mr. Biden. Pence has said he doesn't know if he and Trump will \"ever see eye-to-eye\" about what transpired that day.\u00a0 Before Pence's remarks, there were protest plans and an editorial by the college newspaper, The Cavalier Daily, that criticized the university's invitation to Pence and said his appearance would spread \"hateful rhetoric\" towards marginalized communities.\u00a0 \"It's a university, I'd almost be disappointed if we don't have hecklers,\" said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. \"A large majority of students, faculty and staff, they want to hear both sides. They know where they stand\u2013 if this were Trump it'd be something totally different.\" But only a small number of protesters remained outside by the time Pence began speaking, and he addressed the criticism of the event by framing it as a battle between cancel culture and free speech.\u00a0 \"I heard there was a little bit of controversy preceding my visit,\" Pence said. \"The antidote to cancel culture is freedom. The antidote to woke America is freedom\u2026 the truth is, every one of you must be prepared to stand on the ramparts of freedom in your life.\" Pence also spent time attacking Mr. Biden's handling of the economy and immigration, the rise of inflation, and what he called the Biden administration's \"assault on culture.\" During a question-and-answer portion with students, Pence, who has opposed gay marriage, was asked what he would say if his son or daughter were gay.\u00a0 \"I would look them in the eye and tell them, 'I love you,' he said, to cheers in the audience. He then referenced the Supreme Court decision that legalized same sex marriage, and said while he still believes in \"traditional\" marriage between a man and woman, \"the way we come together as a country united, I believe is when we respect your right to believe, and my right to believe what we believe.\" Asked by a student if he would run for president in 2024, Pence responded, \"I'll keep you posted.\" Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

When asked in January about what the GOP agenda would be, McConnell told reporters, \"I'll let you know when we take it back.\" Scott says he'll support McConnell\u00a0again to be the party's Senate leader, but upon releasing his plan, Scott wrote that \"if Republicans return to Washington's business as usual, if we have no bigger plan than to be a speed bump on the road to America's collapse, we don't deserve to govern.\"\u00a0 His plan addresses a number of issues from education to a national voter ID law to immigration, laying out what Republicans will do if they win later this year. Included in the framework are several steps to address the economy and government spending, but one line in particular has come under fire. \"All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount,\" the plan states. \"Currently over half of Americans pay no income tax.\" Democrats were quick to seize on the statement.\u00a0 \"Senator Rick Scott explains the Republican plan to raise taxes on more than half of Americans,\" tweeted Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. \"He wants working families and seniors to pay more.\" White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki also weighed in, tweeting that Senate Republicans \"just released an economic plan that doesn't include a single proposal to lower prices for the middle class.\" One day after the plan was unveiled, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced it would start running new radio ads highlighting the Scott tax plan. The five-figure ad buy would target voters on streaming radio including Pandora and iHeart radio stations and podcasts.\u00a0 \"We're making sure voters know the facts about Senate Republicans' agenda: a tax hike on millions of seniors and over half of all Americans,\" said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Communications Director David Bergstein. The ad ends: \"if Republicans win, we'll pay the price.\"\u00a0 Some 61%, or nearly 107 million households did not pay federal income tax in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the U.S., according to analysis by the Tax Policy Center last year. But the organization anticipated the spike would be temporary and that the share of those not paying federal income taxes would drop to 102 million households \u2014 or 57% \u2014 in 2021. The study also noted, nearly everyone paid some other taxes, including state and local sales taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, or state income taxes. Scott's plan to have all Americans pay some income tax brings to mind Mitt Romney's 47% comments, made when he was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012. In the leaked recording taken at a fundraiser, Romney argued that 47% of people would vote for President Obama \"no matter what\" and were dependent on the government. He said they were people who pay no income tax. He went on to state his job is not to worry about them because he would never be able to convince them they should take \"personal responsibility.\"\u00a0 President Obama and Democrats hammered Romney for those remarks, pointing out that the 47% included seniors on Social Security, veterans, students and more. The remarks went on to haunt Romney for the rest of his losing presidential bid, and he later expressed regret for them. The tax stance in Scott's plan comes as Democrats in leadership are facing mounting challenges heading into the midterms, with the COVID-19 pandemic stretching into a third year and inflation soaring 7.5% in the past year.\u00a0 In response to Democrats' derision of the plan, Scott doubled down, claiming their \"fake outrage\" about the plan \"further illustrates just how out of touch they are with the American public.\" He tweeted that Americans \"want everyone to pay their fair share. Working Americans all pay taxes on their income, and retirees already paid plenty.\" Tony Fabrizio, a pollster for former President Trump, applauded Scott's \"courage for staking out an agenda,\" but added he didn't understand \"embracing or saddling the] GOP with a tax increase.\" Even before Scott rolled out his plan, Democrats had been attacking Republicans repeatedly over taxes, ever since Trump and the Republican-led Congress passed their tax cuts in 2017.\u00a0 According to the Tax Policy Center, higher income households received larger tax cuts as a percentage of after-tax income, with the largest cuts going to the top 95th to 99th percentile of incomes. At the same time \u2013 the Treasury Department found billions of taxes owed go unpaid by the wealthiest Americans every year. Democrats have called for a reversal of the Trump tax cuts. They've also pushed for more money for the IRS in part to conduct more audits on the wealthiest Americans and corporations.\u00a0 But the Scott plan calls for a different approach to the contentious agency, stating Republicans will \"immediately cut the IRS funding and workforce by 50%.\" CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

            "article_content": "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 Tennis star Novak Djokovic on Monday won a court battle to stay in Australia to play in the Australian Open despite being unvaccinated against COVID-19, but the government quickly threatened to cancel his visa a second time. In a tweet showing him on an Australian Open tennis court with members of his team, Djokovic said he was \"pleased and grateful that the Judge overturned my visa cancellation.\" \"Despite all that has happened,\" he said, \"I want to stay and try to compete\" in the championship. \"I remain focused on that.\" I\u2019m pleased and grateful that the Judge overturned my visa cancellation. Despite all that has happened,I want to stay and try to compete @AustralianOpen I remain focused on that. I flew here to play at one of the most important events we have in front of the amazing fans. \ud83d\udc47 pic.twitter.com/iJVbMfQ037 Federal Circuit Court Judge Anthony Kelly reinstated Djokovic's visa, which was canceled after his arrival last week because officials decided he didn't meet the criteria for an exemption to an entry requirement that all non-citizens be fully vaccinated.   The judge also ordered the government to release Djokovic within 30 minutes from the Melbourne quarantine hotel where he spent the last four nights. The ruling renewed the world's top-ranked tennis player's chance to win a record 21st Grand Slam title at the upcoming Open. Djokovic is a nine-time Australian Open champion. His 20 Grand Slam singles titles is a men's record he shares with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.\u00a0 But government lawyer Christopher Tran told the judge after the decision that the minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and Multicultural Affairs, Alex Hawke, \"will consider whether to exercise a personal power of cancellation\" of the visa. \"The Minister is currently considering the matter and the process remains ongoing,\" Reuters quoted a spokesperson for Hawke as saying.\u00a0 That would mean Djokovic could again face deportation and miss the Open, which starts on January 17.  Kelly said the threat of another visa cancellation meant the \"stakes have now risen rather than receded.\" Government lawyers confirmed that another visa cancelation would mean Djokovic would be banned from Australia for three years. The back and forth has gripped the world and caused a furor in Australia, where many initially decried the news that Djokovic, who has been a vocal skeptic of vaccines, had received an exemption to the country's strict rules for foreign travelers. Many felt the star was being given special treatment as Australians who aren't fully vaccinated face tough travel and quarantine restrictions, and anyone entering the country must prove their vaccination status or demonstrate an exemption. \u00a0 When border police blocked him upon arrival, others cried foul, saying he was being scapegoated by an Australian government facing criticism for its recent handling of the pandemic.  Speaking with television network Prva in Belgrade, Serbia, the tennis star's brother, Djordje Djokovic, described the judge's ruling as a \"great defeat for Australian authorities,\" but said the family was still hearing that his brother could be detained.  \"This is definitely politics, all this was politics,\" he added.  At a later news conference, Djokovic's parents reiterated claims that he was being mistreated for political reason, even suggesting he'd been tortured in Australian custody and had his human rights violated. The office of Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews confirmed that Djokovic had not been placed under arrest. Hundreds of fans gathered late Monday outside his lawyers' office in Melbourne, many carrying Serbian flags and wearing the banner's red, white and blue colors. They chanted \"Free Nole,\" using the star's nickname. Police later dispersed them when they surrounded a car trying to leave the area. The virtual hearing crashed several times because of an overwhelming number of people from around the world trying to watch the proceedings. At one point, an expired court link was apparently hacked and broadcast pornography, The New Daily News website reported. Agence France-Presse described Monday's visa restoration as \"an extraordinary setback for the Australian government, which has imposed strict pandemic requirements on arriving foreign travelers for the past two years.\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison's conservative government is seeking re-election for a fourth three-year term at polls due by May.  While his government was widely praised for containing the nation's COVID-19 death toll at the start of the pandemic, Omicron cases have been rapidly surging. He has been criticized for shortages of rapid antigen tests and for refusing to make the tests available to all for free.\u00a0 Djokovic had argued he didn't need proof of vaccination because he had evidence that he'd been infected with the coronavirus last month. Australian medical authorities have ruled that a temporary exemption for the vaccination rule can be provided to people who've been infected with COVID-19 within six months.  Circuit Court Judge Anthony Kelly noted that Djokovic had provided officials at Melbourne's airport with a medical exemption given to him by Tennis Australia, which is organizing the Open, and two medical panels.  \"The point I'm somewhat agitated about is what more could this man have done?\" Kelly asked Djokovic's lawyer, Nick Wood.  Wood agreed with the judge that Djokovic could not have done more.  Transcripts of Djokovic's interview with Border Force officials and his own affidavit revealed a \"repeated appeal to the officers with which he was dealing that to his understanding, uncontradicted, he had done absolutely everything that he understood was required in order for him to enter Australia,\" Wood said.  Djokovic's lawyers submitted 11 grounds for appeal against his visa cancellation. The lawyers described the cancellation as \"seriously illogical,\" irrational and legally unreasonable.",

            "article_content": "Just weeks before the Nov. 8 vote, Utah's senior senator, Republican Mike Lee, is now acknowledging a real reelection threat from Evan McMullin, an anti-Donald Trump independent and former Republican challenging him in the state's most competitive Senate race in decades. Lee's campaign insists it's confident heading into Election Day, but there are unmistakable signs of anxiety in a race shaping up as a referendum on the direction that Trump has taken the Republican Party. Lee recently sent out fundraising emails with the subject line: \"I'm losing.\" In an appearance on Tucker Carlson's Fox News program, Lee begged the state's other Republican senator, Mitt Romney, to \"get on board\" and endorse him. And speaking to reporters after a debate, the two-term senator said what his campaign had previously avoided saying: \"It's close.\" In reliably Republican Utah, the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, has emerged as a potent issue after the House committee investigating the riot published Lee's text messages with then-President Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows. In the exchange, Lee discussed ways to challenge the 2020 results in the days and weeks after the election. Lee has claimed he was merely doing due diligence and he notes that he did not join congressional Republicans who objected to the results when they were certified on Jan. 6, the day of the insurrection. Lee has not leaned into claims of widespread election fraud and manipulation of voting machines in the 2020 election that have been debunked by repeated audits, court cases and Trump's own Department of Justice. Shortly after the text messages were released, Utah Democrats aiming not to split the anti-Lee vote decided to back McMullin rather than nominate a Democrat. While Lee has tried to categorize McMullin as a Democrat, McMullin, who ran for president in 2016 as an independent and won Lee's vote as a protest of Donald Trump, has said he would not join either party's caucus if elected to the Senate. \"I'm not going to Washington to play the party power game,\" he said. Laura Knowlton, a Republican from right-leaning Davis County, cites the text messages as one of her reasons for voting for McMullin. She is certain they indicate further involvement from Lee in efforts to overturn the election. Knowlton doesn't understand how voters could ignore that. Yet in an election year where many Republicans remain captivated by Trump and the voting fraud claims at the basis of his pursuit to overturn the 2020 outcome, she predicts some \u2014 including in her family \u2014 will vote for Lee out of party allegiance. \"This will be a test,\" she said. \"Can you just excuse the things we know about Lee and blindly vote for him because he has an 'R' next to his name?\" McMullin has tried to use the texts to puncture the reputation Lee has worked to cultivate as a principled conservative deeply committed to the Constitution. McMullin has framed them as proof of how Lee's transformation from onetime Trump critic to loyal supporter puts him at odds with Utah voters yearning for an alternative to the direction that Trump has taken the Republican Party. McMullin argues the country's long-running partisan gridlock and the more recent threats to democracy are intertwined symptoms of a political culture that has veered toward extremes. He and campaign allies such as Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., have urged voters to put aside their views on abortion, government spending and other issues so they can band together against what is portrayed as the existential threats to democracy posed by Trump and loyalists such as Lee. \"I would love to have the luxury to disagree on issues again. We're gonna argue taxes forever. But right now, we're fighting for the survival of this country,\" Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the House's Jan. 6 committee, told an applauding audience at a campaign event for McMullin on Thursday in downtown Salt Lake City, one of Utah's most liberal-leaning areas. Lee has tried to focus the race on pocketbook issues such as the cost of living. He is aiming to appeal to Utah's Republican majority, making a case about how important he thinks it is for the party to retake the Senate In a debate this past week, he cited what he said was his his libertarian voting record and willingness to break from Trump. The senator said that \"seriously entertaining the idea of supporting an opportunistic gadfly supported by the Democratic Party might make for an interesting dinner table conversation. But this is not an ordinary year.\" Republican voter Bill Lee, a longtime Lee supporter who is not related to him, said McMullin has been forced to obscure his real positions on some issues in order to keep together the disparate coalition of Republicans, Democrats and independents that he needs. \"He's playing a fine-line game, where he's trying to garner enough votes from three different groups to coalesce around some sort of margin of victory,\" Bill Lee said. \"But if he talks too much on where he actually stands, he'll probably alienate one of those groups, so his game plan has been to stay as quiet as possible.\" Utah is a deeply conservative state, where the political culture borrows heavily from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A majority of the population \u2014 including Lee and McMullin \u2014 are members. The faith's support for refugees and culture that teaches self-restraint often clashes with the direction that Trump has taken the GOP. Members of the faith lean Republican, yet polling has shown Trump commands less robust support among them than other prominent GOP politicians. Trump failed to win support from a majority of Utah voters in 2016 and Joe Biden lost but performed better with Utah voters in 2020 than any Democrat since 1964. Lee's 2020 remarks comparing Trump to Captain Moroni, a scriptural hero in the Book of Mormon, alienated some members of the faith and is the subject of a recent McMullin attack ad. Unlike other competitive Senate races where Republicans have tried to play down and rebuff Democrats' efforts to make abortion a central issue, both candidates in Utah identify as anti-abortion. McMullin says he is \"pro-life\" but opposes extreme policies that criminalize women. Lee said at the debate he was \"deeply thrilled\" with the Supreme Court's decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade. Though abortion is a key issue for her this election, Jenny Bech, one of the many Democrats who came to see McMullin and Kinzinger in Salt Lake City, said she plans to vote for McMullin. \"I think there's a sense of desperation from the voters,\" she said. \"I'm a therapist and I can tell you people are very anxious.\"",

And this week on Face the Nation: Grim economic numbers prompt new fears of a recession, as President Biden makes a controversial trip to try and help cut global energy prices. Costs continue to soar, with the price of food, energy and housing all up from May. Inflation is now up 9 percent year over year, despite a strong jobs market and decreasing gas prices. Wall Street and economic observers were shocked by the report. But those numbers came as no surprise to Americans finding it harder and harder to make ends meet. This was not the news the president needed on his Mideast trip, where he was criticized by even some Democrats for meeting with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The CIA says MBS approved an operation to capture or kill U.S.-based writer Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. (Begin VT) QUESTION: Do you regret the fist bump, Mr. President? JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): Why don't you guys talk about something that matters? I'm happy to answer a question that matters. QUESTION: Will inflation go down from here, Mr. President? PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I'm hoping. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will devote most of our broadcast to the economy today, Presidential Coordinator on Energy Security Amos Hochstein, former head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Jason Furman, and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser We will also preview this week's prime-time installment of the January 6 hearings with Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger, one of two committee members presenting new evidence Thursday. Plus, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb is back with us, as monkeypox continues to spread and new COVID variants prompt questions about what kind of booster works best. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have a lot to get to today, but we began with the new January 6 investigation developments. Late Friday, the committee issued a subpoena for Secret Service records following the revelation that the agency had erased text messages from the day before and the day of the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Last Tuesday's hearing detailed a chaotic White House meeting between the former president, White House counsel Pat Cipollone, and a group of outside advisers over a plot to seize ballot boxes and overturn the 2020 election. This week, the panel will hold a prime-time hearing on Thursday focused on the 187 minutes from the time when President Trump left the stage at that rally in the Ellipse... (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States): And we're going to walk down to the Capitol! (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: ... until he issued that infamous video message. (Begin VT) FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So go home. We love you. You're very special. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger will be co-leading that hearing on Thursday. Good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER (R-Illinois): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: So let's start with these Secret Service texts. The agency said this was just a matter of timing and a tech upgrade. Do you believe that? Or was this malicious? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: I think we're going to know more Tuesday. We made the decision as the committee that we need to subpoena these records. The I.G. came in front of us and said, look, we have been working hard to get this. They claim it was this technological change: We moved everything, we lost these texts. And then they also put out a statement, though, that said: We've only lost some of the texts and everything relevant to this investigation has been turned over. So, those are very conflicting statements. So we decided, as a committee, let's request these by Tuesday, and we can make a decision. I will say this. In the very least, it is quite crazy that the Secret Service would actually end up deleting anything related to one of the more infamous days in American history, particularly when it comes to the role of the Secret Service. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the subpoena set Tuesday as the deadline. So has the Secret Service said, we will meet that deadline, and these texts still do exist somewhere? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: That's what we've -- from what we understand, they've said: We'll meet this deadline. And we'll see what we get here. So, either we get that info... MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't know that they exist still on record? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: We don't know. So either we get that stuff -- if we end up getting the texts, then obviously, for whatever reason, the I.G. didn't. Now you have what you have. If we don't, then it'll call out the Secret Service as having said that they had these texts, and they don't. So, is this anything big? We're not sure. But we need to chase every lead down on this, and there's a question of, why are they not cooperating with the I.G., the DHS I.G.? MARGARET BRENNAN: Inspector general. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: And they need to. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the committee has, though, spoken in the past with some Secret Service officers. So do you have a date yet to question the two, in particular, Tony Ornato, about what happened January 6? Of course, he's relevant because of Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony about what happened in the vehicle. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Yes. Look, we're still working on that. We'd love to have him come in. We're working out those details. We know that through, I guess, anonymous sources, they've said they're going to be happy to come in and testify. We would encourage anybody to, anybody that knows anything, but it's got to be under oath. Right now, it's just been discussion from Secret Service through anonymous sources. And that, to me, compared to somebody like Cassidy Hutchinson, who swore under oath what she had heard, that's important to come in and do that. So that's still ongoing, but, hopefully, we get that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you get that by Thursday and this hearing? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: I highly doubt we'll get them coming in and talking by Thursday. But, again, I would love that. But we keep getting new people coming in every day with information, willing to go on the record. So it's been amazing how, since these hearings have started, the amount of information we're getting has just rapidly accelerated. MARGARET BRENNAN: CNN was reporting that a D.C. police officer who had been somehow involved in the motorcade arrangements was corroborating the testimony given by Cassidy Hutchinson that there was an almost violent confrontation with the former president in the vehicle that day. Is that what the committee has been told? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: I can't confirm or deny those, because we haven't come out with who we have or haven't spoken to. I will just say, I'm not going to aggressively push back on that characterization. And we have every reason to believe that what Cassidy Hutchinson said, at least from what she said she heard, because she wasn't in the limo, never said she was... MARGARET BRENNAN: She was told this by other officers. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: She was told this. We fully believe that she is a credible witness. And her allegations are quite explosive. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, 187 minutes. You're leading this hearing. You know what you can present at this point. Can you at least tell us if you filled in the blanks of who the President was actually speaking with, why there weren't phone records, for example, of phone calls he may have placed during that time period? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: We have filled in the blanks. I can't necessarily say that the motives behind every piece of information we know we'll be able to explain. But this is going to open people's eyes in a big way. The reality is -- I will give you this preview -- the president didn't do very much but gleefully watch television during this time frame. We're going to present a lot more than that. But I could only imagine, as -- I mean, I knew what I felt like as a U.S. Congressman. If I was a president, sworn to defend the Constitution -- that includes the legislative branch -- watching this on television, I know I would have been going ballistic to try to save the Capitol. He did quite the opposite. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president didn't do anything? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: The president didn't do anything. And we're going to fill those blanks in. And if the American people watch this, particularly -- I say this to my fellow Republicans -- watch this with an open mind. And is this the kind of strong leader you really think you deserve? MARGARET BRENNAN: The chairman of the committee, Bennie Thompson, has said you all are still discussing whether to go ahead and try to force a conversation with the former vice president, Mike Pence. His former chief of staff, Marc Short, said on this program this is very low likelihood of ever happening. Do you personally want to subpoena Mike Pence? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Look, I personally want to talk to Mike Pence. I think there's a difference between, do we subpoena him, do we ask him for a transcribed interview? I think it would be important to hear everything he has to say. That said, I'm not sure we get a ton more out of him than what his staff has already told us. The big question we're still dealing with as a committee is, is there benefit in talking to somebody like Donald Trump and request, and he come in? That's something we're negotiating back and forth on whether we want to do that and what that looks like. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is the value in speaking directly to the former president and the vice president, when the former vice president's chief of staff and his legal adviser have testified to you? Why do you need him physically there? And what would the president's testimony do? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Yes, and I'm not sure we do need them physically there, because, again, we're getting a lot of information. And I think you'll see, after Thursday's hearing, we know a lot. Look, Donald Trump has made it clear that he doesn't mind not telling the truth. Let's just put that mildly. He lies all the time, I wouldn't put it past him to even lie under oath. So I'm not sure what the value is there. That's, again, something we're -- I think the thing to keep in mind is, this -- this investigation is not winding down. We may be towards the end of this tranche of hearings. We may have more hearings in the future. And the investigation is still ongoing. So, we're -- we're getting to the bottom of what we need to know. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tranche of hearings. What does that mean? I mean, how many are you thinking? What more do you have? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, we've done -- this is -- this will be our eighth hearing. This is the end in this kind of grouping. I fully expect, when the report comes out, we may have a hearing or two around that. But, of course, as you saw with Cassidy Hutchinson, if we get information that the American people need to know, we may end up bringing up more hearings at that time too. MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to ask you about the former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who spoke, I guess, for eight hours behind closed doors with the committee the other day. He said to reporters: \"There is so much interest in the December 18 Oval Office meeting because it all comes down to it. The crux of history comes down to it.\" And then his lawyer said, stop talking. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: What's the rest of the sentence? Exactly what is the crux of history here? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: I don't know. You know, it's hard to get into the mind of somebody like Patrick Byrne. It's hard to get in the mind of somebody like Rudy Giuliani. Is this a grift? Do they really believe some of these conspiracies? But he has been -- I mean, it seems like Patrick has come to believe that there is some deep state conspiracy to overthrow the government, and -- or to at least have the deep state way of the government. And so I don't know what would have come next in his mind. But I can tell you his -- he seems a little unmoored from reality when it comes to politics and when it comes to democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, \"Mother Jones\" published audio this week of Steve Bannon, who was speaking to a group of associates in October, I understand this was recorded, about the former president's plan to declare victory. Let's listen to what he said: (Begin VT) STEVE BANNON (Former White House Chief Strategist): And what Trump's going to do is just declare victory, right? He's going to declare victory. But that doesn't mean he's the winner. He's just going to say he's the winner. That's our strategy. He's going to declare himself the winner. So, when you wake up Wednesday morning, it's going to be a firestorm. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that indicate to you? I mean, Steve Bannon speaks sometimes in hyperbolic terms. Does that indicate to you that there was a level of planning going back that far? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Oh, yes. I mean, I think, look, if you look at the President's statements even months prior to the election, he started saying: If we lose, it's because it's going to be stolen. - There was -- I think it was Chris Stirewalt came in on our second hearing and talked about that idea of that -- the red mirage, how, early in the night, it'll look like Republicans are winning, and then, later, it will be the obvious result. I mean, I think Democrats were ahead in Ohio significantly even at the beginning of the night. Steve Bannon is an agent of chaos. Steve Bannon, in his own words, believes you have to basically burn the system down to rebuild it and fix it. What he's saying right there is very clearly him saying, no matter what, we're declaring victory. And that is a violation of everything we have to hold dear in the Constitution. Listen, the only thing we need for democracy to survive is the knowledge that you can vote, that that vote counts, and we live with the winner and loser. If half the country believes that that wasn't accurate, you can't expect democracy to survive. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's going on in Georgia. Your fellow Republican Senator Lindsey Graham is challenging a subpoena by a grand jury there. They want to ask him questions about this call that he placed to the secretary of state there around the election. Graham said he's done nothing wrong. Is there a reason the January 6 Committee has not spoken to him? Are there questions you have for him? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, look, the question of, is there reasons, well, I mean, first off, we have a lot of information in terms of what happened in Georgia. That's a piece of our investigation. We have the whole broader thing of what led to January 6, what's been done since. In terms of him, no, I haven't talked -- talked to Lindsey Graham personally. That's his decision with the grand jury and a challenge. I'm not sure if his issues of speech and debate, which is what he claims the protection are, he was acting in his position as a senator, I'm not sure if that actually would apply to if you're attempting to change an election outcome. I'm not the lawyer. I don't know. But, to me, it seems a little odd that he would try to pull that in front of -- in terms of going in front of a grand jury and saying what you know. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congressman Kinzinger, thank you for coming in. We'll be watching on Thursday. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: You bet. MARGARET BRENNAN: And CBS News will cover that hearing at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time Thursday night on our broadcast and streaming networks. Face the Nation will be back in one minute, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: There are now more than 1800 confirmed cases of monkeypox in the United States. States and cities where infections are spiking are now demanding more vaccines from the Biden administration. Joining us to discuss this is former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who's also a board member at Pfizer. Good to have you here. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Good to see you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Give us a sense of the scale of this, because the CDC numbers are out. They say they're only eight women within that, no children. You're saying this is a pandemic. That's not a word the administration is using yet. What level of emergency are we at. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, and I think they're going to be reluctant to use the word pandemic, because it implies that they've failed to contain this. And I think, at this point, we've failed to contain this. We're now at the cusp of this becoming an endemic virus, where this now becomes something that's persistent that we need to continue to deal with. I think the window for getting control of this and containing it probably has closed. And, if it hasn't closed, it's certainly starting to close, 11,000 cases across the world right now, 1,800 cases, as you said, in the U.S. We're probably detecting just a fraction of the actual cases, because we have a very -- we had for a long time a very narrow case definition on who got tested. And, by and large, we're looking in the community of men who have sex with men and at STD clinics. So we're looking there, we're finding cases there. But it's a fact that there's cases outside that community right now. We're not picking them up because we're not looking there. This has spread more broadly in the community. I wouldn't be surprised there's thousands of cases right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a little chilling to hear you say containment has failed. I have heard you say that before with COVID. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, this isn't going to explode like COVID. This is a slower-moving virus, which is why we could have gotten control of this if we had been more aggressive up front. And we made a lot of the same mistakes that we made with COVID with this, having a very narrow case definition, not having enough testing early enough, not deploying vaccine in an aggressive fashion to ring-vaccinate. But now this is firmly embedded in the community. And while it's not going to explode, because it's harder for this virus to spread, it's probably going to be persistent. You'll have this as a sort of a fact of life, maybe spreading as a sexually transmitted disease, but also breaking out of those settings. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the CDC said monkeypox can show up to three weeks post-exposure. What are the basic symptoms? If you have a rash, do you call your dermatologist? Who do you call? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, it's a vesicular rash. It's associated with fever and achiness. You know, historically, you used to get a disseminated rash. What we're seeing right now is people aren't presenting with a widely diffuse rash, but sometimes just a small number of vesicles. So I think it's being confused with other vesicular rashes, Herpes. Coxsackie can cause a vesicular rash, certainly chicken pox. Right now, anyone who presents with a vesicular rash that can't be explained by another etiology, so a rash that causes vesicles, should be tested for monkeypox, whether they come from a high-risk community or not. That's the way we're going to snuff this out. We didn't have enough testing to do that. Now CDC has gotten in place more testing. There's probably adequate testing to broaden it to be able to accomplish that. So we should be doing that physicians should be sending off these tests. MARGARET BRENNAN: The problem with testing, also, it seems that distribution or access to a vaccine is an issue, the mayor of New York, the governor of New York asking the Biden administration to do more to get them access. Why is this a problem? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, we didn't have adequate stockpiles of the vaccine, the one vaccine that's approved for monkeypox. We only had 2,000 doses in the National Strategic Stockpile. It was there as a hedge against smallpox. We took our eye off that ball, so we didn't replenish that supply. They ordered about 300,000 doses that have been delivered; 150,000 have been distributed. Another 130,000 will go out this week. There's going to be... MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that overseas. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Some of it -- well, there's 800,000 doses that were overseas that the manufacturer, Bavarian Nordic, had overseas. Those are being brought into the U.S. right now. FDA has to do what's called lot release. They have to inspect those doses to make sure they were appropriately manufactured. They're doing that inspection at the same time that they're forward-deploying those 800,000 doses. So those are going to cities right now. And, as soon as FDA finishes that, which should be this week, those doses will be turned on. They'll be able to be distributed or be used on patients. So I think the vaccine situation is going to improve dramatically this week. You're going to see literally hundreds of thousands of doses become available. The White House has intervened to take more control of the response away from CDC. This can't be our response every time... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: ... that, when CDC drops the ball, the White House and the political leadership need to step in. That's what's happened here. It happened in COVID. We need to fundamentally reform how we respond to these crises. MARGARET BRENNAN: You wrote a book on that. I want to ask you about COVID. The CDC says now about 54 percent of Americans live in an area of high COVID community spread. That's up from 31 percent the prior week. That seems fast-moving. What is different about these variants now? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, it's the B.5 variant that's growing. It has the capacity to evade the immunity that we've acquired from vaccination and also from prior infection. It does seem to be that B.2 infection confers more robust immunity against this B.5 variant. So places that had big outbreaks of B.2, like the Northeast, probably are going to be more protected. There's 100,000, over 100,000 cases on average being reported on a daily basis. We're probably detecting one in 10 infections right now. So it's probably more like a million. I think most Americans have started to accept this as part of the fabric of daily living. In part, that's based on a wholesale recalibration of risk. In part, it's based on the fact that there's very few people who are immune-naive, so people feel rightly more impervious to a bad outcome. So we have to recognize that this spread is happening against the backdrop, basically, of normal living. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the White House is saying, put a mask on if you go into indoor gatherings. The city of Los Angeles says they might institute this at the end of the month. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I don't think we're going to see mandates. I don't think that there's a lot of tolerance for mandates, maybe in select cities like Los Angeles. MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it advisable? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think, if you're going into a congregate setting with a lot of people you don't know, wearing a mask is prudent if you're in a high-prevalence area, especially if you're someone who's at risk. You know, I still wear a mask in certain settings. I wear it when I go through the airport. If I catch COVID, I want it to be from a family member or a friend, not some stranger I'm sitting next to on a plane. So I try to be prudent when I'm in mixed company. I think, right now, if you live in a high-prevalence region, it's advisable, especially if you're someone who's vulnerable, if it's easy enough. MARGARET BRENNAN: And a booster shot. Will we have a rebooted bivalent vaccine in the fall? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, well, look, there's going to be a vaccine based on B.4 that the manufacturers are developing right now. There is a bivalent vaccine based on B.1 on the shelf right now that we could be deploying. We're not. That probably would be more protected against this B.4 variant and B.5 variant. We -- they've made a decision so far not to deploy that, but to wait for the B.4 variant vaccine that's going to be available this fall. Right now, if you're above the age of 50 and you haven't had a dose of vaccine this year, you probably should get one. And the sequencing is good. Get a dose now if you're someone who's at high risk, and you can come back and get one later. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Dr. Gottlieb, good to have you back in person. Wish you had better news, but it's nice to see you. (LAUGHTER) DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: In Uvalde, Texas, the community awaits the release of an investigation conducted by the Texas House into the police response to the massacre at Robb Elementary School, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed. More than an hour of video from school security cameras will be shown to families along with that report. CBS News correspondent Lilia Luciano is waiting for the report in Uvalde -- Lilia. LILIA LUCIANO: Margaret, for too many parents in this community, it's too late. Answers will not bring their children back. But they hope this investigation will pave the way for some level of accountability and will prevent at least a delayed response like this one from happening in the future. One of the big questions we're seeking to answer is, why did officers wait more than 70 minutes to stop the shooter, when the training for every one of the seven agencies represented in those hallways tells them you stop an active shooter immediately? Why did they wait even as the gunman continued to shoot? They had shields, rifles, breaching tools. And why was the state's governor, Republican Greg Abbott, given incorrect information about the shooting response in the immediate aftermath? (Begin VT) QUESTION: How do you feel about that now that you have seen the video? GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT (R-Texas): Well, just as angry, because it's clear that what was shown on the video was the exact opposite of the information that I was given on the day that I went out and explained what happened. (End VT) LILIA LUCIANO: The committee interviewed nearly 40 people, at least 20 from law enforcement. Among the questions that we need answers to is, why did officers think that this was a barricaded subject? Why did they wait, when we know from previous police reports that there were discussions among officers about children being inside the classroom, about possible injured people inside? And we also know that, early on in the timeline, officers were talking to dispatch. So who was getting the 911 calls from children like Miah Cerrillo, who was calling from inside the room nearly 15 minutes before that door was breached? This is not the only investigation. There are at least four others, including one by the Texas Rangers and a federal one by the Department of Justice. That so-called critical incident review seeks to inform future policy, training and apply lessons learned for other police agencies across the nation -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lilia, thank you. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, set your DVR. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. As President Biden met with middle eastern leaders last week, he was accompanied by Amos Hochstein, the special presidential coordinator for international energy affairs. He's with us now. Mr. Hochstein, welcome to FACE THE NATION. Good to have you here in person. AMOS HOCHSTEIN (Presidential Coordinator on Energy Security): It's great to be here in person. Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were one of the few U.S. officials in the room when President Biden met with Saudi leaders. Why was this trip worth the political risk? What did you get? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, I think this was a historic trip. First it started just landing in Saudi Arabia, in Jetta, as the first ever flight from -- for a president to fly from Israel directly to Saudi Arabia, with the backdrop of Saudi Arabia opening the -- announcement that they're opening the skies for the first time for Israeli aircraft, for all aircraft, including flights to and from Israel over its air space. It comes on the backdrop of a major achievement over the last few months of a cease-fire in Yemen where thousands of people have been killed over the last seven years. This has been the longest cease-fire we've had with a commitment from Saudi Arabia to work to extend the cease-fire even further. Major announcements for food security and achieving contributions from the GCC, from the Gulf countries, on food security. MARGARET BRENNAN: But none on oil yet? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, we had a -- major announcements on - on cooperation on energy rite large. And if you recall, just before the president announced his trip, just a few days before that, OPEC Plus made a major shift in its policies, recognizing that since Putin started amassing forces, the markets have been affected and that there was a supply/demand issue and announced increases in supply of 50 percent for July and August. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: And I'm -- based on what we heard on the trip, I'm pretty confident that we'll see a few more steps in the coming week. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, OPEC Plus meets August 3rd. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Saudi has some, very little, spare capacity. So, are you saying you got a wink and a nod that they're going to pump more? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: I think what we discussed -- first of all, it's not just about Saudi, it's about -- we met with - with the GCC and with Saudi Arabia. There is -- I'm not going to go into how much spare capacity there is in Saudi Arabia and in UAE and Kuwait, et cetera, but there is additional spare capacity, there is room for increased production. As we've told producers in the United States, we have had conversations over the last several months and weeks with OPEC. And I believe that there is still more room to - to see additional steps in the coming weeks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Saudi says it's got like a million spare barrel capacity. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Again, it's not just about Saudi. This is OPEC, so there are other countries as well. So what we need is to see a little bit more. But let's - let's look at what has happened since the president announced his trip. Oil prices, at that point, were at about $120. Today oil prices are around $100, $101. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: So that's a $20 decline based on the steps - MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that due to economic concerns, though. China looking like it's slowing and concerns here about consumption going down. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: So, there's no doubt, there's never one reason why oil prices go up or why oil goes down. As you know, when oil prices go up, they tend to say there's only one reason, and that's the political leadership. But, if you think about it this way, over the last few months, the president has supplied the U.S. market with a million barrels a day, which is a historic level. MARGARET BRENNAN: From the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: From the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We've never done that before. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that, what, ends in September. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: No, that - that will end towards the end of the year. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do -- will it end towards the end of the year? Can you afford to stop putting emergency supply on the market? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, look at what has happened. The private sector, as we talk to them in the United States, said they can increase production in the United States by about a million barrels a day, but it's going to take time to invest in it. It will come at the end of the year. So, we stepped in, the president stepped in and said, I'll fill that gap. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: So, hopefully, my expectation is that the private sector in the U.S. will have those increases coming so we don't need to have the emergency from the U.S. government. In the meantime, we've seen the - the prices -- both the oil price, but also the price at the pump has come down at the fastest rate that we have seen in over a decade. So, from over $5. And remember this, just a few weeks ago - MARGARET BRENNAN: IT's still pretty high. $5. Still pretty high. It may have come down from - AMOS HOCHSTEIN: It's not $5 anymore. It's now $4.55. And I expect it to come down more towards $4. And we already have many gas stations around the country that are below $4. So we're - we're - this is the fastest decline rate that we've seen against a major increase of oil prices during a war in Europe where one of the parties in the war is the third largest producer in the world. So, these are extraordinary circumstances. We've taken very tough measures to address them right away. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Both or the American consumer but really for the global economy too. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll watch to see if those gas prices continue to fall. I want to ask you about what the administration is pushing around the world, which is this concept of putting a cap on the price of Russian oil that is sold so that it's not cutting back on the amount but rather the windfall profits Putin can profit off of it. What's to stop Vladimir Putin from just saying, fine, I'm just going to stop pumping? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, I think that the way - look, the price cap is -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't that ruin your plan if he does that? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, first, he could do that tomorrow regardless of what we do on a price cap. You know, Putin has been an unreliable supplier, unfortunately. But I think what we're doing is we're designing the mechanism so that he can still - he still would have revenues. He needs those revenues to - that's the only revenues he really has in his country. There's nothing else in Russia except for oil and gas. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, JP Morgan says he's got enough cash that he's sitting on that he could cut by 5 million barrels in that extreme example that the price of oil would go up to, what, over $300 a barrel, almost $400 a barrel. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, what we want to be able to do is to mitigate where the price of oil on the world market doesn't actually impact Russia at all because we're going to put a price cap so that all they have is to get that price and no more than that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: We believe that that is the way to do it. So if prices go up, he still won't get that price, and we can reduce that prices for - MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have buy-ins for that? Why would India or China comply? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, first, at the G-7 a couple of weeks ago, the G-7 endorsed this idea as a good idea. We're now starting to have the conversations with the major consumers. And I would ask the question the other way around, doesn't every buyer try to get a lower price? So, I think every buyer's incentivized to pay less. And I'll - I'll go a step further. Right now, regardless of what you see as the global oil price, that's not what Putin's getting. So these headlines about Putin getting a - some kind of a math between how much is he stilling times the price of oil in the world, that's not his revenue because he's already agreed to major discounts. MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's still taking in money and he's still funding this war. So -- AMOS HOCHSTEIN: That's what we're trying to stop. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But, in the meantime, I want to ask you quickly about the president's climate change efforts. This bill and his proposal is completely stalled right now. The president says he's going to take executive action. What is the plan? What are you going to actually do here in the United States? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, I think we've tried to get a plan where we can incentive great incentives for U.S. investment - MARGARET BRENNAN: But you can't block new oil and gas drilling, right? You can't do some of those things because they would counter your efforts. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: Well, I think what we want to do in this - in this bill that we have proposed, and we are hopeful that - we still hope that that's what Congress does, is to give it the kind of incentive assurance that we can have additional American investment in climate, renewable energy, electric vehicles. Why wouldn't we want to do that? Why would we want to make - to create an environment in which China is ahead of us? The rest of the world is making the investments and we're not. We want to be able to put the kind of incentives that there will be additional investment in the infrastructure for renewable energy, for solar, for wind and for electric vehicles and for our nuclear fleet in this country. That's how we get to climate. We didn't get that today. The president is determined to take some action that he can through executive orders and through other actions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Like what? AMOS HOCHSTEIN: We'll see what we can do this week and in the coming weeks. But, again, I think that the responsibility here is to be able to invest into our future. Whether we like it or not, the -- those -- some don't like it. This is the future of energy markets in the United States and around the world. We've got to decide, do we want the U.S. to lead or do we want the Chinese to lead this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You've got to convince Senator Joe Manchin. We'll be talking about that ahead in this segment. Thank you very much for coming in. We'll be right back. AMOS HOCHSTEIN: It's a pleasure. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For a broader look at some of the economic headwinds we are facing as a country, we're joined now by Jason Furman. He was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under the Obama administration, and is now a professor at Harvard. He joins us from Boston this morning. Good morning to you. Inflation is running extremely high, as you know. Up 9.1 percent over the past 12 months. Shelter, food, gas, all the things the Fed can't really control, they're hurting people. Are we at the peak yet? JASON FURMAN (Former Chairman, White House Council of Economic Advisers): You know, Margaret, I don't know. Oil prices have been coming down. Gasoline prices have been coming down. So that headline number, that's the one that Americans really feel could be coming down. What was worrisome in this last report is even if you strip out all the volatile things, the underlying floor was actually strengthening. We might see the 12 month numbers rising in the months to come. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ouch. You know, looking at forward planning, Bank of America is now predicting a mild recession in the second half of the year. JP Morgan says the risk of recession is uncomfortably high. But Citigroup's CEO said she sees nothing in the data now to indicate that we're on the cusp of recession. So, this - this is the big money bet. What's your bet? Where are we on the possibility of recession? JASON FURMAN: Look, I'm not that much more worried than I am normally, but I don't have any confidence in that. MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? JASON FURMAN: In part because the economic signals are really unclear. In the first half of the year, it looks like GDP fell, but jobs grew quite a lot. You have business leaders saying they're worried we're going to go into a recession, but they're still hiring people. If they're bankers, they're still making loans to people. You have consumers saying they're really negative about the economy but they're still spending money. It's hard to square a lot of these contradictory signals right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But you're saying it is quite possible, it's just not clear. JASON FURMAN: Oh, it's certainly possible. But I - you know, and it's certainly more likely than it normally is. The risks are much greater than they normally are. But the idea that a recession is a foregone conclusion, or even over 50 percent chance, I don't see that, but I'm looking through a cloudy rear-view mirror trying to guess what's going to happen ahead of us. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Fair. I want to ask you about something you've been - you've been tweeting quite a lot about, and that is the fiscal side of the spending plan here. There have been these weeks of talks -- we just discussed it -- over the president's proposals on climate spending, a number of other things, and it collapsed, these negotiations, in recent days. You've been tweeting in favor of the Democrat's bill, which apparently would expand an income tax on individuals making over $400,000. Why do you think it's advisable to raise taxes in a period of inflation like that? People like Senator Manchin say we shouldn't be due to inflation. JASON FURMAN: Yes. So, Margaret, Senator Manchin is absolutely right to be more worried about inflation after the Friday report. That means we're going to need to do more. The Fed's probably going to telegraph larger rate increases in the future. It also means Congress should be trying to do their part in helping out. If they can cut the deficit, including raising taxes on high income households, that would, you know, reduce a bit of spending in the economy. It would cool the economy down a little bit and actually take some pressure off the Fed. The Fed would not need to raise rates by quite as much if Congress did their job. So, clearly, this is a time where everyone should be helping out and bringing inflation down. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what's interesting is that, when you were on this program back in May, you said one of the reasons the U.S. has incredibly high inflation was the emergency spending that President Biden signed into effect back in March of 2021. And it was spending like that, that Senator Manchin points to and says, see, this is why we need to wait. So, why was he right in the past and he's wrong now to be concerned about spending? JASON FURMAN: Yes. The difference is that we're talking about something exceedingly different then -- now than then. That was $1.9 trillion of new spending. Now on the table was something like $500 billion of deficit reduction. It was a net reduction in the deficit. I think almost anyone, regardless of where they were on the political spectrum that was an expert on this topic, would agree that would lower inflation. There's Republican friends of mine that would say, oh, I don't like lowering inflation by raising taxes on high-income households. They might have some other way they'd rather lower inflation. But, unambiguously, this is going to bring inflation down. And from my values and perspectives, it would bring it down in a fair way. Certainly much more fair than the tiny reduction in inflation we'll get if 12 million people get cut off their health subsidies and see their premiums go up at the end of the year. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, President Biden issued a statement saying he would endorse this slipped down version of the bill that would -- that Senator Manchin is endorsing that would lower health care premiums and prescription drug costs. Are you saying that slimmed down version is just not meaningful? JASON FURMAN: Well, look, I think that slipped down version helps. It would lower inflation both because of the overall deficit reduction and then very directly by slowing the growth o prescription drugs cost. That would be in both likely the private sector and the public sector that you would see that slowdown. So if that bill is the best you can get, and I certainly don't know enough about tactics in Washington to judge, that bill would be - would be a very good thing to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JASON FURMAN: You know, even within that bill, by the way, there are some open questions, at least in my mind. If you're not going to raise taxes, how about enforcing the tax code we already have? $600 million goes uncollected every year. Audits of millionaires are down 70 percent. If you fund the IRS, you can collect a lot more taxes without raising tax rates on anyone. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, will it add for inflation if all these states, Massachusetts, California, Indiana, Delaware, hand out checks to offset inflation? JASON FURMAN: Absolutely. Every one of those states is raising inflation nationwide to benefit the citizens in their own states. Collectively we'll be worse off because of it. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Jason Furman, thank you for your analysis and for joining us today. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the more startling numbers from last week's Consumer Price Index was the cost of rent, which is soaring at the fastest pace in 36 years. Here in the nation's capital, average home rental costs have jumped more than 11 percent in just the past year. The national rate is nearly 6 percent. Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser has made the push for affordable housing a part of her agenda. And she joins us. Good morning, Mayor. MURIEL BOWSER (D-Washington D.C. Mayor): Good morning. Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you, \"The New York Times\" had this piece on the housing crisis and homelessness in America and it highlighted D.C. as just one of those cities that has just persistently not had enough housing to meet demand. You've been working on reducing homelessness. Is the prime issue supply? MURIEL BOWSER: Well, we've been working on creating affordable housing and producing more and preserving more. And we are among the jurisdictions, I would say, that lead the nation in being a local partner in production. So, just in the last seven years we've invested more than $1.4 billion in doing exactly that. We're equally invested in making homelessness rare, brief and non-recurring in our city. And we have a plan to get there. We've seen our rates of family homelessness, for example, decrease by 78 percent. Chronic homelessness also. We're attacking and driving those numbers down for most categories. So, what we see is, in a city like ours, where people want to live and want to work, that we always have to be producing more housing. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I'm wondering then, in an environment where we are now where interest rates are going up, is that discouraging builders from producing what you need? Do you need the federal government to step in and provide some sort of support? MURIEL BOWSER: Well, we certainly are going to be able to do less with the very historic investments that we've made. So, we're concerned about that. But what I know, that we're doing everything locally that we can. We have a tool called the Housing Production Trust Fund. This year alone we'll invest $450 million in new units. We've set a goal of building 36,000 new units. So, we're always looking for the federal government to be a partner. And I have to say that in coming out of this pandemic and everything that the federal government was able to do to help cities like ours keep people housed with the American Rescue Plan dollars, with making sure that we're preventing evictions and keep people from getting evicted has been very helpful. MARGARET BRENNAN: \"The Washington Post\" reported last week that homeless shelters in D.C. were filling up and groups are getting overwhelmed by these buses that the governors of Texas and Arizona are sending here full of migrants. How significant is this influx? How many people? MURIEL BOWSER: Well, this is a very significant issue. We have, for sure, called on the federal government to work across state lines to prevent people from really being tricked into getting on buses. We think they're largely asylum seekers who are going to final destinations that are not Washington, D.C. I worked with the White House to make sure that FEMA provided a grant to a local organization that is providing services to folks. But I fear that they're being tricked into nationwide bus trips when their final destinations are places all over the United States of America. MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's not just local taxpayers picking up the tab. You're saying federal government is helping? MURIEL BOWSER: Well, local taxpayers are not picking up the tab and should not pick up the tab. And we really need a coordinated federal response. We know that it's done for refugees who - who come to - to the states from all points of the world and the same has to be done in this situation. MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about monkeypox, 108 million infections here in the district according to the CDC numbers. Is the outbreak more significant than that? And are you prepared for the spike when it comes to available vaccine? Your Democratic colleague in New York City says he needs more vaccine. MURIEL BOWSER: We need more vaccine. We've gotten just over 8,000 doses. We estimate that we need about 100,000 doses to address the current target population. MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow. MURIEL BOWSER: So, we need more doses for sure and we know that that work is being done. We already have a very robust testing regime and we've mottled it on what we were able to do with Covid. And we're going to continue to test. And I think because of that robust testing, we're going to see more cases. But we want people to pay attention to ways to - of protecting themselves, especially by getting vaccinated when the vaccine is available. MARGARET BRENNAN: Has the federal government promised you those doses? MURIEL BOWSER: We -- no. Our health department works with the CDC and others. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. MURIEL BOWSER: And so as the - as the vaccine is available, we're going to be ready to distribute it. MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want - you have a big portfolio here in the nation's capital. MURIEL BOWSER: Indeed. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the risk of political violence. Homeland Security has warned the entire country should essentially be prepared for more political violence. How are you planning for it here in D.C.? MURIEL BOWSER: Well, we, as the nation's capital, we're kind of always on high alert as a target of all manner of political violence. And, unfortunately, we've seen that of a domestic nature in the last several years. So our -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Particularly Supreme court justices, January 6th. MURIEL BOWSER: January 6th. The events of -- surrounding the murder of George Floyd. All. But we also see -- we see demonstrations of First Amendment protests throughout the year. Some you don't hear about, but our police are out there working every day to make sure people can peacefully protest, but also keep our cities safe. So, it is a ongoing, high-level interaction with our federal partners, including federal homeland security, all the federal agencies that are in D.C. But our metropolitan police department is there to support them in many cases and lead in others. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Mayor Bowser, thank you for your time and for coming in today. MURIEL BOWSER: Thank you. Thank you. My pleasure. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with more FACE THE NATION. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'll see you Thursday, along with Norah O'Donnell, John Dickerson and the rest of our team covering the January 6th hearings at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time right here on CBS.

And today on Face the Nation: Ukraine's president makes an urgent plea for help and warns this morning of impending war crimes, as Russia shells the south and the east, targeting populated areas. President Biden's top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, joins us from the region to update on what the U.S. is doing to help.\u00a0    Meanwhile, with Russian forces just 20 miles outside the capital city of Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleads for more firepower. We will ask Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, what they need and ask House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff what lawmakers can deliver.\u00a0    Plus, we will hear from the former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker about how the Western alliance is mobilizing to face its greatest threat in decades. And as the fighting drives the biggest refugee exodus in Europe since World War II, we will get the latest from the United Nations refugee commissioner, Filippo Grandi. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\u00a0    Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have watched with growing horror as Vladimir Putin's rampage through Ukraine continues. The death toll from both sides is incalculable at this point. The news and pictures from the region are adding a surreal quality, devastating a world still struggling to recover from a two-year global pandemic.\u00a0    Russia's economy and, in turn, the Russian people have suffered a series of blows, from crippling sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its allies to the growing list of major corporations pulling out of that country. But Vladimir Putin has refused to back down.\u00a0    Yesterday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Congress for more aid, including fighter jets. And again today he repeated that plea for a no-fly zone, a request the U.S. and its allies have rebuffed, for fear of direct confrontation with Russia's military.\u00a0    We begin in Kyiv with Charlie D'Agata -- Charlie.\u00a0    \u00a0CHARLIE D'AGATA: Good morning, Margaret. The latest word from the International Red Cross is, that effort to evacuate as many as 200,000 residents from the southern city of Mariupol has failed again for the second day in a row. Both sides blaming each other for breaking a temporary cease-fire with renewed fighting.\u00a0    (Begin VT)\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice-over): Residents in the besieged city of Mariupol have withstood some of the heaviest shelling from the Russian military since this invasion began.\u00a0    (HEALTH CARE WORKER SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: Doctors Without Borders describes the humanitarian crisis as catastrophic and that civilians are in desperate need. The city's hospital is overwhelmed.\u00a0    A man rushes in, clutching his 18- month-old son wounded in shelling. Doctors try frantically to revive the little boy, but they're unable to save him.\u00a0    (WOMAN CRYING)\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: His mother breaks down in tears. Elsewhere, the brutal onslaught has only intensified, destroying everything in its path. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy today warned that Russia is now planning to bombard the port city of Odessa, while renewing the plea for a no-fly zone.\u00a0    (PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: Countered by President Putin's warning to the West that any country declaring a no-fly zone would be seen as an enemy combatant.\u00a0    (MAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: With Moscow now banning all media coverage of the war in Ukraine, Visa and Mastercard have now joined the growing number of international companies suspending operations in that country. Even as Russian troops close in on major cities, Ukrainian forces continue to put up a fierce resistance, claiming to have downed a Russian fighter jet, and the Defense Ministry distributing video of a Russian attack helicopter shot out of the sky. Even in occupied cities like Kherson, anti-Russian protests and demonstrations are already under way.\u00a0    \u00a0(GUNSHOTS)\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: Residents confronting armed Russian soldiers, and yet, the more determined the resistance, the more devastating the Russian military's response.\u00a0    (End VT)\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: This morning, Pope Francis rejected Russia's assertion that this is a military operation, saying it is a war, which is leading to rivers of blood and tears. Here, a Ukrainian delegate says a third round of peace talks with Russian counterparts are due to take place tomorrow -- Margaret.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: Charlie D'Agata in Kyiv, stay safe. CBS News national security correspondent David Martin has been closely tracking the Russian military's march toward Kyiv. And he joins us now. David, the U.S. had been projecting Kyiv would fall within days. Is that still what they expect?    DAVID MARTIN: No. The Russian attempt to quickly take down the Ukrainian government has clearly failed. The Russians stalled. But we got to remember, they're stalled, but this is not a spent force. We have seen the satellite photos of that convoy stuck on the road northwest of Kyiv. There's another convoy east of Kyiv, which is a tank column, almost a division's worth of tanks. They ended up there when they ran out of gas, literally ran out of gas. But they have been refueled now. And you can just see that it seems to be a matter of time before this push from the northwest and this push from the east come together in an encirclement.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: And what happens when Kyiv becomes encircled? Because the United States has set some pretty clear lines of what they won't do. If Ukraine gets these fighter jets they want, will that make a difference?\u00a0    DAVID MARTIN: Sure, it'll make a difference, but will it be decisive? I don't think so. The Poles who are the country that is willing to transfer these MiG-29s, on paper, they have 27 MiG-29s. We don't know if all 27 are combat-ready. But, more importantly, we don't know how many pilots Ukraine has left. Because, in air combat, it's the shortage of skilled pilots that usually gets to you  before the loss of aircraft.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. has been pouring -- my sources say, just pouring Stinger missiles, anti-aircraft and anti-tank weaponry in. Is that what Ukraine is completely dependent on right now?\u00a0    DAVID MARTIN: Well, they have their own forces that they began the war with. But they had finite stocks of ammunition. I mean, Russia essentially has infinite stocks of ammunition, because they can bring stuff from the interior. And all of those Javelins and Stinger anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, they're coming in by land. But, if Russia succeeds in encircling Kyiv, how are the supplies going to get through?    MARGARET BRENNAN: I have not been told yet -- from every U.S. official I have asked, I have not heard the clear answer to the question of when all of these sanctions will actually affect their military and what's happening on the ground. When will we see an impact?\u00a0    DAVID MARTIN: I don't think we should count on sanctions to have an impact on the fighting in Ukraine. What we should count on is that the Russians have proven themselves to be not very good at maneuver warfare. The art of maneuver warfare is to bring all your forces, land, air, all together at a point of attack. And they just seem incapable of doing that. The aircraft are flying over here, and the land troops are trying to advance over here. So they're attacking in piecemeal. And the Ukrainians, because they know the terrain better and because they're fighting for their country, are able to stop them. If they get their act together, the laws of physics are going to apply here, and they're just going to be able to grind up the Ukrainian resistance.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: David, thank you very much for your insight and for your reporting. We go now to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who's in Moldova this morning. Mr. Secretary, good morning to you.\u00a0    ANTONY BLINKEN (U.S. Secretary of State): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin has said that sanctions amount to a declaration of war. They are impacting his economy, but they're not stopping his military.  When will sanctions stop the fight?\u00a0    SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Margaret, the impact of the sanctions is already devastating, which is presumably why he said what he said. But at the same time, we continue to see President Putin doubling down and digging in on this aggression against Ukraine. That's continuing. And I think we have to be prepared, unfortunately, tragically for this to go on for some time.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: NATO has said none of its 30 members are willing to set up a no-fly zone. President Biden has been very clear he has no interest in that or combat troops. But what more can the United States do here? If, for instance, the Polish government, a NATO member wants to send fighter jets, does that get a green light from the U.S., or are you afraid that that will escalate tension?\u00a0    SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: No, that -- that gets a green light. In fact, we're talking with our Polish friends right now about what we might be able to do to backfill their needs, if, in fact, they choose to provide these fighter jets to the Ukrainians. What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they're handing over to the Ukrainians? We're in very active discussions with them about that. Look, I have been in Europe for the last couple of days working closely, as always, with our allies and partners at NATO, the European Union, the G7 countries, and all of us together are continuing to take steps to increase the pressure on Russia through additional sanctions, all of which are very actively under discussion and will be implemented in the coming days, as well as taking further steps to give the Ukrainians what they need to defend themselves against the Russian aggression.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you convince Vladimir Putin that this isn't ultimately about regime change? How do you get him to back down?\u00a0    SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: For us, it's not about regime change. That's -- the Russian people have to decide who they want to lead them. And, look, as I said, the challenge is this. Vladimir Putin continues to press this aggression. That's why I say I'm afraid this could go on for some time. But it's going to end, and it's going to end with Ukraine prevailing, because, even as Putin has the capacity, because he can -- the manpower, the equipment that he has that he can bring to bear can continue to grind down these incredibly brave and resilient Ukrainians, winning a battle is not the same thing as winning a war. Taking the city is not the same thing  as capturing the hearts and minds of Ukrainians. What they've demonstrated with extraordinary courage is that they will not be subjugated to Vladimir Putin's will to -- and be under Russia's thumb. So, whether that takes another week, another month, another year to play out, it will. And I know how this is going to end. But the question is, can we end it sooner rather than later, with less suffering than to -- going forward?\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: President Zelenskyy has repeatedly said that these may be his final days. If Russia kills him, what will be the consequence? And are you working on a contingency plan to support a Ukrainian government without him at the helm?\u00a0    SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: The leadership that President Zelenskyy has shown, the entire government has shown is remarkable. They've been the embodiment of this incredibly brave Ukrainian people. I was just a day ago in Ukraine, at least about 15 feet into Ukraine, with my friend and colleague, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. The Ukrainians have plans in place that I'm not going to talk about or get into any details on to make sure that there is what we would call continuity of government one way or another. And let me leave it at that.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about another massive diplomatic undertaking, and this is the attempt to negotiate a deal to put a cap on Iran's nuclear program. Yesterday, Russia's top diplomat, Sergei Lavrov, said you personally, he wants you to personally give him a written guarantee of exemptions from sanctions in order to keep cooperation on the nuclear deal. Are you giving him that? Is the entire Iran deal at risk?\u00a0    SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: The sanctions that are being put in place and that have been put in place on Russia have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal and the prospects of getting back into that agreement. These things are totally different and are just are not in any way linked together. So I think that's -- that's irrelevant. It's also in Russia's interests, irrespective of anything else, for Iran not to be able to have a nuclear weapon or at have the capacity to produce a weapon on very, very short order. That interest remains, again, irrespective of where we are in our relationship with Russia as a result of its aggression in Ukraine.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: What are the prospects for that deal, and also two other aspects here, the American hostages that are being held by Iran right now?  And do you see the prospect for Iran agreeing to stop threatening people on U.S. soil, like they did a journalist living in New York, like they have threatened your predecessor, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo?\u00a0    SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: We've made real progress in recent weeks on getting back to reimplementation of the JCPOA, the Iran nuclear deal. And I think we're close. But there are a couple of very challenging remaining issues. And nothing's done until everything's done. And so, unless we're able to resolve a couple of outstanding issues, then we don't get -- we don't get back to the deal. But we're working on it right now. It is really coming down to whether we can resolve a couple of outstanding issues. If we can, we'll get back on the deal. If we can't, we won't.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: On those specific issues of stopping -- stopping threats against those on U.S. soil and on releasing hostages, are those two demands?\u00a0    SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: We're going to continue to do everything we possibly can to get detained Americans, arbitrarily detained Americans, home, whether it's Iran or anywhere else. And that's something we're working, again, every single day. When it comes to threats that Iran is making, when it comes to actions that it's taken outside of the nuclear area, including activities in the region in the Middle East that are threatening to us, threatening allies and partners, again, irrespective of whether we get back into the deal or not, we will stand and act against those every single day. We were very clear when we were in the deal originally that nothing about the deal prevents us from taking action against Iran when it's engaged in actions that threaten us, threaten our allies and partners. That will very much continue.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.\u00a0    SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Thanks, Margaret. Good to be with you.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.\u00a0    (ANNOUNCEMENTS)    MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ukraine's Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Welcome back to Face the Nation, Ambassador.\u00a0    UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Thank you, thank you very much for having me.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: Your president issued two pleas for help this morning. He said if the west does not provide Ukraine with at least planes, there is only one conclusion to make: you also want us to be killed very slowly. This morning Secretary Blinken said there is a green light for Poland to give you those fighter jets. Do you know if you will get them, and what difference will it make?    AMBASSADOR MARKAROVA: Well, as we see during eleven past days, I think Ukrainians have shown to all the world that we're not going to stop and we're not going to surrender. And we will defend our homes. And like in 2014, when Russians attacked us the first time and there was this brutal destruction of Donetsk Airport, where Ukrainian cyborgs, people that- our military guys, defended the airport until the very end, until it collapsed. And there is a saying we have that, you know, they- the cyborgs withstood the concrete didn't. We don't want that to happen again, so we will fight. Our brave men and women of the armed forces and all of the civilians who are stopping the enemy without weapons, even, will fight, and we need all of the support in order to sustain this fight--\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: --Do \u00a0    AMBASSADOR MARKAROVA: So--    MARGARET BRENNAN: --you know when those planes will come?    AMBASSADOR MARKAROVA: We're hoping as soon as possible. And we are working with our American, especially, friends and allies on the steady supply of all of the ammunition and anti-air anti-tank and planes to be able to effectively defend our country.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: It terrified the world, frankly, this week, when they saw that Russia fired on a nuclear power plant in Ukraine. And their- your president told Congress yesterday forces from Russia seized two nuclear power plants in Ukraine. They're advancing toward a third. Are you on your own to defend these? Is any help coming from anywhere in Europe to secure the nuclear plants?\u00a0    AMBASSADOR MARKAROVA: Well, I think it should come because the first station that they seized was Chernobyl station, which is very risky, but it is not operational, so there is a lot of waste there and everything else. And since they- they- won- won of the war the personnel that is there is held hostage. There are no change of shifts, so it is very dangerous. The second one's operation is the largest one in Europe. So actually, that put the world on the brink of the nuclear disaster. And even though, again, our firefighters were able to put down the fire, nobody is safe. Ukraine is not safe. Europe is not safe. Because these stations are not supposed to be run by war criminals. They are supposed to be run by- run by responsible engineers. So- this is something that we are raising as an issue because Ukraine has many power plants, and all of them could be under attack because, again, we're all are shocked not only about that all this indiscriminatory shelling of civilians, shooting people, bombing schools and now nuclear plants. What's next?\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: So- but what is the solution there? Asking to- you know- U.N. Officials to come in and help secure-? What is the option available to Ukraine to secure these plants now?\u00a0    AMBASSADOR MARKAROVA: This is the question to the world. You know, we are ready for any option. We're talking about the closed no- skies. We're talking about any type of security operations. We are talking to anyone. So, whatever, whoever, whether it's the U.N. or any other, or individual countries, I mean we should act together. We are defending it. We're doing everything possible. We are being responsible, even though we're defending our home, our armed forces are very careful not to shoot at the power plants, not to do any damage that could impact not only Ukraine but us. We cannot say that about the Russian criminals, who are doing everything specifically to destroy Ukraine.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: And Russia, of course, denies any of this is deliberate, and denies the reports from your government that they're raping women, that there is a deliberate targeting of nuclear power plants and infrastructure. They deny bombing the holocaust memorial deliberately. Do you think that the international community is doing what it is supposed to do? Or do you feel like the international system is failing Ukraine?\u00a0    AMBASSADOR MARKAROVA: Well, look, first it is appalling that Russia is denying it and that they- that they are lying because we see it online, and I would like to thank all of the brave men and women, journalists, who are now in Kyiv and all the other places showing what's actually happening in Ukraine. It happens. They did it. They did it deliberately. We see it on videos, photos and you know we all talk to people back home. So, Russians are escalating, and they are quick, and we've very helpful- we're very thankful to all our partners, and especially to the United States, to everyone, to President Biden, for everything they're doing to support us. But it is clear after eleven days that we also need all of us to move faster because Russians are escalating.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: You attended the State of the Union last week as a guest of the First Lady. The president addressed this country talking about Ukraine. That's very different for the American people to hear. How do you explain to the American people why this $10 billion in aid that President Biden is asking for? Why should U.S. taxpayers be concerned and invested in your country?    AMBASSADOR MARKAROVA: Well, Ukraine didn't do anything to be attacked. If we didn't provoke Russia, we didn't do anything. We were not a threat to Russia unless being a peaceful democracy and just peacefully leaving in your own country is a threat. And if it's so, then it's not only about Ukraine, then Europe and the whole world is not safe. I mean, we see President Putin threatening everyone with all the forces, including the nuclear force. We have to stop him because again, it's not just some conflict, it's not just some regional problem. It's a full-fledged war that a nuclear large power that actually signed and assurances, together with the United States and Great Britain when we denuclearize Ukraine voluntarily in 1994 \u2013 signed gave us assurances not to attack us. So, we are first, and we need to stop Putin and this criminal war in Ukraine, rather than waiting until we all together will have to fight it everywhere.    MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Ambassador, thank you again for joining us and we'll be right back with a lot more face the nation, so stay with us.    (ANNOUNCEMENTS)    MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR, or we're available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. And we're replayed on our CBS News Streaming Network at noon Eastern.\u00a0   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0   MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff.  And we will have more on the growing humanitarian crisis in Europe with the chief of the U.N. Refugee Agency, Filippo Grandi, plus the former U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker. Stay with us.\u00a0   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We now want to go to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. He's a Democrat from California and joins us from the Los Angeles area. Good morning to you.   REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Good morning.   MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on Ukraine. The United States purchases about 600,000 barrels of Russian petroleum products a day. Speaker Pelosi said that oil should be banned. The White House says it's looking at options. What is that option? Does a solution come from Congress or is this something President Biden needs to act on?   REP. SCHIFF: I think it could come from either place. I think there's very strong bipartisan support to cut off Russian oil and gas sales to the United States. It's anathema, I think, to many of us in Congress that while we were sanctioning them and trying to cripple their economy that way would help them in any way by purchasing their petroleum. But I think the administration wants to make sure that we work with our allies. This will have an impact to- potentially on global oil prices, including here at home, where in Los Angeles now gas is over $5 a gallon. So he wants to make sure that we understand the impact on the global supply. But I think there is strong support to show solidarity with Ukraine, but also to make sure that American dollars aren't supporting the Russian war machine in any way.   MARGARET BRENNAN: How quickly does that need to happen? I mean, this is Putin's lifeline. It's a cash cow.   REP. SCHIFF: Well, I think we like to act on it very quickly. At the same time, you know, we have to be circumspect about the fact that Russia will probably find somewhere else to sell that oil and gas to. So the impact ultimately on Russia may not be as powerful as we would like. It's why we have to continue to explore additional ways to really crush the Russian economy. But I have to say I'm enormously impressed with how the world has come together with how here in Congress, in a very partisan Congress, Democrats and Republicans are uniting around this tough sanction package, as well as providing more defensive military support to Ukraine. There is enormous solidarity with the brave people of Ukraine.   MARGARET BRENNAN: There is solidarity, but it seems that Vladimir Putin is willing to suffer the consequences of those sanctions. And the Russian people are, the military is not stopping its advance, at least that we can see. what will happen if, as President Zelensky is predicting he loses his life in this Russian attack, what will the United States do then?   REP. SCHIFF: Well, he has, I think, been an incredibly courageous wartime leader. This was, I believe, another miscalculation by Putin, who believes Zelensky was weak, would not be able to lead a country to war. But in fact, he has proved to be enormously strong and not only rallied Ukrainians, but I think rallied people around the world. I don't want to contemplate what might happen in his absence, although I do think the Ukrainian people will fight on and we will continue to support them. But obviously, we're doing everything we can, supplying, I think, real time intelligence to help protect him, as well as to give Ukrainians the information they need to defend themselves.   MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. and global powers, as we spoke to Secretary Blinken about, are potentially on the cusp of a new diplomatic deal with Iran, a renewed version of this nuclear program should the Biden administration present that to Congress for review? Do you want to take a look at it?   REP. SCHIFF: Well, I'm certainly going to want to look at it and study it and assess the merits of it. I think it will come down ultimately to whether it is a, essentially re-entering the deal that the Trump administration pulled America out of or it is substantially different- new and different deal. If it's the latter then I think it will require a vote in the Congress. If- if it's the former, then the administration may be able to do that on its own. Ultimately, I think the decision to pull out was disastrous. Iran has moved forward both in terms of its enrichment, but also in terms of its expertise. And ultimately, we're going to have to weigh the impact of that on any new agreement.   MARGARET BRENNAN: You are the chair of intelligence, you know, well, Iran's espionage activities and the operations they've tried to carry out on US soil, including this attempt to kidnap a New York based journalist. There are also threats against former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other Trump officials. Should this new deal with Iran include a promise to stop carrying out those kind of operations on U.S. soil?   REP. SCHIFF: Well, I would love a nuclear deal to include prohibitions on Iran's malign activities, a cessation of its missile and drone program. But the question is not what I would like, but rather whether a deal that is confined to curbing Iran's ability to get a bomb is a good deal. And I think if we can take off the table, any pathway to a bomb for year- for Iran, that in itself is worthwhile. These other malign activities of Iran's, their plots against the U.S. personnel or Americans around the world we can deal with and have to deal with separately, and we should deal with them aggressively. But I wouldn't say that we should neglect to stop their nuclear program because of these other activities. We need to go after all of this, not necessarily in one agreement.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, I want to ask about the January six committee. There was a development this week, a court filing claiming there is now evidence that President Trump broke the law in his efforts to overturn the election in 2020. Do you think that the attorney general is moving fast enough with his enforcement?   REP. SCHIFF: What we made clear in our filing to the court is we believe there's a good faith basis to conclude that the former president and his campaign may have violated any number of federal laws, including obstructing an official\u00a0 proceeding, the joint session, and defrauding the American people. And I do think that the Justice Department ought to be looking at these issues and ought to be investigating in particular just to give one very graphic example the former president on the phone with the secretary of state in Georgia demanding that he find 11,780 votes that didn't exist, but the precise number he would need to overtake President Biden. I think if anyone else had engaged in that conversation, they would be under investigation and it should be no different for the former president. So I think the department is diligently pursuing those who attack the Capitol that day. But there were multiple lines of effort to overturn the election that may have violated the law, which also should be investigated.   MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Chairmanship, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back.   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the refugee crisis.  Christina Ruffini reports from Poland.\u00a0  (BEGIN VT)\u00a0  CHRISTINA RUFFINI: As Ukrainian men stay behind to defend their country, Ukrainian women are fighting their own battles, navigating danger, rubble, and chaos.\u00a0  WOMAN (through translator): It was scary. We got scared. Before that, we did not think we would leave.\u00a0  CHRISTiNA RUFFINI: Panicked crowds and freezing temperatures, hauling children, luggage, even the family dog. Thousands of refugees have fled into surrounding countries. More than 100,000 to slow Slovakia. Almost 170,000 to Hungary. And more than 800,000 to Poland.\u00a0  WOMAN: I want to stop war and get back my normal life. I want to live in peace.\u00a0  CHRISTINA RUFFINI: Twenty-nine-year-old Christinia (ph) came to this border crossing with a mission, to pick up and deliver this car to the front, paid for with donations and filled with supplies.\u00a0  MAN: We have night vision. It's really hard to get now.\u00a0  CHRISTINA RUFFINI: Since military-aged men can't leave Ukraine, women are acting as couriers.\u00a0  MAN: This whole country are fighting against an enemy united, like helping each other. WOMAN: The only thing that have this day (ph) is to work and to believe.\u00a0  CHRISTINA RUFFINI: Believe that this will end, that they can win, and that their country and its people will be made whole.\u00a0  (END VT)\u00a0  CHRISTIANA RUFFINI: Now, Secretary of State Antony Blinken was here yesterday, where he met with refugees and told them they are not alone. And in a show of support, President Biden has asked Congress for $4.2 billion in aid for Ukraine. Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Christina Ruffini in Poland, thank you. We want to go now to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. He's at a refugee shelter at the Ukrainian-Polish border. Good afternoon to you, High Commissioner. You have said this is the fastest moving refugee exodus since World War II. What are the numbers now? What are you seeing?  UNITED NATIONS HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES FILIPPO GRANDI:\u00a0 As of today, we've passed the terrible mark of 1.5 million refugees, and this in 10 days, essentially from Ukraine into five neighboring countries. The bulk here in Poland, where I am now. And if I think of past decades, I cannot think in Europe of a faster exodus of people. Not since the end of the Second World War, I would say.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What are you seeing in terms of the state that people are showing up at these shelters in. What do they need?  COMMISSIONER GRANDI: Men of military age, which is from 18 to 60, cannot leave the country. They are in conscription and they have to stay there to defend their country. So it's mostly women, children, elderly, many disabled people and they are above all, frightened, traumatized. These are people that until just a few days ago, had a perfectly normal life. And in- in a matter of hours, everything is thrown apart. And they have to be on the road. Very difficult journeys, very traumatizing journeys through war torn Ukraine, up to the border and now here where they're safe. But of course, they're separated from families. Uncertain about their future. So I would say that- that the trauma and anguish is the most defining feature of the moment.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Can civilians safely get out of the country? How many people would be refugees but are instead displaced and at risk right now?  COMMISSIONER GRANDI: These statistics are impossible to- to- to define precisely because we don't have access. We are, you know, UN agencies and Red Cross are inside the country, but they can not move everywhere. This is why the UN and the Red Cross are trying to negotiate safe passage to the most affected places. But up to now, we have not succeeded in getting the necessary guarantees and respect for the ceasefire. That's the only way that we can send convoys in, bring supplies and, if necessary, bring people out. But people are moving also from other places that are even less impacted. Sometimes they move before it happens because they know it might happen to their location. So this is a- an extremely messy situation.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Who is firing on those safe passages?\u00a0  COMMISSIONER GRANDI:\u00a0 Well, there is bombardment by the Russian forces, and this is what people are mostly afraid of. Yesterday I was in Moldova and other neighboring countries. People were coming from the city of Odessa, where there is no bombing- bombardment yet. But sirens have sounded over the day and people are so afraid that they just leave their homes, especially people with children. They want to bring them to safety.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, High Commissioner, you've been dealing with these record refugee numbers all around the world even before this happened in Europe. What happens now that you have this massive influx? What does the UN need? I mean, what kind of resources do you need?  COMMISSIONER GRANDI:\u00a0 Well, let me state the obvious. First, we need this to stop. We need this to stop because without the war stopping, people will just continue to pour out of the country. One and a half million is difficult enough to manage, even for relatively stable and prosperous countries in Europe. Imagine, however, if we go further up and we will, we will no doubt if it doesn't stop. Now for- for the people that are on the movement. First of all, we need to get more supplies inside Ukraine. And for that, we need at least some areas of tranquility where we can deliver help and then here for the mass of refugees. A lot is needed, you know, any kind of relief supplies. We need cash to help people. We need logistical support. European countries have means and organization. But if this number of people grows, we will need more international support. And at some point, if people stay here for a long period of time, there will have to be other countries offering places to host refugees, even outside Europe.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Tell me about that because there was massive political backlash in 2015 when Syrian refugees poured into Europe. There are charges of racism of discrimination. Poland, just in the past year, has tried to build a wall to keep refugees out coming from the Middle East, from Africa. What is different now and what is happening to those refugees?  COMMISSIONER GRANDI: I think there is, of course, at the moment, a colossal emergency. There is a certain- there are certain geopolitical factors at play, but I- I- I look at the future. And you're right, we've been struggling with convincing Europe to take- to open the doors for more people, not to push back people. But I think that this crisis, and I've said it before, carries an important message that anybody can become a refugee. Very suddenly. And that any country can become a frontline refugee receiving country needing the support of others. We want- Europe is learning fast to work together in so many ways in response to this crisis. I hope that this working together will apply to all people seeking refuge in Europe, not only now which is happening, but in the future as well.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Mr. High Commissioner, for your time today and good luck to you. We'll be back in a moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Kurt Volker. He was a former US envoy to Ukraine and former US ambassador to NATO, and he joins us now. Thank you for coming on the program. You've been arguing for a no-fly zone over Ukraine. NATO says that's off the table. The United States, no way, no how, no combat troops because President Biden says this would trigger World War III. Why is he wrong?  FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO KURT VOLKER: Well, I think there are ways to do this that mitigate those risks, if not- doesn't eliminate the risk, but mitigates the risk of direct conflict with Russia. First off, I think we have to recognize that the civilian casualties and the horrific scenes that we just saw are going to get worse. They're not going to get better. There's going to be massive airstrikes against Kyiv, against other cities, and it's going to be absolutely devastating. So if we can prevent that from a humanitarian point of view, I think we- we need to try. And the way to do this that I would recommend is we make clear the humanitarian purposes. We limit the scope geographically to Kyiv and western Ukraine, so we're not getting close to Russian borders. We make clear that we will only fire if fired upon on any ground targets. We are not there to strike anything. We make clear to the Russian military that we will not strike their aircraft or their helicopters as long as they stay outside the zone. And then there are rules of engagement that our Air Force and others are very good at, of escorting people out of a zone without fire if they're not fired upon. And I think we apply all of those things in order to try to create a safe space for the civilians.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So other former ambassadors to NATO have made the public argument that this is unrealistic because you would have to take out Russian systems not only in Ukraine, but long range ones inside Russia. You go to war like this.  AMB. VOLKER: You don't do that because that does bring us directly into the fight. Russia does not want us in the fight, and I think we are letting Putin get inside our heads and deter us from doing things to protect civilians, rather than taking into account that he does not want the US or other countries supporting Ukraine.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So if the goal ultimately, diplomatically, is to stop the carnage and stop the war, how do you get Vladimir Putin to back down? Who can actually do that? Because the Germans tried, the French tried, the Israelis tried. No one's gotten any success. The US is talking to China. Who can do this?  AMB. VOLKER: The Ukrainian people can do this. The Ukrainian people are there. They are determined. They are fighting. We are fortunate that we don't have to be in a position of fighting Putin or trying to stop him. The Ukrainian people are ready to do this, and that's why it's critical that we give them every bit of support and assistance we can.  MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say it will get worse, I mean, the French president has indicated that's basically what Vladimir Putin told him. Tell me what you- what is the scenario the public needs to prepare for. Because NATO's already saying cluster bombs are being used. You hear incredible accusations from the Ukrainian government about what is happening. The United States intelligence says lists of people to send to camps are being drawn up. Is this a scenario where you can see someone sitting down and negotiating a way out?  AMB. VOLKER: Not at all, no. We have to understand that Putin is bent on a military victory. He wants to destroy Ukraine, decapitate the leadership. He doesn't care about how many casualties this causes, what happens to the civilian population. This is a messianic mission that he is on. This is why he has to be stopped. And again, we can do things to assist the Ukrainians. Very happy to hear Secretary Blinken say that we are now greenlighting the aircraft from Poland to Ukraine. We should be providing some of our own A-10 aircraft that we're ready to put into storage. There are trained Ukrainian pilots who use them. We should be looking at more means to get more support in quickly. What the UN High Commissioner just said was they need tranquil areas inside Ukraine. In western Ukraine, there are areas where there is no Russian fighting now. We could try to help create those tranquil areas for delivery of assistance. So much more we could be doing.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there the political will for that? You served in the Trump administration. Former Vice President Pence said Friday, \"there is no room in the Republican Party for apologists for Putin.\" It's kind of extraordinary he had to say that.\u00a0  AMB. VOLKER: Yeah, yeah. We've heard that in our- in our media. We've heard that from some politicians here. But I think- you heard also from Adam Schiff. There is incredible bipartisan unity in the Congress, Senate and the House, and among experts and national security figures here in the country. Everyone sees what Putin is doing. There is- there is no support for this whatsoever. Full support for Ukraine. The only question is how far we go to help Ukraine.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Was the former president an apologist for Putin? That's what the vice president was saying.  AMB. VOLKER: Well I'm not going to pass a judgment on that. We heard what he said. You know, he said that Putin was acting in a smart, savvy way. I mean, that's not the messaging that you want to send. Messaging you want to send is that he is acting in an irresponsible, inhuman way, killing people in an unjustified war, and we should be on the side of the Ukrainians to help them.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, ambassador, for joining us today. We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: There was some good news this week, progress at home battling Covid. There are some hints that life might be returning to something resembling normal. CBS News senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann reports.\u00a0 (BEGIN VT)\u00a0 WOMAN: Happy Mardi Gras!\u00a0 MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): When the only mask in sight is a Mardi Gras costume, you know something's changed.\u00a0 WOMAN: It's like your soul reentering your body. It feels good to be back.\u00a0 MARK STRASSMANN: Starting tomorrow in New York --\u00a0 MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK: We are winning. So, let's celebrate the win.\u00a0 MARK STRASSMANN (on camera): One of America's first cities to impose a mask mandate in public spaces will lift it. Starting Monday, New Jersey ends mandatory masking in schools. California, Oregon, and Washington state will do the same next week.\u00a0 MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths all down dramatically. Under the CDC's new metric, more than 90 percent of Americans live in counties with low or medium Covid risk. And a big reason is vaccinations. Three-fourths of adults now have theirs. Another booster, with Covid cases down, the labor market's up. Nearly 700,000 jobs added last month. Ninety percent of jobs lost during the  pandemic have returned.\u00a0 But Covid always comes with a caveat. Health officials warn the pandemic is hardly over, and children under five are especially vulnerable. But, overall, in unmasked America, we're breathing easier.\u00a0 (END VT)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Our Mark Strassmann with some news on Covid for a change. That's it for us today.

Wittig and Morell trace the evolution of America's standing in the eyes of the world from the end of the World Wars to the end of the Cold War, through the period following 9/11, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, to today. Wittig offers insights on the effect of the Trump administration's \"America First\" policy on global alliances and shares his view on the Biden administration's effort to rally global support for Ukraine before and during Russia's invasion. Wittig and Morell also discuss how its domestic instability may undermine America's credibility and ability to lead.\u00a0 Highlights: \u00a0 Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - PETER WITTIG PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS MICHAEL MORELL: Ambassador Wittig, Peter, welcome to Intelligence Matters. Thank you so much for joining us this morning. PETER WITTIG: Thank you, Michael, for having me on your program.  MICHAEL MORELL: So, Peter, you know that I've been wanting for some time to have a discussion on Intelligence Matters about foreign perceptions of the United States. And quite frankly, I can't think of anyone better placed than you to have that conversation with - your time in Washington, your time in London, your time in New York, all your contacts around the world give you, I think, more insight into this question than really anybody else I can think of. You obviously have your own perceptions, of course, but you also have, I'm sure, gotten a very good sense of the perceptions of many other folks around the world as well.   I also want to just start by saying that that I hope we can talk about foreign government perceptions of the United States, not necessarily public perceptions. But if you want to bring public perceptions into the discussion, please do. Let's just make clear that we're making that conscious switch from public to government and back and forth.  Peter, I think the best place to start is to talk about why foreign perceptions of the United States matter. Why should Americans care? Why should my listeners care? I can imagine some people saying, you know, who cares? Some Americans saying, 'Who cares what others in the world think of us?'   So how would you answer that question in terms of why do foreign perceptions of the U.S. matter?  PETER WITTIG: Michael, I have two thoughts on your question. The first is one of a professional diplomat. Perceptions of other countries matter a lot because perceptions influence, sometimes even determine, foreign policy choices. Whether foreign governments consider the U.S. as an interested or disinterested party, as strong or weak, as united or divided on certain international issues. Those perceptions shape their countries' decisions.  And the great historian Christopher Clark has argued in his famous book on the First World War, it's called \"The Sleepwalkers,\" that the war broke out at least partly because of the stunning misperceptions that the major powers had over each other.   So my second thought is one that I have as a great friend of the United States. It is about alliances. It's true the U.S. is still the most powerful country in the world, but even the U.S. needs allies to achieve its goals in foreign and security policy. In other words, alliances are part of the U.S. power projection in the world. What distinguishes the U.S. from other great powers like China or Russia is its capacity to create and maintain voluntary alliances on an equal footing based on shared values and and respect for each other, not based on coercion or economic dependency, and to be able to do that. Foreign perceptions of the U.S. matter enormously.  MICHAEL MORELL: So, Peter, let's talk a little bit about how and why perceptions of the U.S. have changed over the last several decades. You, Peter, joined the German diplomatic service during the Cold War, just as I joined CIA during the Cold War. How was America perceived by the world then, and why during the Cold War?  PETER WITTIG: Well, when the Second World War ended and the Cold War started, the U.S. took a seminal, enormously consequential decision. So in stark contrast to the aftermath of the First World War, this time the U.S. did not leave Europe. It remained engaged in Europe - and in Japan, by the way. So beyond military forces on the ground, it engaged economically on a large scale: the Marshall Plan or the economic recovery program transferred over 13 billion U.S. dollars, equivalent to 120 billion today, to Western Europe to rebuild war-torn regions and improve prosperity.   Of course, it was not just a charitable gift. It was an incredibly farsighted investment to secure geopolitical influence over Western Europe and prevent the spread of communism. But it also shaped Europe's and in particularly Germany's perception of the U.S. as a force for good. It happened, imagine, 75 years ago and is still part of our collective memory.   The creation of NATO in in 1949 and later the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact were expressions of the Cold War division of Europe. Of course, the perception of the U.S. at that time depended on the camp to which these countries belonged. For Germany and other countries in Western Europe, nature was the military and political reassurance that guaranteed their existence. Germany, for instance, was a frontline state. Later, the Vietnam War divided European societies as much as it divided the public opinion in the U.S.   But on a governmental level, the transatlantic alliance was never jeopardized. And the same goes for the arms build-up in Europe in the seventies. The governments knew full well that without the protection of the U.S. they would be exposed to Soviet coercion. So the perception of the U.S. as a protective power, as it is a European polity, if you will, with skin in the game, was crucial to the peace and prosperity of Europe. And by the way, much of the same positive development happened with the other major World War II foe of the U.S., namely Japan.   MICHAEL MORELL: So, Peter, talk a little bit about that period between the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fall of the Soviet Union at one end of the timeline, and 9/11 on the other end of the timeline. This is the so-called unipolar moment for the U.S.: How did governments around the world perceive the United States then and why?  PETER WITTIG: Well. Allow me for a moment to dwell on the fall of the wall in Germany in 1989, please. Because that was the moment when the perception of the U.S. as a trusting ally and a force for good was at its peak. The Bush-Baker team at the time recognized early on that the unification of the two Germanies was simply unstoppable. So the U.S. supported it wholeheartedly instead of resisting it. And that was the first instinct, understandably, in a way, of France and Britain. The U.S. administration tried to steer the inevitable in the right direction, embedding the united Germany firmly in the Western fold.   I personally consider this a U.S. masterpiece of skillful and strategically visionary diplomacy. And more than that, it instilled a sense of enormous gratitude to the U.S. in a generation of German political leaders.  To your question on the unipolar moment, indeed. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 - another really pivotal historical moment - the clear perception was there's only one superpower left. The end of history. It was not only the title of an influential book by Francis Fukuyama, but it was also basically the mindset of many leaders in Europe. The U.S. was seen as the uncontested democratic leader of the world, especially by the new democracies.   The assumption being that, sooner or later, most countries of the world would follow the, if I may say so, liberal Democratic script of the West. It didn't happen. All of us, we underestimated the strength of what we considered archaic forces in the international arena: extremist nationalism, violent religious radicalism, ethnic tribal forces of all kinds. They tested us, all of us, starting in the 1990s and at the beginning of the new century. So it was clearly not the end of history.  MICHAEL MORELL: Peter, we're going to talk in detail in a little bit about Ukraine, but I want to ask you here, if you believe that the United States and NATO made a mistake during this unipolar moment by expanding NATO to the east, by expanding it right to the Russian border. I wonder what your thoughts are on that question.  There's a lot of discussion about that today. Would today be different if we had taken a different course with post-Soviet Russia? Would we be better off or would we be worse off? What are your thoughts on that question?  PETER WITTIG: Michael, you're right. The debates about who lost Russia have been rekindled with the Russian war against Ukraine on February 24. I want to weigh my judgment very carefully here.   George Kennan, a towering figure of generations of diplomats called the swift NATO expansion the most fateful era of American policy in the post-Cold War era. I think Henry Kissinger argues along similar lines. Even William Burns, the current CIA director and former ambassador to Russia, whom I deeply respected and I had the pleasure to work with him in Washington, even Burns called the NATO expansion in the mid-nineties, 'premature at best, and needlessly provocative for Russia at worst.'   I would partially disagree here. The new Eastern European states - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, also the Baltic states - they were undergoing a tremendously challenging and difficult transformation process and with post-communist forces very much alive and their democratic success far from assured. These countries wanted to get out of a security gray zone as fast as possible, and with NATO membership, locked in their success as Western style democracies and prevented a kind of a backsliding into a security and political no man's land.   And besides the NATO-Russia agreement of 1997 that followed the invitation for Eastern European countries to join, it was de facto a recognition of this new reality by Russia. So I really don't buy Putin's narrative today that directs Russia's war against Ukraine back to NATO's expansion to Eastern Europe, as if this was kind of the original sin. Never has NATO, a defense alliance, threatened Russia, in its territorial integrity or sovereignty.   And Russia, in turn, has signed various international agreements where the right of states to choose their own alliances freely were enshrined, like the Charter of Paris in 1919. So Putin's justification of his invasion of Ukraine as a defensive act against an aggressive NATO is simply absurd and only serves to cover up his, one good call [it], 'revisionist project' to reinstate Russia's dominance over Eastern Europe.  MICHAEL MORELL: Peter, talk a little bit about the perceptions of the United States after 9/11. So that's the next big geopolitical moment here, right. And the perceptions of the U.S. handling of that war against terrorism.  You talk about drone strikes. You can talk about torture. You talked about the Iraq war, the long war in Afghanistan. And then you have the financial crisis. You have a failure to enforce the stated red line in Syria. You have the rise of populism in the United States.   In short, take us from 9/11 to just before the invasion of Ukraine, and how perceptions of the U.S. evolved during that period. And I know that's a big question.  PETER WITTIG: Yes, Michael. Those are a lot of questions. And these are all groundbreaking events, but of a very different nature. 9/11 was perceived as an attack not just against the U.S., but against the whole Western alliance. Remember, NATO invoked Article Five of its treaty, the case of collective defense, for the first time in its history, only one day after 9/11. And this was an act of unprecedented solidarity.   The war against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which had hosted and protected Al-Qaeda, was seen as a legitimate defense act. It was quite different in the case of the Iraq war in 2003, as opposed to Bush father's war against Iraq in 1991 to liberate Kuwait. Bush's son did not get a mandate from the U.N. Security Council.  Europe was split into two camps: France and Germany opposed Bush's decision to go to war against Iraq. The U.K. and some Eastern European countries supported the US. But it left scars in the allies. The debate was about the legitimacy of the Iraq war, but also about the effects of military interventions in the Middle East. In hindsight, the Iraq war turned out to be a disaster for the region.  MICHAEL MORELL: Yes, sure.  PETER WITTIG: And Iran was the winner of this geopolitical earthquake. You mentioned, you know, Abu Ghraib and the torture practices. That alienated many countries and tarnished the image of the U.S. as a standard-bearer of human rights.   But the Iraq war also taught us all a lesson about the limits of Western interventions in foreign regions. And that was, I guess, the backdrop of Obama's decision not to enforce the previously stated red lines in Syria.  After long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq with limited success, the American people were war weary, and I think European leaders understood that. I think they were less critical of this U.S. retrenchment from the international scene or from parts of the world than the U.S. political class or the think tanks in Washington.   Michael, you mentioned the rise of populism in the U.S. This is an entirely different matter. President Trump's \"America First\" Doctrine and his at times outright disdain for alliances came as a shock to European leaders. Of course, with notable exceptions, like the Hungarian strongman Orban or Boris Johnson, who flirted with Trump.  Politically speaking, Trump's actions were seen as a real threat to the survival of NATO and the Western allies. Europeans feared President Trump would simply abdicate from the U.S. role as leader of the Western community of nations. Luckily, it did not happen. In a way, the Trump presidency was a healthy wake-up call to Europeans and to Germans in particular to invest more for their own security and stop free riding in defense spending.   But I must also add a qualifying remark here. On a global scale, there have been quite a few governments and leaders that saw in Trump and in his America First approach welcome change or even a model to emulate. From Brazil to the Philippines, from Israel to Saudi Arabia. So Trump was certainly not alone.  MICHAEL MORELL: So Peter, did the US distancing itself from its allies, did it force those allies in any way to hedge a bit with regard to Russia and China, do you think, or not?  PETER WITTIG: The perception of the U.S. shifted according to events. The assumptions of leaders were probably more stable than those of the rather fickle public opinions in the case of Europe. Trust of allies had developed over decades of closed cooperation and was not easily destroyed.   The Iraq war, however, put a strain on this level of trust. But there was never any question of hedging their bets by relying more on China and Russia.   The Trump presidency, however, was, as I said, an event of a different nature. His administration was at times - concerning our continent - was at times outrightly hostile to the European Union. He once called it worse than China, so most European leaders quickly realised Europe must rely more on itself.   And one more important thing. The perceived absence of the U.S. leadership in the West during the time of Trump created a vacuum. Russia and China tried to step in and fill the gap in Europe, but also Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.  MICHAEL MORELL: So, Peter, let's shift gears here and talk about Ukraine. And let me start here with a very general question: has the U.S. reaction to the initial build-up of Russian forces on the Ukrainian border and then the U.S. reaction to the invasion itself, altered perceptions of the U.S.? And if so, by how much? What's your sense of that?  PETER WITTIG: The U.S. was the first one to see through the build-up of Russian forces at the Ukrainian border and to predict an outright Russian war of aggression. And the groundbreaking step to share its intelligence not only with governments, but also with the public at large, was a first - had never been done before on this scale.  So this is, if I may say so, this coercive use of intelligence destroyed Putin's narratives and pretexts for his war. However, few governments in Europe, one has to confess, had believed the U.S. forecasts, including, by the way, the Ukrainian leadership.   But the U.S. intelligence turned out to be exactly right. Up to this exact day of of the invasion. So the administration's clairvoyance and the handling of the war - resolute but controlled and measured, strengthened its reputation and the trust in US leadership. And it stood in stark contrast to the chaotic way the U.S. engagement in Afghanistan was ended.   But I also must add a caveat here. Europe's attitude is not representative of the whole world. Only 58 countries, mainly the European and Asian allies, take part in the sanctions regime against Russia. Many important countries even refuse to condemn Russia's war of aggression. Not only China, but many heavyweights from the global south India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, the Gulf countries. In this sense, the world is far from united in its perception of the U.S. and its allies.  MICHAEL MORELL: So I'm wondering, Peter, what's behind the reluctance of so many countries in the world to condemn Putin's invasion of Ukraine and to support the West and the Ukrainians?  You mentioned India and Brazil and Mexico. Why have they taken the position they've taken?  PETER WITTIG: I think they have different motivations. Some of those countries are heavily dependent on arms deliveries or energy supply from Russia. And others just don't think that the Ukraine war or the conflict in Ukraine is relevant for them in their eyes; it's a far away European thing.   And others just don't want to belong to the Western camp. They want to stay out of that conflict and be neutral. They think it will be to their detriment if they join the Western camp. So their motivations are manifold and different for each of those countries who have not joined us in resisting Russia's aggression.  MICHAEL MORELL: Peter, I'm going to ask a broader question to you in a minute about China. But at this point, let me just ask, to what extent has China's support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine damaged the EU's relationship with China - which is a critically important relationship for both China and the EU. Do you have a sense of that?  PETER WITTIG: Well, yes. China's reaction to Russia's invasion has indeed important repercussions in Europe. Europeans began to shine a much more critical light on China as these two authoritarian regimes have formed an alliance.   Companies doing business with China are facing increasing headwinds from their domestic public opinions in Europe, but also from their governments. Now the European Union will be more outspoken and critical on China-related issues like Taiwan, on the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, or Hong Kong.  And in my view, in my personal view, China has committed a colossal error in promising Putin a 'friendship with no limits,' as it was called, when the two leaders met. I assume now many top Chinese officials are already regretting it, and they must have been shocked by Russia's surprisingly poor military war performance.  But my assessment is that Beijing will be very careful not to be dragged into the Russian imbroglio and and be very careful to avoid U.S. and European sanctions. And that means, I guess, China will neither choose to be an unconditional ally with Russia, nor will it abandon Russia as an important junior partner for China.  MICHAEL MORELL: Peter, as you look at Ukraine today, what concerns you most about the war there? And given that concern, given how you think about it at the moment, what do you think we, defined as NATO, need to do going forward here? PETER WITTIG: Michael, my concern is that wih all the admirable, heroic bravery of the Ukrainian armed forces and the weapons flowing in from Western countries, Russia is making gains in the Donbas in the eastern part of Ukraine, mainly because of its relentless artillery attacks. So we will be in for a much longer haul, I believe, months, maybe taking us well into the next year. This will be a protracted battle in a kind of war of attrition. Who will have the upper hand in such a fight if the war disappears from page one of Western media? Putin is a ruthless leader. He will not accept defeat. So clearly NATO countries need to step up their support to help Ukraine in pushing back the aggression.  But at some point, the Ukrainians will have to decide what their war goals are. This is a, first and foremost, of course, Ukrainian decision. But also NATO will have to reflect on the conditions of a possible cease fire and beyond. We're not at this point yet, but there will be difficult choices ahead.  MICHAEL MORELL: Peter, as you think about where this might be headed - and I know this is a tough question - but at this point, what do you think the outcome will ultimately be? And I know that might depend on policy decisions made in a lot of places, but what's your expectation for how this ends?  PETER WITTIG:.Michael, a tough question indeed. It's difficult to tell. I tend to think that on the battlefield, in the end, neither side will be able to claim outright victory. But how does this change the world around Russia? Putin's Russia has started a brutal war of aggression against a sovereign nation and has committed war crimes. It is responsible for tens of thousands of dead and wounded, of unbelievable destruction of cities, infrastructure and cultural heritage, not forgetting the many million refugees and an unfathomable suffering of the population - that will be the Russian legacy.   So Russia will leave a wound in Europe's eastern part that will take generations to heal. Russia has also destroyed the post-Cold War order. It's already history. We see, I believe, a Cold War 2.0 emerging in Europe. Western and allied countries will engage in some sort of containment strategy, a new enhanced military buildup, long term economic sanctions, political isolation of Russia as long as Putin's regime remains in power. So Putin really has already lost the war.   NATO has been reinvigorated; even traditionally neutral countries like Finland and Sweden are now joining. Unimaginable a while ago. The EU showed surprising unity and will beef up its defense. And the medium and long term effects of the sanctions regime - by the way, the most robust in history against any major country - will cripple the Russian economy and drive talented young Russians out of the country.  Putin will want to tighten the grip in his immediate neighbourhood through an alliance of authoritarian regimes. This is part of his imperial project to resuscitate Russia's imagined glory of the past. Michael, I think it will not end well for Russia.  MICHAEL MORELL: Peter, I want to ask you two final questions here. As you think about the changing perceptions of the United States over the last several decades, are there any broad lessons, broad themes that jump out to you?  PETER WITTIG: Okay. Well, Michael, my final thought revolves around the U.S. domestic situation. It matters enormously for the way the U.S. is perceived in the world. Any friend of the U.S. must be deeply concerned about the level of division and bitter polarization in in America's political and public life. For many young democracies around the globe, the U.S. as the oldest constitutional democracy in the world, served as a model. Germany was one of those countries. I fear that this example and this kind of, if I may say so, U.S. soft power, is fading. Allies worry about the next U.S. presidential election. Will the losing candidate and his or her party once again claim that the victory was stolen? Our authoritarian foes in the world are gleefully watching the fragility of a powerful democracy. So extreme domestic polarization and political gridlock in a country weakens the power abroad and weakens the ability to lead internationally. And I think this is the main challenge of the U.S. today.  MICHAEL MORELL: I couldn't agree more with that, Peter.   Last question, Peter. Obviously, the relationship between the United States and China is important for the whole world, and how that relationship evolves will be important to the world. If you could advise both the United States and China about how to manage that relationship going forward, what would your broad thoughts be? PETER WITTIG: Michael, I believe China is on the way to become a one-man autocracy. President Xi Jinping will be given a third term at the party conference at the end of the year. It is likely that he plans to stay for life.  China has once again become more ideological. The influence of the Communist Party is on the rise on political and security issues at home and in its neighbourhood. Beijing is ever more assertive, even coercive. Economically, it is flouting the international rules and practices. All of this is not good news, frankly.  But it becomes clear the most strategic future relationship of our time is the one between the U.S. and China. It's decisive for the whole world. Europe's interest here is not to enter into an ever more dangerous spiral of conflict between the two powers, between the two superpowers.   With no exit or without any offramp, the way forward, I believe, is for the U.S. and the European Union to team up to face China together from a position of strength, to contain it where needed in security issues, for example, but also to cooperate with Beijing, where we need China's contribution to tackle climate change or to cope with global health issues.   The U.S. and the European Union have made some headway. They created a joint European, U.S. Trade and Technology Council to coordinate our public policies in relation to China. But we need a more comprehensive approach, a joint approach to calibrate our China relationship wisely between cooperation and conflict. And that is one, if not the most important, challenge for our alliance in the coming decade, I believe.  MICHAEL MORELL: Peter, thank you so much for joining us. It's been an incredibly thoughtful conversation. It's been a pleasure to have you on Intelligence Matters. Thank you so much.  PETER WITTIG: Michael, it was my pleasure. Thank you. ",

And today on Face the Nation: alarming new intelligence reports about Russian plans for a large-scale invasion of Ukraine; and a stunning political split in the Republican Party, as former Vice President Mike Pence rebukes President Trump 13 months after the January 6 attack on the Capitol.\u00a0 (Begin VT)\u00a0 MIKE PENCE (Former Vice President of the United States): President Trump said I had the right to overturn the election. President Trump is wrong.\u00a0 \u00a0(End VT)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Then: The Beijing Winter Olympics are officially under way, but behind their elaborate effort to display international unity during the pandemic. China's leaders are under fire for their human rights abuses, cyberattacks, economic subterfuge, and their suspect alliances. Does the timing of the Olympics play into Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans for Ukraine? We will talk with Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio and the number two at Treasury, Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo. He is a key architect of President Biden's sanctions policies.\u00a0 Former National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster will also join us. And we will have a report on the war games going on in and just outside of Ukraine.\u00a0 And America marks yet another COVID milestone, as our death toll reaches 900,000. We will talk with a former FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Plus, our conversation with parents about how the pandemic has taken its toll on their children.\u00a0 It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\u00a0 Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. There is an overwhelming amount of news this morning, especially on the international front, but we want to start with two extraordinary developments that threaten to further divide the Republican Party and impact our democracy. Late Friday, Republican National Committee members voted to censure Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for their work on the committee investigating the attack on the Capitol and the attempt to overturn election results, saying the two were part of a -- quote -- \"Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.\" The former Vice President Mike Pence rebuked President Trump's insistence that Pence could have rejected the Electoral College results on January 6.\u00a0 (Begin VT)\u00a0 MIKE PENCE: I had no right to overturn the election. The presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone. And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president. Under the Constitution, I had no right to change the outcome of our election.\u00a0 \u00a0(End VT)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin with Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio. He is in Miami. Senator, we invited you to come on the show to talk about China. I want to get there, but I have to start here. Do you agree with Mike Pence?\u00a0 SENATOR MARCO RUBIO (R-Florida): Well, if President Trump runs for reelection, I believe he would defeat Joe Biden, and I don't want Kamala Harris to have the power as vice president to overturn that election. And I don't -- that's the same thing that I concluded back in January of 2021.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So Donald Trump was wrong?\u00a0 SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, as I said, I just don't think a vice president has that power.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Because, if a vice president has that power, Donald Trump would defeat Joe Biden in four years or two years, and then Kamala Harris can decide not -- to overturn the election. I don't want to wind up there.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, so yes. So this appears a turning point for the party, though. Does the RNC speak for you when it says that this is a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse? Was January 6 legitimate political discourse?\u00a0 SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, anybody who committed crimes on January 6 should be prosecuted. If you entered the Capitol and you committed acts of violence, and you were there to hurt people, you should be prosecuted. And they are being prosecuted. But the January 6 commission is not the place to do this. That's what prosecutors are supposed to do. This commission is a partisan scam. They're going after -- they're -- the purpose of that commission is to try to embarrass and smear and harass as many Republicans as...\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what you believe...\u00a0 SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: ... they can get their hands on.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: ... your two Republican colleagues are doing, Liz Cheney...\u00a0 SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, I believe... MARGARET BRENNAN: ... and Adam Kinzinger?\u00a0 SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: ... what the commission is doing -- well, let me tell you, I know that's what the commission is doing, because they're focused well beyond January 6. There are people, for example, like in an older member of the RNC whose husband just died. And she wasn't even in Washington on January 6.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not what the censure said.\u00a0 SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: She signed some papers. She wasn't even in Washington on January 6. She can't afford to lawyer up. And she's being harassed by this commission. This commission is nothing but a partisan tool designed to go out and smear and attack and get their hands on as many people as they can, including people that weren't in Washington on January 6. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, sounds like you say they do speak for you. Let's get to China. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, no, I told you where I stand on that commission. I think that commission is a scam. I think it's a complete partisan scam. And I think anyone who committed a crime on January 6 should be prosecuted and, if convicted, put in jail. I do not believe that we need a congressional committee to harass Americans that weren't even in Washington on January 6, that were not in favor of what happened on that day, have condemned what happened on that day, but they want to smear them anyway. I'm against that, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sources tell CBS News that Vladimir Putin has assembled about 70 percent of the forces that he would need for a full invasion of Ukraine. He could take the capital within just two days. As many as five million refugees would be driven into surrounding countries. He could do all this within 10 to 15 days of where we are right now. What impact do you see this happening -- having on the United States? SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, the impact would begin by destabilizing Europe. This is the single greatest threat Europe has faced since the 1940s. And -- and, as you've pointed out, the refugee surge would be one. But I think this would have a global impact, because we're now all of a sudden once again living in a world in which countries and leaders can decide that something belongs to them and they go in and take it by force. And there are plenty -- there are multiple countries in Europe that have complaints about treaties that were signed over 100 years ago in some cases. We know how China claims its claims on Taiwan. It has territorial disputes with India on its borders. So, if we now live in a world where you can just go in and take a country because you claim it or parts of it belong to you, and you can do so militarily, well, we've entered a very dangerous period in human history once again. So I think it has enormous consequences if -- if and when that happens. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden has made clear he won't use U.S. combat troops. He will use sanctions, financial warfare. Given how Xi Jinping, the president of China, embraced Russia's President Vladimir Putin just in the past few days, do you see this as a way that these two countries can just blunt the impact of U.S. sanctions? SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: I want it to be clear. There is no U.S. combat role in Ukraine. There isn't going to be one. I don't know of anyone who supports it, not even the Ukrainians. That said, I think that Vladimir Putin has to pay a high price if he does this, not just for him to pay the price, but for other countries to see the high price of doing that kind of thing and other leaders. And I think that price should be, A, his economy should be crippled and hurt badly. That will require unity, not just from the Europeans, but other countries around the world, but beginning with the Europeans. If they're not going to impose those sanctions and stick with them, then that -- then -- over -- over time, he will be able to blunt it. But the other thing that's going to happen is, the easiest part for him is going to be the invasion. The harder part is going to be the occupation. Ukrainians are not going to welcome him with roses. He's going to have to explain to Russian mothers why their sons keep coming home injured, killed and maimed from this occupation. If any country on Earth knows how painful and difficult it is to occupy a country that doesn't want you there for a substantial period of time, it should be us, with our experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan. MARGARET BRENNAN: As I mentioned, this alliance between Russia and China seems to be building. On China itself, more than one million Muslim -- mostly Muslim minorities are in detention camps in China. According to the State Department, they're subject to forced sterilization, abortions, rape, torture, forced labor, restrictions on prayer, restrictions on movement. I know you've been working to try to restrict imports made by forced labor inside these camps. But is it really possible to clean up the supply chain, because China is such an economic behemoth here? SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, a couple of things that we need to do. The first is, we need to do this, no matter what, because this country has to be a country that makes things again. If we've learned anything over the last couple of years is that there -- you have to have a manufacturing and industrial capability. And you can't be dependent on foreign supply chains entirely, especially those located in a place like China, because of a pandemic, a war or out of leverage against us. You could be cut off and create an economic crisis. But the second is, we've passed that bill. We passed a bill that says, if something is made in a factory in that part of China, we are going to presume it's made by slave labor, and not allow it into the country, unless companies can prove that that's not the case. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which companies are the worst abusers on this front? SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: I think there are many American companies, like Nike and others, that have definitely benefited from the supply chain that's located in that part of the world. And the list could be even more extensive than that because, there are people that are buying from subcontractors. Many of them know they're sourcing material from that area. But they have continued or continue to allow it to happen. And so we saw the lobbying efforts of Apple, of Nike and other -- and others just represented through chambers arguing that this would raise the costs for consumers. But, ultimately, it's slave labor. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: And it's a horrific genocide. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and Tesla just opened a showroom in the province where these camps are located. I mean, American businesses still seem to be more than willing to try to tap the Chinese market. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, it's one of the largest markets, the second largest market in the world and, in some industries, the largest. I understand the profit motive behind it. And that's fine. But -- but I understand their view of it. That's their agenda. But our agenda has to be the national interests of the United States, not to mention what's right or wrong in the world. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening on U.S. soil. The FBI director, Chris Wray, gave a pretty extraordinary speech last week, saying China and its threat here in the United States is greater than it's ever been before. He said China is actually targeting people inside the U.S. Listen to this. (Begin VT) CHRISTOPHER WRAY (FBI Director): We're seeing the Chinese government resort to blackmail, threats of violence, stalking and kidnappings. They've actually engaged criminal organizations in the U.S., offering them bounties, in hopes of successfully taking targets back to China. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you combat that kind of espionage on U.S. soil without the United States itself becoming a surveillance state? SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, it's difficult. It's not easy. And it's a new threat that we face. But what he's pointing to there is the example of a Uyghur. Let's say there's a Uyghur in the United States who's involved in speaking out against those abuses that are going on in China. They are trying to lure those people to come back to China. And the way they do it is, they threaten their family over there. But they might even align themselves with some sort of a triad group or some street gang of that nature in order to go and personally try to intimidate these people. They have sent people to this country to do that sort of thing as well, to harass and intimidate. Whether it's the Uyghur issue or general political topics as well, if you're speaking out against China and you're a national, a Chinese national or former Chinese national, you have families back over there, they try to harass you through your family over there, and increasingly directly here. And so I think the first step is to sort of reveal it and call it out and do what the director just did. I think the second step is to expel these people. Once we've identified that some agent of influence from China is on U.S. soil, going after people living in this country and trying to intimidate them, those people should be immediately expelled from the country, even if they're here under diplomatic cover or, in many cases, they're here under business cover. MARGARET BRENNAN: But is enough being done on this front? SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think there's now a growing awareness on this. This is a new thing that's emerged over the last few years that they've become more and more aggressive about it. So it remains to be seen. I mean, we've got to do more. And I think more needs to be done at the local level. Look, if you go into a local police department in this country, and you tell them there's a Chinese agent operating in your community, that's something they've never dealt with before. I don't think there's a lack of willingness to address it. I just think it's something that we don't have a lot of experience addressing it. But we have to, because it's happening, and it's real. And every year, it gets worse. MARGARET BRENNAN: And can you do it without impacting the rights of Chinese Americans or Chinese nationals who are living here?\u00a0 SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Yes. In fact, it's Chinese nationals living here that are being threatened and intimidated. And one of the great threats that exists there is some -- many of them are hesitant to come forward and report what's happening to them, to the authorities, because they're specifically told not to do so or their family are going to be harmed. So, I think we've got to develop greater trust.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator Rubio, thank you for your time this morning. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Thank you. Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Now to the crisis in Ukraine and the increasing signs that Vladimir Putin plans a full-scale invasion. Sources tell CBS News that civilian casualties could go as high as 100,000. Our Imtiaz Tyab reports from Kyiv. (Begin VT) IMTIAZ TYAB (voice-over): These are the colors of a country preparing for war. The residents of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, filled the streets with patriotic pride. Most here are Russian-speaking and live close to the border with Russia.\u00a0 But fear of a Vladimir Putin-led invasion has unleashed a new sense of national unity here. At Chernobyl, a city no stranger to disaster, the Ukrainian military ran drills to protect critical infrastructure, while in the capital, Kyiv, civilians are being taught how to fight.\u00a0 The Kremlin continues to insist it has no plans to attack, despite amassing roughly 110,000 battle-ready troops along Ukraine's borders, while, at the same time, accusing the U.S. of trying to goad it into war. (End VT) IMTIAZ TYAB: Now, there's no shortage of support for Ukraine, from military hardware to diplomacy, from Washington, the E.U., and others, but what happens next all depends on Vladimir Putin -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Imtiaz Tyab, thank you. Face the Nation will be back one minute. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Wally Adeyemo is the deputy treasury secretary of the United States, and he's here with me now. Good morning to you.\u00a0 DEPUTY TREASURY SECRETARY WALLY ADEYEMO: Good morning, MARGARET.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: As we've been talking about this latest intelligence shows Russia has all these forces mounted and could launch this large scale, full scale invasion. The impact would be huge in terms of refugee crisis and casualties. What would the impact of the global economy be? DEPUTY SEC. ADEYEMO: So, MARGARET, I'm of course, not going to talk about the intelligence, but I want to talk about what we plan to do if Russia were to invade. When we started seeing Russian troops amassed near the Ukrainian border, the president asked Secretary Yellen and I to start having conversations with our allies in Europe to ensure that we would be in a place where we could launch economic sanctions against Russia if they were to invade. We have designed a set of economic sanctions that would take on the Russian financial system, limit President Putin's ability to project power into the future by cutting them off from key technologies and cutting off key elites from the Russian economy. To your question of what would be the impact on the global economy if Russia were to invade, we're already starting to see it. The Russian economy is already suffering from the- from the- from the moment that President Putin started to take these actions. The ruble is having the worst performance of- among- among emerging economies thus far this year. You're looking at their borrowing costs increase. And what we would see is we would see Russia's economy suffer if they were to take an action to invade Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what would the spillover be if you have a refugee crisis in the middle of Europe, if you have this kind of disruption? Does that spike energy prices? What does it do? DEPUTY SEC. ADEYEMO: So, MARGARET, one of the things that we have done is we're working very closely with our allies in Europe to make sure that we're in a position to help meet their need for energy. A number of our colleagues have worked closely with them. We're also taking steps to prepare for a potential refugee crisis. But the key is the choice belongs to President Putin. He can make the choice of going down the route of diplomacy and dialogue with the United States and NATO. Or he can take the consequences of invasion, which will include severe economic consequences for his economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: But how effective can U.S. and Western sanctions be if Russia is just going to move closer to China, as we're seeing? DEPUTY SEC. ADEYEMO: So, MARGARET, I was in the Obama administration in 2014 when we took actions against Russia in response to their invasion of Ukraine. We've learned a great deal of lessons, and what I can tell you is the actions that we would take if Russia were to invade Ukraine this time would be far more significant. And it's up to President Putin if he wants to become dependent on China going forward. What I'll tell you is that China can't give Russia what they don't have. There are critical technologies that Russia is dependent on the United States and our allies on, technologies that Russia, that China does not have access to. Russian elites who we would cut off from the global financial system are not putting their money in China. They're putting their money in Europe and in the United States. And those elites, those who are helping President Putin make these decisions, we would cut them and their families off from the global financial system in ways that would limit their ability to do business in the ways they've done it in the past. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that would, by putting pressure on the oligarchs and the elites, as you called them, around Vladimir Putin, you think that would put more pressure on Vladimir Putin than sanctioning him directly? DEPUTY SEC. ADEYEMO: We think that the range of actions that we are prepared to take with regard to- with the United States and with Europe would have a significant impact on President Putin, on those close to him as well. When you think about it, the reason that we're taking actions with Europe is because, while on a daily basis Russian financial solutions do about $46 billion worth of financial transactions around the world, 80% of those transactions are in dollars. So they are connected to the US financial system. But their biggest trading partners are in Europe. More than $200 billion of trade is with Europe each year. Forty percent of Russia's trade is with Europe on a regular basis. By the United States and Europe acting together, we put ourselves in a position where we not only would have an impact on the overall Russian economy, but we'd have a direct impact on President Putin, who is tied to the Russian economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, well, Germany is very tied to the Russian economy. We know the German chancellor is sitting down with President Biden tomorrow. Are they the weakest link in this united front you're trying to forge? And Nord Stream Two and sanction, those seem to be inevitable at this point? DEPUTY SEC. ADEYEMO: MARGARET, we've worked very closely with the German government. As you know, the new chancellor in Germany used to be the Finance Ministry, where I spent a great deal of time talking to his colleagues. And the Germans have worked with us closely in terms of building the sanctions package we would implement if Russia were to take these actions. They've helped produce ideas that are part of the things that we would implement to that point. What I can say about Nord Stream Two is that if Russia were to invade Ukraine, Nord Stream Two would never go online. In addition to working closely with Germany, we work closely with the EU and a design- designed a range of sanctions that would have significant impact on the Russian economy. It's important to, while we oppose Nord Stream Two, the key for us is making sure that we take far more significant actions in addition to Nord Stream Two in order to make sure the Russian economy suffers the consequences if Russia decides to invade. But as I've said, the choice belongs to President Putin. He can choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue or choose a path that leads to the Russian economy suffering not only for tomorrow, but suffering over the long term and limiting his ability to project power into the future. MARGARET BRENNAN: China's incredibly fast growing economy. You're 13 months into this presidency. Why don't we have a Biden administration China strategy? DEPUTY SEC. ADEYEMO: MARGARET, it's important to remember that China's economy is growing very fast. But China has had a very challenging last year in terms of their economy, and one of the things the president said was that he was going to focus initially on investing in the American economy and building relations with our allies. And that succeeded. The US economy has grown significantly faster over the last year than any economy in the world.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And so has inflation. So do you need to reconsider the tariffs on China in order to alleviate some of that inflation? DEPUTY SEC. ADEYEMO: So, as you know, MARGARET, inflation is a global challenge. It's not only something that we face in the United States. It's something that Europe faces and the UK faces, and in talking to my allies and partners, the things that they tell me is that they are envious of the fact that we come at this challenge from a position of strength rather than weakness. Last year, as you know, the US economy created 6.6 million jobs and the economy grew faster than at any point in 40 years. And- but we do need to address high prices. It's something that impacts the American people, and the primary responsibility for doing that belongs to the Fed. And we believe in the Fed and the Fed's independence and chairman Powell has laid out a path for addressing this.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. DEPUTY SEC. ADEYEMO: But the administration is also committed to doing what we need to do to address inflation from helping supply chains. And we've already started to see that the backlogs in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach have come down now that they're moving at 24- 24 hours a day. We're also starting to also see that companies are building up inventories because supply chains have gotten better. And you spoke about the jobs numbers that came out this month, which were historically high. But the most important thing to me was also that you saw a number of Americans who came back into the labor force, which- because when I talked to small businesses in the country, the CEOs,-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DEPUTY SEC. ADEYEMO: \u2014the biggest, one of the biggest challenges they face is they need employees, \u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. It's- it's\u2014 DEPUTY SEC. ADEYEMO: \u2014so getting more people in. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. It's a huge challenge we've been following on the program. Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Secretary, for your time today. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to former National Security Adviser General H.R. McMaster. Good morning to you. I think he's....\u00a0 \u00a0(LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: There you go.\u00a0 GEN. H.R. MCMASTER (Former U.S. National Security Adviser): I feel like I'm back in the Army on Army Radio. MARGARET BRENNAN: H.R. McMaster, you are -- you're on live television. Can you hear me? GEN. H.R. MCMASTER: Margaret, can you hear me OK? MARGARET BRENNAN: I can. So... GEN. H.R. MCMASTER: They can hear me, right? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, we are having some audio issues there. So I'm going to ask you a real quick question. We're going to take a break, and we're going to come back. Do you agree with the former vice president that Donald Trump was wrong about the 2020 election? (LAUGHTER) GEN. H.R. MCMASTER: Good. Good. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, I'm going to take a break here, because I don't think H.R. can hear me. So, stay with us, all of you. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And stick with us, because we will be back in a moment with former National Security Adviser retired General H.R. McMaster, and then a conversation with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, and a chat with parents who are really experiencing COVID through their children. Stay with us. We will have a lot more Face the Nation in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: With the Olympic games underway in Beijing, Elizabeth Palmer has a look at how the Chinese Communist Party has tightened control and expanded surveillance, all under the guise of public health. (BEGIN VT) ELIZABETH PALMER (voice over): After apparently straying to the edge of the approved zone, the IOC says it was an isolated incident, but it does show that rules in Beijing are strict. They kicked in as soon as athletes and officials landed. They were Covid tested and then sealed into what's meant to be an infection-free bubble with special buses to take them around. Athletes are tested twice a day. Also had to download a monitoring app. The Chinese government has stuck to its zero Covid policy, placing millions of people under strict lockdowns, even in modest outbreaks. It reports a death toll of just over 4,500 people. But in a country of 1.4 billion, western health analysts believe that number is just too low. Chinese officials say their success in large measure rests on this tracking app, an electronic big brother that sits on everyone's phone and tracks Covid cases and exposure. It's literally the key to entering buildings, taking cabs, or traveling. Typical of the people we asked, this couple said they're fine with that. Maybe so, but on top of the vast network of facial recognition cameras, it's given Chinese authorities a new super-surveillance tool to monitor and meddle in more than a billion lives. (END VT) PALMER: Given the power and the reach of a prickly Chinese state, U.S. officials have counseled American athletes not to criticize China while they're at the games and to stay safe. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz Palmer, thank you. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to former FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Good morning to you, doctor. DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nine hundred thousand Americans have died over the last two years from COVID. That's the population of Indianapolis, greater than the population of San Francisco, Charlotte, North Carolina. Where are we now as a country in this fight? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, we're still tragically in this fight. I think when you look across the country right now, you see the cases declining very quickly all across the country. In almost every state, if you look week over week, cases have declined sharply. So we're a good part of the way through this Omicron wave. If you look at places like New York, New Jersey, Maryland, cases are down to about 20 to 30 cases per 100,000 people per day, which is a low level. That's about where we were before the delta surge. Other parts of the country are still at about 100 cases per 100,000 people per day. One hundred and forty you look at states like North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, right now, Oklahoma, they're about at that level. So some parts of the country still are in the thick of their Omicron wave, coming down, but still in the thick of it. Other parts like New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Boston, if you look at some of the leading indicators have come way down and I think that they're through the worst of this particular wave of infection. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're hearing from governors, there was a bipartisan group of them that met with President Biden just in the past few days, saying they want guidelines to talk about moving from pandemic to an endemic stage here. And yet we're at 2,400 deaths a day. That doesn't feel like we're close to the end. DR. GOTTLIEB: No, it doesn't feel like that, and we're not close to the end right now, depending on how you measure that. I think that this is going to be a long struggle. This is a virus that's going to be persistent. We're going to have to continue to take measures to protect vulnerable people. I think what governors are agitating for is some clear guideposts that define what the on and off ramp is for this. When do we start to roll back this mitigation? And we don't have a agreed upon a set of nomenclature and metrics for measuring that. If you look at CDC right now, many state authorities and public health authorities talk about 10 cases per 100,000 people per day being a metric that rates you being in sort of a low level of spread. If you look at CDC's guidance, they talk about 10 cases per 100,000 people per week. So that's 1.44 cases a day. That's a level of spread, a sufficiently low level of spread, that we've never been at at any point in this pandemic. And that's where CDC defines a low level of spread that would justify removing masks, for example, in schools. And so I think what governors are sensing is that we need to- we need to agree upon a set of metrics when we're going to start to roll back these mitigation steps and give people a light at the end of the tunnel. What is that point when this stuff gets turned off? MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you talk about clear steps and masks. The governor of Virginia, we talked about on this program, you know, lifted the mask mandate for schools and he on January 2nd 20- excuse me, on January 23rd when I asked you what should be done here, you said that was too early, but in two weeks we'd be in a place where mask mandates could be lifted. So that puts us right where we are right now. Can mask mandates be lifted in most schools? DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, I think you're going to see governors start to do that. I think we're two weeks out, we've seen prevalence come down. Connecticut, their mask mandate is - expires on February 15th. I would expect that that's not going to be renewed, and schools in the state of Connecticut will very quickly lift mask requirements for students. I think you're going to see the same thing in New York, New Jersey, other states where Omicron has come down, where vaccination rates are especially high. I think you're going to see states do that. And we're at a point where we can safely contemplate that. That doesn't mean that this isn't going to continue to spread. But when prevalence is low, you have a lot of people who've been infected who have some level of immunity for a period of time and you have high vaccination rates, we can start to lean forward and take a little bit more risk and try to at least make sure that students in schools have some semblance of normalcy for this spring term. A lot of kids haven't really known a normal school day for two years now, so we want to- we need to try to lean forward aggressively to try to restore that and reclaim it when we can. MARGARET BRENNAN: But then I'm a parent of a young child who doesn't have access to a vaccine yet. I don't want to take a mask off of his face. When will he be vaccinated? I mean, the FDA said they want to reconsider their earlier guidance, and now they are looking at two doses. First week of March, do I go into a pediatric- pediatrician's office and get a shot? DR. GOTTLIEB: It's possible, look, the decision is ultimately going to reside with the FDA. The briefing documents on the data that the FDA is going to review are going to be out this Friday. The agency is going to have an advisory committee, a public advisory committee on February 15th. After that, I would expect that they'll make a decision on the vaccine for children ages six months to four years old, and they have a lot more data to evaluate. I think when people see that data come out, some of it will be out Friday in the briefing documents. All of it will be out in a public advisory committee meeting. I think that they'll see that the data package has evolved from when they first looked at it back in December. And what's happened over that intervening time is Omicron. 11.4 million children have been infected through this- through this pandemic, 3.5 million of them were infected in just the month of January, and that was Omicron, and there were 1.6 million kids under the age of five infected over the course of the pandemic. So we now have a lot of experience of the kids in that trial who were vaccinated, who made it through the Omicron wave and we'll be able to evaluate how protective that vaccine was. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you used to run the FDA, but do you think the FDA made a mistake by not authorizing this back in December, when they had the first chance to do so? GOTTLIEB: Look, I always felt that it was important to get baseline immunity in those children. Remember, Pfizer, the company I'm on the board of, made a decision to test low doses in children ages six months to five years old because they wanted to find the lowest dose possible that provided some immune response but improved tolerability. By choosing a very low dose in the children, it's a three microgram dose compared to a 30 microgram dose in adults, you improve the tolerability of the vaccine. But the sacrifice was that the absolute efficacy of the vaccine wasn't as substantial as what you saw in 16 to 25, and that's the data they were looking at back in December. They saw that the immune response wasn't as substantial, so they wanted to wait and see how those kids did. I still believe it was important to get baseline immunity in children ahead of the Omicron wave. They chose not to do that. I think they now have an opportunity to look at a much richer data set because they have the collective experience of all the kids who are enrolled in this trial who made it through Omicron. Some got infected, hopefully some didn't. I think that's what the data package is going to show. And I think it's going to give a much clearer picture of what the effectiveness of this vaccine is in Omicron. MARGARET BRENNAN: And then the open question is how many parents choose to take advantage of that vaccine being accessible. Dr. Gottlieb, it's always good to talk to you, and we'll catch up with you next Sunday. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week we spoke with a group of parents to get their perspective on parenting during the pandemic and the prospect of soon being able to get very young children vaccinated. (BEGIN VT) KYLIE, VIRGINIA DEMOCRAT: A few of the daycare moms and I have made a joke about like waiting in line for it like a concert. Basically, who's bringing the tent? KEVIN, VIRGINIA REPUBLICAN: Well, I mean, my son has had Covid. You know, he's been through -- through it, and it was pretty rough. I -- I know what I felt like when I got the vaccine. For a three-year-old to communicate what they really are feeling, and if there's a problem, can they actually do that? I -- I don't think they can. That's part of the reason why we want to wait. MARGARET BRENNAN: Kam, how about you? How have you fared and how have your children fared during the pandemic? KAM, TEXAS REPUBLICAN: So, my son's 13. So, you know, he started at a new school right when it started. I still think he's, you know, sort of playing catch-up and trying to get back to some level of normalcy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did the vaccine make a tremendous difference in -- in his life or in your psychology? KAM: Absolutely, because you always want to do anything you possibly can to protect your child. And, unfortunately, I lost my best friend, who opted to not get vaccinated, prior to my son being able to get vaccinated. So, as soon as it was an option for him to be able to get the vaccine -- he was 12 when he got it -- there wasn't any hesitation on my part. MARGARET BRENNAN: Alejandro, your children are a little bit older. What was your conversation about the need to get vaccinated or not? ALEJANDRO, NEW YORK DEMOCRAT: My kids are -- my kids really -- are really prevent (ph), verging on the hypochondriac. So they got vaccinated as soon as they were eligible. I didn't have to push them at all. If anything, they pushed me. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, I mean, how did that make you feel as the parent? ALEJANDRO: It made me feel safer. We were not given the (INAUDIBLE). I wasn't worried about them dying of Covid. But I was worried about them having the flu from hell and having any long-term consequences of that flu from hell. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do all of you, and do all of your children, wear masks? Raise your hand. And they all wear masks when they go to school? Are any of you -- like, do any of you hope that they get to take off that mask soon, or is it just normal now? ALEJANDRO: My middle child is going to college. And they -- at colleges, they really have a nasty mental health crisis. It's not made up. And the Covid restrictions have a lot to do with that. It's masking, the social distancing, the asking for -- the having to get tested twice a week, and so on and so forth. It's really taxing (ph) and it's really affecting their social lives. It's driving some of them pretty crazy, I guess. MARGARET BRENNAN: Allison, I want you to jump in here because I think you've got a pretty interesting point of view. You are actually a pediatrician. Are you concerned about development with young children given all the restrictions we're living under? Do you think that's a valid worry from parents? ALLISON, INDIANA REPUBLICAN: I do, especially for our teenage children. As far as the little ones go, I am not quite so concerned because these little ones are so resilient. So I think it's less of a concern than the big kids. But, yes, I think it's -- it's definitely an issue. I see it in my own daughter with -- she's in first grade, and in kindergarten she was wearing a mask all year and it wasn't an issue. And at the beginning of this year they didn't have them wearing masks and she was thrilled, of course. And then with the upsurge in the new variant, they had them return to masks and she just cried. She was devastated. So it really brought it kind of into more perspective to me that, I mean, this -- this is hard for them. It affects them so much more than we realize sometimes. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you hear the term \"children are resilient,\" do you think that's a positive way of characterizing things or does it anger you a little bit? KYLIE: It's not that I don't think children are resilient. I just think sometimes there's such a focus on them being resilient and having grit that they don't get a chance to, like, actually feel their emotions because they're too busy shoving them down to show grit and resilience. The very young, they don't have a lot of memories, but they do have -- there are subconscious things that stick with them. They're going to need to feel their feelings, and we're going to need to give them the grace to do so. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a really, I think, important observation. Kam, what's your feeling on this? KAM: We have a generation of youth, you know, that are missing opportunities and experiences that they're never going to be able to have again. MARGARET BRENNAN: Show of hands, who thinks that we can kind of make up for lost time? No one. Who thinks we can repair whatever impact there has been to our children? Caleb, you're hopeful here. CALEB, OREGON DEMOCRAT: Yes, I am, because with my -- with my three-year- old, this is a new thing that none of us have ever had to go through. But I think this is just normative for them moving forward, so they won't know that it's not, like, the same as what we had. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sidney, I know your children have experienced things as kind of a stop-start. How has that impacted them? SIDNEY (ph): They were 12 and 14. That's a really crucial time. So, for my daughter, who is a little bit more quiet anyway, it -- we had to make sure she came out of her room. And we could kind of see her closing down, tensing up. And, you know, so we could go into how can we help her mode? My son is a little bit more happy-go-lucky, and so he seemed to be taking everything in stride. So, it was clear he wasn't. Like, he was a 12-year- old who had, like, a three-year-old meltdown one day. He just ran out of the house yelling. You know, and -- and it was a -- you know, we were worried. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Kam, I know you had some difficulty seeing the -- what the impact was of isolation on your son. KAM: A couple months into it, he was just breaking down occasionally. And he finally wrote me a letter and said that he was concerned about when I wasn't going to be around, which was shocking because you see all this, like, death and gloom all around you. It's been much better now that he's back at school, but that first six to nine months, it definitely affected him emotionally. MARGARET BRENNAN: That must have been really hard to hear as a parent. KAM: Oh, absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do all of you feel like your emotional health has been impacted by Covid? Show of hands. All of you do. Do you think that impacts your ability to parent? KYLIE: The CDC kept saying, that's -- that's how you protect your child is you make sure everybody around them is vaxxed and boosted, because neither of my kids' grandmothers will get vaccinated. So, they haven't seen her since she was a year old. It was a -- and it was a hard conversation to have with my own mother, I must say. And then there came omicron, and it didn't seem to matter that we were vaccinated and boosted. It was coming for you anyway. And so now that's part of the paranoia, almost, right now. Yes, I'm going to get Marcy (ph) vaccinates as soon as possible, but now I don't think of the vaccine as the way out anymore. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: A painful conversation. But we hope to have a conversation with H.R. McMaster, who's finally up on the line, in a moment. So, stick with us. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to former National Security Adviser retired Gen. H.R. McMaster, who is with us from Palo Alto, California. Good morning to you and I understand you can hear me now. So that's good. I want to go- GENERAL H.R. MCMASTER: Good morning, MARGARET. It's great to be with you. Thanks for your perseverance.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Well, let's pick up on that question I put to you. Do you agree with the former Vice President Mike Pence, that Donald Trump was wrong in what he claims about the 2020 election? GEN. MCMASTER: Absolutely, and all Americans should agree with Vice President Pence and you- it's time, MARGARET, I think, to demand more from our political leaders, demand that they stop compromising confidence in our democratic principles and institutions and processes to score partisan political points. And as you know, this happens across both political parties and it's just time to stop. MARGRET BRENNAN: And you do you believe January 6th\u00a0 was in any way legitimate political discourse? GEN. MCMASTER: No, it was- it was illegitimate political discourse because it was an assault on the first branch of government. And so I think it's really important for us to come together now, MARGARET. And you know, I mean, I really think it is possible to improve the transparency in the security of our elections while ensuring that every eligible voter gets to vote. So I think what we need to do is stop posturing across these political parties and begin conversations with what we can agree on. I mean, your show has been great. I got to listen to the whole thing to be here at the end, but it is pretty clear that we are emerging from a number of traumas of the past couple of years, and it's time for Americans to come together and to restore our confidence in who we are as a people and in our democratic principles and institutions and processes. And of course, Russia preys on our weaknesses in the divisions and tries to portray democracy as weak. But you know, MARGARET, I believe that totalitarianism is fragile and weak and democracies are resilient and we can work together and- and come out of these traumas stronger. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for your clarity on those questions. General, the Trump administration back in 2018 was the first to give lethal aid to Ukraine, the anti-tank systems. It didn't deter Vladimir Putin from what appears to be a plan to invade. Why not? GEN. MCMASTER: Well, who knows what it deterred more, it's hard to- it's hard to prove a negative. Of course, Russia will push, Putin will push until he meets strong resistance. And so what we really need and what you're starting to see, I think, is deterrence by denial. Convincing Putin that he can no longer accomplish objectives through the use of force. And- and so if- if his objective is to divide NATO, what he needs to see is a NATO who comes together with it- with a stronger and higher degree of unity. If he wants to, if he wants to weaken Ukraine and keep it under its thumb, he's going to see obviously, a rise of nationalist sentiment in Ukraine. And Ukraine is doing everything they can to strengthen themselves, not only militarily but also economically. And what I'd like to do is see the whole world amplify the Ukrainians' voices and actually support them militarily, but also economically as well. And you know, MARGARET, I think what you see this past week is some anxiety on the part of Ukrainian leaders because as Russia continues to prepare for what looks like a renewed, massive offensive against Ukraine's port, remember they already invaded Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GEN. MCMASTER: Seven thousand Ukrainians have already died as a result. So I think we need to help Ukraine economically as well, as well as threaten Russia with economic consequences. What can we do to help strengthen Ukraine in the face of this crisis? MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what do you think is the impact then of this growing alliance between Russia and China, and you know, is China going to be emboldened by what happens next in Europe? GEN. MCMASTER: I think possibly depending on how we respond, and of course, China already is more and more aggressive in terms of extending and tightening its exclusive grip on power internally, you've seen how they've gone across sectors of the economy, continuing the genocidal campaign in Xinjiang, extinguishing human freedom in Hong Kong, persecuting journalists and anybody who might criticize the Chinese government during the Olympics have been intimidated or or imprisoned. And then, of course, externally as well, Margaret and we've seen them bludgeon Indian soldiers to death on the Himalayan frontier. You're weaponizing these islands in the South China Sea. Now they're painting some of their naval ships Coast Guard colors so they can claim really the biggest land grab in history in the South China Sea. And then, of course, Taiwan is probably the most dangerous flashpoint, and we've seen how aggressive they've been there as well. So it's really important, I think, for the free world to come together to strengthen again our confidence and to communicate to these totalitarian regimes that they can't accomplish their objectives at our expense. MARGARET BRENNAN: H.R. McMaster, I have much more to talk to you about on China. I'm going have to leave it right there for this moment, though, that's going to be up for us today at FACE THE NATION. Thank you for sticking with us through some bumps. We'll see you next week.",

And today on Face the Nation: The war in Ukraine takes a turn for the worse, and leaders around the world desperately search for a way to end the death and devastation.\u00a0    On day 18, the crisis in Ukraine is intensifying. Overnight, Russian forces fired missiles for the first time into Lviv, a city in Western Ukraine dangerously close to the Polish border. The relentless bombing, shelling, missile attacks and atrocities in other key regions of Ukraine have increased.\u00a0    And there are serious concerns in the intelligence community about Vladimir Putin introducing chemical weapons into Russia's blitz on the devastated country of 44 million citizens.\u00a0    (Begin VT)\u00a0    JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): I'm not going to speak about the intelligence, but Russia would pay a severe price if they used chemical weapons.\u00a0    (End VT)\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: What would that severe price be? President Biden maintains that the U.S. will not send troops, but will continue to defend NATO's interests in the region.\u00a0    (Begin VT)\u00a0    PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Direct confrontation between NATO and Russia is World War III, something we must strive to prevent.\u00a0    (End VT)\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: We will have the latest reporting from Ukraine and hear from its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. Plus, we will ask White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan what our options are at this critical time.\u00a0    We will also look at the worldwide economic impact of the war in Ukraine. Inflation in the United States, already high, leaps yet again, as Russia's  invasion sends the global oil market into turmoil. Is the president correct when he says it's due to the Putin price hike?\u00a0    (Begin VT)\u00a0    PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Make no mistake, inflation is largely the fault of Putin.\u00a0    (End VT)\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, and Mohamed El-Erian, the top economist at Allianz Capital. All that and more is just ahead on Face the Nation.\u00a0    Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. There is no end in sight to Russia's rampage on Ukraine. The Ukrainian government says the civilian death toll alone is in the thousands. Ukraine's president said today that 13,000 Russians are dead in the conflict. The U.S. cannot confirm that death toll.\u00a0    Today, news about the death of an American journalist, Brent Renaud, killed in a Russian attack on the capital city of Kyiv. Our Charlie D'Agata has been reporting from Kyiv since the invasion nearly three weeks ago -- Charlie.\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: Good morning, Margaret. The regional governor said more than 30 cruise missiles struck that base less than 20 miles from the Polish border. It's a military base that's been used by the U.S. and NATO partners for training exercises, drawing the West and U.S. allies closer to the fight.\u00a0    (Begin VT)\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice-over): The overnight aerial assault in Lviv is the latest attack in a Russian offensive that has widened and intensified by the hour. Russian tanks rumble down the street in the besieged port city of Mariupol. There's been no letup in Russia's relentless bombardment.\u00a0    (PROTESTERS SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: To the west, in Russian-occupied Melitopol, thousands of residents protested in the streets after video emerged appearing to show Russian troops kidnapping its mayor. And the Ukrainian government says a second mayor has been abducted from the city of Dniprorudne.  There is now growing evidence that the airstrike that destroyed the maternity hospital in Mariupol may be part of a systematic campaign.\u00a0    (WOMAN CRYING) CHARLIE D'AGATA: The World Health Organization has verified 24 attacks on medical facilities since the invasion began. After taking fire at this hospital in Kyiv, they covered the windows and work with the lights out at night.\u00a0    MAN: And this building, look.\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: OK.\u00a0    (CROSSTALK)\u00a0    MAN: ... building.\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: Yes. MAN: In the highest floor...\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: Right.\u00a0    MAN: ... work sniper.\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: A sniper?    MAN: Sniper.\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: While we were there doctors were saving the life of a first responder torn apart by shrapnel even while trying to rescue the wounded. With the Russian advance now bearing down, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rallied residents to defend the capital in an overnight address.\u00a0    (PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: \"If they kill all of us, then they will enter Kyiv,\" he said. \"If this is the goal, then let them enter, but they will not find friends among us.\" It is already a reality in the suburb of Bucha, where they're burying the dead in mass graves, a terrifying prelude of what may be to come.\u00a0    (End VT)\u00a0    CHARLIE D'AGATA: Now, the outskirts are really getting hit hard now.  And, as Russian forces move in to more densely populated areas, the civilian death toll is rising dramatically, and residents are now risking their lives just to get away -- Margaret.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: Charlie D'Agata in Kyiv, thank you. We turn now to Odessa in the south of Ukraine and our Chris Livesay for a look at how the Ukrainians are coping.\u00a0    (Begin VT)\u00a0    CHRIS LIVESAY (voice-over): It's the pendulum of war, first deathly loud, then, at once, a deafening silence. In the Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv, the morgues are full, mostly with civilians, these victims laid out in the freezing cold.\u00a0    (WOMAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)\u00a0    CHRIS LIVESAY: Among those spared gather here, below an abandoned market, their childhood interrupted by an invading army, even though these are Russian speakers, the very people Putin says he wants to protect, says the mayor, Oleksandr Syenkevych.\u00a0    OLEKSANDR SYENKEVYCH (Mayor of Mykolaiv, Ukraine): I think the main idea is to kill Ukrainians as much as they can. It's complete liar when they say that they want to protect us. They want to kill as much Ukrainians as they can.\u00a0    CHRIS LIVESAY: Human obstacles on the road to Odessa, the former crown jewel of the Russian empire, and, today, Ukraine's biggest port. It's a city half-deserted. The half that is still here steels itself with anti- tank defenses and optimism, like this soldier, who calls himself Snake.\u00a0    \"Fifteen days, we have stood up against the second biggest army in the world,\" he says. \"It's weaker than us.\" Others fill sandbags where a Russian fleet could float ashore any day. Sergey, a plastic surgeon, is ready to stitch up combat wounds, even take up arms.\u00a0    SERGEY (Plastic Surgeon): Russian nation, look at us. We were a peaceful nation. But we all have the brave heart.\u00a0    (End VT)\u00a0    CHRIS LIVESAY: Today, British military intelligence says Russian forces are advancing from Crimea in an effort to sidestep Mykolaiv and come straight here to Odessa -- Margaret.\u00a0    \u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris Livesay in Odessa, thank you. And here with us now is national security correspondent David Martin. David, great to have you here. This attack overnight in the west, this is the farthest Russia has gone towards NATO territory. Why are they doing that?\u00a0    DAVID MARTIN: Well, this is an air base out there. They hit hangars on the air base. It's the base where American troops used to train Ukrainian forces, but all the Americans were pulled out before the invasion. But it is still where much of the Ukrainian air force is based, particularly those MiG-29s we have been hearing so much about. So now the Russians have struck three airfields in the west, which is where the predominance of the Ukrainian air force is. So, clearly, they are trying to destroy the Ukrainian air force on the ground.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: For about two -- more than two weeks now, the Ukrainians have kept Russia at bay from the capital. Are they close to encircling it?\u00a0    DAVID MARTIN: They get a little closer every day. I mean, you still have to call it a creep or a crawl. And, actually, the latest today is that they got reversed a little bit. The Russians got reversed a little bit in the -- one of the towns northeast of Kyiv which had been isolated. And the Ukrainians were able to reopen the resupply route into that city. So it's grind them out. But you heard what Charlie D'Agata said, that they -- you can hear the shelling getting closer and closer.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia, though, is willing to use munitions that have been banned under international law. We know that. We heard President Biden warn about chemical weapons use. Are we seeing movement of those kinds of weapons into Ukraine?\u00a0    DAVID MARTIN: A Pentagon official I talked to you this morning said there is no movement of chemical weapons into Ukraine. At least they're not seeing the signs of it. The concern is that the Russians will seize one of these biomedical research facilities that Ukraine has, where they do research on deadly pathogens like botulism and anthrax, seize one of those facilities, weaponize the pathogen, and then blame it on Ukraine and the U.S., because  the U.S. has been providing support for some of the research being done in those facilities. But it appears the Ukrainians have gotten most of those pathogens destroyed.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: And the World Health Organization reportedly had been warning about some of that. What you're describing sounds like increased acts of desperation, but then Russia still has considerable combat power here. They have lost three generals, reportedly. I mean, how do we judge what they have left?\u00a0    DAVID MARTIN: Well, they still have something like 90 percent of their combat power that they started in the war with still available. But they're starting to run out of things. They're starting to run out particularly of precision-guided weapons. And sometime in the near future, maybe this week, Putin is going to have to make a decision about starting to bring reinforcements in from the interior of Russia, certainly more munitions, maybe more troops. And that will obviously be a sign that he continues to go ahead and double down on this grind-them-out type of warfare that he's adopted.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: David Martin, thank you for your reporting.\u00a0    DAVID MARTIN: Sure thing.\u00a0    MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. Good morning to you, Jake.\u00a0    JAKE SULLIVAN (U.S. National Security Adviser): Good morning.    MARGARET BRENNAN: There are a lot of developments to get through with you. I do want to ask you about these reports that a U.S. journalist has been killed in Ukraine by Russian forces. Do we know what the consequence would be for Russia killing an American?\u00a0   NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, this is obviously shocking and horrifying, and I have just learned about it as I came on to air here, so I will be consulting with my colleagues. We'll be consulting with the Ukrainians to determine how this happened and then to measure and execute appropriate consequences as a result of it.\u00a0   MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake, there are reports of white phosphorus being used in Ukraine, reports of chlorine gas. How imminent is a chemical weapons  attack in Ukraine?\u00a0   NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: We can't predict a time or place. All we can say is that there is an escalating level of rhetoric on the Russian side, trying to accuse the Ukrainians and the United States of potentially using chemical or biological weapons. And that's a tell, Margaret. That's an indicator that, in fact, the Russians are getting ready to do it, and try and pin the blame elsewhere, and nobody should fall for that. That is why we've gone out so decisively at the United Nations Security Council and elsewhere to rob the Russians of the capacity to pin this on anyone other than themselves. And, as the president said on Friday, if, in fact, the Russians do use chemical weapons in Ukraine, they will pay a severe price.\u00a0   MARGARET BRENNAN: Overnight, Poland's president has said use of a weapon of mass destruction would be a game-changer for NATO. President Biden seemed to say military force is completely off the table in Ukraine, even if a weapon like this was used. Is that the case?\u00a0   NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: We are consulting with our allies. And, collectively, we are communicating directly to the Russians. Sitting here before you today, I'm not going to go further than what President Biden said on Friday, which is that the Russians would pay a severe price if they were to move forward with chemical weapons.\u00a0   MARGARET BRENNAN: But none of the sanctions you've imposed so far have stopped Putin. So, is there any red line for the administration here in terms of humanitarian catastrophe that would change the president's calculus? Is this a game-changer?\u00a0   NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: The use of weapons of mass destruction would be a shocking additional line that Putin is crossing in terms of his assault on international law and international norms, his assault on the human rights and human dignity of the people of Ukraine. But, bottom line, Margaret, the premise of your question, which is, well, sanctions haven't stopped Putin, so are they not working, I think we have to look at this in two respects. One is, have we imposed severe costs on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine? And the answer is yes.\u00a0   And the second is, have we been able to help the Ukrainians defend themselves against these attacks, to push back Russian forces from being able to take major cities, including the capital city, Kiev? And the answer  to that is yes as well. And part of the reason why Putin is resorting to the possibility of extreme tactics like the use of chemical weapons is because he's frustrated because his forces aren't advancing.\u00a0   MARGARET BRENNAN: You said that consequences have been communicated to Russia. But, from my reporting, I have heard there's no presidential contact. There's no secretary of state contact. The military leaders in Russia just aren't picking up the phone. You personally have communicated this to someone in the Russian government?\u00a0   NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: I'm not going to get specific about the nature of our communication with the Russians. I will also say that it's not just the United States that has channels to the Russians, but many of our allies and partners, and we coordinate closely in terms of what we communicate to them, how and on what topics. And that will continue, but it will continue through private diplomatic channels.\u00a0   MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. policy is to help Ukrainians defend themselves. How confident are you that you can keep those supply lines open?\u00a0   NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: We believe in our capacity to continue to flow substantial amounts of military assistance, weapons, and supplies to the front in Ukraine. We have been successful in doing so thus far. And we believe that we have a system in place that will allow us to continue to do so, notwithstanding the Russian threats. And we believe that these weapons are making a significant difference in helping the Ukrainians defend themselves. Of course, we're merely helping provide the tools.\u00a0   MARGARET BRENNAN: This is getting very close to NATO territory. Is the U.S. policy that any strike into Polish territory or airspace, intentional or unintentional, is an attack on NATO?\u00a0   NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: The president has been clear repeatedly that the United States will work with our allies to defend every inch of NATO territory, and that means every inch. And if there is a military attack on NATO territory, it would cause the invocation of Article 5, and we would bring the full force of the NATO alliance to bear in responding to it.\u00a0   MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's an accidental, errant shot?\u00a0   NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, all I will say is that, if Russia attacks, fires upon, takes a shot at NATO territory, the NATO alliance would respond to that.\u00a0   MARGARET BRENNAN: It's been a very busy few hours for you. I'm tracking what is happening overnight as well in Iraq. Iran's Revolutionary Guard has now claimed responsibility for firing ballistic missiles into Northern Iraq towards a location where the U.S. Consulate is located. Are you condemning Iran for carrying out this attack?\u00a0   NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Of course. We condemn Iran for carrying out this attack. We're still gathering information on what precisely the target was. What we know at this hour, Margaret, is that no U.S. facilities were hit, no U.S. persons were harmed. But the United States is absolutely clear, we will do whatever it takes to defend our people, our interests, and our allies, and we are in consultation with the Iraqi government and the government in Iraqi Kurdistan, in part to help them get the missile defense capabilities to be able to defend themselves in their cities.\u00a0   MARGARET BRENNAN: So the nuclear deal is not dead?\u00a0   NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: This is not the first time Iran has -- as things stand right now, they're -- the various negotiators are back home in their capitals. And we will have to see what happens in the days ahead with respect to the diplomacy around the nuclear deal.\u00a0   MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake, I have to let you go. Thank you for your time today. Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.\u00a0   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with the foreign minister of Ukraine, Dmytro Kuleba, who is in Kiev. Good morning to you, minister.   UKRAINIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS DMYTRO KULEBA: Good morning.   MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration is warning of an impending chemical weapons attack in Ukraine. Do you have any further information about where or when or what the consequences would be? Would NATO defend you?   KULEBA: Well, we don't know the details, but we do not exclude that option because we see that Russia is using one prohibited weapon after another to break us down, and United Nations have already confirmed that some of the internationally prohibited weapons have been used against Ukrainian civilians, against our cities. So we will work closely with the United States and other partners trying to identify where chemical weapons can or may be- may be used by Russia. And when you're asking me whether NATO will defend us, well, we do not have- we do not expect that. What we are asking is very simple thing. We say arm Ukraine and we will do the rest. Give us all the weapons necessary and we will fight for our own land and for our people.   MARGARET BRENNAN: How reliable are those Western supply lines into Ukraine right now?   KULEBA: Well, they operate, they're functioning, so this is a good sign, and we appreciate those partners who are involved in these supplies. However, of course, in the end, it's all about the quantity and the quality of weapons that we receive, and we currently reach the stage we need- where we need some new advanced weapons to fight Russia, to fight against Russia, to defend ourselves, and we're negotiating with partners including the United States. I hope that all decisions will be swift and we will get what we need because again, we are ready to fight, but we need to be properly equipped to do so.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, President Biden approved another two hundred million in weapons, but those are small arms, anti-aircraft as well. There is the promise that Congress will be sending more money your way. What specific types of weapons do you need? What kind of sophisticated systems?   KULEBA: Well, the highest demand is in planes, in fighting- fighting jets, in attack aircraft because unfortunately, the air force power of Russia and Ukraine are uncomparable. And yes, it's true that we shoot them down, but they also- they also shoot us down. And if we lose control over the sky, we cannot prevent two things from happening. We cannot prevent- we cannot stop Russian bombers, destroy our cities and killing civilians. And we cannot destroy Russian columns heading towards our big cities on the roads. To achieve these two purposes, we need more planes. This is the- the most pressing issue. We- frankly speaking, we don't understand all the explanations that we are given, why we should not be- why we should not be given those planes and we will continue putting pressure on our- and from all corners and requesting this assistance from the United States and other partners.   MARGARET BRENNAN: It was on this program last Sunday that the Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the decision by Poland to provide fighter jets to Ukraine gets a green light from the United States. Then, days later, President Biden spiked that. Do you have a sense that any country will give you fighter jets?   KULEBA: Well, it's- frankly everything that happens over the fighting jets in the last week is kind of a diplomatic mystery. On the one hand, everyone is ready to do it- to do it, but nothing is happening and we are not getting the planes. It reminds me of other ping pong game where every side throws the ball to the other side and gets it back. We have no time for this kind of ping pong diplomacy. We need planes to save lives of our people and to stop Rus- to stop, to put an end to Russian domination in the sky. And I ask as foreign minister and I beg as Ukrainian to find common ground on this issue and provide Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself.   MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States argues giving these jets would be escalatory and a risk to NATO, a risk to United States, and that you have things like drones that work just fine.   KULEBA: I - to my view, this logic is flawed because the drones are not escalatory and planes are escalatory. What is the logic behind it? Anti-tank weapons are not escalatory and planes are escalatory. First, what else Russia has to do for everyone to understand that they already reached the peak of escalation? They used, as I mentioned in the beginning, weapons prohibited by the international conventions. Why are we so afraid of another- another escalation? We need- we need to defend ourselves. And then the second point that I'm hearing is that planes are offensive weapons, and therefore they can not be supplied because the partner is only supplying defensive weapons to Ukraine. I'm sorry, but all weapons given to us are defensive by definition, because they are being used to defend this country. And I don't understand what else has to happen, what kind of atrocity has to be committed for foreigners to put all this flawed arguments aside and finally provide us with what we need.   MARGARET BRENNAN: The president of Poland said that what happened in the past week, specifically the bombing of that maternity hospital that got so much attention around the world, that it bears the features of genocide. Is that what you believe Russia's intent is?   KULEBA: Well, Russia, President Putin definitely believes that Ukraine has no right to exist as a country. He doesn't recognize our identity. He says we are Russians, we are not Ukrainians. We are the same, which is obviously not the case. And from what we've been seeing in recent- in recent three weeks is a series of deliberately committed war crimes, crimes against humanity. And when they bomb hospitals, maternity houses, schools, when they kill civilians passing by trying to be evacuated from the war zone, that, of course, indicates that they are trying to break us down and to destroy us.   BRENNAN: Ukraine's defense minister said that more civilians have been killed than Ukrainian military forces. Do you have any sense of the toll thus far of this war?   KULEBA: Well, it's- unfortunately the death toll of civilians is more is in thousands. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, so I don't want to speculate on this. But Minister of Defense is right. More civilians have been killed, more of them, more than soldiers and police officers and National Guard officers and soldiers fighting against the Russians. And this is mainly the result of the use of Russian Air Force to attack our cities. Only today as we speak, I had to go to to go down to the bomb shelter twice because of the air- air raid- potential air raid attack. In both cases, the Russian plane flew over us. We were not the target this time, but who knows, maybe the next time we will be the target. Civilians died because of the massive control of the skies by the Russians, and this is why we're asking you to help us specifically with the planes.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go one question. Russia has reportedly kidnapped at least two mayors of Ukrainian cities and is replacing them with pro-Russian individuals. What do you believe this indicates about the plans to occupy your country and what Putin's endgame is here?   KULEBA: Well, first, it speaks for the fact that we resist. That even if Russia establishes control over a certain city or town in southern Ukraine, the local- local authorities, local citizens, they resist this occupation. They do not agree with it. They oppose the attempt to impose the Russian rule in these territories. So this forces the Russians to use terrorist tactics and kidnap- kidnap our mayors, our members of our city council to put pressure on them, intimidate them. The second is- the second fact is that yes, Russia tries to change the authorities in order to establish itself as an occupying power in this region. And this is why to all together with partners, Ukraine has to react in the strongest terms possible and impose the strongest measures on Russia so that everyone will know that this comes with a price.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Minister, thank you for your time and stay safe. We'll be right back with a lot more. Face the nation. Stay with us.   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: On Monday, Norah O'Donnell will be reporting from Poland  with a look at the growing humanitarian crisis in the region. That's starting tomorrow on the CBS Evening News.\u00a0  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, including an interview with the CEO of Pfizer, as we mark the two-year anniversary of the COVID pandemic. Stay with us.\u00a0  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. For a closer look at what Americans are thinking about the war in Ukraine, we go to CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto. Good morning to you, Anthony.\u00a0  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You know some of the biggest news of the week was the Biden administration's decision, finally, to put a block on imports of Russian petroleum products into the United States, though they admit it is going to make things more expensive for consumers. What did Americans think about that?\u00a0  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Margaret, there is wide support for sanctions against Russia. And something we don't get to say every day, it is bipartisan. In fact, really strong with both Democrats and Republicans. But, importantly, in a poll you want to follow up and ask people then, what if that means you're going to pay more at the pumps? And when you do that, majority support remains at 63 percent.\u00a0  Now, this is something we'll have to watch. It might depend on just how much those prices rise. But you ask people why it is that they support the sanctions, and it's not that they say they can readily afford it, it's that they say they want to help Ukraine and punish Russia. Margaret.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But inflation is already at a new 40-year high. So just how tolerant are people going to be?\u00a0  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, what happens is, people feel like Russia is not  going to stop at Ukraine. There's 69 percent who thinks that Russia is going to invade other countries. And they're concerned about a wider war. They're concerned about a global recession. And when you look at the folks who are most concerned about that, they're even more likely to support the oil sanctions. So you read this sense that people might be willing to pay more now in order to try to stop or avoid something worse later, Margaret.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, how do Americans assess the president's leadership during this crisis?\u00a0  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, his handling of it is up over the last week, but it's still not net positive. A couple of reasons for that. One is people say they still feel nervous about this. And, secondly, there's half the country that says they want him to take stronger action towards Russia. So we followed up and we asked, what would be stronger action. And the things that pop out are even stronger sanctions and supplying more military weapons to Ukraine. We also looked at the idea of enforcing a no-fly zone. And here you see Americans real weariness about getting into a wider war because in the abstract, you get a majority that says, yes, they'd support a no-fly zone. But then you follow up and ask, what if Russia takes that as an act of war, what if that leads to a direct U.S.-Russia conflict, and then support really drops off, down to 38 percent. So, you see Americans wanting to do something, wanting to stop Russia but really concerned about being drawn into a conflict. Margaret.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you. We'll be right back.\u00a0  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week, harsh financial sanctions and trade restrictions were put in place to punish Russia and cripple its economy. Among them, the banning of all Russian imports of oil, gas, and coal, as well as goods like vodka and caviar. Joining us now is the managing director of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva. Welcome to FACE THE NATION.\u00a0  MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE IMF KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: Thank you very much for having me.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I wonder how you can calculate the total impact of all of these restrictions that have been put on Russia. I mean, it- will Russia default on its debts and what impact will that have to the global economy?  KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA:\u00a0 Let's remember that the reason they're unprecedented sanctions is because the unthinkable happened, a devastating war in Ukraine. And the impact of the sanctions is quite severe for the Russian economy. We expect a deep recession in Russia, and this abrupt contraction is affecting already how the Russian population is taking the heat on them. The ruble depreciated significantly. What does it mean? Real incomes have shrunk. Purchasing power of the Russian population has significantly diminished. In terms of servicing debt obligations, I can say that no longer we think of Russian default as improbable event. Russia has the money to service its debt, but cannot access it. What I'm more concerned is that there are consequences that go beyond Ukraine and Russia.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. I mean, you have said that the crisis in Ukraine could cause famine in Africa, for example, you look at the wheat imports and the price spikes there. Which countries around the world are you most concerned about? Is this going to destabilize other governments?  KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: What we are mostly concerned about are the immediate neighbors of Russia and Ukraine, the Central Asian republics, the Caucasus, Moldova, because they have trade relations with both Russia and Ukraine more than the rest of the world, and because of this outflow of people refugee wave in Europe, that is of the order of magnitude of what happened in the Second World War. So there the impact is most significant. Beyond the immediate neighbors, there are two groups of countries we are very worried. The first group are countries that have yet to recover from the COVID-induced economic crisis. For them, this shock is particularly painful. And the second group of countries are those that are more dependent on energy imports from Russia, because there the impact on consumption, but also on inflation is going to be more prominent.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we looking, because of the debt levels you talk about, the vulnerability, are we looking at the potential of this becoming a financial crisis for the rest of the world?  KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: For now, no. When you look at the total exposure of banks to Russia, it is about a hundred and twenty billion dollars. Not negligent, but definitely not systemically relevant. And to what we are also seeing is that while inevitably we are going to downgrade our growth projections for 2022, it is still going to be a positive growth rate. For countries that have been fast to recover from the COVID crisis, like the United States, growth is robust. It is those that were falling behind where the impact is more severe. And let me say this, yes, war in Ukraine means hunger in Africa, but war in Ukraine also has social implications for many, many countries through the three channels that are already demonstrably impactful. One, commodity prices, energy, grains, fertilizers, metals to the impact that has on inflation and in countries where inflation has already been high, this is dramatic--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --like the United States,\u00a0  KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: Like United States, like many emerging market countries, think of Brazil, Mexico and three, what do we do when we have to fight inflation? We tighten financial conditions.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a question for you. You've been working on emergency funding for Ukraine. If that government falls, can Russia seize that money? If Russia installs a puppet government in Ukraine, can they get access to that money?  KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: We are thinking of our internal interactions with Ukraine as being very productive. We have provided 1.4 billion dollars in emergency financing into the Ukrainian special account with the IMF. In other words, it is being drone by the government of Ukraine and nobody else can touch it. And we see that the Ukrainian authorities have been remarkable. Margaret, we had negotiations on this 1.4 billion and my staff tells me they can hear the air raid sirens and yet works go on. I have family in Ukraine. They tell me they can still pull money from back home. That's even in the city of Kharkiv that is the second-largest, heavily bombarded city. So bravo to the Ukrainian authorities for what they do.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Director, thank you for your time this morning.\u00a0  KRISTALINA GEORGIEVA: Thank you.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be tracking that ongoing story.  We want to go now to the chief economic adviser to Allianz, and that's Mohamed El-Erian, who joins us this morning from Cambridge, England. Good morning to you.  EL-ERIAN: Good morning, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: In this country, we saw yet another high, a 40 year high in inflation. It's the Fed's job to control that, and the Fed chief has some big decisions this week. What are you expecting from?  EL-ERIAN: Well, he doesn't have an easy decision, as you said. Inflation is high and will go higher because of what's happening in Ukraine. And basically, he's got to make a choice, hit the brakes, regain credibility, but risk a recession or tap the brakes, and we have an inflation problem going into next year. We are here because the Fed is very late and has no good policy options available anymore.  MARGARET BRENNAN: No good policy options. You're expecting what kind of rate hike and what is the risk of recession at this point? Goldman Sachs. I know they upped their forecast to at least a 20 percent chance of a recession in the United States.  EL-ERIAN: Yes, and they are thinking that we're going to get seven hikes this year. I don't think we'll get seven hikes. I don't think this economy can support seven hikes, and if we do get seven hikes, we will go into recession. That's the cost of being late. I suspect that what we'll hear on Wednesday, Margaret, is a 25 basis point rate hike. We will hear that more on the way, and we will hear that they will all also contract what has become a nine trillion balance sheet. We are in this absurd situation that last week, when we got the 7.9 percent inflation rate, the Fed was still putting liquidity into this economy. That just gives you a feel for how misaligned policy has been.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Mohammed, you've been a critic for some time. You know, the White House this week is calling inflation \"a Putin price hike.\" But you were on this program back in December talking about how serious inflation was. Where does the responsibility for this lie exactly?  EL-ERIAN: So it lies in the circumstances, it lies in the Fed being late, and mischaracterizing inflation. Til' the end of November they were calling it transitory, but also to be fair to the administration, there- there will be a Putin inflation component. I estimate that at 7.9 percent, we will probably get very close or above 10 percent before we come down. And that difference will be all because of the disruption that Putin's war imply for commodity prices, supply chains and shipments.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Double digit inflation. When do you think we will see that? I mean, people are really feeling it now.  EL-ERIAN: Yeah, if it happens, it will happen in the summer and people will feel it, the worst thing for us would be not only do we feel the higher inflation, but we also feel income losses. That's why it's critical to avoid a recession. We-we can't avoid stagflation\u2013lower growth, higher prices, but we certainly can avoid a recession and we can bounce back quickly.  MARGARET BRENNAN: As we said\u2013I mean\u2013it is the Fed's job to control inflation. The White House is saying both that it is not their fault, but that they're doing something about it at the same time. Are there political measures here that actually can be taken?  EL-ERIAN: There are and they're stuck in Congress, you can do more to increase labor force participation so that wage pressure comes down. That's about childcare, that's about easing people's way back into the labor force. You can do more to enhance productivity, and you can do more to supply\u2013to remove supply bottlenecks. The administration has policies. Lots of them are stuck in Congress right now.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, when you talk about supply chain bottlenecks, we have to remember we are coming out of this global pandemic. And just overnight, we're seeing headlines that local authorities in Shenzhen, China, have imposed a new lockdown there due to a COVID outbreak. This is a major manufacturing hub for the rest of the world. I don't want to overstate this, but how concerned should we be about this as a factor?  EL-ERIAN: We should because China is sticking to its zero COVID [transcription corrected] policy at a time when Omicron makes that policy very hard to implement. So they will have sequential lockdowns that will have spillovers to us. You know, we can be a good house, but we're living right now in a really tough neighborhood. And that's why it's really important to respond quickly. We can't fall behind again on policies.  MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013again on policies. OK, so that's up to the Fed. But when we look ahead for the year, the Treasury secretary is already saying we should expect 12 months of inflation. When can we play catch up there and bring prices back down? Where are these tools really out of the hands of policymakers at this point?  EL-ERIAN: So Secretary Yellen is correct. We, unfortunately, are going to have at least 12 months of uncomfortable inflation, something that we haven't had since the 70s and 80s, and that's going to be especially problematic for the more vulnerable segments of our society. It hits food and gas particularly hot. As to what we can do, we have to be really careful that we don't get another wave of inflation due to what economists call the anchored inflation expectations. Basically, Margaret, it's a simple story. Right now, I will go in. I-being the American worker-and asked for compensation for past inflation. If I don't have faith in my policymakers, I will also ask for compensation for future inflation. I want to protect myself, preemptively, that happens, then we have that awful price-wage-price-cycle.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mohamed El-Erian, thank you very much for your analysis this morning, and we will track what happens in the coming days. We will be back in a moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Today marks two years since the start of a national emergency in the U.S. due to Covid-19. Earlier, we spoke with the chairman and C.E.O. of Pfizer, Albert Bourla, about his book, \"Moonshot: Inside Pfizer's Nine Months Race to Make the Impossible, Possible.\" Here's part of our conversation.\u00a0 (BEGIN VC)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that we will, every fall, have to prepare ourselves for a booster shot with Covid, just like we get a flu shot?\u00a0 ALBERT BOURLA, AUTHOR, \"MOONSHOT\": I think so. Many variants are coming. And omicron was the first one that was able to evade in a skillful way the immune protection that we were giving. But also, in all that the duration of the protection, it doesn't last very long. So, what we are trying to do, and we are working very diligently, right now it is to make not only a vaccine that will protect against all variants, including omicron, but also something that can protect for at least a year.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've seen some of that data on -- on a fourth dose, a second booster shot? You think it will be necessary?\u00a0 ALBERT BOURLA: It is necessary, a fourth booster, right now. The protection what we are getting from the third, it is good enough -- actually, quite good for hospitalizations and deaths. It's not that good against  infections, but it doesn't last very long. But we are just submitting those data to the FDA and then we're seeing what the experts also will say outside Pfizer.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So the question that was number one on my list, and I think for so many parents is, is when will the vaccine be available for those children five and under? The availability.\u00a0 ALBERT BOURLA: Potentially May, if it works. They, I'm sure, will do their utmost to review them fast. So -- and we will be ready with manufacturing.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You are a global corporation. How is the instability in Europe right now regarding Russia and Ukraine impacting you? Do you expect supply chain issues or pricing effects from this?\u00a0 ALBERT BOURLA: No, I don't think that we'll have -- we are very independent in terms of our supplying our ingredients from those parts of the world. We are not making over there medicines. We do make some medicines in Russia for Russia, but we do not export. We do not expect to see in the world any disruptions, right now at least, because of this war.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you -- you don't plan, then, to divest from Russia?\u00a0 ALBERT BOURLA: Every time that you have bans or let's say trade restrictions, typically they don't apply to medicines because these are about lives. How can you say I'm not going to send to the cancer medicines to Russians because of what they did? Usually they are exempt from this, let's say, situations, but, clearly, we are not planning to invest in Russia. And we have very little investments there, frankly.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think, with the technology -- the technology that Pfizer used, and Moderna, mRNA technology, it's still new, and it seems like there are a lot of possibilities for where this could be used. What's the next solution around the corner?\u00a0 ALBERT BOURLA: I would say that the lowest hanging fruit is other vaccines, how to use this technology to bring vaccines that we don't have right now, or we have and they are not good enough. Flu is a good example. The flu vaccines are not very good in general. And there are other and diseases that we don't have good vaccines. So that would be, I think, the first.\u00a0 The second is oncology, cancer. Right now a lot of research is happening by trying to use our -- to train our immune system through mRNA not to attack the virus, as we do with coronavirus, but to attack our cancer cells, to recognize them as an enemy and try to attack them. Highly -- that will revolutionize the field if we will be able to be successful with that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: How far are you from that?\u00a0 ALBERT BOURLA: You know, I think there's so much work happening, even  before the vaccines. We started with cancer in RNA. We will know if we are successful, I think, in the next two, three years.\u00a0 (END VC)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Our full conversation is available on our website and our YouTube channel. We'll be right back.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Around the world, the moral outrage at the scenes and reports from Ukraine are deafening. But that outrage has not dented Vladimir Putin's resolve. (BEGIN VC)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): Among the many atrocity last week, Russia bombed a maternity hospital. As pregnant women tried to bring life into the world, some lost theirs. Others defied the odds. Standing next to the American vice president, Poland's leader said a line has been crossed, calling the attack an act of barbarity with the features of a genocide. Vladimir Putin has shown time and again that he does not believe rules apply to him. The U.S. now says he's considering using chemical weapons.\u00a0 JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: But Russia will pay a severe price if they use chemical weapons.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But what is that consequence that could stop Putin? President Biden has drawn a bright line to say the U.S. will not use military force to stop Russia from killing Ukrainians. Is there a level of catastrophe that might change his mind? Vladimir Putin has terrified European leaders who admit their past complacency may have emboldened him. Britain's top diplomat.\u00a0 LIZ TRUSS, U.K. SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN COMMONWEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT AFFAIRS: The invasion of Ukraine is a paradigm shift on the scale of 9/11. The era of complacency is over.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That new reality convinced Germany, a country that had disavowed the militant legacy of World War II, to send weapons to the war  zone. But that makes little difference to the 2.5 million Ukrainians who fled their homes in the past two weeks and the more than 40 million still there.\u00a0 As Ukrainians defy the odds on the battlefield, Russia is estimated to have lost more soldiers in two weeks than the U.S. did in two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan. Now, western leaders say they want Russian mothers to stop Putin.\u00a0 Perhaps by losing more of their own sons, they'll protest, realizing that they no longer have anything else left to lose.\u00a0 (END VC)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

The panel evaluates Russian President Vladimir Putin's immediate and long-term objectives and discusses how deterrent measures might be enhanced. They also discuss possible post-conflict scenarios in the European security landscape. This episode was produced in partnership with the Michael V. Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. Highlights: Rose Gottemoeller on Putin's motivations:\u00a0\"This is a this is a 'Look at me' moment for Putin and getting attention. He was seeing, I think, the United States passing Russia by and pivoting to Asia. Well, what has he done in recent times? He's shown us, he's gone off and had a great big summit meeting with Xi in Beijing. So this whole crisis has kept Russia, and it's kept Putin, before the global community on the front pages of the newspaper now for a long time. And I think that's part of what is going on here.\" John Sipher on avoiding escalatory spiral:\u00a0\"The goal is going to be to make sure it's extremely painful for Putin, but to try to avoid some sort of escalatory spiral that we get caught into because, obviously, gas supplies are the immediate lever that Putin can pull. But I am also really worried about cyber. And so if we really do go after Russian banks, might they wield cyber tools to go after our banks? And so there is that needle to thread where it has to be painful, but how do we also prevent this kind of this escalatory spiral?\u00a0 Andrea Kendall-Taylor on long-term implications:\u00a0\"This to me is a signal that we're going to be in for a long, hard slog with President Putin. He's more brazen, he's more aggressive. He's willing to use his military. That's the lesson that he's learned. You learn that you use your military, you get the United States and Europe to the table to have the discussions that you want. S I may be thinking slightly past this most immediate crisis, but we've got to rethink entirely what our U.S. and European policy approaches [are] to Russia.\"\u00a0 Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. \"Intelligence Matters\" transcript - Experts including former Deputy Secretary General of NATO Rose Gottemoeller, former Deputy National Intelligence Officer for Russia and Eurasia Andrea Kendall-Taylor, and former senior CIA operations officer John Sipher Producer: Olivia Gazis MICHAEL MORELL: Let me get the discussion started by asking, and Andrea, we'll start with you. Why is Putin doing this? Why is this so important to him and why now? What's behind the timing? ANDREA KENDALL-TAYLOR Yeah, a lot to unpack there, and no simple answers. First of all, it's great to be on this panel with these guests. I feel really honored to be with them tonight. So thank you for having me. But I think first and foremost, this is about Ukraine. This is about keeping Ukraine in Putin's sphere of influence and in his orbit. I think it's an intensely personal issue for Putin. He has tried and failed repeatedly to increase Russian influence over Ukraine over his 22 years in power. So I think he sees this as quite personal and that this is his time to reassert influence. But we have to underscore it's about Ukraine, but it's also about more than Ukraine. I think that very much for Putin, this is about revisiting the end of the Cold War. This is about reversing time. It's about rewriting the security order. It's about reinstating spheres of influence in Europe. And I think the 'Why now?' question, I think we obviously don't know exactly what it is. I think in terms of the Ukraine question, when Putin sees what's happening in Ukraine, he can see that trends are not moving in a direction that's favorable to Moscow. So his intervention, particularly in 2014, had the opposite effect of only hardening Ukrainians' desire to reintegrate into Euro-Atlantic institutions. So he sees quite clearly that things are not moving in his direction. And so I think if he judges, if he has to interfere and intervene to right that trajectory, from Moscow's perspective, that now is the time to do it before the Ukrainian military continues to enhance its capabilities. But I also think it's, you know, I personally think that there are legacy issues at play here. I think Putin is thinking long term. I think he believes that he is the last Russian leader who would be willing to take such risks to reassert Russia's role as a great power. And so I think for him, the time is, his clock is ticking, time is ticking. And so he is getting ready to break things. I mean, I think he really sees this. He sees the West as being in decline. He sees the United States is distracted. He sees the transatlantic relationship as under strain and he is leaning in now, I think, to accomplish these very maximalist objectives because I think that he views this as the opportune moment to do that. MICHAEL MORELL: John, do you want to add anything? And maybe at the same time, give us your perspective on Putin, the man who are we dealing with here? JOHN SIPHER: I'll just add, you know, I would think I totally agree with Andrea. I think Ukraine is moving further and further away from Russia. It's on the upswing. It's showing itself to be a model of moving to the West, which is bad for him and his people. So I totally agree with that. I also do think some of this crisis is built into the way we previously dealt with Putin. I think he's essentially - as we look at he's been in power now, 20 years, the last 10 years, he's been essentially in a political war against us. And he's continued to take quite aggressive attacks and actions against us. And every time he's done something, we've only pushed back to the point where we didn't want to push him too far. We thought, maybe if we own it, we're getting some concessions or accommodations. Maybe he'll come around. Maybe he'll change. And in retrospect, it looks like he saw that as weakness. That is, if he decides to sort of yank our chain, he'll get something out of it. We don't show great strength. We really don't push back. And so now he's he's sort of thrown down the gauntlet and we have less means to sort of deter this type of action. And you add to that, I think he sort of despises the EU and Europe, thinks they're weak, he sees that the US pulled out of Afghanistan. You see what happens here domestically; January 6th is kind of things he sees. Americans are very inwardly focused. Most Americans are not interested in another foreign war. So timing wise, I think all these things come together in his view of our weakness, a view of European weakness. Plus, just like Andrea said, you know, Ukraine is moving further away: if not now, when? Putin the man. I think that's something we can talk about more as we go along here. But one of the things I like to focus on when I talk to groups is he's a Chekist. He is a career KGB officer. He's someone who takes pride in the beginning of the Bolshevik state security services that use brutality to keep the regime in power at all costs. And many of the things that we've now seen and focused on since 2016 in terms of disinformation, sabotage and subversion, deception, these things we've seen, these are things that were used by the Soviet security services and actually even the tsarist security services before that. So, he came from a background that tried to use these aggressive, overt tools of intelligence services, of security services to weaken their enemies from inside. And in fact, they use them against their own people, too. And so I think when we look at Putin, we need to think of him, as with his KGB and Soviet background as well. So I think that's that's something we have to always keep in mind. MICHAEL MORELL: So Rose, Andrea and John talked about why this is important to Putin. Why is this important to the United States? There's been a little bit of debate here, right, about whether this should matter or not to us. What's the answer to that question? Why does this matter to the United States and why does this matter to the American people? ROSE GOTTEMOELLER: Before I dive in on that, Mike, I'd like to just comment, because I do feel and I know we'll probably get into this in our discussion, I do feel that we are still seeing some opportunity for diplomacy to make a difference here. And in fact, I see some perhaps growing momentum in that direction. We can have a debate about that, but that implies that Putin is not irrevocably on the path that both Andrea and John have laid out. There is also an aspect of resentment here, I think, and part of what is going on, in my view, is Putin - well, we have Khrushchev all those years ago banging your shoe on the table. This is a this is a 'Look at me' moment for Putin and getting attention. He was seeing, I think, the United States passing Russia by and pivoting to Asia. Well, what has he done in recent times? He's shown us, he's gone off and had a great big summit meeting with Xi in Beijing. So this whole crisis has kept Russia, and it's kept Putin before the global community on the front pages of the newspaper now for a long time. And I think that's part of what is going on here. He is, you know, he is feeding his own resentment in some ways by making sure that he's causing a lot of trouble for a lot of very important people who have, from his perspective, been ignoring him in recent times. So that means I think that there is an opening still for diplomacy, as long as it does involve the kind of pageantry and symmetry that we are seeing, including several Europeans going off to to Moscow this week and a continuing attention from the top leadership in Washington as well. But I think to my mind, it's worth it to keep the possibility of diplomatic progress open. Now why is it important to the United States? The United States, of course, came out of World War II the dominant global figure and global country, the superpower that was able to define the institutions that have governed us internationally since World War II. I think that system is worth preserving and of course, evolving it in the direction that makes it also modern and able to cope with the current situation. But all of those principles for which we stand independence, sovereignty, the ability of nations to continue to develop stable relations with their neighbors without having to be caught in the web of the sphere of influence. I think these so-called sometimes democratic principles are worth fighting for. It's worth the United States and its NATO allies, its allies in Asia, standing up for these principles and the institutions that that group grew up to support them. So to my mind, that is first and foremost why this crisis matters to the United States. It also has to do, of course, again with the China connection, and that Putin and Xi seemed to be marching off in the direction of new rules or no rules. In other words, they are rejecting these post-World War II institutions. They want to remake them in their own image. And I think the United States and its allies has to stand also in defense of the institutions and what they mean in terms of supporting democratic principles. MICHAEL MORELL: Let's get into the debate a little bit, Rose, that you started. I'm wondering if you all think that Putin has made up his mind about how far to push this? And if he's made up his mind about specifically what he wants to do or whether he sees his options as still open and if so, what are those options that he sees? ROSE GOTTEMOELLER: May I just say a word, perhaps mention why I think there may be a bit of a growing momentum in the direction of diplomacy. Putin, in recent times, including in his press conference or a couple of weeks ago, has been talking about that he was going to take the advice of his military, of his military experts. And in just in the last couple days, we've begun seeing emerge retired military people - I've seen two such public media interventions in the last two days one from General Ivashov, who most of us remember is not a particularly nice guy. But the gist of these communications is to say that this is not going to be easy for the Russian army, and invading Ukraine is not a particularly good idea. So, in some ways, the combination of Putin stating quite publicly that he's going to ask his military experts for advice and then this kind of early shaping of the media environment with retired military people kind of warning against the invasion - it's beginning to look to me like Putin is trying to open up space so that he can make a decision to say we should proceed down the path of diplomacy and be magnanimous about it, because of the advice he's receiving from his military experts. So early days yet. But I'm interested to see if my view of this shaping of the media space is going to gain any ground in the coming days. ANDREA KENDALL-TAYLOR: I hope Rose is right, but I am more pessimistic. I think based primarily on what we see happening on the ground, we can see the security situation around Ukraine continues to deteriorate on a daily basis. You know, Putin is clearly the master of optionality. He has created a series of options, and he could certainly take different paths. And Rose is right, maybe there is some opening for more diplomacy here. But I think what I see is that Russia is continuing to build forces on its borders and thinking back to my intelligence community days - if you were setting up a list of indicators that you would expect to see before a major military invasion, I think we're ticking through those indicators pretty quickly and we're, you know, we're on those proximate indicators that you would see before a significant invasion. And so some of the things we're seeing, you know, first and foremost, we're seeing the arrival of large numbers of personnel. And that's important because what Russia has done to this point is to preposition a lot of equipment that they didn't necessarily have the people in on it. And we're seeing Russian soldiers showing up in extremely large numbers. We're seeing the appearance of the Rosgvardia, which is the National Guard, and that signals to me that they, you know, that gives Russia for the capability to hold territory. That's who you send in behind the front lines when you're looking to hold territory. Presumably in eastern Ukraine, we're seeing, you know, in Crimea, the Russian military down there is now on its highest state of readiness. We're seeing the arrival of significant naval assets, including things like amphibious assault ships. Those ships can't stay there forever, right? And they've sailed all the way down from the north through the Mediterranean and now into the Black Sea. They're fully loaded. They're ready to go. You know, I don't know why Putin would go through such an elaborate build up this way to get to this point if he wasn't intending on using all of these assets. We're seeing the arrival of all of the logistical infrastructure communications. We had the report about blood supplies showing up. So all of these kind of enablers, the logistics, all of these things that are kind of proximate indicators. And I'm not a Russian military expert, but in talking to my friends who are, signs that help you distinguish between a military exercise - because by the way, the military exercise starts with Belarus shortly and will continue through the 20th. But signs like, things like gasoline tanks on the back of their tanks that give the tanks extra distance, you don't need those for exercises. And so there's little telltale signs, I think, that I hear to suggest, you know, this isn't just about the exercise with Belarus or other things. They are really positioned for an invasion should they so choose. And I, you know, I unfortunately think kind of that window is narrowing. If Putin wanted to pocket concessions, I feel like the time for that was maybe three or four weeks ago before the West has kind of flooded Ukraine with weapons and other things. So, you know, again, I don't it's hard to know if a decision has been made, but kind of given the sustained build up in the types of things we're seeing. I feel pessimistic and kind of agree with the intelligence community and what Washington is saying that we're pretty much in the window now and over the next two to three weeks, I think invasion is more likely than not. MICHAEL MORELL: John, your view? JOHN SIPHER: It's interesting, this is so hard because, you know, in a Western perspective, what he thinks he's going to gain from this is crazy, like it doesn't seem to make sense, and he looks at this differently than we do. So trying to get into his head is very hard. And frankly, at the end of the day, it's his decision. He is the ultimate decision maker. And then none of us are going to get into his head ahead of time. But I think one thing is the last 10 years has shown us is that he's never going to be satisfied. There's no diplomatic answer or negotiation that's going to make him say, 'Oh, this is good, I'm comfortable and I'm going to sit back in my country and be happy.' He can only be deterred, I believe, like a bully who is going to just keep pushing and pushing. He has to be scared of what deterrents mean. There has to be threats that are credible to him that he thinks going to hurt him. So there's all sorts of things that are important to him. I think he wants the U.S. out of Europe. I think he wants NATO to be weaker, NATO to go away. I think he wants countries on his border to be vassals, to be supportive of Russia, namely Ukraine. But at the end of the day, I think this is about political survival. You know, he is a dictator. He doesn't have a good sense of his people because he doesn't have elections. He doesn't have those things that allow a democratic government to understand and get a feel for how things stand. And so, you know, he has to start looking at - I think the administration's done a good job and the allies have done a good job of trying to put up as many things together to show that there's a price to be paid here. He's going to be a pariah. He's going to be damaged economically. There could be a nasty insurgency in Ukraine. Body bags may find their way back to Russia and cause problems for him. So, you know, as I look at it, you know, there's enough there that would make someone who is conservative and trying to stay in power sort of back away. And one of the things he has going for him here is the thing I mentioned up earlier is he could do this any time. Essentially, he can push us, push us, push us, he can back down. We'll all think it's great. And then a year from now, he can play the same game again. MICHAEL MORELL: Maybe I'll just finish this piece with my own comment here and then ask Rose one final question. There's plenty of times when when I went to the Sit Room with the views of our analysts that something wasn't possible diplomatically, only to have our diplomats actually achieve it. So that's the kind of thing I'll throw on the table. But Rose, do you think diplomatically, do you think there's space for an agreement where the U.S. does not essentially give away Ukraine and Putin doesn't fully back down? Is there space for such an agreement? ROSE GOETTEMOELLER: The other thing that is clear, and in some ways, I agree with how it's been described so far by John and Andrea, he wants to remake the European security architecture in his concept. Now some of the ideas he's put out on the table, I think, are very good ones. The Russians are suffering some regrets for having killed the INF treaty. I believe they're concerned about the advent of new deployments of intermediate-range ground-launched missiles in Europe. And Putin himself put an offer on the table to remove the missiles that we have stated are violations the so-called 9M729 or SSC-8 to remove that missile from Europe and put in place verification measures to ensure it's not there. So, you know, he's put some offers on the table of things that he says Russia would be willing to do.  By the way, that's now been joint - Xi and Putin together agreed that there should be perhaps some constraints on enough missiles in both Europe and Asia. That's probably the most interesting thing that came out of the Beijing summit, from my perspective. So in other words, there's some useful stuff that Putin has been proposing that we should be willing to explore. And as far as I can tell from hearing what our diplomats have to say, we have put a clear message out that we are ready to start negotiating on some of these things. We have issues of principle as well. And it means that we are not going to respond to a demand that there be no further NATO enlargement and no enlargement involving Ukraine. We are not going to move or budge on some of those untenable demands, but there's a whole lot of territory that Putin has staked out himself or his diplomats have staked out that I think we can do some useful work on and indeed some parts of the European security architecture I think not only deserve refurbishment, but they demand refurbishment, such as modernization of the Vienna document confidence-building measures. So yes, there's there is territory that he has staked out himself. He should now take yes for an answer because after some years of hesitancy, NATO itself, as well as the United States, are willing to engage on some of these issues. But the other point I'd like to make here is there has to be reciprocity. Putin cannot direct demands of NATO or demands of the United States and expect us to do the heavy lifting. Of course, it has to be a reciprocal kind of arrangement that would come out. JOHN SIPHER: Can I add something quick? Frankly, I think we would have been glad to negotiate all of these things without this threat, without a threat of war. I mean, these are issues we brought up before, we were glad to talk to Putin about those kinds of things. So I think diplomatically, they all should be there if Putin wants to use that opportunity to back off to move away from this. But I don't think it's the INF or something that will change his mind that, 'This is so great, I'm now comfortable and it's all good.' I think if he chooses to move towards these negotiations, which he could have had anyway, it's just a way to back off for now because he's seen that the price of taking action is too much. MICHAEL MORELL: OK, so if he does decide to invade - so we're beyond the negotiations. Wwe're beyond him successfully orchestrating a coup in Kyiv, right? We're beyond all that and he decides to invade. What will his objectives be? And given those objectives, what will the invasion look like? Who wants to take that first? ANDREA KENDALL-TAYLOR: I'll jump in and try and definitely welcome other ideas. So, you know, my understanding of what he is looking to accomplish is two things one, he wants autonomy for regions in the East, and that's going to require some sort of constitutional change. To get that, you're going to have to topple this one state government or have some sort of kind of commanding military position to force that. And as he has stated over and over again, he wants Ukraine out of NATO. And so I think in order to accomplish those maximalist objectives, it will require a significant land invasion that would likely look to kind of encircle Kyiv. And then the question becomes, once his troops are in that kind of commanding position, the question to Kyiv and to the West is, What do you want to negotiate now? And so I think I've seen kind of coming out of the congressional briefing that got read out from last week that I see a kind of warning about a pincer movement where they really can come around from three sides. They've got the attack from the north and from the east and obviously from the south through bases through Crimea. So I think to me, if he is actually looking to accomplish that most maximalist objective, that is likely what it would be. MICHAEL MORELL: John, do you agree with that and does he hold that territory? Or does he change the government in Kyiv and leave? MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, that's a good one. I mean, I think the one thing we can probably guess is it's not going to look like what we think it'll look like. You know, he, again, he's always trying to use these, you know, sabotage and all these other different ways of doing things and trying to sort of keep his enemies off balance. I don't think - again, this is Western thinking, though - of course, I don't think he wants to invade and hold that country because then he risks again body bags. He risks a long term insurgency. He risks the kind of things that we faced in Afghanistan. But I do think he can achieve a lot of goals if he chooses to go in by essentially destroying the military, making the government unstable, maybe having a government fall and even pulling out very quickly because I think is then weakened Ukraine and any future Ukrainian government has to think this could happen again. And so I think he can achieve his goals without having to occupy the country. And I just want to add one thing here is that I think we in the West and especially United States are a little too cavalier about this. I think we're sort of foolish if we think there can be a major war in Europe, a bloody war with huge refugee flows and these type of things without NATO, the U.S., others somehow getting involved in this. I mean, in 1950 in Korea, we said Korea wasn't part of our zone of interest; we wouldn't fight. And we found ourselves there for a number of years. I'm not suggesting that's what we're going to do here, but the notion that he's going to go out and it won't really, you know, that NATO's fine, we're all fine. I just find it hard to believe. I think it's going to be uglier and more dangerous than that. ANDREA KENDALL-TAYLOR If I can add one thing before we go to Rose, and I definitely want to hear what she has to say. I mean, I think it's a very low probability scenario, and I agree with John that I don't think he necessarily wants to hold territory like, you know, he just wants to achieve these objectives, increase his leverage in any future negotiations, and then he would be able to withdraw. There is a low-probability scenario in my mind, though, that really haunts me, that sticks in the back, which is, what if he does want to occupy eastern Ukraine? I mean, so you look at the context in which this is happening, you look at what's happening in Belarus, for example. You know, there's 6,000 troops there that they'll surge to about 30,000. I know Putin has kind of promised that those troops would leave after the exercises, but I'm not convinced that's the case. And so he's really managed in the last, you know, since Lukashenko's fraudulent election, where he's been Lukashenko's only lifeline, he has totally eroded Belarussian autonomy and he's not leaving. And so what if he is in this legacy mindset? What if Putin really is looking to increase his control and influence over Belarus? Take all of eastern Ukraine, and now he holds a swath of territory. He's bumped his periphery out significantly, return these historically kind of Slavic heartlands to the Russian territory. Again, I think it's a low probability, but it nags me in the back of my mind and kind of to get back to John's Western thinking - we all think that's outrageous. It is full of risks. Of course it is. But that's the one scenario that really kind of nags me and keeps me up at night. MICHAEL MORELL: Rose, I want to ask you, if he does invade, is there any doubt in your mind that the U.S. would not follow through with the threat of significant sanctions? Do you know? Do you think the UK would join us? ROSE GOTTEMOELLER: Yes. And more than that, I think the NATO countries -- MICHAEL MORELL: And do you think the EU will join us because they didn't join us in 2014? ROSE GOTTEMOELLER: I think the EU is poised to join us. Everything that I am hearing, at least from colleagues in Washington, is that the allies and partners in Europe, including the EU and its organizations, are really standing firm and they are ready to move on some quite significant sanctions actions well beyond anything that was contemplated in 2014. The watchwords are start high and stay high, so they are planning working very closely together to extract some significant - I would say financial penalties, might not extract but impose some significant financial penalties on the Russian Federation. So this is all about deterrence, clearly at the moment, but I think I do see really much more significant cohesion with the European countries than I have seen in the past. MICHAEL MORELL: And the impact of those sanctions on the Russian economy. How serious do you think those would be?\u00a0 ROSE GOTTEMOELLER: From what I hear, they are going after the banking system, so there will be very significant, very significant impacts on the Russian economy. MICHAEL MORELL: And then what do we expect Putin's response to those sanctions to be? What's his next step? ROSE GOTTEMOELLER: Of course, there will be some retaliation. No doubt in those areas where Putin can retaliate, the energy sector is front and center there. But there are other areas, too. You have to remember that titanium production, for example, is very much front and center as part of how the Russian Federation earns its keep these days. So there are critical minerals that are important to Western economies as well. So there's definitely going to be some pain on the western side of the equation, but the focus is on trying to think ahead about ways to mitigate that pain. Now, really understanding that there will be retaliation from Putin's Russia - if I may just add one point on the previous exchange about how the invasion could unfold. I don't want to leave the discussion without flagging hybrid methods as well, because I think, of course, day in, day out, we're always at NATO, always at a level of hybrid activity that is, as we think about it, neither peace nor war, but really bent on causing serious mischief in NATO's cyber networks and elsewhere so that I can definitely see ramping up as a prelude to military invasion. But it is an area that I think we are neglecting really to think about how those, the kinetic and the hybrid will fit together. And I think that's going to be an important part of how we foresee such an invasion as well. MICHAEL MORELL: John and Andrea, your thoughts on Putin's pushback against sanctions. ANDREA KENDALL-TAYLOR: I agree with Rose. You know, he's got the oil weapon, you know, one of the skills he's had as a Chekist, as a former intelligence officer, this hybrid war where he's weaponized social media and he's weaponized corruption, he's weaponized financial networks, he's weaponized all these type of things against us. We're going to see a lot of that. We're going to see cyber attacks. We're going to see, you know, trying to disrupt and cause trouble around the world, supporting violent groups and all these type of things. Frankly, a lot of them, sort of like our ability to threaten that we're going to do sanctions, He's seen it before these kind of attacks we've seen before, it's just going to be ramped up. And so it's serious. But you know, nonetheless, we have to make sure that the pain is larger for him to try to deter him here. JOHN SIPHER: Andrea, I agree with that. And also one more point on the sanctions, though the other thing Rose is right I think the focus is going to be the financial institutions and that will have kind of immediate economic pain for the Russians and hearing people talk about, you know, if our last set of sanctions, I think estimates say about to cost Russia about two to three percent of their GDP, that is what they're talking about. This time will be far and away above above that kind of financial economic impact. But the second piece that they're also putting on the table is this export controls discussion. And by that, you know, they will go after things like semiconductors, going after sectors of the Russian economy that drive growth and then that feed the defense budget and the aggression abroad. So they're looking to have immediate impact, but there is going to be a longer term impact and they are going to go after and squeeze these sectors of the economy going after things that Putin cares about dearly, like by making it harder for the regime to innovate, that'll hurt the defense industrial complex. So it's both immediate impact, but there's going to be long-term costs as well. So that's important. I think the key is, yes, start high, stay high. The goal is going to be to make sure it's extremely painful for Putin, but to try to avoid some sort of escalatory spiral that we get caught into because obviously gas supplies are the immediate lever that Putin can pull. But I am also really worried about cyber. And so if we really do go after Russian banks, might they wield cyber tools to go after our banks? And so we're going to that. There is that needle to thread where it has to be painful. But how do we also prevent this kind of this escalatory spiral? MICHAEL MORELL: And that's exactly the question I wanted to ask. One of the things the White House leaked, you know, for deterrence effect was the fact that that CIA would be in a position to train Ukrainians to fight Russians. And I ask that not to ask whether that's possible or not or whether we will do that or not. I ask it in the context of, is there a scenario you worry about with regard to escalation. Rose? ROSE GOTTEMOELLER: Well, taking us back to my concern about the hybrid space, I think, frankly, here it is difficult to know. And there's been some concern in my mind that if the attacks do start in that hybrid space, then there is the possibility of some escalatory pressures. But there's also the possibility that we won't take sufficient deterrent action in that space. Time and again, it's difficult to judge the direction of attack. The focus of the attack. The extent of the attack and attribute from whence came the attack. So it worries me that - not so much that that we will get into an escalatory spiral in that space, but that we will be insufficiently able to deter. Asking about now, well, how do you deter in cyberspace? OK, well, maybe we start to apply a few economic levers there. And that's the hard question from my perspective. I do worry, and I have to say, I think NATO's been doing some really hard thinking about this. I do worry about spillover also. And John mentioned the possibility of - perhaps, I'm sorry, Andrea, it was you as well - that there would be implications, serious implications for data from any Russian attack on Ukraine, kinetic or otherwise. And so I think that that is something that worries me very much as well. MICHAEL MORELL: John. JOHN SIPHER: Yeah, Russians have always been very good in the past of, you know, when we tried to push back, they've often pushed back very quickly, so hard. And Michael, you've seen this on Russian expulsions of diplomats and our expulsion of intelligence officers after there's been a large espionage case or something. For example, when we arrested Robert Hanssen, the FBI special agent was spying for the Russians, we wanted to punish the Russians by kicking out a bunch of intelligence officers. Well, the next day, the Russians kicked out, you know, more Americans, and we kicked out Russians, and then we backed down because oftentimes we don't hold together, even internally in the US government, certainly amongst allies. When the Russians, they're serious, we've often sort of backed away. In this case we can't do that. If we feel pain from the Russians, if we back off, Putin's just going to see that as weakness and continue to push for more and more of what he wants here. One of the reasons I think we are seeing some of this leaking of intelligence and these types of things where the administration has sort of leaked it, that we have insight into some of the stuff they're trying to do, to do a false flag attack or do these kind of things, I think it's part of the deterrence factor that - showing them that we have real insight into what's going on in the Kremlin in there and that he ought to take that into his calculus, that we may be better poised than he thinks we are. ROSE GOTTEMOELLER: I just want to fully agree with John. I am quite impressed with some of this rollout of intelligence, which I think has in this, this interim period, while we're waiting for Godot or whatever we're waiting for at this moment - we fear an invasion, of course. But the deterrent effect of these kinds of roll-out of intelligence, I think is very, very important at this moment. I'd be interested actually, Andrea, from your experience, and Mike and John, what you would have to say about that. But I think it's an important use of this tool. ANDREA KENDALL-TAYLOR: Yeah, just on the deterrent piece, I mean, the other deterrent we haven't talked about, so it's obviously sanctions, export controls, Rose is talking about our kind of intentional leaking to take away that pretext of surprise, which I think has been quite effective, as Rose said. But the other thing we're doing is putting forces into the region, right, to strengthen the eastern flank just for the reason that Rose said, because of the potential of spillover. I think that was a really welcome sign from the administration to try to start taking steps to reinforce the eastern flank. I think it serves two functions, one, I think it is a deterrent. And alongside sanctions, we've clearly communicated to Putin that if he invades Ukraine, we will increase our force posture in Europe. And I actually think that's the more deterring step rather than sanctions. It's basically telling Putin, 'You do this action, you invade Ukraine, you might get a small win in Ukraine, but you're going to entirely change the security picture that you're facing in ways that Russia won't like.' And so I think any we've heard the administration kind of communicate that when they put these forces in Romania and Poland, that that was a down payment on what would be to come if he does invade. So I think from a deterrent perspective, that was also a really welcome step. It's a welcome step from the kind of preparedness perspective to try to be ready to manage any potential spillover, so that that's another, I think, was a strong move from the administration that maybe could have come sooner. But better late than never. JOHN SIPHER: Just one quick piece, Michael, here, is Putin for the last actually in his entire term in office has been claiming that the United States and the CIA and the State Department, rather than interfering inside Russia, that we've been causing - You know, he's been blaming his economic problems on the CIA and others are causing problems inside that we're supporting opposition groups. He's jailing people because he says they're Western agents and sources. He knows that's not true. You guys know that's not true. We have not tried to do those things to Mr. Putin. But, you know, we can. And so I think one of the big deterrent factors that could be here - and I don't know how you would message to somebody like Putin is to say, \"We're going to change the way we do this. We've tried to accommodate you. It's not going to work. You're a KGB officer. You understand the Cold War, you've been pushing it for your entire term.\" \"We're able to also support opposition inside. Countries were also able to do these kind of things, cyber attacks. And then, you know, we're able to take your money away and steal it and do all those kind of things that you claim we're doing. We can do those. And if you want to play this game hard, we do have the capability to do it. And you know we haven't done it so far, but, you know we can.\" MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So maybe that's going to be your answer to the next question - we're going to do one more Round Robin and then we're going to go to audience Q&A. And my last question is, if you could give President Biden one piece of advice going forward here, what would it be? Let's start with Rose. ROSE GOTTEMOELLER: It goes back to the remarks I made earlier about Putin wanting the global attention and the high-level attention, and actually President Biden's been good at this. He was willing to meet with Putin in Geneva back in June, and that has gotten us started on a couple of worthwhile tracks, such as dealing with these ransomware attacks. I actually agree with comments that were made earlier. If you know Ukraine is invaded, then all bets are off in terms of trying to make any progress with Russia on our bilateral issues. But I think there has been some success in my own arena of a strategic stability dialogue. I like the way they have been able to get off the ground with some worthwhile discussions through the fall. But again, all bets are going to be off. But I only say that to point out that Biden's been willing to have his contacts with President Putin, to speak with him on the phone, to meet with him when it's worthwhile. And I think that would be my advice to keep that channel open because we're going to need to have channels of communication open no matter how bad it gets. ANDREA KENDALL-TAYLOR: Yeah, that's a great one. I mean, I agree with Rose that the diplomacy to keep the channels of communication open is a really important one. And to do that as long as humanly possible, to continue to explore these options to find alternatives that might avert crisis. So that's definitely a piece of it, which I think we see the Biden administration doing quite clearly. And I mean, I guess it's I don't know if it's good advice because I think they're already doing it, which is kind of preparing also to buckle down for what's going to be a long confrontation with Russia. And I think that's going to be true no matter what happens in Ukraine, actually. You know, even if this is kind of a long slog and they maintain this force posture on the border and start grinding down Ukraine's economy and grinding down our nerves, I mean, I see this as a really important turning point in U.S.-Russian relations. This administration came in wanting to pursue a stable and predictable relationship with Russia that was prudent at the beginning. But when they built a force posture in April, that was a pretty clear signal that Putin wasn't interested in that kind of relationship. So regardless of what happens, if we do find a diplomatic path out of this or if it's a full invasion, I think we need to entirely shift and rethink what the U.S. and European approach to Russia is going to be. Because I think, you know, this to me is a signal that we're going to be in for a long, hard slog with President Putin. He's more brazen, he's more aggressive. He's willing to use his military. That's the lesson that he's learned. You learn that you use your military, you get the United States and Europe to the table to have the discussions that you want. So I think I guess for me, I may be thinking slightly past this most immediate crisis, but we've got to rethink entirely what our U.S. and European policy approaches to Russia. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. John. JOHN SIPHER: I remember I was working in CIA's Russia House and there was sort of a worldwide operational thing when 9/11 happened, and I can remember talking to our head of the clandestine service saying, 'Hey, there's a lot of things that Russians are up to here, a lot of espionage, a lot of sort of covert attacks and things, you know, now there's going to be so much focus on terrorism. We're going to lose a lot of sort of support here.' And I remember him saying, 'Don't worry, Putin will always come around and do something to force us to pay attention to them.' And it's exactly what we're seeing here. So I think, just like Andrea said, the administration wanted to focus on China. The previous two administrations wanted to move towards Asia, all these type of things. Putin is almost like Kim in North Korea. He is going to make himself relevant. He's going to use, you know, attacks and other things to make us pay attention to him. So we're going to have to continue to invest in Europe. We're going to have to try to tighten up our banking and other sectors so that this elite capture where he uses dirty money in London and in other states to try to get people and all of these sort of sabotage subversion tools against us is - you know, we can't give it up. So we're going to have to continue to focus on it. And I guess the thing I'd said to you before: I think you can't be tough enough with Putin. And I think threatening him with the kind of covert stuff that he does to us is something we should consider. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah.

            "article_content": "Gaza City, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel said Sunday that it killed a senior Islamic Jihad commander in a crowded Gaza refugee camp, the second such targeted attack since it launched its high-stakes military offensive against the militant group just before the weekend. The Iran-backed militant group has fired hundreds of rockets at Israel in response, and the risk of the cross-border fighting turning into a full-fledged war remained high.  Gaza's ruling Hamas group, which fought an 11-day war with Israel in May 2021, appeared to stay on the sidelines for now, possibly because it fears Israeli reprisals and undoing economic understandings with Israel, including Israeli work permits for thousands of Gaza residents, that bolster its control. The Islamic Jihad commander, Khaled Mansour, was killed in an airstrike on an apartment building in the Rafah refugee camp in southern Gaza late Saturday.  Two other militants and five civilians were also killed in the attack, bringing the Palestinian death toll to 31 since the start of the Israeli offensive on Friday. Among the dead were six children and four women. The Palestinian Health Ministry said more than 250 people were wounded since Friday.  Israel says some of the deaths were caused by errant rocket fire, including one incident in the Jebaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza in which six Palestinians were killed Saturday. On Sunday, a projectile hit a home in the same area of Jebaliya, killing two men. Palestinians held Israel responsible, while Israel said it was investigating whether the area was hit by an errant rocket. Mansour, the Islamic Jihad commander for southern Gaza, was in the apartment of a member of the group when the missile struck, flattening the three-story building and badly damaging nearby houses. \"Suddenly, without warning, the house next to us was bombed and everything became black and dusty with smoke in the blink of an eye,\" said Wissam Jouda, who lives next to the targeted building. Ahmed al-Qaissi, another neighbor, said his wife and son were among the wounded, suffering shrapnel injuries. To make way for rescue workers, al-Qaissi agreed to have part of his house demolished. As a funeral for Mansour began in the Gaza Strip on Sunday afternoon, the Israeli military said it was striking suspected \"Islamic Jihad rocket launch posts.\" Smoke could be seen from the strikes as thumps from their explosions rattled Gaza. Israeli airstrikes and rocket fire followed again a few hours later as sirens wailed in central Israel.  The Rafah strike was the deadliest so far in the current round of fighting, which was initiated by Israel on Friday with the targeted killing of Islamic Jihad's commander for northern Gaza. Israel has said it took action against the militant group because of concrete threats of an imminent attack, but has not provided details. Caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid, who is an experienced diplomat but untested in overseeing a war, unleashed the offensive less than three months before a general election in which he is campaigning to keep the job. In a statement Sunday, Lapid said the military would continue to strike targets in Gaza \"in a pinpoint and responsible way in order to reduce to a minimum the harm to noncombatants.\" Lapid said the strike that killed Mansour was \"an extraordinary achievement.\" \"The operation will continue as long as necessary,\" Lapid said. Israel estimates its airstrikes have killed about 15 militants.  Islamic Jihad has fewer fighters and supporters than Hamas, and little is known about its weapons arsenal. Both groups call for Israel's destruction, but have different priorities, with Hamas constrained by the demands of governing. The Israeli army said militants in Gaza fired some 580 rockets toward Israel. The army said its air defenses had intercepted many of them, with two of those shot down being fired toward Jerusalem. Islamic Jihad has fewer fighters and supporters than Hamas. Air raid sirens sounded in the Jerusalem area for the first time Sunday since last year's Israel-Hamas war.  Jerusalem is typically a flash point during periods of cross-border fighting between Israel and Gaza. On Sunday, hundreds of Jews, including firebrand ultra-nationalist lawmaker Itamar Ben Gvir, visited a sensitive holy site in Jerusalem, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. The visit, under heavy police protection, ended without incident, police said. Such demonstrative visits by Israeli hard-liners seeking to underscore Israeli claims of sovereignty over contested Jerusalem have sparked violence in the past. The holy site sits on the fault line of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is central to rival narratives of Palestinians and Israeli Jews. In Palestinian cities and towns in the West Bank, Israeli security forces said they detained 19 people on suspicion of belonging to the Islamic Jihad during overnight raids.  The fighting began with Israel's killing of a senior Islamic Jihad commander in a wave of strikes Friday that Israel said were meant to prevent an imminent attack. By Sunday, Hamas still appeared to stay out of the battle. The group has a strong incentive to avoid another war. Last year's Israel-Hamas war, one of four major conflicts and several smaller battles over the last 15 years, exacted a staggering toll on the impoverished territory's 2.3 million Palestinian residents. Since the last war, Israel and Hamas have reached tacit understandings based on trading calm for work permits and a slight easing of the border blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt when Hamas overran the territory 15 years ago. Israel has issued 12,000 work permits to Gaza laborers, and has held out the prospect of granting another 2,000 permits.  The lone power plant in Gaza ground to a halt at noon Saturday due to a lack of fuel. Israel has kept its crossing points into Gaza closed since Tuesday. With the new disruption, Gazans can use only four hours of electricity a day, increasing their reliance on private generators and deepening the territory's chronic power crisis amid peak summer heat.",

            "article_content": "\u00a0A cease-fire between Israel and Palestinian militants took effect late Sunday in a bid to end nearly three days of violence that killed dozens of Palestinians and disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Israelis. The flare-up was the worst fighting between Israel and Gaza militant groups since Israel and Hamas fought an 11-day war last year, and adds to the destruction and misery that have plagued blockaded Gaza for years. The Egyptian-brokered cease-fire took effect at 11:30 p.m. (2030 GMT; 4:30 p.m. ET). Israeli strikes and militant rockets continued in the minutes leading up to the beginning of the truce, and Israel said it would \"respond strongly\" if the cease-fire was violated. Israeli aircraft have pummeled targets in Gaza since Friday, while the Iran-backed Palestinian Jihad militant group has fired hundreds of rockets at Israel in response. The risk of the cross-border fighting turning into a full-fledged war remained as long as no truce was reached. Israel says some of the dead were killed by misfired rockets. Gaza's ruling Hamas group remained on the sidelines, possibly because it fears Israeli reprisals and undoing economic understandings with Israel, including Israeli work permits for thousands of Gaza residents, that bolster its control. Israel launched its operation with a strike Friday on a leader of the Islamic Jihad, and followed up on Saturday with another targeted strike on a second prominent leader. The second Islamic Jihad commander, Khaled Mansour, was killed in an airstrike on an apartment building in the Rafah refugee camp in southern Gaza late Saturday, which also killed two other militants and five civilians. Mansour, the Islamic Jihad commander for southern Gaza, was in the apartment of a member of the group when the missile struck, flattening the three-story building and badly damaging nearby houses. \"Suddenly, without warning, the house next to us was bombed and everything became black and dusty with smoke in the blink of an eye,\" said Wissam Jouda, who lives next to the targeted building.

Israeli airstrikes and rocket fire followed for hours as sirens wailed in central Israel. As the sunset call to prayer sounded in Gaza, sirens wailed as far north as Tel Aviv. Israel says some of the deaths during this round were caused by errant rocket fire, including one incident in the Jebaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza in which six Palestinians were killed Saturday. On Sunday, a projectile hit a home in the same area of Jebaliya, killing two men. Palestinians held Israel responsible, while Israel said it was investigating whether the area was struck by an errant rocket. Israel's Defense Ministry said mortars fired from Gaza hit the Erez border crossing into Israel, used by thousands of Gazans daily. The mortars damaged the roof and shrapnel hit the hall's entrance, the ministry said. The crossing has been closed amid the fighting. The Rafah strike was the deadliest so far in the current round of fighting, which was initiated by Israel on Friday with the targeted killing of Islamic Jihad's commander for northern Gaza. Israel said it took action against the militant group because of concrete threats of an imminent attack, but has not provided details.

The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Monday on the violence. China, which holds the council presidency this month, scheduled the session in response to a request from the United Arab Emirates, which represents Arab nations on the council, as well as China, France, Ireland and Norway.

            "article_content": "During a visit to the Israeli-occupied West Bank on Friday, President Joe Biden offered compassion and financial assistance for hope-starved Palestinians but also delivered a blunt assessment that the \"ground is not ripe\" for new attempts to reach an elusive peace.  Political uncertainty in Israel, which will be holding another round of elections in November, and the weakness of Palestinian Authority leadership has dimmed any chance of restarting negotiations that broke down more than a decade ago.  The stalemate has left millions of Palestinians living under Israeli military rule. Mr. Biden said they \"deserve a state of their own that's independent, sovereign, viable and contiguous. Two states for two peoples, both of whom have deep and ancient roots in this land, living side by side in peace and security.\" Although such a goal \"can seem so far away,\" he said he wouldn't abandon the dormant peace process. \"Even if the ground is not ripe at this moment to restart negotiations, the United States and my administration will not give up on bringing the Palestinians and the Israelis, both sides, closer together,\" Mr. Biden said during a joint appearance with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. The president offered more than $300 million for the Palestinians on Friday, including $201 million for a United Nations agency that helps refugees and a proposed $100 million for hospitals. The health care funding requires congressional approval.  Israel has also committed to upgrading wireless networks in the West Bank and Gaza, part of a broader effort to improve economic conditions. However, Biden did not criticize Israel for expanding settlements, some of which resemble sprawling suburbs, in occupied territory that the Palestinians want for a future state. Nor did he mention his unfulfilled pledge to reopen a U.S. consulate in east Jerusalem, which served as a de facto embassy to the Palestinians before President Donald Trump closed it three years ago.  Abbas, in his own remarks, said \"the key to peace\" in the region \"begins with ending the Israeli occupation of our land,\" and he said Israel \"cannot continue to act as a state above law.\"  He also raised the death of Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, saying her killers \"need to be held accountable.\" Abu Akleh was shot during an Israeli military raid in the West Bank in May, and U.S. officials say she was likely killed unintentionally by Israeli troops. But they did not say how they reached that conclusion, and the outcome angered many Palestinians, including her family, who accuse the U.S. of trying to help Israel evade responsibility.  Mr. Biden said the U.S. \"will continue to insist on a full and transparent accounting of her death and will continue to stand up for media freedom everywhere in the world.\" He called her death \"an enormous loss to the essential work of sharing with the world the story of the Palestinian people.\" Palestinian journalists wore black T-shirts with Abu Akleh's picture and placed a poster of her on an empty chair in the room where the leaders spoke.  The president's trip to the West Bank was met with skepticism and bitterness among Palestinians who believe he has taken too few steps toward reviving peace talks, especially after Trump sidelined them while heavily favoring Israel.  Israel's outgoing government has taken steps to improve economic conditions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza. But Yair Lapid, the 58-year-old caretaker prime minister, has no mandate to hold negotiations. Nov. 1 elections could also bring to power a right-wing government that is opposed to Palestinian statehood. Meanwhile, the 86-year-old Abbas, whose Palestinian Authority administers parts of the occupied West Bank and cooperates with Israel on security, is more representative of the status quo than Palestinian aspirations. His Fatah party lost an election, and control of Gaza, to the Islamic militant group Hamas more than 15 years ago. He called off the first national elections since then last year \u2014 blaming Israel \u2014 when Fatah appeared to be heading for another crushing defeat. Polls over the past year have consistently found that nearly 80% of Palestinians want him to resign. On Friday, Hamas criticized Abbas for meeting with Biden, calling the U.S. \"a partner in the aggression on our people.\" Palestinian leaders fear being further undermined by the Abraham Accords, a diplomatic vehicle for Arab nations to normalize relations with Israel despite the ongoing occupation. Mr. Biden, who arrived in Saudi Arabia later Friday to attend a summit of Arab leaders, hopes to broaden that process, which began under Trump. Hours before Mr. Biden was set to become the first U.S. leader to fly directly from Israel to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the kingdom's General Authority of Civil Aviation signaled the end of its strict limits on Israeli flights over its territory. Biden called the decision \"an important step towards building a more integrated and stable Middle East region.\" But this wasn't the first presidential flight directly between Israel and the kingdom. President George W. Bush flew from Tel Aviv directly to Riyadh in 2008, and President Donald Trump flew from Saudi Arabia directly to Israel in 2017, but the White House nevertheless called it \"historic.\" During his appearance with Abbas, Mr. Biden said he hopes that the Abraham Accords could ultimately benefit the Palestinians as well. \"I do believe that in this moment when Israel is improving relations with its neighbors throughout the region, we can harness that same momentum to reinvigorate the peace process between the Palestinian people and the Israelis,\" he said. However, apart from his visit to the West Bank, there was little mention of the Palestinians during the two days the president spent in Israel, which he praised as a democracy that shares American values. At a news conference with Mr. Biden, Lapid evoked the U.S. civil rights movement to portray Israel as a bastion of freedom. This seemed hypocritical to Palestinians, who have endured 55 years of military occupation with no end in sight. \"The idea of shared values actually makes me sick to my stomach,\" said Diana Buttu, a Palestinian lawyer and political analyst. \"I don't think Israeli values are anything that people should be striving towards.\" Both Mr. Biden and Lapid said they support an eventual two-state solution but their approach, often referred to as \"economic peace\" because of its focus on financial assistance and business development, has limitations. \"Mr. Biden is trying to marginalize the Palestinian issue,\" said Mustafa Barghouti, a veteran Palestinian activist. \"If he does not allow Palestinians to have their rights, then he is helping Israel kill and end the very last possibility of peace.\" Roughly 700,000 Jewish settlers now live on annexed land in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, which were seized in the Six Day War in 1967. Most of the world considers the expanding settlements illegal.  Well-known human rights groups have concluded that Israel's seemingly permanent control over millions of Palestinians amounts to apartheid. One of those groups, Israel's own B'Tselem, hung banners in the West Bank that were visible from the presidential motorcade.  Israel rejects that label as an attack on its very existence, even though two former Israeli prime ministers warned years ago that their country would be seen that way if it did not reach a two-state agreement with the Palestinians. The U.S. also rejects the apartheid allegations.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with GOP Senator Marco Rubio of Florida that aired Sunday, February 6, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. There is an overwhelming amount of news this morning, especially on the international front, but we want to start with two extraordinary developments that threaten to further divide the Republican Party and impact our democracy. Late Friday, Republican National Committee members voted to censure Representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger for their work on the committee investigating the attack on the Capitol and the attempt to overturn election results, saying the two were part of a quote, \"Democrat led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.\" The former Vice President, Mike Pence, rebuked President Trump's insistence that Pence could have rejected the Electoral College results on January 6th. VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE: I had no right to overturn the election. The presidency belongs to the American people and the American people alone. And frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president. Under the Constitution, I had no right to change the outcome of our election. MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin with Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio. He is in Miami. Senator, we invited you to come on the show to talk about China. I want to get there, but I have to start here. Do you agree with Mike Pence? SENATOR MARCO RUBIO: Well, if President Trump runs for re-election, I believe he would defeat Joe Biden, and I don't want Kamala Harris to have the power as vice president to overturn that election, and I don't- that's the same thing that I concluded back in January of 2021. You know, when that issue was raised, I looked at it, had analyzed it and came to the same conclusion that vice presidents can't simply decide not to certify an election. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So Donald Trump was wrong?\u00a0 SEN. MARCO RUBIO: Well, as I said, I just don't think a vice president has that power because if the vice president has that power, Donald Trump would defeat Joe Biden in four years or two years, and then Kamala Harris can decide not- to overturn the election. I don't want to wind up there. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. So yes, so this appears a turning point for the party, though. Does the RNC speak for you when it says that this is a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse. Was January 6th legitimate political discourse? SEN. RUBIO: Well, anybody who committed crimes on January 6th should be prosecuted. If you entered the Capitol and you committed acts of violence and you were there to hurt people, you should be prosecuted and they are being prosecuted. But the January 6th commission is not the place to do this. That's what prosecutors are supposed to do. This commission is a partisan scam. They're going after- they're- the purpose of that commission is to try to embarrass and smear and and harass as many Republicans as-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what you believe-- SEN. RUBIO: --they can get their hands on. MARGARET BRENNAN: --your two Republican colleagues are doing? Liz Cheney--\u00a0 SEN. RUBIO: Well I believe-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --and Adam Kinzinger? SEN RUBIO: --that's what the commission is doing. Well, let me tell you, I know that's what the commission is doing because they're focused well beyond January 6th. There are people, for example, like in an older member of the RNC whose husband just died and she wasn't even in Washington on January 6th-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's not what the censure said.\u00a0 SEN RUBIO: But she signed some papers. No, but well, I'm sure it is because that's what- she- she- she wasn't even in Washington on January 6th. She can't afford to lawyer up, and she's being harassed by this commission. This commission is nothing but a partisan tool designed to go out and smear and attack and get their hands on as many people as they can, including people that weren't in Washington on January 6th. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, sounds like you say they do speak for you. Let's get to China. SEN. RUBIO: Well, no I told you where I stand on that commission. I think that commission is a scam. I think it's a complete partisan scam. And I think anyone who committed a crime on January 6th should be prosecuted and if convicted, put in jail. I do not believe that we need a congressional committee to harass Americans that weren't even in Washington on January 6th, that were not in favor of what happened on that day, have condemned what happened on that day, but they want to smear them anyway. I'm against that, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sources tell CBS News that Vladimir Putin has assembled about 70% of the forces that he would need for a full invasion of Ukraine. He could take the capital within just two days. As many as five million refugees would be driven into surrounding countries. He could do all this within 10 to 15 days of where we are right now. What impact do you see this happening having on the United States? SEN. RUBIO: Well, the impact would begin by destabilizing Europe. This is the single greatest threat Europe has faced since the 1940s and- and as you've pointed out, the refugee surge would be one. But I think it would have a global impact because we're now all of a sudden once again living in a world in which countries and leaders can decide that something belongs to them and they go in and take it by force. And there are plenty of- multiple countries in Europe that have complaints about treaties that were signed over 100 years ago in some cases. We know how China claims- its claims on Taiwan. It has territorial disputes with India on its borders. So if we now live in a world where you can just go in and take a country because you claim it or parts of it belong to you and you can do so militarily, well, we've entered a very dangerous period in human history once again. So I think it has enormous consequences if- if and when that happens. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden has made clear he won't use US combat troops. He will use sanctions, financial warfare. Given how Xi Jinping, the president of China, embraced Russia's President Vladimir Putin just in the past few days. Do you see this as a way that these two countries can just blunt the impact of U.S. sanctions? SEN. RUBIO: Well, there are two things here. The first is there is no- I want it to be clear, there is no U.S. combat role in Ukraine. There isn't going to be one. I don't know of anyone who supports it, not even the Ukrainians. That said, I think that Vladimir Putin has to pay a high price if he does this, not just for him to pay the price, but for other countries to see the high price of doing that kind of thing and other leaders. And I think that price should be A., his economy should be crippled and hurt badly. That will require unity not just from the Europeans, but other countries around the world, but beginning with the Europeans. If they're not going to impose those sanctions and stick with them, then that- then- over- over time, he will be able to blunt it. But the other thing that's going to happen is the easiest part for him is going to be the invasion. The harder part is going to be the occupation. Ukrainians are not going to welcome him with roses. He's going to have to explain to Russian mothers why their sons keep coming home injured, killed and maimed from this occupation of- any country on Earth knows how painful and difficult it is to occupy a country that doesn't want you there for a substantial period of time- It should be us with our experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan. I think that he'll pay a tremendous price that way as well. And- and so those are the two things that I think need to happen if in fact, he moves forward with this, as I believe personally, I hope I'm wrong. I really do. I hope I'm wrong. But I truly believe that he has decided that he wants Ukraine to be neutral. He's going to impose neutrality. He'll either get it through a signed agreement or he'll impose it militarily. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and as I mentioned, this alliance between Russia and China seems to be building. On China itself, more than one million Muslim- mostly Muslim minorities, are in detention camps in China. According to the State Department, they're subject to forced sterilization, abortions, rape, torture, forced labor, restrictions on prayer, restrictions on movement. I know you've been working to try to restrict imports made by forced labor inside these camps. But is it really possible to clean up the supply chain because China is such an economic behemoth here? SEN. RUBIO: Well, a couple of things that we need to do, the first is we need to do this no matter what, because this country has to be a country that makes things again. If we've learned anything over the last couple of years is that you have to have a manufacturing and industrial capability and you can't be dependent on foreign supply chains entirely, especially those located in a place like China because of a pandemic, a war or out of leverage against us. You could be cut off and create an economic crisis. But the second is we've passed that bill. We passed a bill that says if something is made in a factory in that part of China, we are going to presume it's made by slave labor and not allow it into the country unless companies can prove that that's not the case. So I think that will obviously address some of it, but ultimately the best thing we can do not just to not have supply chain disruptions, but also not to be so dependent on China, is to reindustrialize America, which was a terrible mistake when we sort of thought that we could be a great power and not be an industrial power. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which companies are the worst abusers on this front? SEN. RUBIO: Well, it's interesting, you ask. Obviously, I think there are many American companies like Nike and others that have definitely benefited from the supply chain that's located in that part of the world. And- and the list could be even more extensive than that because there are people that are buying from subcontractors. Many of them know they're sourcing material from that area. But- but they have continued or continue to allow it to happen. And so we saw the lobbying efforts of Apple, of Nike and others- and others just representative chambers arguing that this would raise the costs for consumers. But ultimately, it's slave labor.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. RUBIO: And- and it's a horrific genocide. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and Tesla just opened a showroom in the province where these camps are located. I mean, American businesses still seem to be more than willing to try to tap the Chinese market. SEN. RUBIO: Well, it's one of the largest markets, the second largest market in the world and in some industries, the largest. I understand the profit motive behind it. And that's fine. But- but I understand that with their view of it, that's- that's their agenda. But our agenda has to be the national interest of the United States, not to mention what's right or wrong in the- in the world. And ultimately, it's important for policy leaders to push back and say, look, we want American companies to be prosperous and do well, but not in ways that undermine American national security interests, which in the case of China, they are. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening on US soil. The FBI Director Chris Wray gave a pretty extraordinary speech last week, saying China and its threat here in the United States is greater than it's ever been before. He said China is actually targeting people inside the US. Listen to this. FBI DIRECTOR CHRIS WRAY: We're seeing the Chinese government resort to blackmail, threats of violence, stalking and kidnappings. They've actually engaged criminal organizations in the U.S., offering them bounties in hopes of successfully taking targets back to China. MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you combat that kind of espionage on US soil without the United States itself becoming a surveillance state? SEN. RUBIO: Well, it's difficult, it's not easy, and it's a new threat that we face. But what he's pointing to, there is the example of a Uyghur. Let's say there's a Uyghur in the United States who's involved in speaking out against those abuses that are going on in China. They are trying to lure those people to come back to China. And the way they do it is they threaten their family over there, but they might even align themselves with some sort of a triad group or some street gang of that nature in order to go and personally try to intimidate these people. They have sent people to this country to do that sort of thing as well to harass and intimidate. Whether it's the Uyghur issue or general political topics as well. If you're speaking out against China and you're a Chinese national or former Chinese national, you have families back over there, they try to harass you through your family over there. And increasingly directly here. And so I think the first step is to sort of reveal it and call it out and do it what the director just did. I think the second step is to expel these people. Once we've identified that some agent of influence from China is on US soil going after people living in this country and trying to intimidate them, those people should be immediately expelled from the country, even if they're here under diplomatic cover or, in many cases, they're here under business cover, MARGARET BRENNAN: But is enough being done on this front? SEN. RUBIO: Well, I think there's now a growing awareness on this. This is a new thing that's emerged over the last few years that they've become more and more aggressive about it. So it remains to be seen. I mean, we've got to do more and I think more needs to be done at the local level. Look, if you go into a local police department in this country and you tell them there's a Chinese agent operating in your community, that's something they've never dealt with before. In some places, there's a little bit of hesitancy simply because they've never heard that and they don't realize what that threat means. So this is something we're going to have to develop the capacity to do. I don't think there's a lack of willingness to address it. I just think it's something that we don't have a lot of experience addressing it, but we have to because it's happening and it's real. And every year it gets worse. MARGARET BRENNAN: And can you do it without impacting the rights of Chinese Americans or Chinese nationals who are living here? SEN. RUBIO: Yeah, in fact, it's Chinese nationals living here that are being threatened and intimidated. And one of the great threats that exist there is many of them are hesitant to come forward and report what's happening to them, to the authorities because they're specifically told not to do so or their family are going to be harmed. So I think we've got to develop greater trust. We have to understand you're the perpetrators are working on behalf of the Chinese government, but the victims are disproportionately Chinese Americans who are living here and they're Americans and they deserve the protection of our country. So it's a- it's a tricky balance, but it's one we need to be able to distinguish. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Rubio, thank you for your time this morning. SEN. RUBIO: Thank you.",

State police said Trooper Lukasz Lipert arrived to the call in Tolland and was greeted by Walesa, who had spoken in Hartford on Tuesday as part of his U.S. tour advocating for aid for refugees who have fled Ukraine during the war with Russia.  Lipert, 35, who came to the U.S. when he was 18, told The Hartford Courant that he spoke with Walesa in Polish about their homeland and the anti-communist movement Walesa helped lead.  \"It was definitely a great opportunity to meet the man who had a voice during those times,\" Lipert said. \"It was definitely a great experience.\"  Walesa, 78, led the nationwide Solidarity movement in Poland in the 1980s that eventually toppled Poland's communist leaders  through an election in 1989. He received a Nobel Prize in 1983 and served as Poland's first popularly elected president from 1990 to 1995. He is a strong critic of Poland's current right-wing government.  A vehicle service worker changed the tire and Walesa continued on his way down I-84. One of his next stops is an event in Boston on Monday.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Congressional leaders reached a bipartisan deal early Wednesday providing $13.6 billion to help Ukraine and European allies plus billions more to battle the pandemic as part of an overdue $1.5 trillion measure financing federal agencies for the rest of this year. Though a tiny portion of the massive bill, the money responding to the Russian blitzkrieg that's devastated parts of Ukraine and prompted Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II ensured robust bipartisan support for the legislation. President Biden had requested $10 billion for military, humanitarian and economic aid last week, and Democratic and Republican backing was so staunch that the figure grew to $12 billion Monday and $13.6 billion just a day later.  \"We're going to support them against tyranny, oppression, violent acts of subjugation,\" Mr. Biden said at the White House. Party leaders hoped to whip the 2,741-page measure through the House on Wednesday and the Senate by week's end, though that chamber's exact timing was unclear. Lawmakers were spurred by the urgency of helping Ukraine before Russia's military might makes it too late. They also faced a Friday deadline to approve the government-wide spending measure or face a weekend election-year federal shutdown. As a backstop against delays, the House planned to pass a bill Wednesday keeping agencies afloat through March 15, said a House Democratic aide who wasn't authorized to publicly describe the plans and spoke on condition of anonymity. \"War in Europe has focused the energies of Congress to getting something done and getting it done fast,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. The bipartisan rallying behind the Ukraine aid package was just one manifestation of Congress' eagerness to help the beleaguered country, though not all of it has been harmonious.  Republicans accused Mr. Biden of moving too slowly to help Ukraine and NATO nations assisting it, and to impose sanctions against Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin. They've also used the crisis to amplify their years-long drive to ease drilling restrictions on federal lands and to oppose Democrats' attempts to curb carbon-heavy fuels that worsen climate change.  A bipartisan push to ban Russian oil imports had grown perhaps unstoppable before Mr. Biden announced Tuesday that he would do that on his own. Democrats said time was needed to bring along European allies that rely heavily on Russian energy sources. They also noted that plenty of drilling is available on nonfederal lands.  Before the $1.5 trillion measure was released, some details had already emerged of a bill bearing victories for both parties.  Democrats won $15.6 billion for a fresh round of spending for vaccines, testing and treatments for COVID-19, including $5 billion for fighting the pandemic around the world. That was below Mr. Biden's $22.5 billion request. Republicans said they'd forced Democrats to pay for the entire amount by pulling back unspent money from past legislation. The money would come from previously approved spending for combating COVID-19 and for helping states cope with pandemic costs, said one person who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the legislation publicly.  Schumer said there would be money for Mr. Biden's \"Cancer Moonshot\" to find a cure for the disease, and for increasing Pell grants for lower-income college students. Still unresolved was whether to include programs protecting women against domestic violence and strengthening the country's cybersecurity, Schumer said.  The overall measure was on track to increase overall defense and domestic spending over last year's levels, though exact figures were not yet available. No. 2 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota said Republicans were happy with the boost for the military.  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the measure would provide loan guarantees to Poland to help it replace aircraft it is sending Ukraine. \"It's been like pulling teeth\" to get Democrats to agree to some of the defense spending, he said. But he added, \"It's an important step. It needs to be passed. It needs to be passed quickly.\"  Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland a sponsor of a bipartisan effort to win billions to help the pandemic-battered restaurant industry, said that initiative had not survived due to GOP opposition.  House leaders were hoping that chamber could approve the legislation on Wednesday, sending it to the Senate. Debate there could last days. Since the government's fiscal year began last October 1, agencies have been running on spending levels approved during Donald Trump's final weeks in the White House. Congress has approved three short-term bills since then keeping agency doors open.  Last week, eight conservative Republican senators wrote Schumer saying lawmakers \"should not vote on it\" until they've had time to read the bill and for a full study of its costs by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.  \"There are some senators who won't agree on anything, anytime, anywhere,\" said No. 2 House Democratic leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland, \"which is frustrating.\"",

            "article_content": "Each week, humanitarian aid workers for the Polish non-governmental organization (NGO) Grupa Granica find between 40 to 80 migrants in Poland's freezing Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest, just over the border with Belarus. Anna Alboth, one of the founders of Grupa Granica, which helps migrants and monitors human rights violations, says that although the numbers of migrants arriving from hotspots in the Middle East is down from its peak a few months ago, they're arriving in worse condition because of the harsh Polish winter and the physical challenges posed by the forest.\u00a0 \"People are coming. Maybe it's not because of the organized special flights now. Maybe it is just normal flights that are coming from Istanbul or Beirut or Iraq, but we are meeting people who came in December or January,\" says Alboth.\u00a0 The border Belarus shares with Ukraine has been under constant watch lately, as the likelihood of a full Russian invasion of Ukraine grows. But not long ago, on the other side of the country, it was Belarus' western border with Poland that was drawing attention \u2014 because of the migrant crisis said by Europe and the U.S. to have been manufactured by Belarus' strongman leader, Alexander Lukashenko. Six months since that crisis began, hundreds of migrants remain in limbo, held in centers in Belarus and Poland.\u00a0 Lukashenko was accused by Europe of waging a \"hybrid war\" that relied on the movement of massive numbers of desperate migrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries to breach the border with Poland. The Belarusian government encouraged the migrants to come through Belarus, reportedly easing visa requirements, raising the numbers of flights to Belarus and even supplying them with wire cutters to slice through border fences, according to the New York Times. Lukashenko's migrant onslaught came in the wake of European sanctions imposed on Belarus after his re-election, which the U.S. and Europe condemned as fraudulent.\u00a0 Josep Borrell, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called Lukashenko's use of vulnerable migrants \"an abhorrent attempt to deflect attention from the regime's continued disregard for international law.\" Poland began to defend its border aggressively in September, unleashing tear gas and water cannons on migrants who tried to cross and enacting an entry ban on the border with Belarus that turned back not only migrants, but also humanitarian organizations and journalists.\u00a0 For months, hundreds of migrants lived in makeshift camps along the Polish barbed wire fence on the Belarussian side of the border. Most of those who did make it across the border, had nowhere to go and hid in the forest, fearing discovery by Polish border guards. After a European diplomatic effort, the border crisis began to ease in December; Lukashenko told migrants they could head west or head home, and he blamed the European Union for the situation, according to Reuters. Belarus began repatriation flights, sending 3,817 Iraqi migrants home, and the United Nations assisted with the flights, repatriating another 381 migrants.\u00a0 But many remain stranded in detention facilities. An estimated 1,600 who made it past Polish border guards are being held in centers run by border enforcement, although different aid organizations say the number may be even larger.\u00a0 Alboth told CBS News that the people in the detention centers in Poland are treated \"worse than prisoners\" and that organizations like hers are still not being given access to the facilities. The organization sends food and clothing, but Alboth says Poland is constantly changing the law governing what the detainees may receive.\u00a0 Grupa Granica has complained that the detention centers are dismal, with poor, overcrowded living conditions, low food rations and insufficient medical care.\u00a0 The exact number of migrants still in the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest is unknown, but the Polish national guard tweeted on February 12 that it had apprehended over 1,180 migrants since the beginning of the year.\u00a0 Meanwhile, on Tuesday, the United Nations issued\u00a0a statement\u00a0calling on Poland to grant access to journalists and humanitarian workers to the border area and to investigate allegations of harassment of human rights defenders.\u00a0 On the other side of the border, the Ministry of Emergency Situations in Belarus says there are around 450 migrants left, but aid organizations believe the number is higher, closer to 800. They're being held at a center in conditions \"not suitable for extended stay\" according to a Red Cross report. The report says that despite repatriation efforts, several hundred people remain, \"due to their lack of ability or willingness to repatriate for a variety of reasons.\" When the migrants are found in the forest, members of Grupa Granica try to address their basic needs before addressing any legal questions. Maciej Nowicki, President of Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights which is part of Grupa Granica, said that some of the migrants have been sending aid workers their location so they can obtain emergency assistance. Some locals with homes in the area hold green lights outside of their doors to signal their willingness to host migrants.\u00a0 Doctors Without Borders withdrew from the border in early January after being repeatedly denied access to treat migrants and refugees. The group said in a statement that the Polish authorities were stopping them from helping migrants in desperate need of humanitarian aid amid sub-zero temperatures. At least 21 people have lost their lives trying to cross in 2021, according to Doctors Without Borders.\u00a0 Under international law, refugees from conflict zones may apply for asylum, but with humanitarian aid blocked from the border, it has fallen largely on local residents and groups like Grupa Granica to help the migrants.\u00a0 CBS News contacted the Polish government for comment but has not received a response.\u00a0 Poland is building a wall of steel topped with razor wire along the border, aimed at preventing a future surge of migrants. The wall is scheduled to be completed in June and will cost the government almost $400 million according to the Associated Press.\u00a0 But now that the migrant route through Poland has been traveled, Alboth believes more people will arrive in the spring when the weather is warmer. \"This route, even if all the flights would be stopped, I don't believe that this route will just disappear. When it gets a bit warmer and sleeping in the forest will not be a life risk, there will be more people coming,\" Alboth said.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "With less than two weeks to go before election day, Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan and Republican challenger Don Bolduc went head-to-head in an afternoon debate, clashing\u00a0 on the economy, abortion, election integrity and the border. It comes as there has been an influx of cash in and out of the Granite State Senate race in the final stretch of the 2022 midterm campaign. The U.S. Senate race in New Hampshire has tightened slightly in recent weeks, with average polling putting Hassan up just over 3.4 points over Bolduc, who won the GOP primary in mid-September despite opposition from establishment Republican groups.\u00a0 On Thursday, Hassan announced that first lady Jill Biden would be joining her at two campaign events this weekend.\u00a0 Bolduc, a retired brigadier general who has never served in elected office, attempted to paint himself as an outsider and Hassan as a career politician. Hassan accused Bolduc of being an extremist and touted her ability to reach across the aisle in the Senate.\u00a0 At times Bolduc was confrontational, speaking over the moderators and audibly groaning while Hassan was talking. But Hassan also showed signs of weakness, failing to jump in and defend herself and Democrats against a series of Republican criticisms.\u00a0 On the economy, Bolduc blamed Democrats' policies for inflation, saying he would change all the energy policies of the Biden administration and cut spending. When asked how Democrats were entirely to blame, he said it was a \"Republican and a Democrat problem.\"\u00a0 Hassan addressed inflation, referring to it as a global issue. She also mentioned price gouging and pointed to the recent record profits of big oil companies. The New Hampshire senator argued that\u00a0 the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act's provisions would bring down Medicare and prescription drug costs,\u00a0 helping struggling Americans.\u00a0 Abortion was a hot topic in the debate. The moderator referenced a recent comment by Bolduc on the campaign trail in which he suggested that in vitro fertilization needs to be investigated and asked Bolduc what he meant by that.\u00a0 \"Well, I have no idea because I don't have [a] reference to that,\" Bolduc responded. \"I do not support a federal ban either for or against abortion,\" he said. He accused Hassan of lying about his stance on the issue. Meanwhile, Hassan was pressed over her support for delaying the end of Title 42, the health policy first used by the Trump administration to largely shut the border to asylum seekers during the pandemic. The moderators noted some activists have said it is racist. \"We have to have a secure border so that we can run an asylum adjudication system that honors our values,\" Hassan responded. \"But the first job of government is to keep people safe, and right now we don't have enough \u2026border patrol agents at the border. I have voted to provide significantly more there.\" Hassan also called for more technology at the border and said there were some gaps in physical barriers that should be closed.\u00a0 During the debate, Bolduc, an ardent supporter of former President Trump, continued to stoke concerns about election integrity. When asked if he believes the state's governor and secretary of state are wrong for saying elections in New Hampshire are secure, Bolduc rattled off a series of concerns he said he is hearing from people he meets campaigning across the state but did not offer any proof to back up the claims. \"They don't like the fact that they can't trust the mail-in ballot system. They don't like the fact that there was proven irregularities with voting machines that haven't been certified in 20 years. They don't like the fact that same-day voter registration causes fraud. If Granite Staters don't like it, then we need to take a look at it,\" Bolduc said. He went on to say he wanted the state Legislature to look at same-day voter registration. And raised several other baseless claims. \"We need to make sure that school buses loaded with people at the polls don't come in and vote,\" Bolduc said. When asked to clarify his statement on the buses, Bolduc said he was \"claiming that that is what Granite Staters tell me, and I'm saying we need to respond to that.\"\u00a0 \"What you just heard from Don Bolduc is his continued attempt to stoke the 'big lie,'\" Hassan responded. \"He has traveled around this state for over a year now, stoking the big lie that 2020 was stolen.\"\u00a0 Later in the debate Bolduc said he admits he \"got it wrong on the 2020 election\" when asked about his shifting stances on the campaign trail but accused Hassan of being a 2016 election denier. He also reiterated his belief there are integrity issues in the elections. On climate change, when asked if the federal government should have a role when it comes to establishing targets for reducing emissions, Bolduc said federal government involvement in business is a \"complete waste of money and a waste of time.\" He argued the state government should do it. Hassan said she's in favor of returning to a talking filibuster, but she also said there are some fundamentals to democracy, like voting and abortion rights, where the Senate minority should not be able to block votes. Bolduc said he does not support ending the filibuster.\u00a0 The debate came as the Republican Senate campaign arm has returned to help Bolduc in the state after withdrawing money earlier in the cycle. It came as the Mitch McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund shifted its money out of the race.\u00a0 The super PAC's president told CBS News at the time it was moving resources to where it could be most effective in helping Republicans win the majority.\u00a0 Bolduc and Hassan will debate again on Nov. 2.\u00a0 Fin Gomez contributed reporting.

            "article_content": "New Delhi - India's ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) has retained power in the country's most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, in an election that was seen as a test of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity ahead of general elections in 2024 when he will seek a third term in office. The BJP won more than 270 of 403 seats in the state assembly, well over the 202 needed to form Uttar Pradesh's state government. The resounding victory makes the BJP the first political party in over three decades to win consecutive terms in the bellwether state. Uttar Pradesh is home to more than 220 million of India's 1.32 billion people. The state sends the most legislators (80) to the country's national parliament. Its chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, who has just won his second term in office, is a Hindu monk-turned-politician who some political pundits believe is a possible successor to Modi on the national stage. Adityanath openly backs his party's Hindu nationalist agenda. He denies being anti-Muslim, but his rise to power in the state has coincided with anti-Muslim hate crimes and\u00a0violence there, including lynchings. Besides Uttar Pradesh, the BJP also won elections in the states of Uttarakhand, Manipur, and Goa this week. The party only lost in one of the five states that held elections, Punjab. These elections were held in the aftermath of several\u00a0deadly waves of COVID-19, which threw the country's economy into tatters, worsening unemployment and inflation. It also came on the heels of widespread\u00a0protests by farmers\u00a0that posed the biggest challenge to Modi's government to date. \"But the economic anxiety of the people did not translate into a vote against the BJP, as many would have assumed,\" Neelanjan Sircar, a senior fellow with Centre for Policy Research, an Indian think-tank, told CBS News. \"Hindutva ideology is always a factor with BJP's wins,\" Sircar said, referring to the party's officially adopted policy of \"cultural nationalism,\" but he said Thursday's election results were also about the BJP's \"ability to build a narrative on issues and a persona around Modi.\" India is home to more than 200 million Muslims. BJP's critics say the party has deliberately polarized national politics along sectarian lines and marginalized minorities, citing controversial new\u00a0citizenship laws, a\u00a0hijab ban, and even speeches by politicians advocating attacks on Muslims. The BJP insists it is true to its inclusive slogan of \"sabka sath, sabka vikas,\" or \"everyone's support, everyone's development.\" But right-wing organizations in the country speak openly of their vision to turn secular India into a Hindu Rashtra (nation), and activists fear the BJP will quietly allow things to move in that direction, which could mean Muslims' rights being curtailed, and increased violence. \"My fear is, as people look at what's happened in Uttar Pradesh, the new model for someone trying to come up within the BJP is to be more aggressive,\" Sircar told CBS News.",

And this week on Face the Nation: democracy stress test. Americans are worried about voting, violence and disinformation. President Biden delivered his message for the 2022 campaign last week, putting former President Trump and the so-called MAGA extremists he leads squarely on the midterm stage. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): The Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country. (End VT) MAJOR GARRETT: In his first rally since the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago as part of an investigation into the handling of classified documents, the former president, who spoke for nearly two hours, responded. (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States): Republicans in the MAGA movement are not the ones trying to undermine our democracy. We are the ones trying to save our democracy. (End VT) MAJOR GARRETT: The committee investigating the January 6 assault on the Capitol prepares its next move. We will ask Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin, a key Democrat on the panel, what to expect. Voter turnout set records in 2018 and 2020. Will new voting laws break the streak or sustain it? We will hear from Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, and we will talk with former Massachusetts Governor and the former head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division Deval Patrick. Plus, we will ask two experts who study online extremism what can be done to combat the problem and whether fears of unrest around the midterms are warranted. It is all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Face the Nation. Margaret is taking some time off. Labor Day typically marks the kickoff of the homestretch of an election year. As Americans look ahead to the midterms this November, there is broad and deep anxiety in the country about the health of our democracy. A new CBS News poll this morning shows 72 percent of Americans think U.S. democracy is under threat. Why? The top answers include the influence of money in politics, potential for political violence, and attempts to overturn elections. Our next hour will focus on these fault lines, fears and some potential solutions. We begin with CBS News senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann with a look at how we got here. (Begin VT) KARI LAKE (R-Arizona Gubernatorial Candidate): When I'm governor, we're going to take a sledgehammer to these damn electronic voting machines. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): Take Arizona's Kari Lake or Pennsylvania's Doug Mastriano... DOUG MASTRIANO (D-Pennsylvania Gubernatorial Candidate): We, the people, are pissed. MARK STRASSMANN: ... Republican nominees for governor and election deniers, evangelists of the big lie. CBS News election expert David Becker: DAVID BECKER: What's really important for voters to understand is, our process is actually as secure and transparent and professional as it's ever been. MARK STRASSMANN: And yet, since the 2020 election, at least 39 states changed or updated voting laws, often spurred by invented claims of widespread election fraud. Texas imposed new I.D. requirements for mail-in ballots. Georgia restricted drop boxes and absentee ballots. Florida established an elections crime unit. Yet, come Election Day, November 8... DAVID BECKER: For most voters, they're going to find that the experience is very similar to 2020. MARK STRASSMANN: The bigger worry, what comes next? More January 6 outrage? Claims of election rigging? Crowds baying for blood? RIOTER: Nancy. Oh, Nancy. MARK STRASSMANN: Potentially encouraged by candidates who may refuse to lose. Our research shows, in these six battleground states, in this November's elections for offices that helped certify elections, 53 of 88 Republican candidates are election deniers. That is 60 percent. In Arizona's four major Republican primaries, steal champions won all of them, worrying other Republicans there. BILL GATES (R-Maricopa County, Arizona, Supervisor): This cannot be accepted, because our democracy cannot withstand it. So we have to continue to push back. MARK STRASSMANN: Like many election deniers, Doug Mastriano says, as governor, he would have refused to certify Joe Biden won Pennsylvania. He was in the crowd on January 6. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: With or without new election laws, every state's chief election officer has to certify results. Usually, that's the secretary of state. And, this November, a number of conservative candidates running for that office are also election deniers -- Major. MAJOR GARRETT: Mark Strassmann in Atlanta, thank you. We're joined now by Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of the January 6 Select Committee. Congressman, good to see you. Good morning. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN (D-Maryland): Thanks so much for having me, Major. MAJOR GARRETT: So, former President Trump says that MAGA Republicans are trying to save democracy, and they want to be taken seriously on this issue. So let's review what the former president said this week earlier. He said the 2020 election should be rerun or he should be reinstated in office, and that, if reelected in 2024, he would provide apologies and full pardons to those charged and/or convicted for storming the Capitol on January 6. Evaluate that. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, first, if he's saying that the election should be rerun, which is something he's been asserting from the beginning, that's totally outside of the Constitution. There is no procedure for the military just to seize the election machinery and run a new election, which is one of the things that his disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was pushing and we know was part of the January 6 plot. And, look, more than 60 courts rejected every claim of electoral fraud and corruption which Donald Trump advanced. He's had the benefit of more than 60 courts, including eight courts where he appointed the judges to office, look at all those claims, and they were all rejected. It was rejected in the states. And he lost the election. Two of the hallmarks of a fascist political party are, one, they don't accept the results of elections that don't go their way, and, two, they embrace political violence. And I think that's why President Biden was right to sound the alarm this week about these continuing attacks on our constitutional order from the outside by Donald Trump and his movement. MAJOR GARRETT: Let's talk about the January 6 committee. There is conversation about having Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House, come in. He has described this committee as a Stalinist show trial. Earlier this year, he said, under a Republican-led Congress, members of this committee might be arrested. How do you respond to that remark -- those remarks? And what would be the value of him coming in talking to the committee? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we're inviting in only people who have relevant evidence and testimony. MAJOR GARRETT: What's his relevant evidence and testimony? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, he has appeared at numerous times in -- throughout the investigation about the attempt to propound the big lie, and to keep things going long after the election had been settled. But it's interesting that he invoked Stalinism, when all of the Stalinists are on Donald Trump's side, like Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB, who said that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century, or the dictator of North Korea, who Donald Trump writes love letters to. The Stalinists are on their side, and they should keep them on that side of the aisle, because our side is fighting for democracy in America. MAJOR GARRETT: Does the committee still have interest in obtaining testimony from Ginni Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Look, we're interested in getting testimony from anyone who has relevant evidence about the attempt to overthrow the 2020 election. Let's not lose sight of what we're talking about here' MAJOR GARRETT: There were disclosures this week that she was in e-mail conversation with people in Wisconsin about that topic. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: I -- speaking as one member and only as one member, I would say she has a relevant testimony to render. And she should come forward and give it. I don't want to overstate her role. We've talked to more than 1,000 people. But we'd like to hear from Gingrich and we'd like to hear from her too. MAJOR GARRETT: What is the probability former Vice President Pence testifies? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, look, Vice President Pence was the target of Donald Trump's wrath and fury and effort to overthrow the election on January 6. The whole idea was to get Pence to step outside his constitutional role and then to declare unilateral lawless powers to reject Electoral College votes from the states. So I think he has a lot of relevant evidence, and I would hope he would come forward and testify about what happened' MAJOR GARRETT: Voluntarily or via subpoena? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we're trying to get everybody to come forward voluntarily' MAJOR GARRETT: But a subpoena is not out of question? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: In no one's case is a subpoena out of question, but I would assume he's going to come forward and testify voluntarily, the way the vast majority of people have. MAJOR GARRETT: One of the mandates of this committee is to create legislation. Ten Republicans on the Senate side have signed on to an Electoral Count Act revision. Is there a bill on the House side? Will there be? And do you expect this to be updated and resolved legislatively, either before the midterms or in the lame-duck session? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we want to take a much broader view, I think. I mean, the narrowest thing you could say is, well, the vice president doesn't have the power to unilaterally rebuff Electoral College votes from the state... (CROSSTALK) MAJOR GARRETT: Clarify that? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: But -- yeah, but if that's all we do, in a certain sense, it's validating Donald Trump's argument that there was any ambiguity about it in the first place, which there was not. No vice president had ever tried to reject Electoral College votes. And Mike Pence and his team ultimately said it was ridiculous. So I think we need to take a much broader view about Donald Trump's attack on the entire Electoral College process and the entire democratic process from the counties and the towns and the cities through the states all the way up to the federal government. So, I think we have got to defend the right to vote and democracy itself. MAJOR GARRETT: Does that mean the Senate bill would be unacceptable in the house? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: No, I think it's a -- it's a good first start. It's a good first offer. But I think we need to look far more systematically at what Donald Trump was trying to do. And we've seen, for example, when he called Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and said, just find me 11,781 votes, when they tried to intimidate election officers, this was a far more sweeping plot than just what happened in the last couple of hours there. MAJOR GARRETT: We have less than a minute. One of your colleagues on the committee, Adam Kinzinger, said the next step for the committee is to look into the money behind and the money being made off of the big lie. True? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: That was an important degree, an important dimension of everything that was happening. This was a Donald Trump operation. So it was always an effort to... (CROSSTALK) MAJOR GARRETT: But will that be brought in the public presentation of that committee coming forward? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: It will undoubtedly be part of our report. And whether it comes up again in the hearings, I can't say yet, because we're still working all of that out. MAJOR GARRETT: There is much anticipation in the nation's capital, possibly across the country, in the report propounded by the committee. When can the country expect to see that? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, certainly by the end of the year, because we're like Cinderella at midnight. Our license runs out at the end of the year. But, under House Resolution 503, that's a significant part of our responsibility to report to the American people about how to prevent coups, insurrections, political violence, and attacks on our democratic process going forward. MAJOR GARRETT: Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin, thanks so much. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Thanks for having me, Major. MAJOR GARRETT: Face the Nation will be back in just one moment. Please stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back. We turn now to Michigan's Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Madam Secretary, welcome to Face the Nation, and good morning. I know you talk to lots of secretaries of state of both parties, as well as election officials nationwide. What are they most worried about as the midterms approach? JOCELYN BENSON (D-Michigan Secretary of State): Violence and disruption on Election Day, first and foremost, and in the days surrounding the election. And, secondly, there's a concern about the ongoing spread of misinformation, which of course, fuels the potential for additional threats, harassment and, and even violence on Election Day. MAJOR GARRETT: A natural question that viewers might have hearing you just now is, well, is there a plan to deal with violence? Should I be afraid when I go to the polls? SECRETARY JOCELYN BENSON: There is. And they should -- all voters should know that election officials on both sides of the aisle are working night and day to ensure we're collaborating with law enforcement and every other potential partner to protect the sanctity of the polling place and protect the integrity of our democracy. And it's also important to note that we've been doing this work now for close to two years, or over two years, and we've been succeeding really at every turn. Democracy prevailed in 2020. There have been, in Michigan and in other states, no significant attempts, apart from the tragedy in our Capitol on January 6, to really see disruption of the polling places on Election Day itself. So, we are in many ways even more prepared this year than ever before, than -- even than we were in 2020, to ensure that we are eliminating, mitigating or certainly protecting the system against any potential disruptions, and also speaking clearly to folks who are thinking about interfering with our elections that the law is clear, and we will seek accountability and consequences for anyone who tries to interfere with a citizen's right to vote and democracy itself. MAJOR GARRETT: Madam Secretary, I want to put things in two different distinct buckets if I could. Consternation and denialism is one, and curiosity is another. Do you welcome from your constituents in Michigan and should secretaries of state broadly welcome curiosity, voters who maybe don't believe the election was stolen, but have questions? Are you open to that and that engagement? SECRETARY JOCELYN BENSON: Yes, that is such an important distinction. I think we need to look at things based on truth and evidence. If there are evidence of -- or questions based on evidence, rooted in evidence of any issues around our elections, then, yes, we welcome that, because the more transparency we have on the process, the more sunlight, the more people can understand really how much work has gone into protecting the security and accessibility of elections for every voter. What's really happened over the last few years is this growth of fact -- or factless misinformation or allegations based not on evidence, but on aspersions, and really geared towards furthering partisan agendas and delegitimizing democracy itself. But if questions are rooted in evidence, and if responses are similarly rooted in evidence, then we actually move forward to having a healthy, robust, transparent democracy, where everyone can have confidence that their vote is counted and their voice is heard. MAJOR GARRETT: This next question might be an opportunity for that kind of clarity. So, a piece of election equipment from Michigan was recently found on eBay. It had been sold in an auction of some kind. There's a criminal investigation. What's the underlying crime? And what do you want to say about that? SECRETARY JOCELYN BENSON: Well, in Michigan, as in many other states, it's illegal for anyone to have unauthorized access to election equipment. And so we have for really the past several years been engaging and working with law enforcement to ensure the security of the equipment. We immediately decommission any equipment that has been found to be potentially compromised. And we ensure that, prior to every election, there are accuracy tests for every piece of election equipment, so the citizen can feel confident that, when they vote on paper ballots, that the machines are securely counting every valid vote. Now, in this case, we had a situation -- and we're still working with law enforcement to investigate what happened -- where not a voting tabulator, but a marking device, a device that's used to assist voters who need assistance in marking their ballot, perhaps may have been inadvertently dropped off at Goodwill, maybe even discarded as something that wasn't clear what it was. We're still finding out those facts. But it's important to note that that's happening in this era of misinformation, where people are quick to seize on the potential for machines to be somehow insecure. And our work in Michigan is to ensure that any machine that is illegally accessed or even tempted to be illegally accessed is decommissioned and that we only have secure machines in play on Election Day. And, again, we test those before every election. MAJOR GARRETT: Madam Secretary, again, keeping with the theme of transparency, as you know, there is a lawsuit filed in Michigan alleging that the names of deceased voters remained on those rolls longer than they should have. A Biden-appointed federal judge has allowed that lawsuit to continue. What can you say about that? And do you need to do better in Michigan than you have on this particular front? SECRETARY JOCELYN BENSON: We have maintained and prioritized ensuring the accuracy of our voting list since I took office, including doing a mailing to every voter in the state -- registered voter in the state, so that we can assess whether or not they were still in Michigan. We've also partnered with national collaborations with other states to ensure, when voters move to another state, that we get that information. With regards to voters who become deceased, we receive information every week from the federal government, Social Security and other sources. And we use that information to, on a weekly, regular basis, ensure that we're tracking and increasing and improving the accuracy of our lists. Now, that said, we also welcome the suggestions or the input of others. And we've asked individuals who do present us with lists to let us know how they compile this evidence, so that we can verify whether or not it's actually true. The bottom line is, we want to ensure that our lists are accurate, but that we're also not removing voters who are legitimately able to be registered and vote in Michigan. And that's a very technical process. It's one that requires constant vigilance. We've also set up a Web site on our Michigan.gov/vote where citizens can learn in granular detail about everything we do on a regular basis to ensure the accuracy of our voting lists in Michigan. MAJOR GARRETT: Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Madam Secretary, thanks for taking the questions. Good to see you. Happy Labor Day. SECRETARY JOCELYN BENSON: Thanks. Thank you. Thanks for having me. MAJOR GARRETT: And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. We invite you to please stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We learned more about the FBI's investigation of former President Trump last week, including new details about what federal agents recovered during the search of Mar-a-Lago last month. To help us with all of this, we are joined by CBS News chief election and campaign correspondent -- that would be Robert Costa -- and CBS News congressional correspondent, my good friend Scott MacFarlane. Good morning to you both. Bob, catch the audience up on what we have learned and what's most important about that, that we learned. ROBERT COSTA: Major, good to be with you. A federal judge in Florida decided to unseal more information about what was collected during that FBI search at Mar-a-Lago in early August. What we learned this week were new details, including the fact that there were empty folders marked as classified inside the president's Mar-a-Lago estate. This is a serious investigation, based on my reporting. It also has mounting unanswered questions about why the president had so many -- former president had so many documents marked as classified, empty folders. If they are empty, then where was the information that was contained in them? MAJOR GARRETT: And also questions about if the representations made by his attorneys were truthful to the Justice Department. ROBERT COSTA: That's right. The Justice Department has been suggesting in court filings that they're looking into possible obstruction by Trump and his legal team in terms of their engagement with the National Archives, as well as with the Justice Department. MAJOR GARRETT: Scott, fair to say, fairly or not, this has set off a firestorm within the Trump-sympathetic community in our country. Has that gotten the attention of prosecutors, judges and others picking up similar suggestions of violence or threats of violence of the kind that preceded January 6? SCOTT MACFARLANE: Exactly. There's a symmetry to what's been said publicly and on social media platforms and chat groups after the search at Mar-a-Lago and what they saw and what they heard January 4, January 5, 2021, talk of civil war, talk of delegitimizing federal law enforcement or federal institutions. And one of the most unequivocal warnings has been coming from D.C. federal judges who are handling the January 6 cases. They warned in the past week of the prospect of another January 6 in 2025, of more political violence. These are the judges, Major, who know the January 6 cases. They know what these defendants had been saying before the attack. And the symmetry of what's being said now is striking and important. MAJOR GARRETT: Bob, what's your reporting about January 2025 and concerns Republicans have looking that far ahead? ROBERT COSTA: When I'm on Capitol Hill, that is the point of alarm among some of my top sources. What happens in January 2025, after the next presidential election? And it's up to Congress to decide how this is all certified. And if there are disputes in the states -- let's say a state court says one thing, a governor says another, and the legislature says another -- how will Congress handle that? And there isn't a clear road map at this point, because the Electoral Count Act, which has been guiding this process for a long time, has been confusing to many lawmakers. And so, as Congressman Raskin was saying, there are ongoing discussions in the Senate, Senator Manchin, Senator Collins, trying to come up with their own proposal. But some in the House and in the Senate don't believe it goes far enough. For example, the threshold now for an objection, it's just one senator, one House member. The Senate proposed package, it's about 20 percent of a chamber is needed for an objection. But some of my sources, Democrat and Republican, are saying, is 20 percent too low? For the sustainability of American democracy, does it need to be more stringent when it comes to how things are objected to? And does it need to be more clear in terms of having Congress understand what to consider as a legitimate outcome in a state? MAJOR GARRETT: Scott, related to the conversation we just had, you're on Capitol Hill every day. Is the atmosphere there still as tense as it was after January 6? Are members and staff still on edge about the prospect of violence or their own personal safety? SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes. And note the increased security some members of Congress have had to take or get because of the talk in recent weeks, in recent months and threats against their lives. I will say something else. The defendants in court from January 6, when it's time to go ask for leniency, go to sentencing, plead for the mercy of the court, are still so muted in their criticism of Donald Trump and, in some cases, still denying the integrity of the 2020 election. The judges and some of the people involved will say, that's why they're so concerned about more violence. Even defendants on their day of reckoning are still critical. MAJOR GARRETT: And very quickly, Scott, how much volatility, if any, does it add when the former president says, if he's reelected in 2024, he will grant full pardons? SCOTT MACFARLANE: Yes, it's a potential light to the candle to the match. It infuses this with more chaos and potentially more denialism of elections. MAJOR GARRETT: Bob, any thoughts on that, real quick? ROBERT COSTA: Just to build on Scott's point, January 6 remains a wound that will not heal in this country. It's influencing ongoing investigations. It's influencing Congress and the next election, in terms of how people like Doug Mastriano are running in Pennsylvania, people who are linked to January 6 in various ways. MAJOR GARRETT: Robert Costa, Scott MacFarlane, thanks so very much. And we will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to Deval Patrick, former governor of Massachusetts who, before that, led the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division during the Clinton administration. He joins us this morning from Richmond, Massachusetts. Governor, thanks for making time. Good to see you. FORMER GOVERNOR DEVAL PATRICK (D-Massachusetts): It's a pleasure. Good morning. MAJOR GARRETT: So, you're out of politics now. Your focus at the Kennedy School at Harvard is on leadership. How comfortable were you with President Biden's speech last week, and also a speech that Republicans well remember that the President gave earlier this year when he compared changes that Republicans made in voting laws in Georgia to Jim Crow and violent enforced segregation of another era? Are you comfortable with that kind of rhetoric? FORMER GOVERNOR DEVAL PATRICK: You know what? A friend of mine says that we've been treating our democracy for a long time in this country as if it would tolerate limitless abuse without breaking. And when you add up the 19 states and their vote suppression laws recently, and you look at that alongside the amount of money, so much of it dark, which has been permitted into our politics and our policymaking, the radical purging rules, the ways in which we have distorted the democratic process as a means to achieve better lives for citizens, it is deeply worrisome. And it's gotten worse because of election deniers. So, I celebrate the president's speech. Any one of us would choose different words, but I think it is great that the president first of all calls things what they are, and also reminds us that the purpose of democracy is a means to assure liberty and justice for all. And we have to care about that process and that purpose for those reasons. MAJOR GARRETT: Governor, in our focus group that our audience will see in a few moments of Trump supporters, one pointed out that Democrats raised objections in 2000, and they wouldn't let them go. They raised objections in 2004. Some wouldn't let them go, and, in 2016, raised objections and wouldn't let them go. And they consider Democrat criticism of Republican objections to what they saw in 2020 hypocritical. Respond to that. FORMER GOVERNOR DEVAL PATRICK: Well, I think it's important for us to hear that, first of all, and to -- and really try to process that. I think I experienced that differently. I think, when Donald Trump -- if what you mean is objections to Donald Trump winning the presidency, I don't think there was any Democrat calling the election itself illegitimate because the outcome was surprising or disappointing to Democrats. I think it is important, though, to acknowledge that there is frustration that runs pretty deep throughout the political spectrum about democracy as a path to a better future. And that is because I think we've been treating it in this -- in these kind of careless ways for a long, long time. It's a whole other order of magnitude. And that is serious enough, but a whole order of magnitude to say that democracy is illegitimate unless the outcome is the one you want or the one you voted for. I don't think that's what Democrats were objecting to in the policy choices of Donald Trump and those who have supported him. That's a very, very different thing. MAJOR GARRETT: Governor, as you well know, democracy is sustained on a generational basis. You deal a lot, I gather, with leadership and the question of thereof with younger American students. What is their orientation to democracy? Do they want direct democracy? And do you have to explain to them, we don't have direct democracy in our country, we have representational democracy, and do you work them through that? And what's their level of optimism or pessimism? FORMER GOVERNOR DEVAL PATRICK: What great questions. First of all, I think the students at the Kennedy School, the young people I meet all around the country, give me tremendous amount of encouragement. And they -- and I think they all -- they should encourage all of us. I think their sense of patriotism runs deep. I think their sense of urgency is also natural and a thing not to be tamped down, because there are unmet needs, many of which cross all kinds of differences, reach people in every part of the country, and were undeniable in the experience we all shared going through the COVID 19 pandemic. I think that the notion of being engaged, of taking responsibility for this generation and generations to come is enormously important and encouraging. And one of the things I try to encourage in them is that they look for and think about and reject the false choices that so many of our would-be leaders tell us. You know, you don't have to hate the members of another party to be a member in good standing of your own, in the same way you don't have to hate business to advocate for social and economic justice or to hate the police to believe black lives matter. But we are sold so many of these kinds of false choices in our current political discourse. And I keep encouraging the young people who want to be involved and who are trying to encourage others of all generations to be engaged to be alert to those false choices and reject them, because the fact is, most people aren't buying 100 percent of what either party is selling. You know that, Major. MAJOR GARRETT: Governor, we have less than a minute left. Do you think the business and corporate community in America needs to be more involved in the democracy debate? And, if so, how? FORMER GOVERNOR DEVAL PATRICK: I think the business community is becoming more involved and business leaders in the democracy debate. The question of where they stand as an entity on any given issue, any given policy is another story. And that's more delicate, I think, for businesses. But the question about whether participatory democracy is a thing to celebrate and encourage, and, where it is suppressed or frustrated or encumbered, to be called out and condemned, I think that's something that business leaders have to show leadership on, because that involves all of us. And the truth is... MAJOR GARRETT: Governor... FORMER GOVERNOR DEVAL PATRICK: ... capitalism depends on democracy. MAJOR GARRETT: Former Governor of Massachusetts Deval Patrick, thanks so much for your time. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MAJOR GARRETT: To better understand the pulse of Republican politics at the moment, we spoke earlier with a group of voters who would support former President Trump if he ran again in 2024. We began our conversation with the Justice Department's intensifying investigation into the former president for allegedly mishandling classified information. (Begin VT) STEVE (Trump Voter): It appears to be politically motivated. But there's no way to be sure, because we work for the FBI. We don't work for the Biden administration. MARY (Trump Voter): They're not going to leave him alone. So, even if he has done something wrong, they will always be trying to go after him for something, and it'll be the focus. JOANN (Trump Voter): I believe that, if it really was about documents, that it could have been handled between the lawyers, as it had been being handled. You don't raid the home of a former president like he's a drug dealer down the street, with the lights and the guys with the guns. And it wasn't necessary. Can I trust that what they say that they supposedly found is really found? I can't. I will never believe it. MAJOR GARRETT: Right. When Senator Lindsey Graham, Joann, said that, if the former president is indicted, there will be riots in the street -- streets, do you agree with that? And do you feel comfortable with a senator saying something like that? JOANN: No, I wish Lindsey Graham had not voiced it that way. I think, if he's indicted, there will be a lot of unhappy people. But I do not believe that MAGA Republicans are going to be rioting in the streets. STEVE: I don't see there would be any rioting. If they were going to -- if there was going to be any rioting in the streets, it would have been when the last election was stolen. It wouldn't be over this issue. MAJOR GARRETT: Let me pick up on that, Steve. You just said the last election was stolen. How was it stolen? STEVE: I saw the video out of Georgia, that they cleared everybody out of the polling place. And, as soon as everybody was gone, they pulled suitcases full of ballots out of -- underneath tables, and started processing. And the next morning, the entire outcome was different. MAJOR GARRETT: Steve, does it matter to you that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation looked into that and decided itself that there was nothing wrong there? STEVE: I have to believe my own two eyes. I watched it happen on video. Yes, we know that video can be doctored today, but I'm not buying it. I'm a pretty bright guy. What I see, I believe, at least half of it. MAJOR GARRETT: Does it matter that two U.S. attorneys, both of them appointed by former President Trump, looked into it and did not consider that activity fraudulent? Does that matter to you? STEVE: It gives me pause. It makes me think more deeply about it. But, again, I have to believe what I see. MAJOR GARRETT: Mary, do you believe the 2020 election was stolen? MARY: I wouldn't necessarily say that it was stolen. But I believe that it is unfair. People don't know their history, then, because they don't know how Democrats argued over the 2000 election. Obviously, they said the Supreme Court elected George W. Bush. And then, again in 2004, it was the same thing MAJOR GARRETT: To that point -- and I don't disagree with you at all. I covered 2000. I covered 2004. I well remember the instances. You describe them. You describe them accurately. But I remember a phrase that my grandmother used to use, which is two wrongs don't make a right. And I wonder how you process that wisdom from my grandmother in this context. MARY: I think two wrongs don't make a right. But I don't think hypocrisy is very flattering as well. MAJOR GARRETT: Joann, about two wrongs don't make a right, I understand that there is a history on both sides. I'm just wondering if you're comfortable and if you have any anxiety about the future of democracy if both sides use that as an excuse against one another, and we never get anywhere. JOANN: You're absolutely correct. If every side is going to say after they lose, we really didn't lose, then, yes, I mean, elections will become something that nobody's ever going to be happy with. MARY: You just said the question of democracy, but isn't democracy arguing, debating? So, if the precedent has been set that you can question elections, I mean, you can question everything in a democracy. MAJOR GARRETT: Sure. MARY: It's getting -- to somebody like me, who's not a Republican or a Democrat, but I do support Trump, it's getting really old hearing democracy, democracy, democracy, because what we're doing is part of a democracy. And the way Joe Biden and the Democrats use it as a weapon -- the term democracy has become a weapon. And it just means that. if you're afraid that Republicans are a threat to democracy, what you're telling me is that you're -- you're afraid that Republicans are a threat to your power and your agenda. And so I think we need to go back and have a better understanding of what democracy actually is. MAJOR GARRETT: Steve, let me follow up with you. What are your feelings about the upcoming midterms? Do you have confidence in the election results you will see reported either that night or the following days? STEVE: No, my confidence in that area has been shaken for a long time. MAJOR GARRETT: Mary, can I ask you the same question? How do you feel about the coming midterms and the election results that will be reported? MARY: For the most part, yes, I'm confident. MAJOR GARRETT: OK. Joann, how about you? JOANN: The Democrat Party has spent a lot of money to prop up what they call MAGA candidates in the upcoming November election, candidates that they figured, once they got there, the Democrat could beat. But then the president the other night basically told everyone that we can't have the MAGA Republicans in office at all, that we're going to destroy the country. So, I'm -- I don't know. It concerns me. I thought we were going to do very well in November. MAJOR GARRETT: Steve, if I could ask you, if former President Trump were not to declare for 2024, do you have an alternative who is already a favorite of yours? STEVE: Ron DeSantis. In fact, I'd love to see a DeSantis-Trump ticket. MAJOR GARRETT: Mary, if former President Trump were not to run, do you have an alternative favorite -- alternate favorite already? MARY: Yes, definitely Governor DeSantis. But I have family in Florida, and I would hate to steal such a great governor from them. MAJOR GARRETT: Joann? JOANN: Oh, definitely DeSantis, Ron DeSantis all the way, if it can't be Trump. MAJOR GARRETT: And, Joann, let me just follow up with you. Why? What is it that's so attractive about Governor DeSantis? JOANN: When DeSantis sees an issue, he takes it on. He's not afraid to take on anything, nor does Donald Trump. MAJOR GARRETT: Mary, your thoughts about Governor DeSantis? MARY: Well, I think -- I think Republican politicians need to pay attention to him and how he governs and how he deals with the press. He goes on offense like we haven't seen except with President Trump. MAJOR GARRETT: I appreciate your time. But I want to open the floor, if anyone wants to add anything that is still on their mind that I haven't gotten to. JOANN: I am a MAGA Republican, and I'm not a threat to anybody. And I just appreciate the fact of being able to say that. I don't want to hurt anyone. I don't want to destroy democracy. I want this country to be great again. That's what I want. And that's all it means, MAGA, to be great again, make America great again. And that is something that I'd like to see happen, hopefully sooner, rather than later. STEVE: Well said, Joann. JOANN: And thank you for listening to me. (End VT) MAJOR GARRETT: And we will be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MAJOR GARRETT: Political violence and riots can often be traced back to the rise of online extremism. We spoke earlier with two experts on the problem and its potential solutions, Jared Holt, a senior research manager at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, and Karen Kornbluh, the head of the German Marshall Fund's Digital Innovations and Democracy Initiative. We began by asking them to describe the relationship between the Internet and democracy. (Begin VT) JARED HOLT (Senior Research Manager, Institute for Strategic Dialogue): Tenuous. The Internet, in the way that it is monetized in the current age, is through attention. You can get a lot of attention saying crazy stuff. And we're seeing a lot of people do that, frankly. So, you know, as long as the business model of the Internet is built around trying to captivate audiences and keep them clicking, reacting, whether that's through rage or die-hard support, it's going to be in conflict with democracy, because democracy is not about what gets the most attention. It's supposed to be about what the best ideas are, how do we compromise, how do we move forward? And this attention-based economy online is incongruent with that mission. MAJOR GARRETT: Karen, complete the sentence. The Internet's relationship to democracy is? KAREN KORNBLUH (German Marshall Fund Digital Innovations and Democracy Initiative): It's fraught. It's definitely fraught. In the early days of the Internet, it offered incredible promise, and it still does. All of these movements, Black Lives Matter, Me Too, were able to gain steam online, in that it just continues to offer the kind of promise of educating people, informing them, connecting them. But these algorithms really have contributed to the crisis we're in. And the platforms have a real responsibility to fix them and to help fix the problem that they've helped create. MAJOR GARRETT: Jared, from a libertarian perspective, one might argue, look, people are out there. They decide what they want to consume. There is agency, as you indicated. So, the Internet isn't a problem. These people are out there. They have their beliefs, and they're going to pursue it. Or is it that you're arguing the Internet is an accelerator and a multiplier? JARED HOLT: It's an accelerator and a multiplier. This kind of content, conspiratorial content, extremist movements have existed in America for as long as America has been around, right? These platforms are designed, guiding people towards more extreme content, what they're not taking down, what they're giving a free pass to, people who are using these platforms to manipulate audiences, and guide them and steer them. MAJOR GARRETT: From your perspective, is January 6 and its magnitude impossible without this multiplier accelerationist effect? JARED HOLT: It's very safe to say that it wouldn't have happened the way that it did, at the scale that it did, coming together as fast as it did without the Internet. A lot of attention was paid to fringe platforms like Parler after the riot, but a lot of the'he agitation and calls to action were happening on mainstream platforms from mainstream figures. MAJOR GARRETT: For those on the right who say, you're missing this whole point, the point is, we get canceled, we get deplatformed, and that's big tech silencing us, so our rights are the ones being trampled, you would say? KAREN KORNBLUH: This is the danger of the Whac-A-Mole solution. Not only is it ineffective, too little too late, but it also raises all kinds of free expression concerns, because it takes down content. It takes down people after the fact. I would love to see the platforms not only fix their algorithms, but, when they publish their terms of service, really commit themselves to enforce what they've put out there, and not have so much discretion. It's this kind of discretion that I think really bothers people and makes them feel that they can't get on these very few opportunities for speech. MAJOR GARRETT: Jared, what happened in these places you are describing, Parler, Gettr, other parts of the Web that maybe aren't as well-trafficked as others after the Mar-a-Lago execution of a search warrant? JARED HOLT: These spaces online, pro-Trump forums, fringe platforms, just really erupted with violent rhetoric, these false beliefs that the FBI or law enforcement is out to get conservatives and Trump supporters specifically. But we saw that paired with also a lot of violent rhetoric, taking their existing beliefs that the system is compromised, and ratcheting it up to the next level, saying, we need to do something, whether that's protesting or whether that's taking it as far as that individual in Cincinnati did, trying to breach the FBI office there. MAJOR GARRETT: Karen, what can Congress do? KAREN KORNBLUH: There's bipartisan concern, but there's really not bipartisan action. The proposals on algorithmic accountability, I think, offer real promise, but, so far, they don't include any kind of enforcement mechanism. Given the tinderbox that we're in, I think we really have to turn to the platforms and ask them to step up. MAJOR GARRETT: What are you looking at in terms of these realities -- they're not going to change before the midterm elections -- and multiplier effects, accelerationist effect on the Web heading toward the midterms? KAREN KORNBLUH: There are two things, two urgent things, that I would say that the platforms could do. First, they should stop siloing people, directing people into these bubbles that reinforce extremist world views and don't let in opposing viewpoints. And, second, they should really work with the providers of important civic information, people like election administration officials, to help them amplify accurate information, so that people can be empowered and actually know what's going on. MAJOR GARRETT: What does this conversation and these underlying realities mean, as America grapples with what appears to be a rise in white nationalism, white supremacy? JARED HOLT: The Internet has been a really powerful tool for extremist movements in the U.S. It's been a big accelerant. It's been a big boom. And we've seen consistently on platforms they all have kind of red lines that content is not supposed to cross over. If it crosses over, if it's particularly violent, particularly racist, that kind of material will get banned. But the content that walks right up to that line, that sort of tiptoes on that line is among the highest-performing content on these Web sites. It's not a level playing field. And that unlevel playing field has been definitely an accelerant of these issues that we're seeing rise up in American prominence. The kind of stuff that we're talking about today, whether it's misinformation, conspiracy theories, et cetera, everybody is vulnerable to this, rich people, poor people, smart people, not-so-smart people. Everybody can fall victim to this stuff. And it has to do with the manipulative nature of the content. And I just think it's really important to stress that. (End VT) MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MAJOR GARRETT: Well, that's it for us today. We thank you so much for watching. Margaret will be back next week.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates that aired Sunday, May 22, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" The full interview transcript can be found below. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said that you've been disappointed in Republican leaders for not standing up for traditional Republican values. We just had this awful shooting in Buffalo, New York. Liz Cheney, Congresswoman, said, \"House GOP leadership has enabled white nationalism, white supremacy and anti-Semitism. History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse. Republican leaders must renounce and reject these views and those who hold them.\" Do you think Republican leaders are enabling those things she said? GATES: I don't know that I would go that far. I do know that there aren't enough of them denouncing those things, denouncing white supremacy, denouncing- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? GATES: We have too many people who- who are in politics to further their own agendas and to further their own personal prospects rather than what's good for the country. And I would say that's true in both parties. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it is important for the American public to have a full accounting of the events of January 6th with these public hearings that are planned in the weeks ahead? GATES: I think so. What happened on January 6th was- was a huge blight on our democracy.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You think there is value in having this aired publicly? GATES: I think so, yes. I think people need to understand. My worry is that people will- that everybody will retreat to their ideological corner. And, and so nobody will- nobody will listen. I think maybe the best thing to do is just to rerun the videos. MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Trump Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was with us on Face the Nation recently, and he revealed some pretty shocking things about what he witnessed when he was part of the administration. Unconstitutional, illegal, immoral actions. Firing missiles into Mexico. Shooting American protesters in the legs. Did you know that these types of ideas were being considered at that time? GATES: A few of them. Not, not those specific ones, but, but some others that he talks about. So- and people would call me from the Pentagon and tell me that, you know, we're- we're wrestling with how to respond to this. So I had some flavor of it, but none of the kind of detail that- that Mark Esper has in his book. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe President Trump running for office again would present that threat to national security? GATES: It would concern me. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a very diplomatic phrase. GATES: That's and that's- that's where I am. ROBERT GATES: I think it's huge, Margaret. I think it changes the geopolitics in Europe in a dramatic way. Now he's got NATO on his doorstep, not only in Ukraine and elsewhere, he's going to have them on his border in Finland. And- and you know, it's an amazing thing he's done because he's- he's gotten Sweden to abandon 200 years of neutrality. So I think- I think Putin, one of his many, huge miscalculations in invading Ukraine is he has dramatically changed the geostrategic posture of Western Europe. And now that you have the Swedes and the Finns as part of that, he's really put Russia in a- in a much worse strategic position than it had before the invasion. MARGARET BRENNAN: But he could still win, Vladimir Putin could still win in Ukraine? GATES: If winning means taking over the country and absorbing it into Russia, the whole country, I think that's very unlikely at this point. He has the potential to hold on to a good part of the Donbass. But I think in terms of pushing on to Odessa or trying to bring a change of government in Kyiv or absorb Ukraine, I think if that's winning, I don't see that he can win. MARGARET BRENNAN: What are the security guarantees that the West needs to put in Zelenskyy's hands, to put in Ukraine's hands, to actually broker a deal? GATES: I think access to Western weapons, continued training by NATO countries, including the United States. A promise to have a- keep a large NATO's presence in Eastern Europe next door to Ukraine, the supply lines. The other thing that I think is really going to be critically important, especially if this conflict drags on for a very long time, is the West has to come together and figure out some way to help Ukraine economically, long term. Both short term humanitarian needs, but then rebuilding MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a concern that if Putin is cornered, that he would actually use a tactical nuke? GATES: I think the probability of him using a tactical nuclear weapon is low, but not zero. There are no large masses of Ukrainian forces that would be taken out by a tactical nuclear weapon. And if it's not got a military purpose, then the only purpose is as a terror weapon to try and break the will of the Ukrainian people. And I think that moment has come and gone. I don't think that there's anything at this point that will break the will of the Ukrainian people. The other thing that I hope somebody around Putin is reminding him is that, in that part of the world, and particularly in eastern Ukraine, the winds tend to blow from the west. If you set off a tactical nuclear weapon in eastern Ukraine, it's going to- the radiation is going to go into Russia. So I just hope somebody reminds him of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've called Vladimir Putin a man of the past. But when I talk to officials now, they say he could be around for another decade. GATES: His invasion has- has weakened Russia and it's got now long term economic problems. Europe, I think, is very serious at this point about weaning itself away from Russian- dependence on Russian oil and gas. So that will weaken Russia significantly. Where where is he going to find that market around the world for-\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: China?\u00a0 GATES: China is not going to want to become dependent on Russia for its energy sources. China will want to remain diversified. They might buy some more Russian oil and gas, but nothing like what would be required to replace the European market.Putin will remain a pariah. It's hard to see Putin ever walking in the door of the White House or number ten Downing Street or at the Elysee. So I-I think Russia- he has put Russia really behind the eight ball economically, militarily, and because now people are going to look at the Russian military and say, you know, this was supposed to be this fantastic military. Well, they give a good parade, but in actual combat, not so hot. MARGARET BRENNAN: Xi Jinping is watching what's happening in Ukraine and he is taking notes. What do you think his lesson is so far? GATES: He and Putin have- have had a common narrative about the decline of the West We're paralyzed, we're polarized. We can't get anything done. The alliance was divided and had lost its purpose and so on. Boom. We totally underestimated the West. We underestimated the United States' willingness to take the lead again. We underestimated the willingness of the Europeans to come together and of the United States to put this coalition together. And we underestimated how fast and how severe the sanctions are that they could place. So maybe the West isn't as weak as we thought. Second lesson is looking at the Russian military performance. He's got to ask himself what if my equipment isn't any better than the Russians? What if my troops aren't any better than the Russians? Maybe my military is not as good as they're telling me they are. The Chinese have given the Russians all kinds of rhetorical and political support. But they are doing very little concretely to help the Russians. My guess is, Putin told Xi before the Olympics, look, I'm going to do this. It's going to take a few days and it'll be done I'd wager, that Xi never expected a protracted, brutal conflict that would isolate Russia so much from the rest of the world. And so I think he's playing it actually very cautiously. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the rise of China still inevitable? GATES: China and-and its role as a- growing role as a global power will continue. They do have some real problems. The big issue for Xi where he can't admit he's wrong is on the zero-Covid. And you know, when you shut down a city of 25 million people for weeks and people don't have food, they don't have water, they don't have medical care. This has consequences and-and how can he say I got that wrong when you- its resulted in so much economic and and human cost. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were directly involved in and overseeing the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan for so long. The Taliban is back in power in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda is in the government. Women on the street have to cover their faces and their bodies now. Girls don't have widespread access to education. How do you make sense of where we are now? GATES: Well, I think people predicted every single one of those things would happen if we got out of Afghanistan altogether. I think we made a mistake in pulling everybody out. I think that had we kept a small number of U.S. troops, 5,000, 6,000, something on that order, the contractors would have stayed. The equipment would have been repaired and taken care of. We built- we built a military modeled on our own, which requires a lot of logistical support, a lot of sophisticated maintenance and so on. MARGARET BRENNAN: How was that not known after 20 years of war? How is that dependence not recognized? GATES: I think people did recognize it. And that's one of the reasons that people in the military argued for keeping a number of people there, because only if we had some representation in our military would the contractors who take care of those things been willing to stay, so they weren't at risk. And when you had military, Afghan military suddenly realizing they're getting no ammunition, they're getting no food, they're getting no support and they're isolated. It's kind of no wonder that most of them gave up. It wasn't that they were cowardly or that they were unwilling to fight. It was they had poor leadership. And-and they-they had this dependency on on technical support that went away. MARGARET BRENNAN: You must have seen the special inspector general report that came out just a few days ago. It blamed both President Trump and President Biden for withdrawing the military and contractors. GATES: Don't forget, it started under President Obama. So you have three presidents. MARGARET BRENNAN: You would add culpability there? GATES: Yeah. They all wanted out of Afghanistan, the forever war. But that allows for no shades of gray. It's either all in or out- all out, is the way it was portrayed. And in fact, there were alternatives. And the military put forward some of those alternatives, which was a relatively small number of people that we would plan to keep there for some indefinite period. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhmm. You admitted your own error there in that model of replicating an American type military style and trying to rebuild it within the Afghan forces. GATES: Yeah, I mean, it was well along that way when I got there, but I certainly didn't do anything to change it. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said before, the biggest threat to the United States is our polarization and the distance, the two square miles that encompass the White House and the Capitol building. Do you still feel that way? GATES: Totally. MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see signs of improvement? GATES: No. I will say this: there is one glimmer of hope that I see, and it's in kind of my world. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have done something no other living human beings have done. They've actually brought Republicans and Democrats together on Capitol Hill and with the administration. Apart from a handful of isolationist Republican senators, you've got a pretty - from left to right - a pretty strong consensus in Washington. But I would say it's broader than just Ukraine. You have the same kind of attitudes toward China and how we react to China and to Russia more broadly beyond Ukraine. So maybe that's- maybe that's a foundation. Maybe there's a way to build on that. And who knows, if you begin to get it in national security policy, maybe you can get it in some other places. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'll take the optimism. GATES: Well, I'm not sure I'd take the bet, but you might take the optimism. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time and for having us here again. FORMER SECRETARY ROBERT GATES: Always a pleasure. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start in Asia. President Biden is there and the White House has been clear that there is a very real risk that North Korea could test either a nuclear weapon or another missile while the President is in the region, if that happens. What should the U.S. do? ROBERT GATES: I think that it's basically for demonstration purposes. It's sort of you've forgotten about me on the part of Kim Jong Un. And, um, you know, you got to pay attention to me. This is what he does when he feels like he's being taken for granted or being ignored. MARGARET BRENNAN: Kim Jong Un. ROBERT GATES: Kim Jong Un. Um, and, and so I think- I think that the best way to respond would be to do nothing, frankly. I think the reaffirmation of our defense ties with South Korea and the other visits that he's making, it speaks for itself in terms of our position out there and I don't think we need to respond to the- to the bratty child. MARGARET BRENNAN: The bratty child. You told me two years ago that North Korea will never denuclearize, in your view. If their program continues to advance, what does that mean for U.S. security? ROBERT GATES: Well, they've had nuclear weapons for some time now and I've never- as- as you suggest, I've never thought that he would denuclearize. And if- and if that view ever was reinforced, it's been by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here's Ukraine, gave up its nuclear weapons 1800 of them in 1994 in exchange for recognition of its borders by the U.S., the U.K. and Russia, and now look what's happened to them. So as Kim Jong Un looks at that, he's going to say, why- why would I ever do this? The question is whether there is a- a diplomatic approach that limits the number of nuclear weapons he has and perhaps the missiles, that gets the threat- keeps the threat at a very low level where he has the weapons to deter an attack on North Korea, but not enough to be a serious threat to other countries in Asia or to the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move now to- to Russia and Ukraine. You've said in more than one interview that President Biden, when you knew him, was wrong on foreign policy as a senator, as a vice president for 40 years. Given that, how do you assess how he's doing now with this threat from Russia? ROBERT GATES: I think the administration was slow to come to Ukraine's help last year. I think we could have sent weapons sooner and more of the kind of weapons we're- we're sending now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Prior to February 24th and the invasion? ROBERT GATES: Prior to last fall. That said, I think beginning in the late fall, early winter, when they began releasing the intelligence to demonstrate what Putin's intentions were going to be, I think they handled this well. I think that they deserve to be commended for the speed with which they put together a coalition. The president put together a coalition. I think it's extraordinary that you're getting unanimity on the severity of the sanctions on Russia. The turn of attitudes in- in Europe has been in no small part due to American leadership and American intelligence and Putin's brutality. So I think that- I think that they've handled it properly. I think the president made the right decision on no-fly zone. I think that he's made the right decision not to react to Putin's threat of using nuclear weapons, of just kind of cooling it on that. So I think- I think beginning last early winter, late fall, I think they've handled it pretty well since then. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden is trying to usher in these two new NATO's members, Sweden and Finland, into the alliance. That's a personal project for him. How strategically important is that? ROBERT GATES: I think it's huge, Margaret. I think it changes the geopolitics in Europe in a dramatic way. If you go back to last fall and Putin's demands, one of those demands was to push NATO back to where they were in 1997. Well, instead of that, he's now got over a hundred thousand American troops in Europe, many of them in Poland, and on other front lines, and more NATO allies in- on those front lines. And now with- if Finland becomes a member, another 800 mile direct border between Russia and NATO, the whole purpose of moving them back to 1997 was to keep that East European buffer between NATO and Russia. Now he's got NATO on his doorstep, not only in Ukraine and elsewhere, he's going to have them on his border in Finland. And- and you know, it's an amazing thing he's done because he's- he's gotten Sweden to abandon 200 years of neutrality. And guess what? The last war Sweden fought was actually against the Russians. And- and both the Finns and the Russian- Finns and the Swedes have terrific militaries. They're well-equipped. They train. They're- they're a real asset. So Putin says the other day, you know, he tells the president of Finland, you know, if you don't put NATO infrastructure into Finland, we can probably live with this. He didn't say those words, but it was basically that- that would be a problem for Russia. So a lot of the bluster and so on associated with this was not in that phone call. And- and the truth of the matter is, Finland doesn't need NATO infrastructure. It already has the infrastructure. We've been training with the Finns for years. This isn't- this isn't a new thing. So- So I think it's a huge change. I think the change in Germany, their commitment to increase their defense spending and really make their military work is also huge. So I think- I think Putin, one of his many, huge miscalculations in invading Ukraine is he has dramatically changed the geostrategic posture of Western Europe. And now that you have the Swedes and the Finns as part of that, he's really put Russia in a- in a much worse strategic position than it had before the invasion. MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia is weaker now after the invasion? ROBERT GATES: Yes. Yes, I think they're weaker in- on a number of counts. Their economy is going to get weaker. Their military is going to get weaker because they can't import the kinds of precision, the things that are necessary for precision-guided munitions and various other technologies. They've changed their strategic deployments. Their military has suffered huge losses. So, yes, I think- I think Russia already is weaker than before the invasion. MARGARET BRENNAN: But he could still win, Vladimir Putin could still win in Ukraine? ROBERT GATES: I think that would be a big challenge at this point. If winning means taking over the country and absorbing it into Russia, the whole country, I think that's very unlikely at this point. Will he succeed in taking a big swath of the Donbass? And he's now already trying to incorporate that into Russia and actually absorb them. He's got the land bridge to Crimea by taking Mariupol. And- and so he has the potential to hold on to a good part of the Donbass. But I think in terms of pushing on to Odesa or trying to bring a change of government in Kyiv or absorb Ukraine, I think if that's winning, I don't see that he can win. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration describes its strategy not necessarily as about winning, but about strengthening the hand of the Ukrainians, both on the battlefield now and at a future negotiating table. What are the security guarantees that the West needs to put in Zelenskyy's hands, to put in Ukraine's hands, to actually broker a deal? ROBERT GATES: Well, I think that- I think that joining NATO is probably still not in the cards. So- so then the question becomes to your point, what kind of assurances can we give Ukraine? And I think access to Western weapons, continued training by NATO countries, including the United States. So there are some things in terms of building a security relationship that actually were going on well before the invasion, which helps explain in part how well the Ukrainians are doing because of all the training they've gotten since 2014. So I think- I think there are a variety of security assurances that you can give in terms of access to weapons, a promise to have a- keep a large NATO's presence in Eastern Europe next door to Ukraine, the supply lines. The other thing that I think is really going to be critically important, especially if this conflict drags on for a very long time, is the West has to come together and figure out some way to help Ukraine economically, long term. Both short term humanitarian needs, but then rebuilding. And- and I think, you know, I think we also have to if- if the fighting basically is concentrated in the east, if there is some sort of tacit cease fire, and if we get to the point of providing assurances, I think one of those assurances ought to be a warning to Russia that if they launch missiles against the part of Ukraine, they don't occupy, whether it's Kyiv or Lviv or any place else, that we will provide a different kind of weapon to the Ukrainians so that they have the ability to retaliate. So I think that would be part of assurances once- once the conflict sort of winds down, if you will, at some point, though, that could be one of the assurances. MARGARET BRENNAN: When I interviewed President Zelenskyy, he said he doesn't trust pieces of paper anymore. He was referring to assurances his country has been given in the past. You're deliberate in your language, assurances versus guarantees? ROBERT GATES: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there any kind of military weaponry, any kind of actual hard guarantee that someone like Zelenskyy could feel confident when sitting across from Vladimir Putin to say, if you do this again in two years, they've got my back. ROBERT GATES:I think that- I mean, one aspect, one- one approach that you might try is- is basically giving him assurances that if Russia launches missile attacks against targets in Ukraine outside of the Donbass, outside of areas Russia occupies, the United States has agreed to give me these specific weapons. MARGARET BRENNAN: Iron Dome? Or those kind of things? ROBERT GATES: Whatever. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 U.S. intelligence says there's no sign right now that Russia is actually looking to use its nuclear arsenal in this conflict. But there are those threats Vladimir Putin has made. Do you have a concern that if Putin is cornered, that he would actually use a tactical nuke? GATES: I think that- I think the probability of him using a tactical nuclear weapon is low, but not zero. First of all, it makes no military sense the way the Ukrainians are fighting this war. There are no large masses of Ukrainian forces that would be taken out by a tactical nuclear weapon. The only way it makes sense militarily is a series of weapons, the use of a series of nuclear weapons. But even one or a few, at this point, I don't think can change the military equation on the ground. And if it's not got a military purpose, then the only purpose is as a terror weapon to try and break the will of the Ukrainian people. And I think that moment has come and gone. I don't think that there's anything at this point that will break the will of the Ukrainian people. The two other things that he has to take into account is that I think the use of a tactical nuclear weapon, even one, would be a game changer for the West. And I think we would begin then to do some things we have refrained from doing up to now. I think at that point, a no fly zone becomes a possibility. I think providing more sophisticated and longer range weaponry becomes a possibility. The other thing that I hope somebody around Putin is reminding him is that, in that part of the world, and particularly in eastern Ukraine, the winds tend to blow from the west. If you set off a tactical nuclear weapon in eastern Ukraine, it's going to- the radiation is going to go into Russia. So I just hope somebody reminds him of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Maybe he'll watch your interview. But one of the other arguments here about even just the threat of nukes is that it gets the West to think twice. Do you, in your assessment of President Biden, see signs that he is holding back \"self deterrence\", is the criticism? GATES: No, actually, I think they've handled this aspect of this whole invasion well in the sense of not giving into it. The minute somebody threatens to use nuclear weapons and you back off because of that threat, you've opened Taiwan to an invasion. You've created all kinds of possibilities for Iran, for North Korea, for others. And so you can't let yourself be deterred by threats, by another power to use nuclear weapons in a situation. Otherwise you might as well give up and go home. So the thing is to make clear what the consequences of using a nuclear weapon would be, the risks of escalation and of things getting out of control. So I think that not being deterred by these threats has been important, and I think they've handled that piece of it. I think the president was right when he didn't raise our nuclear alert level when the Russians did. I think that he has responded appropriately to not giving in to these threats by Putin or them or being intimidated by them. MARGARET BRENNAN: You- I was reading some of your recent transcripts from interviews you've done, and you've called Vladimir Putin a man of the past. He's all about lost glory, lost empire, lost power. But when I talk to officials now, they say he could be around for another decade. So he will shape the future. How does the West plan for that? Does he remain a threat to the security of Europe? And how do you build around that? GATES: Well, I think I think, first of all, his invasion has- has weakened Russia and it's got now long term economic problems. Europe, I think, is very serious at this point about weaning itself away from Russian- dependence on Russian oil and gas. I was there in the Reagan administration as deputy director at CIA when we tried to persuade the Europeans that letting the Russians build those pipelines was a stupid mistake, and that they would end up politically on the fence, on the defensive with the Russians, that they could use this as a political weapon. And not only did the Europeans want them, they provided the steel, the pumps, the turbines, and they even provided the financing. So they've finally done, after 40 years what we told them they ought not do 40 years ago, and- in terms of a reliance on Russia. So that will weaken Russia significantly. Where where is he going to find that market around the world for-\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: China?\u00a0 GATES: China is not going to want to become dependent on Russia for its energy sources. China will want to remain diversified. They might buy some more Russian oil and gas, but nothing like what would be required to replace the European market. So I think there's a long term weakening. I can't imagine these sanctions coming off or most of these sanctions coming off as long as Putin is in power. Putin will remain a pariah. It's hard to see Putin ever walking in the door of the White House or number ten Downing Street or at the Elysee. So I-I think Russia- he has put Russia really behind the eight ball economically, militarily, and because now people are going to look at the Russian military and say, you know, this was supposed to be this fantastic military. Well, they give a good parade, but in actual combat, not so hot. MARGARET BRENNAN: Reminder to India as they go through with this Russian military purchases? GATES: Well, I think - And I hope the administration is telling the Indians. So you want to buy more of that junk from the- from Russia? You know, we have- we have other options for you. MARGARET BRENNAN:: So I want to ask you about your background in intelligence and how you assess things right now, because U.S. intelligence was spot on about Vladimir Putin's intention here, even when the rest of Europe doubted it. The U.S. said this invasion is going to happen pretty close on the timing of it. But they overestimated Russia's military prowess, underestimated the Ukrainian military's resolve or ability to fight back. How do you bottom line the performance here? GATES: I think the performance of the intelligence community was-was terrific. You know, how do you- what- what agent what signals intelligence can help you gauge the will of a people? And let's take the Ukrainian example. You know, you had the Ukrainian army and we'd done some training. We had- we had some confidence in them. But we saw the mass that the Russians were bringing to bear. But- but how do you measure in any way the moral fiber of a people? And and their willingness to sacrifice and courage. And that's one of those great unknowns in whenever you go to war. And, you know, we can turn the equation around and say, how did we possibly underestimate the performance of the Afghan army? So I think- I just think that those kinds of intangibles are that's a- that's too much to ask of intelligence. I think measuring intentions at all is extremely difficult. The U.S. intelligence is very good at measuring equipment, capability- military capabilities, technological capabilities and so on. It's very hard to measure intentions, and we've gotten it wrong as often as we've gotten it right. You know, we saw the Soviet armies on the border of Afghanistan. We didn't think they'd go in because it didn't make any sense. We saw them on the border of Czechoslovakia in 1968. We didn't know that they would actually pull the trigger. So I don't give the intelligence folks any demerits for underestimating will. I don't know how you- I don't know how you measure that. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden says there's a genocide underway in Ukraine. He's described this as this conflict between democracies and autocracies and a battle really sort of for the central values. If those are the high stakes, do you agree that it is not worth using force? GATES: I think that- I think that what is going on in Ukraine is a cultural genocide. If you look at the places where the Russians have occupied in the east, they've looted the museums, they've- they've- they're changing things in the schools there. They're basically doing everything they can to get rid of anything Ukrainian. So I think it is a cultural genocide. I don't think Putin has a plan to eliminate them as a people, he just wants them to be Russians. I think that you have to be very careful about the way that you deploy military forces. And you have to try and think two or three steps ahead. I think we have- we have violated or we have failed to appreciate too often since the end of the Cold War the unpredictable consequences of the use of military force. And once you begin to use military power, the statesman loses control. It's an old edict of of Churchill's once- once the bombs start to drop, the politicians, the leaders are not in control anymore. And- and so I think when you're facing off with a superpower that is nuclear armed, You need to be very cautious about the role that you decide to take in a conflict. And I think the other lesson we've learned since the end of the Cold War is that the use of military force to change a regime, or to try and change a country, Is-is a very long gamble. And- and we have not been very good at it. And there are very few examples of success. So in the case of Ukraine, I think in terms of NATO, you know, the President has been very explicit. He will protect every inch of NATO territory. So where that test could come is what if the Russians launch attacks against some of the supply depots in Poland? I think that could be a game changer. But again, I think it would be more in doing different things to enable the Ukrainians than it is for us to directly intervene. MARGARET BRENNAN: One global consequence of this war is the added spike in the price of a lot of food, grain. Scarcity of some of that. The UN has warned millions of people around the world will die because Ukrainian grain can't get out to market because the ports are blocked. Should there be military intervention to allow for that? GATES: Well, if you want to go to war with Russia, because that's what it would take. I don't know how you intimidate Putin into pulling his blockade when our ability to put significant naval power into the Black Sea is- is very limited. And so are you going to use aircraft and just sink their warships? If the Ukrainians can sink them, that's fine. You know, like the Moskva. But- but I think- I think the use of force to try and break that blockade would be a mistake. And so the question is, can Europe come together and can we provide assistance in helping the Ukrainians get more of that food out by land, by convoy, by railroad, whatever? And it's a little bit like the Berlin airlift in the sense that we chose not to confront the Russians militarily. We just bypassed their blockade. And so, I think- I think that the likelihood of trying to get rid of that blockade militarily by the NATO's or the U.S. invites a direct conflict with Russia. On the other hand, perhaps giving the Ukrainians some capability to take care of some of those ships and to make the cost higher for the Russians is certainly worth considering. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Vladimir Putin, the implication is, can't be negotiated into it. I mean, he is weaponizing- GATES: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Inflation and food. GATES: I don't think he can be talked into that now. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move on to China. Xi Jinping is watching what's happening in Ukraine and he is taking notes. What do you think his lesson is so far? GATES: I hope that he's taking at least three lessons out of this. The first is he and Putin have- have had a common narrative about the decline of the West and-and-and that the- the arc of history, if you will, is on his side and the side of the authoritarians. We're paralyzed, we're polarized. We can't get anything done. We can't build infrastructure. We can't deal with any of our big problems, and we're divided internally. The alliance was divided and had lost its purpose and so on. Boom. So first lesson is we totally underestimated the West. We underestimated the United States' willingness to take the lead again. We underestimated the willingness of the Europeans to come together and of the United States to put this coalition together. And we underestimated how fast and how severe the sanctions are that they could place. So maybe the West isn't as weak as we thought. Second lesson is looking at the Russian military performance. He's got to ask himself, you know, Putin and I both spent hundreds of billions of dollars in the last 15, last ten years or so, 15 years. Russia and China have spent all this money on our- our militaries. And what if my equipment isn't any better than the Russians? What if my troops aren't any better than the Russians? What if my commanders aren't any better than the Russians? Chinese haven't fought since they fought the Vietnamese in 1979. So second question is maybe my military is not as good as they're telling me they are. And then the third question, the third point or lesson that I hope he's taking is looking at the way the Ukrainians have defended their country and the resolve and the courage they have shown. And what if the Taiwanese fight like that? What if the United States and the others give the Taiwanese the kind of weapons that enable them, as the saying goes, to become a porcupine? Very difficult for us to take. And by the way, we've never done an amphibious landing. So maybe that's something to think about. So I think- I think there are at least those three lessons. The interesting thing to me about the Chinese response and, you know, before the Olympics, they pledged that this was a limitless partnership or friendship or whatever. The Chinese have given the Russians all kinds of rhetorical and political support. But they are doing very little concretely to help the Russians. Their banks are complying with the sanctions on Russia. They don't want to end up at the other end of secondary sanctions that affect their banks at a time when Xi is facing some real economic pressures of his own. He doesn't want to get cross threaded on or any of the sanctions, not just the financial sanctions. I don't think we're seeing any evidence of the Chinese providing military equipment or supplies to the Russians. I don't think- I think they may buy some more food and some more oil and gas, but they're not going to buy a lot of it. So I think Practically speaking, the Chinese have been very cautious about this. My guess is, Putin told Xi before the Olympics, look, I'm going to do this. It's going to take a few days and it'll be done, and we'll be in an even more powerful position. I don't think I'd wager that Xi never expected a protracted, brutal conflict that would isolate Russia so much from the rest of the world. And so I think he's playing it actually very cautiously. MARGARET BRENNAN: So China's has some of its own economic problems. It's got a real estate bubble. It's got these continued rolling Covid lockdowns, the zero-Covid strategy. So given what you just said, plus that. Is the rise of China still inevitable? GATES: I think- I think that the continuing growth of China and-and its role as a- growing role as a global power will continue. They do have some real problems. I mean, Xi's line that we've read about is telling his advisors, I don't care what you do, but our growth rate has to be higher than the Americans this year. That's a pretty interesting comment. And, you know, he's just looking toward this Congress in November and this fall when he'll get his third term or president for life or whatever, and he can be up there in the pantheon with Mao. So I think he's not likely to do much disruptive. They've already seen that in the restrictions and the regulations they put on their tech companies, they're killing the golden goose. So they've started to lift those sanctions and some of those restrictions so that the tech people can kind of get back at what they were doing best, which was making money. And- and so I think that they are self-correcting some. I actually think Xi and Putin are both an example right now of what happens when a country has one man rule and nobody around them to tell them, that's a terrible mistake you're about to make. And so she has put you know, he's a real ideologue and he's put all these Communist Party representatives on company boards and, you know, watchdogs in the- in the companies and so on, and that's deflating Chinese growth. Those are easily reversible decisions. And so the question is whether he sees that as-as something necessary, it's already apparent that he does because he's as I said, they've lifted some of these restrictions. But there - the question is whether there are some growing voices inside China that are cautioning him about some of these things and that some of his decisions have led to the economic problems that they're having. The big issue for Xi where he can't admit he's wrong is on the zero-Covid. And you know, when you shut down a city of 25 million people for weeks and people don't have food, they don't have water, they don't have medical care. This has consequences and-and how can he say I got that wrong when you- its resulted in so much economic and and human cost. MARGARET BRENNAN: We are on the cusp of Memorial Day. You were directly involved in and overseeing the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan for so long. The Taliban is back in power in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda is in the government. Women on the street have to cover their faces and their bodies now. It's regulated and enforced. Men in their homes have to enforce it. Girls don't have widespread access to education. How do you make sense of where we are now? GATES: Well, I think people predicted every single one of those things would happen if we got out of Afghanistan altogether. And-and I think- I think we made a mistake in pulling everybody out. We've had small numbers of U.S. forces in a number of countries for many years and have prevented things from getting worse or have staved off bad consequences. I think that had we kept a small number of U.S. troops, 5,000, 6,000, something on that order. The contractors would have stayed. The equipment would have been repaired and taken care of. We built- we built a military modeled on our own, which requires a lot of logistical support, a lot of sophisticated maintenance and so on. MARGARET BRENNAN: How was that not known after 20 years of war? How is that dependence not recognized? GATES: Well, I think- I think people did recognize it. And that's one of the reasons that people in the military argued for keeping a number of people there, because only if we had some representation in our military would the contractors who take care of those things been willing to stay, so they weren't at risk. So in a way, a small number of U.S. forces enabled the support structure to continue to exist. When we pulled everybody out, we- we took the props out from under the Afghan military. And when you had military, Afghan military suddenly realizing they're getting no ammunition, they're getting no food, they're getting no support and they're isolated. It's kind of no wonder that most of them gave up. But I think- I think it's important to remember that over the years, tens of thousands of Afghan men served and a lot of them died. A lot more Afghans died in that war against the Taliban than Americans or other allies did. So it wasn't that they were cowardly or that they were unwilling to fight. It was they had poor leadership. And-and they-they had this dependency on on technical support that went away. MARGARET BRENNAN: You must have seen the special inspector general report that came out just a few days ago and it said, what you just put your finger on there? When the contractors pulled out, it was like we pulled all the sticks out of the Jenga pile and expected it to stay up. But it blamed both President Trump and President Biden for withdrawing the military and contractors. GATES: Don't forget, it started under President Obama. So you have three presidents. MARGARET BRENNAN: You would add culpability there? GATES: Yeah. They all wanted out of Afghanistan, the forever war. But that allows for no shades of grey. It's either all in or out- all out, is the way it was portrayed. And in fact, there were alternatives. And the military put forward some of those alternatives, which was a relatively small number of people that we would plan to keep there for some indefinite period. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhmm. You admitted your own error there in that model of replicating an American type military style and trying to rebuild it within the Afghan forces. GATES: Yeah, I mean, it was well along that way when I got there, but I certainly didn't do anything to change it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you know that at the time? Did you see that there was the risk for this scenario? GATES: I don't think- I don't think early on I fully grasped how dependent that- that our ability to get out was contingent on figuring out how to- how for them, how they could be self-sustaining. In a way, the same thing happened with the Iraqis, with ISIS. You know, they had a bunch of corrupt generals. When we left, we had trained and helped pick many of the Iraqi generals within a relatively short period of time. After we had left, Maliki and others had removed all the generals we trained and put in a bunch of political hacks. And these young men in the Iraqi armed forces weren't going to fight and die for these guys. And the generals were the first ones to run. So it's a similar situation. And I- you know. But I do think that that was an error and I talked about it early on that we needed to create- I couldn't understand why our Afghan troops weren't as self-sustaining as the Taliban, and it was that we had created a different model. Instead of creating an Afghan army that reflected Afghan military strengths and capabilities, we created a Western model, and I think that was a fundamental error. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree that the Trump deal with the Taliban, the February 2020 deal that Mike Pompeo helped broker, that that was a strategic mistake? GATES: Yes, I do. MARGARET BRENNAN: The report came to that conclusion as well. GATES: Yes. And I think President Biden's decision to reinforce it-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --To stick with it-- GATES: --was a mistake as well- To stick with it. MARGARET BRENNAN: He'd argue it was a US agreement, had to be recognized and stuck by. GATES: Well, so is the Iraq- So is the Iranian nuclear deal. We didn't have a problem reversing that. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden's trying to reenter that one.\u00a0 GATES: True.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But for Americans who- who lost a loved one in combat over those 20 years of war, these are painful things to hear right now and to think of the people that they lost. How do you personally process that? How do you say it was worth it? GATES: Well, what I tell them is that they- they bought the Afghans 20 years of development, of opportunity for women, of the opportunity for freedom of the press. People who weren't in Afghanistan never realized how much of a free press Afghanistan had while we were there. The schooling for girls. The- the building of- of health centers within an hour's walk of villages. We accomplished a lot in Afghanistan for the Afghans. We kind of gave them the same chance we gave the Iraqis. The Iraqis have taken better advantage of the opportunity we gave them. It's an- Iraq has a very flawed democracy today, but it's the only democracy in the Middle East. And the politicians are at least shouting at each other, not shooting at each other. And- and we presented the same kind of opportunity with the surge in 2010 in Afghanistan. And we- we basically pushed the Taliban mostly out of the- out of Kandahar, out of Helmand and places like that. But we couldn't hold it forever without the Afghans doing their part. And that meant the politicians in Afghanistan and- and they simply failed to take advantage of the opportunity we gave them. So I tell the young men and women who served, you did an amazing thing. You did your job. You accomplish the mission, your mission, which was to get rid of- get-push the Taliban out and keep al Qaeda out. They did that. And- and you gave the Afghans tremendous opportunities. That- that was an extraordinary achievement. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said before, the biggest threat to the United States is our polarization and the distance, the two square miles that encompass the White House and the Capitol building. Do you still feel that way? GATES: Totally. MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see signs of improvement? GATES: No. I will say this: there is one glimmer of hope that I see, and it's in kind of my world. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have done something no other living human beings have done. They've actually brought Republicans and Democrats together on Capitol Hill and with the administration. MARGARET BRENNAN: On this one issue.\u00a0 GATES: On this issue. On Ukraine. And you have really, you know, apart from a handful of isolationist Republican senators, you've got a pretty - from left to right - a pretty strong consensus in Washington that we have to do what we're doing with respect to Ukraine. But I would say it's broader than just Ukraine. You have the same kind of attitudes toward China and how we react to China and to Russia more broadly beyond Ukraine. So maybe that's- maybe that's a foundation for once again figuring out how to have a more bipartisan foreign policy or national security policy. Maybe there's a way to build on that. And who knows, if you begin to get it in national security policy, maybe you can get it in some other places. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'll take the optimism. GATES: Well, I'm not sure I'd take the bet, but you might take the optimism. MARGARET BRENANAN: Because, I mean, you've said that you've been disappointed in Republican leaders for not standing up for traditional Republican values. We just had this awful shooting in Buffalo, New York. Liz Cheney, Congresswoman, said, \"House GOP leadership has enabled white nationalism, white supremacy and anti-Semitism. History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse. Republican leaders must renounce and reject these views and those who hold them.\" Do you think Republican leaders are enabling those things she said? GATES: I don't know that- I don't know that I would go that far. I do know that there aren't enough of them denouncing those things, denouncing white supremacy, denouncing- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? GATES: Um, I think- I think they, you know, my- my concern- my broader concern, Margaret, is- is that we just- we have too many people who- who are in politics to further their own agendas and to further their own personal prospects rather than what's good for the country. And I would say that's true in both parties. They- they both seem to have forgotten that the only way democracy works is through compromise. And- and when you lay down the law and say, \"We're not- not one single vote is going to go for this or that, whatever it is.\" If- if compromise is impossible, then progress is impossible. And- and that's one of my biggest worries. And, you know, it kind of comes from American people, American students no longer taking civics in school about how the system works. And, and, you know, this is where the founders were so brilliant. They created this system where, you know, if- if you don't compromise, you can't- you can't move forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it is important for the American public to have a full accounting of the events of January 6th with these public hearings that are planned in the weeks ahead? GATES: I think so. I do. I think, I think that those- the- what happened on January 6th was- was a huge blight on our democracy. And- and if you don't think that the Chinese and the Russians are trumpeting what happened on January 6th to everybody in the world through their propaganda networks, people aren't paying attention. It's a- it's a big win for them in arguing that democracy doesn't work, that our authoritarian approach is actually the only system of government that actually works. Because look at what we've accomplished and look how messed up these guys are. MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's a school of thought that says this is a political circus. Let the Department of Justice prosecute people who carried out the violence. Don't go ahead with these public hearings. You think there is value in having this aired publicly? GATES: I think so, yes. I think people need to understand. My worry is that people will- that everybody will retreat to their ideological corner. And- and the Democrats will, a lot of Democrats will say, see, this proves how terrible these people are, and everybody. And all the- all the Republicans- and the Republicans will say, you know, this is just a political show trial. And, and so nobody will- nobody will listen. I think maybe the best thing to do is just to rerun the videos. MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Trump Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was with us on Face the Nation recently, and he revealed some pretty shocking things about what he witnessed when he was part of the administration. Unconstitutional, illegal, immoral actions. Firing missiles into Mexico. Shooting American protesters in the legs. Did you know that these types of ideas were being considered at that time? GATES: A few of them. Not, not those specific ones, but, but some others that he talks about. So- and people would call me from the Pentagon and tell me that, you know, we're- we're wrestling with how to respond to this. So I had some flavor of it, but none of the kind of detail that- that Mark Esper has in his book. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think, though, that the American people deserved to know that these things were happening and being discussed at that time? GATES: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: There's criticism of Esper and other former officials for not speaking out. And that in that moment. GATES: You know, Margaret, this is one of the toughest. Toughest decisions a public servant has to make. Do you when you're faced with a terrible situation? I joined the Nixon administration. I went to the NSC staff from CIA a few months before Nixon resigned. And I always like to describe it that it was like signing on as a deckhand on the Titanic after it hit the iceberg. But you're always faced with a president making. decisions that you disagree with or even find abhorrent. And and for the most senior people, the question always is, 'do I stay and try and mitigate it? Or do I leave and make way for somebody who will be who will be, who may support those things or who will just do what he or she is told?' And figuring out that line, I think, is is very tough. Sometimes\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: There is that other option of the 25th Amendment of trying to remove the president from office. GATES: Well, that requires. I can't remember the percentage of the cabinet that has to sign on, whether it's two thirds or or whatever. But, you know, you what I would call the power ministries, the secretary of state, secretary of defense, attorney general, secretary of the Treasury. You might actually get those people on board. But when you start talking about the secretary of Health and Human Services and the secretary of Commerce and Housing and Urban Development and so on, they have, I think, sometimes a different calculus, I think. I think trying to and absent a president who is clearly physically or mentally incapable, I think it would be almost impossible to get the 25th Amendment to work. MARGARET BRENNAN: So that backstop really isn't there? GATES:I don't think so. I don't think in practical terms, I don't think it's there, again, absent obvious disability. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Esper says that the former president is a risk to national security. Do you believe President Trump running for office again would present that threat to national security? GATES: It would concern me. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a very diplomatic phrase. GATES:That's and that's that's where I am. MARGARET BRENNAN: It would concern you? GATES:Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you see reason for optimism, or signs of leadership within the party right now? GATES: You know, I Margaret, I worked for eight presidents over almost a half a century and, uh, and the way I was able to do that was keep my personal politics to myself. And- and I frankly just don't want to go down that road. MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see you don't want to name names, is what you're saying in terms of leadership and inspiration.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We are headed towards a potentially historic Supreme Court decision on Roe v. Wade and whether to uphold it. When you heard about the leak of that draft decision, did that concern you? Do you see this as a threat to another U.S. institution? GATES: I do. I went to Washington 56 years ago and I cannot ever recall a leak like that coming out of the Supreme Court. And it destroys the thing about leaks as they destroy institutional trust. George Shultz always used to say trust is the coin of the realm. And- and, on- on so many really significant decisions in the past, there have been no such leaks. And I'm- I worry it's just a reflection of the continued deterioration of the political climate in this country that now it's even affecting the Supreme Court. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why should it be different than those other branches of government where leaks happen all the time? GATES: Well, and I would argue that that leaks are very destructive and particularly of really sensitive things. For example, I think you have to- you have to be careful about discussing leaks in general. So, for example, the Pentagon leaks like a sieve when it comes to weapons programs, decisions on big dollars going places. I don't recall any- any leak of consequence the entire time I was secretary on military operations. Everybody knows, lives are at stake. Young men and women may die because you leak something. Same thing with very sensitive intelligence sources. And on the other hand, you know, if there's an internal battle over something, the internal politics, those- those things are just part of the- part of the furniture in government. But this kind of a consequential leak on such an important matter, I think undermines trust in the institution. And one of the things that I worry most about now is the level of mistrust on the part of a lot of Americans, both Republicans and Democrats and independents, for that matter, in almost all of our institutions now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Justice Thomas said, I wonder how long we're going to have some of these institutions at the rate we're undermining them. That raised some eyebrows given his wife's support for overturning the election. But the sentiment itself, 'wonder if the institutions that we'll still have them?' GATES: I think I think the institutions will survive. But what do they look like?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 GATES: What kind of people can you get to come staff those institutions. That's what gets undermined. That and the effectiveness of those institutions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhmm.\u00a0 GATES: That's what gets undermined. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time. GATES: My pleasure. Thanks again, Margaret.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Jared Holt of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and Karen Kornbluh of the German Marshall Fund that aired Sunday, Sept. 4, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" INTRO: Political violence and riots can often be traced back to the rise of online extremism. We spoke earlier with two experts on the problem and its potential solutions -- Jared Holt, the senior research manager at the institute for strategic dialogue and Karen Kornbluh, the head of the German Marshall Fund's Digital Innovations and Democracy Initiative -- and we began by asking them to characterize the relationship between the internet and democracy. JARED HOLT: Tenuous. The internet in the way that it is monetized in the current age is through attention, you can get a lot of attention saying crazy stuff and we've seen a lot of people do that, frankly. So you know, as long as the business model of the internet is built around trying to captivate audiences and keep them clicking, reacting, whether that's through rage or diehard support. It's going to be in conflict with democracy, because democracy is not about what gets the most attention. It's supposed to be about, you know, what the best ideas are, how do we compromise? How do we move forward? In this attention-based economy online, is incongruent with that mission. MAJOR GARRETT: Karen, complete this sentence: the internet's relationship to democracy is? KAREN KORNBLUH: Fraught, it's definitely fraught, in the early days of the internet, it offered incredible promise, and it still does, you know, all of these movements, Black Lives Matter, Me Too, were able to gain steam online and that it just continues to offer the kind of promise of educating people, informing them, connecting them. But these algorithms really have contributed to the crisis we're in. And the platforms have a real responsibility to fix them, and to help fix the problem that they've helped create. MAJOR GARRETT: Jared, from a libertarian perspective, one might argue, look, people are out there, they decide what they want to consume, there is agency as you indicated, so the internet isn't a problem. These people are out there. They have their beliefs, and they're going to pursue it- or is it that you're arguing the internet is an accelerator and a multiplier? HOLT: It's an accelerator and a multiplier, this kind of content, conspiratorial content, extremist movements have existed in America for as long as America has been around, right? These platforms are designed guiding people towards more extreme content, what they're not taking down, what they're giving a free pass to, people who are using these platforms to manipulate audiences, and guide them and steer them. MAJOR GARRETT: From your perspective, is January 6, and it's magnitude impossible without this multiplier accelerationist effect. HOLT: It's very safe to say that it wouldn't have happened the way that it did, at the scale that it did coming together as fast as it did, without the internet. A lot of attention was paid to fringe platforms like Parlor, after the riot. But a lot of the agitation and calls to action were happening on mainstream platforms from mainstream figures. MAJOR GARRETT: For those on the right, who say, you're missing this whole point, the point is, we get canceled, we get de-platformed, and that's big tech silencing us. So, our rights are the ones being trampled, you would say? KORNBLUH: This is the danger of the whack a mole solution. Not only is it ineffective, too little too late, but it also raises all kinds of free expression concerns because it takes down content and takes down people after the fact. I'd love to see the platforms not only fix their algorithms, but when they publish their terms of service, really commit themselves to enforce what they've put out there, and not have so much discretion. It's this kind of discretion that I think really bothers people and makes them feel that they can't get on these very few opportunities for speech. MAJOR GARRETT: Jared, what happened in these places you are describing Parler, Gettr, other parts of the web that maybe aren't as well trafficked as others after the Mar a Lago execution of a search warrant? HOLT: These spaces online, pro-Trump forums, fringe platforms, just really erupted with violent rhetoric. There's these false beliefs that the FBI or law enforcement is out to get conservatives and Trump supporters specifically. But we saw that paired with also a lot of violent rhetoric, taking their existing beliefs that the system is compromised, and ratcheting it up to the next level, saying, you know, we need to do something, whether that's protesting, or whether that's taking it as far as that individual in Cincinnati did, trying to breach the FBI office there. MAJOR GARRETT: Karen, what can Congress do? KORNBLUH: There's bipartisan concern, but there's really not bipartisan action. The proposals on algorithmic accountability, I think, offer real promise, but so far, they don't include any kind of enforcement mechanism. Given the tinderbox that we're in, I think we really have to turn to the platforms and ask them to step up. MAJOR GARRETT: What are you looking at in terms of these realities? They're not going to change before the midterm elections and multiplier effects, accelerationist effect on the web, heading toward the midterms? KORNBLUH: There are two things, two urgent things, that I would say that the platforms could do. First, they should stop siloing people, directing people into these bubbles that reinforce extremist worldviews and don't let in opposing viewpoints. And second, they should really work with the providers of important civic information, people like election administration officials, to help them amplify accurate information so that people can be empowered and actually know what- what's going on. MAJOR GARRETT: What does this conversation and these underlying realities mean, as America grapples with what appears to be a rise in white nationalism, white supremacy?\u00a0 HOLT: The internet has been a really powerful tool for extremist movements in the US, it's been a big accelerant. It's been a big boom. And we've seen consistently on platforms, you know, they all have kind of red lines, that content is not supposed to cross over, if it crosses over. If it's, you know, particularly violent, particularly racist, that kind of material will get banned. But the content that walks right up to that line, that sort of tiptoes on that line, is among the highest performing content on these websites. It's not a level playing field. And that unlevel playing field has been, you know, definitely an accelerant of these issues that we're seeing rise up in American prominence. The kind of stuff that we're talking about today, whether it's misinformation, conspiracy theories, etc. Everybody is vulnerable to this. Rich people, poor people, smart people, not so smart people, everybody can fall victim to this stuff. And it has to do with the manipulative nature of the content. And I just think it's really important to stress that.",

He also discussed what a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would entail\u2014 a national mobilization that requiring not only the People's Liberation Army but also the whole Chinese economy and society.\u00a0 Johnson focuses on the concerns China has over legislation being considered in Congress that the PRC believes would erode the one-China policy.\u00a0 HIGHLIGHTS:\u00a0 China's military response to Pelosi's Taiwan visit:\u00a0JOHN CULVER: \"They didn't take any action last week that would have compelled Taiwan to consider taking, you know, shooting at Chinese aircraft or vessels. And so that shows there were constraints here. So on one level, it was unprecedented, especially the number of exercise areas around Taiwan, the firing of ballistic missiles, aircraft crossing over the medium line of Taiwan's ADIZ. But they didn't compel Taiwan to make a use of force decision.\" China's message to Taiwan: JOHN CULVER: \"I don't think we saw anything near the scale of what we'd see in the event of a real military assault on Taiwan, even a blockade scenario, let alone an invasion. Because if China were really going to finally drop everything and decide that they were going to compel unification, it would involve national mobilization, not only of the PLA, but the entire Chinese economy and society. So this is not a rehearsal of anything like that scale, but it did send a signal to the population, something that China is careful to do only when they want to, which is that they could have to set aside their expectations regarding economic growth and peaceful international relations and be ready to think about what they need to do for the motherland in wartime.\" China's concerns about erosion of One-China policy by Congress:\u00a0CHRIS JOHNSON: \"I think the visits actually are probably only one half of the problem from China's perspective. There's also a slew of these bills working their way through Congress that would fundamentally erode, arguably, the underpinnings of the one-China policy, especially in terms of potentially declaring Taiwan a major non-NATO military ally. This is the Taiwan Policy Act that's going through Congress right now, and probably more importantly from China's perspective, would allow for the pre-positioning of ammunition and other supplies on Taiwan at the U.S. taxpayers expense. And we only have those arrangements with our closest allies in the region, as you know.

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - CHRIS JOHNSON AND JOHN CULVER PRODUCER: PAULINA SMOLINSKI MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, John, welcome to Intelligence Matters. It's great to have you on the show again. And it's terrific to have you together. I'm really looking forward to the conversation, so welcome.\u00a0 CHRIS JOHNSON: Thank you. Same here.\u00a0 JOHN CULVER: Great to be with you, Michael.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So we are going to jump right in here to a discussion about the Chinese response to Speaker Pelosi's recent visit to Taiwan. We really want to unpack everything here. And Chris, I'm going to start with you. Why did the Chinese respond aggressively to the speaker's visit? What are the factors that drove them to do that? I really want to understand the Chinese mindset here.\u00a0 CHRIS JOHNSON: Sure. And it's sort of a complicated at some level mindset and not complicated at all in another. I think there are really three primary factors. The first was Beijing and the Politburo's perception that the United States, through what the Chinese have recently been referring to as 'salami slicing tactics', which is somewhat ironic given that the U.S. used to refer to their actions in the South China Sea as 'salami slicing tactics.'\u00a0 There's a lot of salami being thrown around. That the U.S. has been steadily eroding its commitment to the one-China policy. That's the main factor that the Chinese say, of course, is the foundation for the US-China relationship. So in other words, if the U.S. is signaling Beijing that at least de facto and probably increasingly China worries de jure at some point, the U.S. is abandoning the one-China policy. Then there really isn't much else to talk about in terms of bilateral relations.\u00a0 And moreover, in the past, when they assessed that the U.S. was heading in this direction, they been quick to take what we might call demonstrative action to warn the U.S. to correct its course. So, for example, we saw this on display the last time the Chinese launch missiles into the Taiwan Strait in the 1995-96 episode. And I'm sure we'll talk a lot more about that today. But we saw it again early, much more recently, early in the Trump administration, when President Trump hinted publicly that he might just outright abandon the one-China policy ahead of his summit meeting with Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago early in the administration. And, of course, in that instance, Xi basically cut off all communications with Washington, including on North Korea, which was obviously a very hot topic at the time, until Trump basically genuflected and repeated the one-China catechism publicly. \u00a0 I think what's interesting about this most recent case, though, is that it's an accumulation of actions by the U.S., not just these one offs as in those two previous episodes, including public discussion of abandoning our policy of strategic ambiguity concerning the defense of Taiwan and insistence on publicizing things such as FONOPs, which I'm sure John will talk more about, in the Strait and the presence of U.S. troops on Taiwan, for example, that we used to keep quiet. And a whole array of other actions that led them, I think, to conclude the message was necessary. \u00a0 And I think that's a natural follow on to the second factor, which was an awareness on the part of Xi Jinping and his Politburo colleagues that Pelosi's visit may in fact just be a harbinger of things to come. In other words, although they certainly do not like Speaker Pelosi, given her long extended activism, I think on China, human rights issues, Tibet, things like that. This was more about her standing as the number three in the line of succession. Something that the Chinese actually harped on a lot in their formal responses to the visit. We also had, of course, 25 years between the last visit by a Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich in 1997, and Pelosi's trip. But then Minority Leader McCarthy made clear in his public statements around the Pelosi visit that he would be very keen to undertake another visit soon after succeeding Pelosi should the midterm elections produce that result. \u00a0 As we're seeing today, just 12 days after Pelosi's visit, we have another congressional delegation, this time led by Senator Markey of Massachusetts on the ground in Taipei. But I think the visits actually are probably only one half of the problem from China's perspective. There's also a slew of these bills working their way through Congress that would fundamentally erode, arguably, the underpinnings of the one-China policy, especially in terms of potentially declaring Taiwan a major non-NATO military ally. This is the Taiwan Policy Act that's going through Congress right now, and probably more importantly from China's perspective, would allow for the pre-positioning of ammunition and other supplies on Taiwan at the U.S. taxpayers expense. And we only have those arrangements with our closest allies in the region, as you know. So that just is not tolerable for Beijing. So my sense is that China did the exercises in that instance because they know this is only going to get worse. And they wanted to put the White House on notice that they're willing to escalate. \u00a0 And quickly, the third reason, obviously, has to do with the Politburo's concerns about developments on Taiwan itself.\u00a0 They obviously will be holding municipal elections in late November, right around the same time as our midterm elections, that while they don't have much policy significance in and of themselves, they could witness the virtual destruction, for lack of a better term, of the opposition party, the Guomindang, as a viable electoral enterprise. And of course the KMT is China's preferred political party in Taiwan. That would mean more freedom of action for President Tsai Ing-wen's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which is, of course, the more independence oriented party on the island.\u00a0 And like the U.S. then Taiwan, will hold its next presidential election in 2024. Tsai cannot run again, which makes Beijing nervous probably about what she might do in her lame duck time. And the possible implosion of the KMT obviously makes it very likely that her successor would be another DPP President. And from what we know about the available candidates there, they're almost certain to be even more pro-independence than she is. So I think those three factors combined really drove this response.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: John, walk us through how the Chinese responded militarily. Outline what they did and of that, what was unprecedented.\u00a0 JOHN CULVER: With the 1995-1996 military demonstrations over then President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the U.S. - it was sort of that on steroids. But the unprecedented things we saw were primarily the announcement by China of missile impact areas in the waters surrounding Taiwan. So in the mid nineties, they announced one closure area in 1995 and then two in 1996. This time we had seven, and they fired ballistic missiles into at least three of them, including one on the far eastern side of Taiwan, where the ballistic missiles flew over the island and indeed, Taipei. Now, these were exo-atmospheric when they flew over Taipei, they were in space about 200 nautical miles up. But nonetheless, they had never done that. And the other really unprecedented thing in the missile domain was these are the kind of closure areas, and indeed, the Chinese referred to these as blockade drills. So one tactic China could employ in a more dire situation would be to announce a full economic blockade that would be enforced by the Chinese Navy and the Coast Guard, which we didn't see last week, but would also be enforced by the threat that ballistic missiles will be fired. So any commercial vessels or military vessels that are seeking to break the blockade could be subject to sort of random missile bombardment. \u00a0 We also saw a real increase in the flights on the Taiwan Strait by the Chinese Air Force and the Chinese Navy, which has its own fighter component, fighter aircraft component. We've all gotten used to seeing them fly into what's called the extreme southwest corner of the ADIZ since 2019. That means flights into Taiwan's air identification zone, which in the westernmost part runs right down the middle of the Taiwan Strait.\u00a0 So the Chinese have been flying in to Taiwan's ADIZ, if you will, air defense identification zone, pretty frequently since 2019. But they've always done it in the spot where it was furthest from- it was as far as you could be from the island of Taiwan and still be inside the ADIZ.\u00a0 What they did during the most recent exercises was to fly much closer to the area right off Taiwan, like just north of the island and just south of the island. And at the speeds that these aircraft move at, if you're at the center line, you're 5 minutes from being over the island. So it puts a lot of stress on Taiwan's air force and their surface to air missile units to monitor the situation. \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: John, was there was there something that the Chinese did vis a vis Japan that was unprecedented here?\u00a0 JOHN CULVER: Some of the missiles they fired over Taiwan that landed in that missile impact area to the east of the island, also fell into an area Japan claims as its exclusive economic zone. So it was really something that drove a domestic reaction in Japan. I'm not sure what international law says about missiles falling in your economic exclusive economic zone, although it gives Japan, which is a very adroit user of its EEZ's to kind of claim extra territorial rights. It definitely had- it amplified the impact in Japan that these were close enough and the conclusion that was being drawn in Tokyo was- if China goes to war with Taiwan, it's not going to be over there. It's going to be right here. \u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: John, anything that they didn't do that was interesting?\u00a0 JOHN CULVER: Yeah. Compared to the mid-nineties, they did not stage large amphibious exercises opposite Taiwan. That was a key feature of their mid-nineties display.\u00a0 The other thing they didn't do is, and there was some dispute over this from the sources I can see on the Internet, mostly Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense, which is very good and timely. And the Japanese government was also very timely with some of the information, for example, about the missiles falling in their EEZ. They didn't fly inside Taiwan's territorial waters nor sail vessels within sight, within Taiwan's territorial waters. \u00a0And if I could kind of take that to a higher level, they didn't take any action last week that would have compelled Taiwan to consider taking, you know, shooting at Chinese aircraft or vessels. And so that shows there were constraints here. So on one level, it was unprecedented, especially the number of exercise areas around Taiwan, the firing of ballistic missiles, aircraft crossing over the medium line of Taiwan's ADIZ. But they didn't compel Taiwan to make a use of force decision.\u00a0 And before this exercise, some folks were concerned that in the event of another flare up, you would see Chinese aircraft go right over the island of Taiwan daring them to shoot. So on the one hand, it's kind of sort of reassuring that they didn't take that step. But it also means, you know, to mix metaphors, that the Chinese have some saved rounds. Where if there is additional behavior by Taiwan or the United States where they need to up the ante and and demonstrate something even more serious, those are the kind of steps you could see them taking.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, I'm going to ask John some more military questions here in a second. But in addition to the Chinese military reaction, did we see other Chinese reactions to the Pelosi visit outside the military realm?\u00a0 CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah, it's interesting in that perhaps surprisingly, they really didn't do a lot in those other domains. If we want to talk about sort of diplomatic or economic things or even in the sort of information space. There were obviously some things that happened. They did induce boycotts of certain Taiwan products, but it was very focused on agricultural products.\u00a0 You know, some folks had suggested, 'Well, then it's not really that big a deal. They didn't, you know, do anything with semiconductors, for example, or anything like that.' But if you're the DPP President Tsai's party, you do care about that because that's where your base is, is in those agricultural growing areas of Taiwan. And what they did do, I think in those spaces we could largely call performative.\u00a0 So, for example, they did place these personal sanctions on Speaker Pelosi and her relatives, but didn't really specify what those would entail. Some previous such sanctions, I think, had prohibited visits to China or Hong Kong or are doing business there. But, you know, that would probably have little meaningful impact on the Speaker as underscored by her basically laughing it off in her public commentary. Obviously, they also suspended all the major dialogues with the U.S., including those on sort of the few remaining areas where the two countries have been working together somewhat cooperatively, such as climate change. And I think the other one was counter-narcotics. And they suspended, of course, the main working level U.S.-China military to military dialogues.\u00a0 But you could say that that's almost been kind of F-5 on their computer, given how many times they've done that in the past for much lesser offenses, for example, arms sales and so on. You can argue, though, that the cut off basically eliminates any hope for moving forward with what the Biden administration has repeatedly, publicly signals its interest in, in terms of these discussions on what they call military and security guardrails. In other words, things that are designed to prevent things from going off the rails. And I think obviously, given what we've just seen, those are probably more necessary than ever.\u00a0 I think probably this suspension may also put an end to some hopes that some of the administration, and I think on the Chinese side had that with the potential and likely probable face to face meeting between Biden and Xi in November, either at the G-20 meeting in Bali or the APEC summit in Thailand, or perhaps both, that that would have allowed for some of those kind of long now dormant working level discussions that traditionally precede an in-person summit to create the impetus for some kind of new, more sustainable dialogue mechanism that might have taken place after that meeting. So one indicator there I think will be to see how long the Chinese choose to keep these dialogues in the in the deep freeze.\u00a0 And just per our discussion a moment ago on Japan, perhaps the more interesting thing to me was what we might call the informal use of the exercises to send diplomatic messages. So again, the landing of these five missiles in Japan's exclusive economic zone was unprecedented, clearly meant to remind Tokyo that there are costs to supporting the U.S. and Taiwan in a future clash and that U.S. facilities certainly like the Kadena Airbase are within easy range of Chinese missiles. And I think on that score, the Pelosi visit arguably handed China the opportunity they've been looking for for probably the last couple of years to be able to signal Japan that Beijing is taking note of Tokyo's shift from largely rhetorical or back up support in Taiwan scenarios to a more integrated and forward leaning posture.\u00a0 So it was no surprise, for example, that a Japanese diet delegation led by a former defense minister just happened to be in Taipei just days before Pelosi's arrival. That obviously stokes all of Beijing's paranoia about Japanese militarism and so on, and especially now that the tragic assassination of former Prime Minister Abe means his ghost, if we want to call it that, will be hanging over even more prominently the Kishida government as it considers measures like revising Japan's peace constitution, something that Abe obviously sought to do but was never able to achieve. And then just lastly, I think the missile firings around the east side of Taiwan send a pretty powerful signal to Southeast Asian countries about China's ability to disrupt major maritime shipping channels in, say, the Strait of Luzon, for example.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: John, let me come back to you with a couple of questions. One is, how help to the Chinese is it to have been able to conduct these these military exercises? How helpful to them from a military training perspective?\u00a0 JOHN CULVER: I would call it marginal probably. There were some some facets, though, that were probably very useful for them. This is the first large public exercise by a command entity called Eastern Theater Command, which was stood up six years ago and probably has done training. But this is the first time it's stood up in something approaching kind of a crisis mode.\u00a0 So, I don't know if you've been to some U.S. military exercises. They teach what's called battle rhythm. They show 24 hour operations and the effect that has on command staff and command staff effectiveness. It gives you a chance to move some muscles, in this case, mostly the Chinese Air Force, the rocket force, and in some aspects of the Navy. But it didn't have any scale. And among the things they didn't see, even though they called this a blockade drill, if China were going to do a real blockade or quarantine of Taiwan, it would primarily fall on the Navy and the Coast Guard. And we saw very limited naval involvement in these drills last week and no Coast Guard involvement. So it wasn't a rehearsal for the real thing in that regard.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: John, that's a great transition to the second question I had, which is from what we saw the Chinese do. Did we learn anything about how they might conduct a military operation to force Taiwan back into the fold? \u00a0 JOHN CULVER: I think we got a pretty good example at limited scale of what a joint firepower strike would look like, either in a blockade scenario or in a more aggressive campaign that would include missiles targeting the island of Taiwan, and especially high priority military leadership or economic targets there. As you know, any military exercise by a foreign military, an adversary is a bonanza usually for all intelligence services, because they do things you don't normally seen them do.\u00a0 You know, they have to move to the field. They have to operate in something approaching wartime mode. They may activate a broader array of their sensor networks, so you'll find that there's a lot to go through afterward typically in these scenarios. I don't think we saw anything near the scale of what we'd see in the event of a real military assault on Taiwan, even a blockade scenario, let alone an invasion.\u00a0 Because if China were really going to finally drop everything and decide that they were going to compel unification, it would involve national mobilization, not only of the PLA, but the entire Chinese economy and society. So this is not a rehearsal of anything like that scale, but it did send a signal to the population, something that China is careful to do only when they want to, which is that they could have to set aside their expectations regarding economic growth and peaceful international relations and be ready to think about what they need to do for the motherland in wartime.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: John, because of the Pelosi visit, what do you think might be different in a year or more in terms of PLA operations near Taiwan? How China responds to U.S. Navy transits through the Taiwan Straits, freedom of navigation operations, say in the South China Sea or surveillance and reconnaissance operations off of China's coast.\u00a0 JOHN CULVER: The exercise that Chinese announced lasted from, I think the third of August to the eighth or the seventh our time. It is hard with the international dateline to figure out sometimes. But the thing is, the PLA activity didn't stop. Chris earlier mentioned Senator Markey's delegation landed in Taiwan yesterday. The Chinese then announced they were going to do additional drills.\u00a0 And the thing is, with what we're seeing, at least as far as I can tell from the Taiwan Ministry of National Defense is the same activity that continued after the exercise following Pelosi's departure, which is there are aircraft flying over the middle of the center line, which is something the Chinese didn't do prior to the Pelosi visit. And those have continued every day since the formal exercise was wrapped up. So it's a case where they aren't doing anything different than they were doing two days ago. But they're announcing it. So they're turning it into a signal.\u00a0 I think we do live in a new normal now. I think things that Chinese had avoided that they then set precedents breaking last week. They're going to keep doing, especially on the center line and then probably flights around the island. One thing that didn't get a lot of attention, but was also discussed\u00a0 by Taiwan military sources openly was there were Chinese unmanned vehicles flying around the eastern side of the island.\u00a0 So, all the way on the other side from where China sits, you had long range Chinese reconnaissance drones flying around. And I think we're going to see just a heightened tempo of activity, not continuously, but similar to what they've done in the Senkaku since that issue heated up with Japan in 2012, where to this very day the Chinese are demonstrating a new normal where every month or so they will send Coast Guard ships inside the territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands. And so I think that that's a very good demonstration.\u00a0 It's been decades, 20 years since the PLA was what you might call a noisy demonstration force. When challenged over sovereignty, and we've seen this on the Indian border and in the South China Sea, they don't just bang trash can lids and complain loudly. They change the status quo. And I think that's what we're seeing with Taiwan now.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, let me come back to you with a couple of questions on the political front. First will this episode have any effect, do you think, on the 20th Party Congress or China's overall Taiwan policy or its overall approach to the U.S.?\u00a0 CHRIS JOHNSON: I think it certainly has the potential to, as John was just saying, on the approach to the U.S., I do think they are trying to signal a new normal in the way they operate. They are trying to get our attention. And I think that's been something that is really a takeaway or should be a takeaway for the U.S. administration in this is that why did they do what they just did? And we may come back to this at some point in talking about the administration's reaction, but it was because they felt they weren't being listened to or if they were being listened to, they were being ignored. That obviously is something that then would seem to cause them to feel, 'well, maybe we have to do even more.' So I think that's important. \u00a0 In terms of the 20th Party Congress, what was fascinating to me in the run up to Pelosi's visit was what seemed, again, to use my earlier analogy, to be something akin to F-5 on a lot of people's computers or laptops, which was this idea that Xi Jinping can't afford right now to be humiliated or to look weak because he's in the run up to the 20th Party Congress seeking this sort of unusual or atypical third term and maybe more in office. And therefore, because of that, there was this impression that he was sort of perhaps unpredictable. And that if Pelosi even when at all, he may not be able to control the desire to do something really demonstrative, kind of what John was suggesting earlier in terms of actual response.\u00a0 So we saw this in some of the reactions from the Chinese public where they sort of reacted themselves to Beijing's clear misplaying of its propaganda and saying, 'well, we're going to escort the flight down and we're going to not allow this to happen and so on.' And then when it did, the public was sort of like, 'what's going on there?' And the point is that because Xi Jinping is so firmly in charge, especially of the military, he was in full control of the situation all along. And that's an important thing to get right in terms of your analytic call. Is he really weak or under pressure or is he strong and in control? Because it gives you a sense of what you could do in response without escalation. To give an example in that space, in that 1995-96 episode, it was exactly the opposite situation. Jiang Zemin, who was the president at the time, had not fully consolidated his control over the PLA. He literally was almost grabbed by the lapels by these cranky, revolutionary, credentialed generals who said we're going to do something, even though they had real concerns about missiles potentially going awry and so on. We did not see that in this scenario. And in fact, just to draw that contrast, what we did see was Xi Jinping right as that was all going on, being escorted around by the top uniformed officer in the PLA, in a new display in the military museum in Beijing, highlighting up Xi's many achievements and his control over the military. So I think that's a very significant difference in that respect.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, why don't we take on the Biden administration point right now. Do you have any insight into how they thought about the Pelosi trip before the trip? We heard the president say the U.S. military was opposed right now. Does the White House see an upside? Did they see this as a net negative? Did they try to talk her out of it? What's your sense?\u00a0 CHRIS JOHNSON: I think it's at some level it's impossible really for us to know exactly what went on. But I think what we can say is that if the administration did try to talk her out of the trip, and I think that's an open question, their response seemed what I would call sort of both late and disjointed, late in the sense that when Speaker Pelosi initially postponed her trip in April after contracting COVID, you could make the case the White House then had four months to quietly persuade her that this was not a good idea. They apparently did not do that and then may have, depending on which media story you read, leaked the news that she was considering a new trip to the media, which immediately put the White House on the defensive in terms of perception management and so on. The disjointed part of it, I think, of their response was Biden's public comments, as you mentioned, that the military thought the trip was a bad idea, which I think was probably read both domestically and by foreign allies and partners, that somehow he needed to use that as a crutch of sorts to control someone from his own party when the Constitution makes clear that the president can make foreign policy. So it looked a bit disjointed. \u00a0 Also, there seemed to have been a sort of painful back and forth that played out in the media in media leaks after the trip where the administration seemed to be trying to throw Pelosi under the bus for the trip, and then her side seemed to push back. So no one looked authoritative in a moment where the increase in tensions makes doing so incredibly important. I'm glad you raised the domestic political angle. I would say, again, we can't really know what was going on in President Biden's mind, but my sense would be that his reasons for not blocking the trip probably were three.\u00a0 One, I think he has a genuine like for Speaker Pelosi, but more importantly, probably, as a 40 year veteran of the Senate himself, he probably is sympathetic to that idea that congressional leaders view that their institutional prerogatives grant them some role in foreign policy.\u00a0 Second, obviously, it wouldn't be a good look to have a major public spat between the number one and number two Democrats at a time where their prospects for the midterms might be modestly improving.\u00a0 And three, I think he was concerned about looking soft on China in a way that would provide what we might call red meat to to Republicans. \u00a0 So to your point, note that all three of these motives are exclusively in the domestic realm, which might lend some credibility or weight to Henry Kissinger's comments around the time of the visit that for far too long U.S. policy toward China has primarily been being driven by the ever worsening domestic political narrative around China. And that approach also raises real questions then, I think, around whether or not President Biden is too weak politically to be able to conduct that pure realist, national interest focused foreign policy when the circumstances require it. \u00a0 And then just quickly, as to whether the U.S. saw any upside to the trip, I think that could be reflected in their what I would call their 'nothing to see here' response to the exercises. By caricaturing China's response as that of a sort of child throwing a tantrum or schoolyard bully. I think the administration may have been trying to kind of sharpen the comparison to Russia as part of its efforts to promote this narrative of a Russia China new axis with the goal of mobilizing domestic audiences for a policy of sort of a forward leaning strategic competition with China, while perhaps also trying to win hearts and minds, I guess you could say, among allied country officialdom and the general public. If that was some of the motivations for adopting the stance, it's unclear to me how effective that may be or have been.\u00a0 If, for example, China did what it did, as I mentioned earlier, because it wants it felt Washington wasn't hearing it, a response that emphasizes ignoring China's actions, in my mind would seem to incentivize them to kind of turn it up to 11 as John was suggesting. And I think likewise, there was some at least initial critical response from close allies like the Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong that pretty strongly hinted that the U.S. kind of foisted this crisis on us for no good reason at a time where in Australia's case they're trying to make some moves toward repairing their own relationship with Beijing.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: I want to kind of close here by looking out and talking about under what circumstances China might decide to use force against Taiwan and then whether their capabilities are such that they can do that now or do they need more time? And John, let me start with you on that question Are there improvements in their capabilities that the Chinese would want in place before they had to or chose to use force?\u00a0 JOHN CULVER: The short answer yes. But then big, big caveat. If Taiwan, backed by especially the United States, took a step toward permanent separation tomorrow, China would go to war tomorrow. So it isn't just a military calculation that there are a few more turns of the screw and tightening of the bolts and then the PLA is going to be ready.\u00a0 And that will drive China's decision. It will remain a political decision. And I think even for Xi Jinping, I think Chris characterized his consolidation of power pretty correctly. But even for Xi, Taiwan is a crisis to be avoided, not an opportunity to be seized. So if China can avoid a series of circumstances where they feel compelled to go to war, they will always want to further improve military capabilities to give them a higher sense of success. And the main things that are still lacking are net amphibious lift, the ability to manage large scale U.S. intervention, which they could never discount.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: What's the first one again? \u00a0 JOHN CULVER: Amphibious lift. It's interesting. They've built a very modern military and a very large and modern navy, but they haven't built the essential vessels that they would need, especially the more expendable, smaller ones that would ensure success in an amphibious invasion of Taiwan. If they have to move 150,000 troops across the Taiwan Strait. They can maybe do a fifth of that today.\u00a0 So, unless you want to entertain notions that they're going to get very creative with helicopters and aircraft and try to do things that most military experts think would be bad ideas, why try to do an airborne assault or use a lot of merchant ships which can look great on paper, but they still need a port. So, if you need to seize a beachhead, then you're going to need flat bottomed amphibious assault vessels. And the number of dedicated LSTs that China has is actually declined over the last ten years. So they have left of that kind of dedicated and expendable lift than they did a decade ago.\u00a0 What they have built are some really big ships, not just aircraft carriers, but helicopter carriers and big things called amphibious docks. But again, those are big, capable ships that are great if you want to impress people in the South China Sea, do you really want to lose it off a beach off the coast of Taiwan? Because that's a very nonexpendable asset, any of those vessels. So I think you need to see something more along those lines.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So, John, in addition to some capability building on the amphibious front, is there anything else that the Chinese would need to do to significantly increase their chances of being successful in a reunification by force scenario?\u00a0 JOHN CULVER: We are on the right track. I mean, one of the things that's worried long-time analysts like me of the PLA is that they've made very few wrong moves for the last 20 years. So they've built a lot of regional strike capability. They've effectively targeted every pillar of U.S. power projection in East Asia, from carrier battle groups to our bases in the region, our reliance on air power, our ability, our need to be able to control space and long-range communications. So the main thing they need is larger ability to have a highly assured amphibious landing capability and then the ability to gain air superiority over Taiwan, whether the U.S. intervenes or not.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: And then, Chris, back to you on sort of the politics of all this and the political decision making.\u00a0 John said if they had to go to war now, they would. Under what circumstances - a Taiwanese declaration of independence - under what circumstances would they go to war? Is it a declaration of independence? Is it a referendum on independence that passes? Is it an official change in our one China policy? What would force their hand at this point?\u00a0 CHRIS JOHNSON: Right. I think certainly probably all of those that you just highlighted would be things that would in their mind feel that they would have to do something more than just demonstrative, as I mentioned earlier.\u00a0 I'd just refer back probably to the top of our discussion in terms of their motivations for this recent demonstration that we've just seen. And to put it in a bumper sticker form, as long as their perception remains that the U.S. is moving toward de facto support for Taiwan independence, they will be more inclined to warn the U.S. of the potential consequences of those actions through a continuation of what John referred to earlier as the new normal. \u00a0 I do think I would just highlight as well, coming back to what I said earlier, what's been interesting in this episode was that it was not one specific action. Lee Teng-hui gets a visit to the United States, the former Taiwan President, that kicked off the 1995-96 episode. Or President Trump making public commentary.\u00a0 This was an accumulation of U.S. actions over time, many of which never came to fruition, right? Yes, there was a debate about abandoning strategic ambiguity, but it was basically quashed by President Biden, in my understanding. Thank goodness for that.\u00a0 So, in other words, we're getting into this weird space now where they may feel increasingly that they have to do something, barring a you know, if it's short of a formal declaration of independence or a formal acknowledgement by the U.S. of something crazy like diplomatic relations. I say something crazy, but people like former Secretary Pompeo and other Republican potential presidential candidates have discussed this as a possibility in their public remarks and so on. And that all, I think, contributes to Beijing's concerns.\u00a0 We may find ourselves increasingly in that position where what we traditionally thought were the very few and very unlikely red lines that they absolutely would have to react to. Maybe it would be something different in the future. And I think that's a very important distinction.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: We have we have 2 minutes left. So I'm going to give each of you a minute to answer a final question for me, which is, are you at all concerned that the anti-China politics here in the U.S. and the nationalism, the growing nationalism, that we see in China partly stoked by Xi himself, could lead to a war that no one really wants. John, why don't you go first?\u00a0 JOHN CULVER: Not as a direct cause, but certainly as an atmospheric, where if you have another event more serious from a Chinese perspective than a Pelosi visit or military action by China, more serious than their reaction to Pelosi's visit, then you have to worry about a perfect storm scenario, where things less than a clear cut cost for China or a clear cut actions by China that the U.S. feels it needs to respond to militarily can operate in a different environment than we were used to say 20 years ago. Where you have a pretty by strong bipartisan consensus to be strong against China. And it's that one of these episodes turns into something more like a Cuban missile crisis, if not, the U.S. China war, that it actually becomes not just a debatable crisis the U.S. says didn't, you know, shouldn't have risen to that level, but one that actually causes major risk of direct conflict.\u00a0 CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah, I agree with that. I would just come back to what we were talking about earlier where we did see some aspect of this on display on the Chinese side, where it was very clear that the party had misplayed its hand in terms of making a lot of heavy noise about somehow preventing Speaker Pelosi from visiting, that this was not allowed to happen. So we saw things, there are folks who track what appears on Weibo, Chinese social media very carefully. And there was a great line that someone had up there about, 'the security guard at my compound, he's asleep half the time but he does a better job of keeping people out who aren't supposed to be in.' So there was a day or two where it looked like they'd misplayed it. What also though was interesting was how quickly through the exercises and their very smart packaging of media and photo op and other things. They were able to get that back on track and make the Chinese people kind of feel like, 'okay, we've shown them that we're serious.'\u00a0 It's always very difficult, I think, in this space as well. Both whether you want to say that the sentiment in the U.S. is sort of anti-China or this nationalism stuff on China. There is always that 'it could go out of control.' So you sound a bit like Chicken Little, right, if you're constantly focusing on that. Yet it could go out of control. These things are very, very difficult. More troubling from the U.S. side, just to close, would be the issue of all these bills some of which have really serious provisions that are going through Congress. In this environment we're going into, we're just going to see more and more of that activity. Typically you might say, 'well, the cooler heads will prevail and that stuff will be edited out of the bills.' I'm not so sure.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: John, Chris, thank you so much for joining us today. Fascinating discussion. Thank you.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Tokyo \u2014 The body of Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was returned to Tokyo on Saturday after he was fatally shot during a campaign speech in western Japan a day earlier. Abe was attacked in the city of Nara and airlifted to a local hospital but died of blood loss despite emergency treatment including massive blood transfusions. Police arrested the attacker, a former member of Japan's navy, at the scene on suspicion of murder. Police confiscated the homemade gun he used, and several others were later found at his apartment. The attacker, Tetsuya Yamagami, told investigators he plotted the shooting because he believed rumors that Abe was connected to an organization that he resents, according to police. Japanese media reported that the man had developed hatred toward a religious group his mother was devoted to. The reports did not specify the group. A black hearse carrying Abe's body and accompanied by his wife, Akie, arrived at his home in Tokyo's upscale residential area of Shibuya, where many mourners waited and lowered their heads as the vehicle passed. Abe's assassination ahead of Sunday's parliamentary election shocked the nation and raised questions over whether security for the former prime minister was adequate. Police on Saturday said autopsy results showed that a bullet that entered Abe's upper left arm damaged arteries beneath both collar bones, causing fatal massive bleeding. Some observers who watched videos of the assassination on social media and television noted a lack of attention in the open space behind Abe as he spoke. A former Kyoto prefectural police investigator, Fumikazu Higuchi, said the footage suggested security was sparse at the event and insufficient for a former prime minister. \"It is necessary to investigate why security allowed Yamagami to freely move and go behind Mr. Abe,\" Higuchi told a Nippon TV talk show. Experts also said Abe was more vulnerable standing on the ground level, instead of atop a campaign vehicle, which reportedly could not be arranged because his visit to Nara was hastily planned the day before. In videos circulating on social media, the attacker, identified as 41-year-old Yamagami, can be seen with the homemade gun hanging from his shoulder, standing only a few meters (yards) behind Abe across a busy street, and continuously glancing around. A few minutes after Abe stood at the podium and started his speech \u2014 as a local party candidate and their supporters stood and waved to the crowd \u2014 Yamagami can be seen firing the first shot, which issued a cloud of smoke, but the projectile apparently missed Abe. As Abe turned to see where the noise came from, a second shot went off. That shot apparently hit Abe's left arm, missing a bulletproof briefcase raised by a security guard who stood behind the former leader. Abe fell to the ground, with his left arm tucked in as if to cover his chest. Campaign organizers shouted through loudspeakers asking for medical experts to provide first-aid to Abe, whose heart and breathing had stopped by the time he was airlifted to a hospital where he later pronounced dead. According to the Asahi newspaper, Yamagami was a contract worker at a warehouse in Kyoto where he was a forklift operator and known as a quiet person who did not mingle with his colleagues. A next-door neighbor at his apartment told Asahi he never met Yamagami, though he recalled hearing noises like a saw being used several times late at night over the past month. Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who early on had a frosty relationship with Abe, sent a condolence message to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Saturday, a day after most\u00a0other world leaders issued their statements. Xi credited Abe with making efforts to improve China-Japan relations and said he and Abe had reached an important understanding on building better ties, according to a statement posted on China's Foreign Ministry website. He also told Kishida he is willing to work with him to continue to develop neighborly and cooperative relations. Even though he was out of office, Abe was still highly influential in the governing Liberal Democratic Party and headed its largest faction, but his ultra-nationalist views made him a divisive figure to many. When he resigned as prime minister, Abe blamed a recurrence of the ulcerative colitis he'd had since he was a teenager. He said then it was difficult to leave many of his goals unfinished, especially his failure to resolve the issue of Japanese abducted years ago by North Korea, a territorial dispute with Russia, and a revision of Japan's war-renouncing constitution. That ultra-nationalism riled the Koreas and China, and his push to create what he saw as a more normal defense posture angered many Japanese. Abe failed to achieve his cherished goal of formally rewriting the U.S.-drafted pacifist constitution because of poor public support. Loyalists said his legacy was a stronger U.S.-Japan relationship that was meant to bolster Japan's defense capability. But Abe made enemies by forcing his defense goals and other contentious issues through parliament, despite strong public opposition. Abe was groomed to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, former Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. His political rhetoric often focused on making Japan a \"normal\" and \"beautiful\" nation with a stronger military and bigger role in international affairs. Japan is particularly known for its strict gun laws. With a population of 125 million, it had only 10 gun-related criminal cases last year, resulting in one death and four injuries, according to police. Eight of those cases were gang-related. Tokyo had no gun incidents, injuries or deaths in the same year, although 61 guns were seized. Abe was proud of his work to strengthen Japan's security alliance with the U.S. and shepherding the first visit by a serving U.S. president, Barack Obama, to the atom-bombed city of Hiroshima. He also helped Tokyo gain the right to host the 2020 Olympics by pledging that a disaster at the Fukushima nuclear plant was \"under control\" when it was not. He became Japan's youngest prime minister in 2006, at age 52, but his overly nationalistic first stint abruptly ended a year later, also because of his health. The end of Abe's scandal-laden first stint as prime minister was the beginning of six years of annual leadership change, remembered as an era of \"revolving door\" politics that lacked stability. When he returned to office in 2012, Abe vowed to revitalize the nation and get its economy out of its deflationary doldrums with his \"Abenomics\" formula, which combines fiscal stimulus, monetary easing and structural reforms. He won six national elections and built a rock-solid grip on power, bolstering Japan's defense role and capability and its security alliance with the U.S. He also stepped up patriotic education at schools and raised Japan's international profile.",

He's the Republican tasked with winning the Senate majority for the GOP in this year's midterm elections. And he joins us from Naples, Florida. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Good morning, Margaret. I think those numbers are consistent with what we've seen, that inflation is still the number one issue in the country and the president is slow to react, whether it's the border, whether it's inflation, whether it's gas prices, even Ukraine. I think the expectation is that whoever the president is gets ahead of the problems rather than behind the problem. So I think the election this fall is going to be about inflation. It's going to be about the effectiveness of the Biden administration. And I think it bodes well for Republicans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, why do you think that? Because you just heard our poll, which shows Republicans don't really have much of an advantage on that specific issue. 51% of those polled trust the GOP on inflation, 49% trust Democrats. How do you advise Republicans to change that? SEN. SCOTT: Well, I think it's important that, you know, we talk about what we're going to do. And we- you know, we explain the problem that the Biden administration has, that they don't react to, you know, record gas prices and open border, things like this. But also, we tell people what we're going to do to bring down inflation. We're going to balance the budget. We're going to start watching the dollars very closely. We're going to watch our spending. We are going to, you know, expect the Federal Reserve to reduce their balance sheet. So, I think we have to talk about the things that we're going to do to make it better for people. But if you go and look at the races around the country, Biden's numbers are really, really bad. And he's- he is the face of the Democrat Party right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: But so then if- if you want your candidates to be- Republican candidates to be talking about inflation, is it a waste of time for so many of them to talk about relitigating the 2020 election? SEN. SCOTT: You know what I've seen, Margaret, is people want to know that the election's going to be fair and their votes are not going to be diluted. So, I- when I- as I go around the country and talk to people, what they're hoping is that Republicans will make sure that, you know- you know, there's voter I.D., there's no ballot harvesting, signatures have to match. And- and that's what when I talk to people, that's what they care about. There's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --So you don't want them to talk about 2020, you want- sorry. Go ahead. I'm sorry. SEN. SCOTT: No, Margaret, there's- there is clearly people that are still concerned about what happened in 2020, and they would like the facts to come out. And they- and they want to know what happened, why it happened-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --What do you mean by that? SEN. SCOTT: Well, they want to know- they want to know that exactly what happened- if, you know, were there problems? Exactly what happened? They'd like to know that. But also, they're- you know, they also want to make sure we win in '22. So, you know, they- they want to make sure that, you know, we're going to make sure their vote's not diluted. So I think you have to- you have to talk about, you know, making sure people understand what happened in 2020, but also make sure, you know, they know that you're going to focus on making sure that 2022 is a- you know, is a fair election. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be abundantly clear, you have recognized President Biden is the duly elected president of the United States, correct? SEN. SCOTT: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So, let's just move on from there. SEN. SCOTT: The-- MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 --So, in terms of the things you think Republicans should be talking about and inflation, you put forward this 11-point plan. One of the things you're suggesting is to end all imports from China. Is that going to add to price inflation? SEN. SCOTT: Well, I think what we've got to do is we've got- we've got to figure out how to decouple from China, and it's going to take a while to do that. But if you look at what they want to do, they're sending fentanyl in this country. We had over 100,000 people die of drug overdose last year. They never comply with any trade agreements, they've never complied with the World Trade, you know, association. So, you know,- Organization. So, what we've got to do is we got to start building American jobs. We've got to get American manufacturing back. And when we do that one, our wages will go up-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Okay-- SEN. SCOTT:\u00a0 --We'll have more jobs in this country and we- and people want to buy American products and there's other countries to do business with. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. Okay. So, it's a long term goal that's not actually banning Chinese imports now. Let me ask you about something else you talk about. The Institute on Taxation Economic Policy says your plan you put forward would increase taxes by more than $1,000, on average, for the poorest 40% of Americans. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said this. SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if your fellow Republicans don't support this alternative you're putting forward, who does? SEN. SCOTT: Well, first off, it's Rick Scott's plan. I believe we ought to have a plan for how we go forward. I'm a business guy. I created plans when I- in my business life. I created plans when I was governor. But here's how- here's the way I look at it. My mom told me I had to have skin in the game. And what she meant by that is I had to get to work and participate in the American dream. When you get a job, you pay payroll taxes, you pay income taxes, you buy things, you pay sales tax, you buy a house, you pay property taxes. We have very low labor participation right now. I want people back to work. And with regard to Medicare and Social Security, think about this. We have got to be honest with the American people and come up with solutions. Medicare goes bankrupt in four years, Social Security goes bankrupt in 12 years. We're not talking about that. I want to- I want to fix those programs. I believe in those programs and people rely on those programs. MARGARET BRENNAN: You want Congress to review them every single- every five years-- SEN. SCOTT: --Joe Biden has proposed cutting those. Well, we- think about it, we do the military every year. We ought to you know, we ought to be- look at it. I mean, people expect us. It's our job. If you get elected, it's your job to go through and figure out how you fix things. That's our job. We do the military every year and we fight over what we should do to make sure we're the most lethal military. We ought to be honest with the American people. Here's the things we're going to do to make sure you get your Medicare, make sure you get your Social Security. So I will never raise a tax. I cut taxes more than 100 times, but I'm going to make sure we fix and make sure these Medicare- Medicare programs and Social Security work. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. As you know, there's concern that in- given the opportunity to review it, that you could put some of those programs at risk. But I want to move on to have you respond to something else that was in our polling that I think is important to have you comment on. Do you personally think it's important for political leaders, particularly in your party, to condemn white nationalism? Because according to our poll, 75% of Democrats say it is very important. Only 23% of Republicans say it's very important. Why do you think there is such a gap? SEN. SCOTT: Well, clearly, we ought to all condemn any hatred. We ought to condemn any white supremacy. We- mean we've got to figure out how to come together. I- I believe we got to stop all this racial politics and what the plan I put out at Rescue America.com I said, we have to stop asking people on government forms for their skin color. We ought to judge people by their character, not, you know, not their skin color. So, we've got to figure out how to bring people together. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you would tell all Senate Republicans running for election that they need to, each and every one of them, condemn white nationalism? SEN. SCOTT: Well, I tell people what I believe. And, you know, every- every Senate candidate on both sides is going to decide what is important to them, and what is important to the citizens of their state-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would advise them- you think-- SEN. SCOTT: --But I can tell you I'm clear.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the answer is yes? SEN. SCOTT: Oh, if they asked me, I would say be clear. Be clear. I mean, we do not believe- none of us- I don't think any American should believe in white supremacy or hatred of any kind. I mean, it's wrong. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Scott, thank you for joining us today. And FACE THE NATION be back in a minute with New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. So stay with us.",

I'm Margaret Brennan. Good morning. We have learned that the number of Americans who say things are going badly in this country, particularly with the economy, is at the highest rate it has been during the Biden presidency. Six out of 10 Americans surveyed feel uneasy or worried about the state of the country. Today, we will hear from key players in both parties, the head of Senate Republicans' campaign efforts, Florida Senator Rick Scott, and a top House Democrat, New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. Plus, we will take an in-depth look at the state of the economy and talk with former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who offers a little bit of optimism for us. We begin with our CBS News poll. Joining us now to help us break it down is CBS News director of elections and surveys Anthony Salvanto. Anthony, good morning. Great to have you here at the table. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you for having me. Great to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have some fairly pessimistic news for us, I know, but is inflation still the number one electoral issue for Americans? ANTHONY SALVANTO: So much of this is about inflation. That view of the nation that you described at the top is driven by concerns about inflation. So much of these views of the economy are driven by concerns about inflation. In fact, the number who say that the economy is bad is now the highest it's been during the Biden administration. And then, recently, we see people reacting to the drop in the stock market, where now they're pessimistic about both the market and maybe their retirement. So, all of that is piling on. And the longer that it goes, you see people becoming more pessimistic that it can be reversed. Having said all that, Margaret, I do need to point out a couple of optimistic things. One is the jobs market. People are optimistic that they can find a job in their area. And then the other part is, you have to say, after two years of a pandemic and all the losses, people are starting to feel optimistic about that effort as we head into the summer. MARGARET BRENNAN: So how are Americans assessing the president's performance? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, on inflation, it's not good. His handling of inflation and his ratings for that are low. But there's another component of this. And that is, a majority of the public, two-thirds, feel like the administration has been slow to react, slow to react to events as they come up. Of course, that's been a critique on inflation and on other matters. It's also starting to stick a little among his party, among Democrats, who are also now more likely to say that, and then that the economy is bad. So, that's tough politically. And I think, coming into this, we saw numbers where people were expecting him to be effective, and now those ratings are low. So, it's that setup of expectations here, because people reason backwards from results. If they don't see results on inflation, then he pays a political price. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the parties themselves? Do Americans think they're talking enough about the issues that actually matter to them? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, in a word, no. You're seeing the party primaries play out in state after state around the country now. And, yes, the candidates are forced to speak to their bases in those places. But something that both Democrats and Republicans share is that they want those potential nominees to talk about inflation. And maybe, by virtue of the fact that they're not talking about it enough, the parties are actually even on this. Republicans don't have a large advantage on handling inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's interesting. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right, even though the Democrats are the party in power. But after that, the bases really diverge, you have to point out. The Democrats are very concerned about the potential overthrow of Roe v. Wade, and they want their candidates to talk about that and abortion rights. And then the Republicans are having this split -- and it's really important as people watch this go forward -- over former President Trump. You have got half of Republicans who say they want their candidates to talk about being loyal to the former president. You have got nearly half who say that they want to basically relitigate 2020 and talk about what they feel was a rigged election, even though that's been disproven. So, you have got the other half of the Republicans that don't want that. And that's a intraparty fight that you're seeing play out in race after race, state after state right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what we are also seeing here is, voters feel the parties are dividing them, not just along partisan lines, but demographic lines. Explain that. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes. It starts with the views of the partisans. When you look at Democrats, and you look at things like what's happening in America -- it's going through cultural change. It's going through demographic change. Democrats think that's a good thing. They think increasing diversity is a good thing, that immigrants contribute to the country. Republicans disagree and, by and large, think that that diversity is not a good thing. That's then reflected in what you hear from the candidates and what you hear from the debate in these primaries. There's something else too. And that is, we asked people to just label the parties. And a majority said they thought the Republicans were extreme, but far less than majority said they describe the Democrats as effective. And they're the party in power. So I think, when you go forward into these midterms, you're looking at that. If the Republican label of extreme doesn't come down, they may not do as well as in midterms as they could. And for the Democrats, as the party in power, they need to get that effective number up to stay in. MARGARET BRENNAN: Fascinating snapshot of the country. Anthony Salvanto, thank you. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Florida Senator Rick Scott. He's the Republican tasked with winning the Senate majority for the GOP in this year's midterm elections.

So I think you have to -- you have to talk about making sure people understand what happened in 2020, but also make sure you know -- they know that you're going to focus on making sure that 2022 is a -- is a fair election. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just -- OK, just to be abundantly clear, you have recognized President Biden is the duly elected president of the United States, correct? SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Absolutely. Absolutely.

Senator Scott, thank you for joining us today. (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: And Face the Nation will be back in a minute with New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. So, stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by New York Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. He's the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, and he is in San Diego, California this morning. Good morning to you. Congressman. REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-New York): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to you on some of this poll data that you also heard here. Specifically, young people, Hispanics and half of Black Americans say the president has been too slow to react. His ratings on effectiveness are low. Perceptions of competence are low. A majority of Democrats now say the economy is bad. How does your party hold on to the majority? REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: I'm very confident that we will be able to hold on to the majority. President Biden has done a very good job under incredibly difficult circumstances. I understand that the electorate, of course, is going to be unsettled, experiencing COVID fatigue, inflationary pressures, high gas prices, a war in Ukraine, a radical, extreme Republican Party that doesn't appear to believe in democracy any longer. And so this is a tough moment for our country. But President Biden has been very decisive in his leadership, beginning with the American Rescue Plan. We rescued the economy, put shots in arms and money in pockets, Kids back in school, laid the foundation for a robust economic recovery that has led to more than eight million good-paying jobs being created and unemployment at 3.6 percent. That's a tremendous start. Of course, there's more that needs to be done. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And you know inflation, as you heard, is the chief concern. But specifically on looking like the president is reacting too slow and not taking action, talk to me about a specific issue, police reform, for example. It's been two years. It'll be two years this weekend since the killing of George Floyd and the national protests that followed. The President has been looking at an executive order on police reform for months now, continues to say it's coming. Does he need to act on something specific like that before November? REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, it's my hope and expectation that we will see some further decisive action from the administration. It's unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position because Senator Tim Scott decided to walk away from negotiations that were bipartisan in nature. In terms of striking the right balance between... MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Democrats walked away in the Senate on that one. But on the question of the president, is the urgency on police reform fading? REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: I think the president has said it correctly, that we are going to lean into public safety, make sure we strengthen the relationship between the police and the community, that we confront the rise in gun violence, and that we also invest in young people, in violence interruption, and making sure that young people have access to extracurricular programming, summer enrichment programs, summer jobs, and the things that allow for them to live a productive life, and not be put in the position where they are influenced by destructive behavior around them. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, for fellow Democrats who are up for election, this bit from our poll may stand out. More than a third of Democrats call their own party weak, and that is particularly acute among young people, 41 percent. That could hurt your turnout. How do you respond to that? Is it -- is there time for change here in terms of congressional leadership? REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: No, I think, led by Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer, we've been acting decisively. Just this week, we responded by passing legislation to address the price gouging that we believe, particularly as it relates to the oil and gas industry, is taking place and hurting the American consumer. We, of course, passed legislation to deal with the rise in domestic terrorism and white supremacy in this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said that law wasn't needed. REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Unfortunately, every single Republican, except for about one or two, voted against this in the immediate aftermath of the tragic massacre in Buffalo. So, we are acting decisively. But I think we do have to crystallize the differences between what we're about and what Republicans are all about. It's clear that Washington Republicans want to raise taxes on everyday Americans, on police officers, on firefighters, on nurses, on factory workers, on grocery store clerks. And we are trying to provide them with relief. The Republicans, including your prior guest, actually want to end Social Security and Medicare as we know it in five years, forcing it to sunset. Those are serious differences between the two parties. And I think, once the voters understand that dynamic, the choice will be as clear as a sunny day in San Diego. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you a bit about what's happening in your home state of New York. We've talked on this program previously about the redistricting that has been happening around the country, New York, to Democrats' advantage largely. But you've had this fight internally over the congressional map. Bottom line, did Democrats put their own communities at risk in your state by gerrymandering it to the degree they did? REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, the Court of Appeals was wrong in the decision that they made, both on the substance and in terms of turning over redistricting to an out-of-town unelected special master and a judicial overseer in Steuben County, who's a Republican-leaning partisan judge. MARGARET BRENNAN: Democrats control your state legislature. This was a Democrat-led process, even though I know you're talking about the court right now. REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Well, the process -- right. Well, the process, unfortunately, was hijacked by the Court of Appeals. A bad process has now led to a bad result. You're talking about five different congressional districts where the Black and Latino population was degraded. The only -- most significant Jewish district in the country has been detonated, for no good reason. The core of many congressional districts... MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think have a -- file -- a case to file in court? REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: I think that the lawyers are taking a close look at that. But here's what's most important. We're going to remain united, because we believe in a very simple vision for America. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Work hard, play by the rules, you should be able to provide a comfortable living for yourself and for your family... MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES: ... educate your children, purchase a home, and retire with grace and dignity. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Congressman. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Friday, we traveled to Williamsburg, Virginia, to talk with former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Here's what he said about the GOP and former President Trump. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said that you've been disappointed in Republican leaders for not standing up for traditional Republican values. We just had this awful shooting in Buffalo, New York. Liz Cheney, Congresswoman, said: \"House GOP leadership has enabled white nationalism, white supremacy and antisemitism. History has taught us that what begins with words ends in far worse. Republican leaders must renounce and reject these views and those who hold them.\" Do you think Republican leaders are enabling those things she said? ROBERT GATES (Former U.S. Secretary of Defense): I don't know that I would go that far. I do know that there aren't enough of them denouncing those things, denouncing white supremacy, denouncing... MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES: We have too many people who -- who are in politics to further their own agendas and to further their own personal prospects, rather than what's good for the country. And I would say that's true in both parties. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it is important for the American public to have a full accounting of the events of January 6 with these public hearings that are planned in the weeks ahead? FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES: I think so. What happened on January 6 was -- was a huge blight on our democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: You think there is value in having this aired publicly? FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES: I think so, yes. I think people need to understand. My worry is that people will -- that everybody will retreat to their ideological corner, and so nobody will -- nobody will listen. I think maybe the best thing to do is just to rerun the videos. MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Trump Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was with us on Face the Nation recently. And he revealed some pretty shocking things about what he witnessed when he was part of the administration, unconstitutional, illegal, immoral actions, firing missiles into Mexico, shooting American protesters in the legs. Did you know that these types of ideas were being considered at that time? FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES: A few of them, not those specific ones, but some others that he talks about. So, people would call me from the Pentagon and tell me that: We're wrestling with how to respond to this. So I had some flavor of it, but none of the kind of detail that -- that Mark Esper has in his book. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe President Trump running for office again would present that threat to national security? FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES: It would concern me. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a very diplomatic phrase. FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY ROBERT GATES: Yes. That's -- and that's where I am. (End VT) (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. The midterm primary season is turning into an exciting one. Last Tuesday's Republican contest for Pennsylvania Senate between TV Dr. Mehmet Oz and former hedge fund manager David McCormack likely won't be decided until after a recount. CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe is on the campaign trail in Atlanta, Georgia, one of the four states with contest this is coming Tuesday. Ed. ED O'KEEFE: Margaret, great to see you. Some big contests here on Tuesday that remind us, they're all former President Trumps to lose because he's decided to engage in them. First off, in the Senate race, former football star Herschel Walker is coasting to a Republican win here. He'll take on the Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock in what promises to be one of the most expensive and divisive Senate contest this cycle. But it's the governor's race where former President Trump is perhaps most personally invested. Republican Brian Kemp facing a challenge from the former senator, David Purdue, who was put up to the race by Mr. Trump. Kemp, however, appears to be pulling away in what will end up being a general election match-up between the governor and his former Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams. But there's another contest that we wouldn't normally focus on here on FACE THE NATION, the race for secretary of state. Brad Raffensperger, like Governor Kemp, decided to stand against former President Trump's push to change the results of the 2020 election here in Georgia and somehow get him to win. Raffensperger is in a crowded field and he's likely headed to a runoff election next month. But elections observers all across the country concerned that if he loses it's a sign that someone like the former president can come in and try to manipulate elections. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Ed, I mean that's an important point. We don't normally cover primary race this closely on the national level. And it is very unusual a former president gets directly involved. In fact, endorsing candidates who are at odds with his own party's selected candidates. And this is going to get even more dramatic when the former vice president, Mike Pence, comes to town. ED O'KEEFE: That's right, because he's defying former President Trump by showing up tomorrow and endorsing and campaigning with Governor Kemp. Pence and a handful of other GOP office holders have been here in Georgia in recent weeks believing -- seeing the trends that show that Kemp is going to win despite standing against the former president because they come out of the wing of the party that still believes that somebody other than Trump can somehow prevail in 2024, retake control of the party, and win over general election voters that continue to show up in our polling as not necessarily big fans of the former president. But, you're right, you never see a former president and vice president quite at odds like this. The race here in Atlanta across Georgia is a big proxy fight for them. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. You know, we have to talk about Democrats here too, and, excuse me, you heard our CBS poll, Democrats view the party as weak. A large number of them. There's also such sharp criticism of the president reacting too slowly. What's the signal here for Democrats? ED O'KEEFE: Well, the biggest one, and you talked about it with Anthony and with Congressman Jeffries there, the fact that young voters, black voters, Latino voters now also are in agreement that the president isn't necessarily doing enough to take on the economic challenges and inflation. That's the secret sauce. If you can't convince young people, black people, Latino voters in this state, like Georgia, in others across the country, you're going to see Democrats lose big statewide elections. Stacey Abrams, Raphael Warnock, here in Georgia, need those numbers to improve in order to get the Biden coalition to turn out again. Same story goes in places like Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, all across the country. So, the White House as to be looking at these numbers today with great concern. It's part of the reason why you've seen the White House, in recent days, really step up its attempts to demonstrate that it's on top of the baby formula shortage. You have those flights arriving today with the first stockpiles from Europe because they understand, unless they're demonstrating action, those numbers are only going to get worse. MARGARET BRENNAN: Absolutely. And a very personal issue for so many. Ed O'Keefe, thanks for your great reporting from Atlanta. We'll be right back with a closer look at the economy. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Jason Furman. He was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under former President Obama, and he joins us today from Davos, Switzerland. Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. You know, it was a rough week, really, for the markets. The Treasury Secretary kind of spooked people when she started talking about high energy prices, high food prices, having a slowing effect on the economy. Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chair, also used this word, stagflation. What should American consumers understand is going on? JASON FURMAN, HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL: Look, I'd put some perspective on what we're going through right now. The market is not the same as the economy. When you look at the economy, you see a 3.6 percent unemployment rate, you see 500,000 jobs being created a month, you see consumer spending quite strongly. So, there's a lot of good things going on there. But the market is sending a signal, and it's one that we should be somewhat concerned about and pay attention to, just no time to panic. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Treasury secretary was also sending a signal by acknowledging that this could be weighing on consumers, which would offset the positive data points you just pointed to there. Looking at this, what are the odds of a recession? JASON FURMAN: Look, we've seen a remarkable things. Consumers, if you survey them, are very pessimistic and negative about the economy. When they vote with their wallets, we saw -- we got the consumer spending data for April and it was way up. Consumer spending on just about everything has been booming. Over the next six to 12 months, I'm not super worried about a recession. After that is where I start to get worried because that's where the Fed's policy will start having more of an effect. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you know, we talk and have been talking about inflation on this program. It is, of course, the job of the central bankers, the Fed, as you just referenced there, to act to control it. But, politically, there's a cost, as you know. Democrats are pushing bills in Congress, as Congressman Jeffries just talked about, trying to cap what they are calling price gouging. You hear President Biden using that phrase, also talking about raising taxes on the wealthy. As an economist, do any of those things have a measurable impact for consumers in fighting inflation? JASON FURMAN: Look -- look, as you said, most of the job of fighting inflation is with the Fed. There's a little bit the president can do. He's done some good steps, whether it's opening up ports, getting more truckers on the road, releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I'd like to see him do more, like lower tariffs on China that were placed there by President Bush. I don't think, though, that these anti-price gouging bills would do much to bring inflation down. They just increase the type of shortages that consumers probably hate even more than the high prices. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were quoted as saying, corporate greed is a bad theory of inflation. Is that another way to say that what Democrats are talking about is just a gimmick? JASON FURMAN: I think it's pretty gimmicky, these price gouging bills, because, you know, you've got a lot of extra demand. What happens when demand goes up? Prices go up. There's an old saying, the cure for high prices is high prices. That's a little bit of a painful thing to deal with, but it's what elicits the additional supply, it brings more producers into the market, and it's what brings prices down. And we need to let that process work. You try to interfere with it and you're going to make things worse. We tried that in the '70s. it was a big failure. We shouldn't be repeating it again. MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned that you do think the president should act to lower inflation, at least partially, by lifting the trade tariffs off of -- of China. Those are the Trump era trade tariffs. But you know there's disagreement within the administration about doing that because they like the leverage here. For consumers, how should they understand how much exactly of the inflation they're experiencing is due to this fight? JASON FURMAN: It's just a small portion of it. I would -- that may be a quarter of a point to half of a point of inflation. That's off of an 8 percent inflation rate. So it's not huge. I just think if you're the president and you've made inflation rightfully your number one priority, you want to leave no stone unturned. And this is one of the bigger tools he has. It's not without controversy. But in terms of jobs, there's record jobs opening right now. This is about as good a time to take a step like this as I could imagine because the relief is needed by consumers. Anything you can do is worth it. MARGARET BRENNAN: It seems the Treasury secretary would agree with you on that. On the bigger picture here, we're hearing on the campaign trail a lot of blame of where the inflation came from and, you know, there's an argument that this is like 20 years' worth of spending and, you know, it's all sort of added up, plus all the geopolitical things going on. How do you digest that for someone watching at home? How much are democrats actually to blame for continuing to pump in pandemic era spending at a time when the economy was already recovering last spring? JASON FURMAN: Look, in March of 2021, the president signed the American Rescue Plan into law. That's part of why the United States has had a faster recovery than any other economy, but it's also part of why we have incredibly high inflation. I wished at the time that he would -- did something smaller. I think it was larger than it needed to be. But it's good that something happened. Then, after that, the Fed made a bunch of mistakes. It was behind the curve for most of last year. It kept thinking the inflation was transitory. It kept not moving to normalize rates. And now you add on top of that President's Putin's invasion of Ukraine, and that's like the cherry on top of this terrible concoction that we already had. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, it's quite a picture. Jason, thank you for your analysis and for joining us today. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week President Biden welcomed the heads of Finland and Sweden to the White House in honor of both countries declaration to join NATO. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates tells us why this move will have such an enormous impact on Russian President Vladimir Putin and the western military alliance. (BEGIN VC) ROBERT GATES, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY: I think it's huge, Margaret. I think it changes the geopolitics in Europe in a dramatic way. Now he's got NATO on his doorstep, not only in Ukraine and elsewhere, he's going to have them on his border in Finland. And -- and, you know, it -- it's an amazing thing he's done because he's -- he's gotten Sweden to abandon 200 years of neutrality. So I think -- I think Putin, one of his many huge miscalculations in invading Ukraine is he has dramatically changed the geostrategic posture of western Europe. And now that you have the Swedes and the Fins as part of that, he's really put Russia in a -- in a much worse tragic position than it had before the invasion. MARGARET BRENNAN: But he could still win? Vladimir Putin could still win in Ukraine? ROBERT GATES: If winning means taking over the country and absorbing it into Russia, the whole country, I think that's very unlikely at this point. He has the potential to hold on to a good part of the Donbas. But I think in terms of pushing on to Odessa or trying to bring a change of government in Kyiv or absorb Ukraine, I think if that's winning, I don't see that he can win. MARGARET BRENNAN: What are the security guarantees that the west needs to put in Zelenskyy's hands, to put in Ukraine's hands, to actually broker a deal? ROBERT GATES: I think access to western weapons, continued training by NATO countries, including the United States, a promise to have a -- keep a large NATO presence in eastern Europe next door to Ukraine, the supply lines. The other thing that I think is really going to be critically important, especially if this conflict drags on for a very long time, is the west has to come together and figure out some way to help Ukraine economically long- term, both short-term humanitarian needs, but then rebuilding. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a concern that if Putin is cornered that he would actually use a tactical nuke? ROBERT GATES: I think the probability of him using a tactical nuclear weapon is low but not zero. There are no large masses of Ukrainian forces that would be taken out by a tactical nuclear weapon. And if it's not got a military purpose, then the only purpose is as a terror weapon, to try and break the will of the Ukrainian people. And I think that moment has come and gone. I don't think that there's anything at this point that will break the will of the Ukrainian people. The other thing that I hope somebody around Putin is reminding him is that, in that part of the world, and particularly in eastern Ukraine, the winds tend to blow from the west. If you send off a tactical nuclear weapon in eastern Ukraine, it's going to -- the radiation is going to go into Russia. So, I just hope somebody reminds him of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you've called Vladimir Putin a man of the past. But when I talk to officials now, they say he could be around for another decade. ROBERT GATES: His invasion has weakened Russia and -- and it's got now long-term economic problems. Europe, I think, is very serious at this point about weaning itself away from Russian and dependence on Russian oil and gas. So that will weaken Russia significantly. Where is -- where is he going to find that market around the world for -- MARGARET BRENNAN: China? ROBERT GATES: China is not going to want to become dependent on Russia for its energy sources. China will want to remain diversified. They might -- might buy some more Russian oil and gas, but nothing like what would be required to replace the -- the European market. Putin will remain a pariah. It's hard to see Putin ever walking in he door of the White House or Number 10 Downing Street or at the Elysee. So, I -- I think Russia -- he has put Russia really behind the eight ball economically, militarily. And -- because now people are going to look at the Russian military and say, you know, this was supposed to be this fantastic military. Well, they give a good parade, but in actual combat, not so hot. MARGARET BRENNAN: Xi Jinping is watching what's happening in Ukraine and he is taking notes. What do you think his lesson is so far? ROBERT GATES: He and Putin have -- have had a common narrative about the decline of the west. We're paralyzed. We're polarized. We can't get anything done. The alliance was divided and had lost its purpose and so on. Boom, we totally underestimated the west. We underestimated the United States' willingness to take the lead again. We underestimated the willingness of the Europeans to come together and of the United States to put this coalition together. And we underestimated how fast and how severe the sanctions are that they could place. So, maybe the west isn't as weak as we thought. The second lesson is, looking at the Russian military performance, he's got to ask himself, what if my equipment isn't any better than the Russians? What if my troops aren't any better than the Russians? Maybe my military's not as good as they are telling me they are. The Chinese have given the Russians all kinds of rhetorical and political support, but they are doing very little concretely to help the Russians. My guess is, Putin though Xi before the Olympics, look, I'm going to do this. It's going to take a few days and it will be done. I'd wager that Xi never expected a protracted, brutal conflict that would isolate Russia so much from the rest of the world. And so I think he's playing it actually very cautiously. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the rise of China still inevitable? ROBERT GATES: China and -- and its role as a -- its growing role as a global power will continue. They do have some real problems. The -- the big issue for Xi, where he can't admit he's wrong, is on the zero Covid. And, you know, when you shut down a city of 25 million people for weeks, and people don't have food, they don't have water, they don't have medical care, this has consequences. And -- and how can he say, I got that wrong, when you've -- when it's resulted in so much economic and human costs? MARGARET BRENNAN: You were directly involved in those -- in overseeing the wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan for so long. The Taliban's back in power in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda is in the government. Women on the street have to cover their faces and their bodies now. Girls don't have widespread access to education. How do you make sense of where we are now? ROBERT GATES: Well, I think people predicted every single one of those things would happen if we got out of Afghanistan altogether. I think we made a mistake in pulling everybody out. I think that had we kept a small number of U.S. troops, 5,000, 6,000, something on that order, the contractors would have stayed, the equipment would have been repaired and taken care of. I mean we built -- we built a military modeled on our own, which requires a lot of logistical support, a lot of sophisticated maintenance and so on. MARGARET BRENNAN: How was that not known after 20 years of war? How is that dependence not recognized? ROBERT GATES: I think people did recognize it, and that's one of the reasons that people in the military argued for keeping a number of people there, because only if we had some representation in our military would the contractors who take care of those things been willing to stay. So, they weren't at risk. And when you had military, Afghan military, suddenly realizing they're getting no ammunition, they're getting no food, they're getting no support and they're isolated, it's kind of no wonder that most of them gave up. It wasn't that they were cowardly or that they were unwilling to fight. It was, they had poor leadership and -- and they had this dependency on -- on technical support that went away. MARGARET BRENNAN: You must have seen the special inspector general report that came out just a few days ago. ROBERT GATES: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: It blamed both President Trump and President Biden for withdrawing the military and contractors. ROBERT GATES: Well, don't forget, it started under President Obama. So you have three presidents. MARGARET BRENNAN: You would add culpability there? ROBERT GATES: Yes. They all wanted out of Afghanistan, the forever war. But that allows for no shades of grey. It's either all in or out, all out, is the way it was portrayed. And, in fact, there were alternatives. And the military put forward some of those alternatives, which was a relatively small number of people that we would plan to keep there some indefinite period. MARGARET BRENNAN: You admitted your owner error there in that model of replicating an American type military style and trying to rebuild it within the Afghan forces. ROBERT GATES: Yes. I mean it was well along that way when I got there, but I certainly didn't do anything to change it. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said before, the biggest threat to the United States is our polarization and the distance, the two square miles that encompassed the White House and the Capitol Building. Do you still feel that way? ROBERT GATES: Totally. MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't see signs of improvement? ROBERT GATES: No. I will say this, there is one glimmer of hope that I see. And it's in kind of my world. Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have done something no other living human beings have done. They've actually brought Republicans and Democrats together on Capitol Hill, and with the administration. You know, apart from a handful of isolationists Republican senators, you've got pretty, from left to right, a pretty strong consensus in Washington. But I would say it's broader than just Ukraine. You have the same kind of attitudes toward China and how we react to China, and to Russia more broadly, beyond Ukraine. So maybe that's -- maybe that's a foundation. Maybe there's a way to build on that. And, who knows, if you begin to get it in national security policy, maybe you can get it in some other places. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'll take the optimism. ROBERT GATES: Well, I'm not sure I'd take the bet, but you might take the optimism. (END VC) MARGARET BRENNAN: Our full interview with former Secretary Gates is on our facethenation.com website and our YouTube channel. We'll be right back.

I'm Margaret Brennan. We have a lot to get to today, but we begin with breaking news from Buffalo, New York, where an 18-year-old male is in police custody following a mass shooting that killed 10 and injured three others. That massacre is being investigated by the Justice Department as a hate crime and an act of -- quote -- \"racially motivated violent extremism.\" President Biden referred to it as an act perpetrated in the name of white nationalist ideology, and he has called for an end to hate-fueled domestic terrorism. CBS News correspondent Nancy Chen reports. (Begin VT) MAN: A shooter, a mass shooter. NANCY CHEN (voice-over): A frantic scene after a gunman opened fire at a Tops supermarket Saturday afternoon starting in the parking lot. Police say the heavily armed suspect shot four people outside, killing three, before moving inside the store. GRADY LEWIS (Witness): When I first saw him shooting, he shot a woman, he shot a deacon, he shot another woman, and then he went in the store and started shooting again. NANCY CHEN: That's when police say he encountered a retired police officer working as a security guard, who fired multiple shots that hit the gunman, but didn't impact him because of his tactical gear. The suspect then killed the guard. Officers say the suspect held a gun to his own neck after encountering police, but eventually surrendered. JOHN GARCIA (Erie County, New York, Sheriff): This was pure evil. It was straight-up racially motivated hate crime. NANCY CHEN: Of the 13 people shot, 11 were black. The suspect, 18-year-old Payton Gendron, is believed to have posted a hate- filled manifesto shortly before the shooting, which he also livestreamed on the social media platform Twitch, authorities say. A law enforcement source told CBS News the suspect allegedly yelled racial slurs during the attack. GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL (D-New York): To see that sense of security shattered by an individual, a white supremacist, who has engaged in an act of terrorism. NANCY CHEN: Gendron is from Conklin, New York, about three-and-a-half- hours from Buffalo. He was arraigned hours after the attack on a first- degree murder charge, pleading not guilty. (End VT) NANCY CHEN: A first-degree murder charge carries a sentence of life in prison without parole if convicted. The suspect is being held without bond and is set to appear in court again on Thursday -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nancy Chen, thank you. We want to go now to the governor of New York, Kathy Hochul. Good morning to you, Governor. GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: Good morning. I'm happy to be here, to be on this show, but it's very a tragic day for all of us here in Western New York. It's my hometown of Buffalo. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, our condolences to you and to that community. Are you concerned about further violence in your state? GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: Well, we are taking proactive measure to make sure that we're monitoring all social media platforms, because this -- this information was out there. This was on a manifesto that was written a while back. And so we're very concerned about what other information is perpetrated out there on social media platforms and are out there being disseminated globally. So, this information from yesterday's attack is already out there. It was livestreamed. The intent of this individual was telegraphed in advance. So I'm calling on social media platforms to be making sure that they're doing a better job monitoring the hate speech that's out there, especially when it's directed against populations and comes under the guise of white supremacy terrorism, which is exactly what happened here in Buffalo. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to come back to that in a moment, but I want to ask about the weapon that this shooter used. You've said it was legally obtained. You've also said that the shooter had been at one point under the surveillance of medical authorities because of past comments he had made about carrying out a shooting. How was he allowed to buy and to hold on to that weapon? GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: That is exactly what's being investigated now. I understand that he wrote something when he was in high school and that that was being investigated. So we're going to get to the bottom of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's possible that he should not have been sold that weapon? Is that an oversight in the state? GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: Well, no, we don't know that. We don't know that right now. But I'm going to get to the bottom of and find out right now. This would have happened a little while back. He's 19 years old. Apparently, he was investigating when he was a high school student, brought to the attention of the authorities. He had a medical evaluation based on something he had written in school. And so we're going to find out what happened in the aftermath. MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand. I know you just mentioned going online and taking what's out there in the social media space seriously. You've called it a feeding frenzy for white supremacy. How do you actually regulate this without impeding on free speech? You have a number of media and social media companies with big offices in your state. Specifically, what are you asking them to do? GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: No, we want them to stay in our state. We also want them to be more vigilant and use the resources they have to hire more people, change their algorithms, be able to identify the second that this hate speech appears, and let there be a determination by law enforcement quickly. Law enforcement also monitors this as well. I mean, we have the FBI monitoring. We also have state police. So we need a multifaceted approach. We need vigilance, not just law enforcement, but also from the platforms that are allowing this to spread. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: They have a responsibility as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Justice Department has called this an act of racially motivated violent extremism. You used a sharper word. You said white supremacist terrorism. I know your state classifies assault based on race or religion as a terror attack. There's no federal statute that does that. Should there be? GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: Yes. Federal terrorism -- there are domestic terrorism laws on the books. This can be prosecuted under state or federal laws right now. It started with our district attorney at the state level. So this individual is not going to see the light of day again, whether it's under federal prosecution or state under our domestic terrorism laws or just murder one. This person murdered ten innocent victims in our community just yesterday. MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, good luck to you. Thank you for your time this morning. GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL: Thank you very much. MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the mayor of Buffalo, Byron Brown. Good morning to you, Mr. Mayor. And our thoughts, our condolences are with you and your community. How are you all handling this? BYRON BROWN (Mayor of Buffalo New York): Thank you, Margaret. It is obviously very painful, very raw, very fresh. We're wrapping our arms around the families of those whose lives were lost. We're standing strong as a community and working to not let this horrible act of hate detract from us being a loving, warm, welcoming community. MARGARET BRENNAN: The shooter was allegedly motivated by white supremacist ideology. I know that you are the first African-American mayor of Buffalo, which, as a city, has been called very segregated, if not one of the most in the country. How do you all unite in the wake of something like this? MAYOR BYRON BROWN: We're a midsize American city of over 278,000 people, and this part of the city, 80 percent African-American, but diverse, with people of many different backgrounds living in this community. We are certainly saddened that someone drove from hundreds of miles away, someone not from this community, that did not know this community, that came here to take as many black lives as possible, who did this in a willful, premeditated fashion, planning this. But we are a strong community. And we will keep moving forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there an ongoing threat? Are your residents safe today? MAYOR BYRON BROWN: I think the question that we need to ask ourselves, are any residents safe in this country anywhere? We have to focus on sensible gun control. That said, after all of these mass shootings that have taken place in this country for different reasons, year in and year out, month in and month out, week in and week out, let Buffalo, New York, be the last place that this kind of mass shooting happens. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Mayor, good luck to you and thank you for your time today. MAYOR BYRON BROWN: Thank you very much, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy. And we learned this week that the cost of things like food and energy rose compared to last month. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg joins us now. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary. PETE BUTTIGIEG (U.S. Transportation Secretary): Good morning. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: As a representative of the administration, I do want to ask you a little bit about this reaction to the events in Buffalo. You were once a mayor. Do you think that there should be a federal law criminalizing domestic terrorism? The president used that phrase, but that's not really on the books. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, I will let the president speak to the legal outlook with regard to the definition of terrorism. But whether it's called that legally or not, this was terrorism, this was hate. And this would be a good day for every politician in this country left, right and center, every media figure in this country, left, right and center, to come out and unequivocally condemn white nationalism, so-called Replacement Theory, and any other hateful ideology that could have contributed to something like this, before it happens again. MARGARET BRENNAN: But should there be a federal statute that elevates things when those terms you just threw out there -- should there be an association directly with terrorism? SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Again, we don't know, obviously, all of the details that fit the legal definitions. What we know is that somebody traveled a long distance with an AR-15 to hunt human beings, to hunt black people. And we need to make sure that we root out that kind of hate and, by the way, that we have a conversation about the availability of the kind of tactical weaponry that he seems to have had. And yet we seem to be having that conversation over and over and over again as a country. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you a little bit on a personal note. We've been talking about this baby formula shortage nationwide that's been ongoing now for months. You have infants at home. Do you have problems getting a hold of formula? SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Yeah, this is very personal for us. We've got two nine month old children. Baby formula is a very big part of our lives. And like millions of Americans, we've been rooting around stores, checking online, getting in touch with relatives in other places where they don't have the same shortages to see what they can send over. And we figured it out. We're all set, at least for now. But I think about what that would be like if you're a shift worker with two jobs, maybe you don't have a car. You literally don't have the time or the money to be going from store to store. That's why this is such a serious issue. And that's why it's getting attention at the highest levels, including, of course, direct involvement by the president. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and this is going to be an issue Congress takes up this week. I know the president said more action is coming, but this has been ongoing for months. There are supply chain issues already. Then you have the issue with this one plant, Abbott, whistle-blower in September, February, the recall. It's May. Why has it taken so long? And why did the president on Friday seem to say that it was new information to him? He said, if we'd been better mind readers, I guess we could have done something earlier. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, look, the administration acted from day one after the recall, taking steps like creating more flexibility for the WIC program to help rebalance the availability of formula in the States. There are more actions that are underway, including looking at imports. But, fundamentally, we are here because a company was not able to guarantee that its plant was safe. And that plant has shut down. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that is the federal government's job as regulators to help ensure safety of the plant. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: As regulators, yes, but let's be very clear. This is a capitalist country. The government does not make baby formula, nor should it. Companies make formula. And one of those companies, a company which, by the way, seems to have 40 percent market share, messed up, and is unable to confirm that a plant, a major plant, is safe and free of contamination. So the most important thing to do right now, of course, is to get that plant in Michigan up and running safely. And that's the work that's going on between the company and the FDA. It's got to be safe and it's got to be up and running as soon as possible. But this is the difference between a supply chain problem, in other words, a problem about moving goods around, and a supply problem, which has to do with whether they're being produced in the first place. Now, the administration's also been working with other companies to try to surge their production. That's led to an increase in production, which is helping to compensate. But, at the end of the day, this plant needs to come back online safely. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll have more on that later in the show, but -- because I know you're not the FDA commissioner. Let me talk to you about the things you are involved more in, which is supply chain and procurement. How is the administration making sure that those essential ingredients that are actually required for something like formula are actually available? SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: So, a shortage of ingredients is not what led to the shutdown of the facility, right? MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but it is a factor that has led to price inflation. It's one of the factors among many that has been blamed for months of problems with baby formula even before the recall in February. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Right, but America has the productive capacity to create the baby formula that we need. I think what... MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're trying -- bringing it in from Europe right now. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Right. But that's because, again, we've got four companies making about 90 percent of the formula in this country, which we should probably take a look at. And one... MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that an oligopoly? SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Yeah, I mean, it's basically a series of monopolies that have added up into enormous market concentration. By the way, this is an issue the president has been talking about in area after area after area, whether we're talking about fertilizer, whether we're talking about other things in our agriculture sector, or more generally. MARGARET BRENNAN: But there are contracts there too... SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... because this is also part of -- I'm using the term food stamp program. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a part of a government assistance program. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Which is exactly why, again, from day one after the recall... MARGARET BRENNAN: This isn't just a private sector problem, is my point. The federal government is directly involved in some of these arrangements. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: A plant shutting down because a company can't assure that it is physically safe from contamination is the responsibility of the company. The responsibility of the regulator is to ensure, as they take steps to get it ready, that it will in fact be safe when it comes back online. MARGARET BRENNAN: I have so much more to get to as well. I want to get you on inflation. Gas prices, highest ever price in the country, $4.45 a gallon national average. Are you asking Americans to drive less? SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: No, what we're asking Americans to do is to obviously recognize that we're working this issue because we're feeling it, too. I mean, all of us see that pain at the pump. MARGARET BRENNAN: Should Americans drive less? SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Look, what we want to do is create options for Americans to be able to get where they're going more affordably. It's why we up the fuel economy standards, so that, by the 2026 model year, the cars will be so much more efficient, if you have a gas car, that you -- if you used to have to fill up four times a month, it might be three now. Of course, we're also working to make electric vehicles more affordable, because that has a huge benefit, especially in terms of protecting families from these kinds of price volatility. MARGARET BRENNAN: Those battery components are also a supply chain issue. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Right. So, are we going to take that as an excuse to do nothing and do the same thing forever, or are we going to take that as an issue to work? We're taking it as an issue to work on. But, right now, with existing technology, we know that we can get more Americans into these vehicles. And we also know, right, that with gas prices on the rise -- and the president's acted with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. He's acted with ethanol flexibility to try to stabilize those prices. But we also know, right now, that we could be lowering other costs for Americans. And this is the most important thing I think we need to take a hard look at right now, when we're fighting inflation with everything that we've got, that we made the case to lower the cost of insulin to $35 and faced basically unified Republican opposition, tried to lower the cost of prescription drugs, and were blocked from doing so by congressional Republicans, who then come around and want to talk about inflation, without offering a plan. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the public isn't interested in things that didn't work, right, or didn't pass or aren't law. They want to know what's going on right now,at their kitchen table and in their pocketbooks. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Well I think they want to know what Congress is going to do to lower their costs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk about that because I want to... SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: And we're making the case for that to happen... MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what the administration thinks in regard to what some congressional Democrats, like Senator Warren -- Speaker Pelosi also says she's putting forward a bill about price gouging by companies and banning unconsciously excessive pricing. This has been called dangerous and misguided nonsense by the Obama administration economic adviser Jason Furman. Do you agree that it is nonsense? SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: I'm not familiar with all of the details of that legislation. But what I can tell you from an administration perspective is that there is guidance going out to crack down on price gouging where we see it. If price gouging arises in the formula market or the fuel market... MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that what -- how much of a factor is that, though? SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Look, one thing that we know is that we're in this moment, right, where we're feeling -- Americans are feeling the pinch on product after product. And some companies have become ridiculously profitable, notably including oil companies, which have specifically said they're not going to use the permits and the production capacity that they have. Why would they? They're incredibly profitable right now. They're not complaining. They're not unhappy about the situation. The public is unhappy. The president is unhappy. And we're taking action. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to leave it there. Secretary Buttigieg, good to have you here in person. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And good luck with the baby formula. SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG: Thanks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former Trump FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member. Good morning to you, Doctor. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to tap into your perspective, as someone who ran the FDA. You just heard the administration's view that this baby formula shortage is really the failure of one company here and that the FDA isn't necessarily fully responsible for ensuring things at that plant. I wonder how you respond to that. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, these look, were persistent problems that appear to have been handled poorly, certainly by the company. FDA didn't exert all the oversight that they could have of that facility. There were known problems with that facility going back many years. There were findings on previous inspections. The agency had a 34-page whistle-blower report in hand making pretty serious allegations that there was data falsifications information -- data falsification information withheld from inspectors. So these should have prompted more aggressive action earlier. I think, now that that facility has been shut by Abbott and production isn't going on, it's going to be hard to clear the facility. The overhang of allegations of data falsification are going to be the kinds of allegations that are hard for the agency to clear, even if they're not able to prove a causal relationship between the infections that we saw in children and the facility itself, which -- which, so far, the agency hasn't been able to prove, and they may never be able to prove that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. You just said that the FDA didn't do all it could. We know they didn't inspect the Abbott facility back in 2020. They stopped inspecting some places during the pandemic that weren't mission-critical. Isn't baby formula mission-critical? How does the facility not get inspected by the FDA? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, it is mission-critical. And during the government shutdown, we actually preserved inspections of infant formula plants because of the risks associated with those facilities. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were in office. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And that facility probably should have been inspected, especially -- when I was in office -- especially given the fact that there had been prior findings there. The fact that FDA went into that facility this year and found five different strains of Cronobacter, that is a serious concern. And it doesn't appear to have been a state-of-the-art facility, based on the findings in that 483. So, they should have been under close supervision. Look, we have -- we have sort of the worst of both possible worlds right now. We have a regulatory scheme that is stringent enough that it does create obstacles to getting into the market for new entrants. There's only been one new entrant in the last 15 years that's a domestically based manufacturer, a company, ByHeart. But, at the same time, it doesn't provide stringent enough oversight of the resulting oligopoly -- three companies control 80 percent of the market -- to ensure that there's no snafus that can cause shutdown of those facilities. And so, when you do have a shutdown, when the market's that concentrated, it creates these distributed shortages that we're seeing right now that are very hard to resolve. They're going to eventually need to get that facility reopened. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: The timeline for that is very unclear right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's what I wanted to ask you. I'm sure the FDA commissioner will be questioned about that on Capitol Hill this week. But you said it's a broken market. And you're pointing to regulation failures. That whistle-blower report said they failed to maintain proper records and released untested baby formula. There's all sorts of allegations in here. Does this sound like criminal behavior to you? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Potentially. And that whistle-blower report was head -- sent to the head of the Office of Criminal Investigations at FDA. So it does appear to be a sophisticated whistle-blower. Remember, this division at FDA is nine people. And it was even fewer people when I was there. It's grown in recent years. And we made some budget requests to increase the size of that group. So the entire industry in this country is overseen by nine people. This has been an under-resourced part of the agency for a very long time, and that's contributing, I think, to these challenges that the agency is facing, trying to exert more vigorous and more efficient oversight. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Those allegations are going to be very hard to clear. And another issue may be that the people who the whistle-blower has implicated -- and FDA has interviewed that whistle-blower -- may be the same people now making representations to the agency about the safety of that facility. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And, if that's the case, that's going to complicate issues. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have more to talk about with you, as always. So stay with us. And, on the other side of the break, we'll continue the conversation. So, stay with us on Face the Nation. (COMMERCIALS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR, or we're available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ apps. And we're just -- replayed on our CBS News Streaming Network at noon Eastern. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We want to continue now with former FDA Commissioner and Pfizer board member Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Dr. Gottlieb, we've been talking about the baby formula shortage. I want to ask you about COVID, but just to pick up on something you said, I think you told me there are only nine people who oversee the entire baby formula industry in this country. Nine? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's right. And I think -- I think there were -- I believe there were three when I started at the FDA. We got some more resources for that group. There's been more resources added since then. And there's a budget request from the current administration to add four more people. But, yeah, only nine people right now oversee -- oversee the entire industry in the United States. And it was less than that just several years ago. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's astounding. Let me ask you about COVID. We hit this horrendous milestone this week of one million deaths over the entire course of this pandemic. Right now, we're averaging about 326 deaths a week. So we've come a far way. But we heard from both Dr. Fauci and Dr. Walensky this week that they have started putting on masks when they go indoors once again. There's concern about an uptick. What do you see in terms of trend lines? Where are we? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, we're definitely seeing a surge of infection, particularly in the Northeast and parts of the Mid-Atlantic right now. If you look at the modeling going on in those states, states like Connecticut and New York, it does appear that the infections are peaking right now. And it's mostly a wave of infection driven by B.2 and this new Omicron variant, B.2.12.1 that appears to be more contagious and have more immune escape than prior variants of Omicron. It looks like most of the people who are getting infected aren't people who were previously infected with B.1, but some portion of the 40 percent of people who escaped the prior wave of Omicron and are now getting caught by this current wave. I do believe that cases will continue to come down -- wastewater data collected by cities does show overall cases coming down -- and that we shouldn't have a big wave of infection this summer, although there are models floating around the administration that does show a big wave of infection this summer. The bottom line is, we didn't see that in 2020. We didn't see it in 2021, when B.117 emerged in the spring. So this summer should be a backstop against continued spread of this variant, but it does pose a risk for the fall. And it's going to be important to learn whether or not the new -- newly formulated vaccines that are now in development will cover this B.2 variant well. Hopefully, they will. I believe they will, but that remains to be seen. MARGARET BRENNAN: But -- so you reject the idea of a summer surge, even though scientists like Dr. Birx, who was on this program just a few weeks ago, is predicting and seeing a trend line that makes her very concerned that could happen, because it's happened before? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, and there is a model that the White House was briefed on last week that shows a big surge of infection in the summer driven by B.2 as it moves into the Midwest and the West. I mean, it is certainly possible, but other people disagree with that model. There is the potential that you see a slow burn through the summer. I think it's more likely that you're going to see infection levels come down. Remember, we thought that there was going to be a big surge last year and this summer with B.117 when it emerged in the spring. And as we got into the later spring, infection levels came down. We had a relatively quiet June and July, and then Delta came along in late August and started to create a new wave of infection. I think that's probably the pattern we're going to see again, where June and July are relatively low, people do feel safe again, and then, as we head into the late summer... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: ... probably B.2.12.1 is going to emerge or B.2 mostly in the South. MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Gottlieb, we'll be watching that. Thank you for your insight, as always. Well, voters in five states head to the polls for midterm primary elections this Tuesday, and those contests will determine which party candidates will be on the ballot in November. But it is the contest among Republicans in Pennsylvania that is attracting a lot of attention. Our Robert Costa tells us why. (Begin VT) ROBERT COSTA (voice-over): Top Republicans are flocking to Pennsylvania in the final days of the state's red-hot Senate primary race, knowing the state will be a crucial battleground in this November's midterm elections. (APPLAUSE) SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): Every Republican running for office says: \"I love Donald Trump.\" (LAUGHTER) SENATOR TED CRUZ: \"No, no, no, I love Donald Trump even more. No, no, no, I have Donald Trump tattooed on my rear end.\" (LAUGHTER) ROBERT COSTA: And the top three contenders are all pitching themselves as champions of Trump's political legacy. But voters face a conundrum: Who exactly fits the bill? Television personality Dr. Mehmet Oz won Trump's endorsement last month. But Oz has since struggled to fend off two challengers, retired hedge fund manager David McCormick, whose wife, Dina Powell, served in the Trump administration as a deputy national security adviser, and hard right candidate Kathy Barnette, whose fiery and deeply personal message on abortion has caught fire with grassroots conservatives. KATHY BARNETTE (R-Pennsylvania Senatorial Candidate): But it definitely made me become very adamant about the sanctity of life. ROBERT COSTA: But once polls in recent days showed Barnette jumping into the top tier, she also faced new and intense scrutiny of her past, including homophobic and anti-Muslim statements. Barnette has mostly denied and deflected, hoping to keep up her momentum. And on Saturday at what was billed as her final campaign rally, Barnette spoke to supporters in Bucks County alongside Doug Mastriano, who was endorsed hours earlier by Trump in the race for governor. MAN #1: Stand behind the cone, please. ROBERT COSTA: But CBS News and others were refused entry, no access, no questions allowed. MAN #2: They told us, no presser. ROBERT COSTA: OK. Trump has been watching her rise carefully, and warned his supporters to stick with Oz, arguing Barnette, if nominated, will -- quote -- \"never be able to win in November.\" And her rivals are sounding the alarm. You have called Kathy Barnette a mystery person. What do you mean by that? MEHMET OZ (R-Pennsylvania Senatorial Candidate): I called Kathy Barnette a mystery, because, every time she answers a question, she raises a bunch more questions. She's not transparent about so many aspects of her basic biography, that we don't know who she is. ROBERT COSTA: Would Kathy Barnette be a risky bet for Republicans in November? DAVID MCCORMICK (R-Pennsylvania Senatorial Candidate): Well, listen, I have gotten to know Kathy on the campaign trail. I respect her story. But Kathy has been tested. She was tested in the last 24 months in a congressional seat, which she lost by 20 points. ROBERT COSTA: But the race remains a tossup, with voters divided. For Face the Nation, this is Robert Costa, reporting from Philadelphia. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the war in Ukraine. Senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata has the latest on the diplomatic front and the battlefield -- Charlie. CHARLIE D'AGATA: Good morning, Margaret. The Ukrainian government is claiming a key victory in the battle for Kharkiv. And with Finland now on the verge of joining NATO, President Vladimir Putin faces the prospect of sharing an 800-mile border with a NATO partner. (Begin VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice-over): Finland today formalized its intention to apply for NATO membership, with Sweden likely to follow suit in the days ahead. SAULI NIINISTO (President of Finland): We have today a historic day. Finland will maximize its security. CHARLIE D'AGATA: President Putin has already warned the Finnish president he's made a mistake in joining the alliance. It comes as Russia has faced significant losses, pulling back from Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv. (VERA KUSOLOPENKO SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CHARLIE D'AGATA: But the shelling continues; 67-year-old Vera Kusolopenko lost everything to a Russian missile. (VERA KUSOLOPENKO SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CHARLIE D'AGATA: \"This was my home,\" she said, \"and, yesterday, it was burned down.\" Russia has now turned its firepower on Eastern Ukraine's industrial Donbass region, targeting infrastructure, bridges, oil refineries warehouses. But standing here, looking at the size of this crater in the middle of a dirt road in a quiet residential neighborhood, it's hard to know exactly what the Russians were aiming for. The sheer devastation caused by an airstrike in Bakhmut that tore homes apart, leaving residents homeless and furious. (WOMAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CHARLIE D'AGATA: \"We need help,\" a woman shouts in despair. \"Everything is destroyed, broken,\" salvaging what's left of their homes and their lives. (End VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA: British military intelligence reports that, despite that kind of bombardment, Russia has failed to achieve substantial territorial gains in the past month, and it's likely Russia has lost around a third of the ground forces it committed to the invasion of Ukraine -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Charlie D'Agata, thank you. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to return now to the economy and the financial challenges facing this country. We turn to the former CEO and current senior chairman of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, who joins us from Water Mill, New York. Good morning to you. LLOYD BLANKFEIN (Senior Chairman, Goldman Sachs): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Americans haven't experienced inflation like this in 40 years now. And the prices year over year are pretty incredible, when you look at them, gas up 44 percent, eggs 23 percent increase year over year. There's spillover into the services too now. I mean, you look at hotel prices, 23 percent increase. LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... airlines over 30. What does all of this indicate to you? LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Well, wage as well. I will tell you how we got here. We had this massive exogenous event, COVID, lockdowns all around the world. And, at the time that this was -- that this was beginning, it was a huge crisis. And I would say -- you say worse in 40 years, kind of unprecedented that everywhere in the world all lock down at the same time. In response, there was a massive public policy response, and -- to overwhelm it. And it was a little bit of fighting the last war, in some ways, because, in the financial crisis, you recall, the feeling in the aftermath was it took a long time to recover from that. So, this time, we were going to go big. And we went big. And that created a lot of liquidity. And all those dollars are change -- are chasing -- are chasing assets. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. So... LLOYD BLANKFEIN: So, we have too much growth, too much stimulus. MARGARET BRENNAN: Too much growth. Too much stimulus. So you agree with the San Francisco Fed... LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... when they point to things like all the fiscal spending adding to inflation? LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Sure. Now, again, at the time, it was very uncertain. And the most important thing was to not have it -- was to not lose all those jobs and have a massive crisis. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. LLOYD BLANKFEIN: And so they reacted. And I think they reacted sensibly with what they knew at the time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. LLOYD BLANKFEIN: And you can argue about that, but that's all with the benefit of hindsight. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, let's talk about what's happening now to try to control it. So it is the Federal Reserve's job. LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know this. LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, for our audience, it's the central banker's job control inflation here. Chairman Powell said getting it down to 2 percent is going to involve some pain. What does that indicate to you? And do you think the Fed is doing what is needed right now? LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Well, the object is, there's an imbalance, too much demand. And what you have to do is, you have to slow down that demand. You have to slow down the economy. And so they're going to have to raise rates. They're going to have to curtail, hopefully reduce the number of positions that are unopened, because they -- and increase the size of the labor force. And that's going to involve some pain. And the real pain is not so -- is partly what the Fed is going to do, but it's just that this inflation, some of it is sticky. It's going to be -- you know, we have something like 8 percent inflation. Some of that is transitory. Some of that is transitory, will go away. Eventually, the war in the Ukraine will be over. Some of the supply chain shocks will go away. But some of it will be a little bit stickier and it will be with us for a while. And while we're talking about this in the macro sense, overall, for individuals and certainly the individuals at the bottom quartile of the pie sharing, it's going to be quite difficult and oppressive. MARGARET BRENNAN: Difficult and oppressive. I mean, you lived through the last financial crisis... LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... Goldman Sachs obviously a key part. You know it very well. When you say it took a long time, it took about 10 years to recover from the last financial crisis.. LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Yeah. That's quite a long time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. So, given what you're saying is unprecedented, what does recovery look like? Are you saying strap in for more than a decade of struggle here? LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Well, it's -- well, no, no. It's a little bit different. There was a lot -- a lot of different things going on. And there were -- it's always at least a little bit different. This is -- this is kind of much different. And, there, you had the banks in trouble, a lot of distress, a lot of liquidity issues, big credit issues. Nobody was sure who was able to pay their debts as they arose. And that took -- and then, again, the financial system is the intermediary by which Fed accomplishes its activity. That's not impaired today. Actually, the consumer is starting out at a strong level. There is a lot of -- it is going to be hard for people to have savings, but they already have savings. They're not necessarily going to increase it quickly because of inflation. But they're starting in a much better place than we were then. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. LLOYD BLANKFEIN: And the Fed has very, again, powerful tools. Some of this will transition away. Some of the supply chain issues, again, will go away. China won't be locked down forever. The war will not go -- in the Ukraine will not go on forever. Some of it -- and some of these things are a little bit stickier, like energy prices. And there are some elements of the supply chain that are going to be a lot stickier. I will give you an example. We were the beneficiary for... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. LLOYD BLANKFEIN: ... a very long time of the globalization of the economy, which made goods and services cheaper because we took advantage of cheap labor and countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Well, how good do we feel, with what we've learned to be relying -- and this as part of your last talk with -- with Secretary Buttigieg. How comfortable are we now to rely on those supply chains that are not within the borders of the United States that we can't control? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. LLOYD BLANKFEIN: Do we feel good about getting all our semiconductors from Taiwan, which is, again, an object of China? MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think we're headed towards recession? LLOYD BLANKFEIN: We're certainly heading -- it's certainly a very, very high risk factor. And there's -- but there's a path. It's a narrow path. But I think the Fed has very powerful tools. It's hard to finely tune them, and it's hard to see the effects of them quickly enough to alter it. But I think they are -- I think they're responding well. I think it's -- it's... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. LLOYD BLANKFEIN: It's definitely a risk. If I were running a big company, I would be very prepared for it. If I was a consumer, I would be prepared for it. But it's not baked in the cake. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Lloyd Blankfein, thank you for your insights. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper is out with a new book called \"A Sacred Oath,\" which chronicles his time in the Trump administration. Mr. Secretary, welcome back to Face the Nation. MARK ESPER (Former U.S. Secretary of Defense): Margaret, great to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about a number of things,. but you did say recently that, after the events of January 6, which took place when you were out of office, that you now consider President Trump a threat to democracy. The committee that's investigating January 6 is about to begin public hearings. And they've said they have in their possession a draft executive order that would have had the then-defense secretary seize voting machines, and that the Department of Justice and the Pentagon would then be involved somehow in stopping the transfer of power. Do you think it's important for that committee to lay out these facts to the public? FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: Well, first, let me extend my condolences, by the way, to the families and friends of those tragically murdered yesterday in Buffalo. But, to your question, yes, I think the January 6 Committee needs to get to the bottom of the truth of what happened on January 6, the events leading up to it, and understand it, so, we -- there is a degree of kind of accountability, and, second, we have lessons learned to make sure it doesn't happen again. It's absolutely important. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's -- I mean, just even laying that out to you, it is kind of astounding to hear. And in your book, you write General Milley actually had an agreement with the other members of the Joint Chiefs, the lead military commanders in the country, to all resign if President Trump tried to use the military to stop the transfer of power. You write about personally being concerned that that's what he was trying to do. So, you saw evidence or you had good reason to believe there was an attempt here to basically stage a coup? FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: I had a lot of concern about what might or might not happen in the months leading up to the election, right? There was talk about conducting strikes against -- military strikes against other countries. The president through the summer was talking about sending troops into Seattle and Portland. And I write about in the final days, I had this private meeting with the head of the National Guard and General Milley, and I talk about what might or might not happen the day after the election, concern that there may be the use of the military somehow to influence the outcome. And, look, I -- there's been a lot of criticism about why I didn't speak up. It's because I wanted to be there on the spot if any of these things happened to be the circuit-breaker, because the only two people in the United States that can deploy troops, U.S. military troops, are the president and the secretary of defense. And I was in that pivotal position to act if I thought something was outlandish, irresponsible or would affect the institution of DOD or our country. That's what it came down to for me. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's why you didn't resign. But why didn't you speak out as soon as you left office? I know you started writing the book within months. FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: But why didn't you speak publicly about all of this? FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: Well, the election was over. I think, like many of us, I figured the president would -- would challenge the election, like others have done in the past, and, after a few weeks, it would be over, and we'd have a peaceful transition of power. MARGARET BRENNAN: But he did. There was an impeachment hearing on -- about what happened with January 6... FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... and about whether there were attempts to stop the peaceful transfer of power. You're saying you actually were worried about that yourself. FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: Well, I was concerned. You always have to think through alternative scenarios, what might or might not happen. And I would have spoken out if called for to do it. I said on another network I would have certainly spoken out if he had won the election. But he didn't. And at that point in time, I was patiently waiting to see what would happen, make sure that the peaceful transfer of power happened. As you know, I joined my other -- the living secretaries of defense, wrote an op-ed on January 3, three days prior to the transition, expressing our concern about the peaceful handover of power and warning the Pentagon, if you will, about the importance of them doing their duty. MARGARET BRENNAN: You talk about and have spoken quite a lot this past week about the events in Lafayette Square. FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's an important bit of the public record. You were in the Oval Office with the president and he spoke about a very specific number, 10,000, of active-duty troops potentially being sent into the streets of Washington, D.C. I want to play a clip for you here because I asked the then-Attorney General Bill Barr about exactly that. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: A senior administration official told our CBS' David Martin that, in a meeting at the White House on Monday morning, the president demanded that 10,000 active-duty troops be ordered into American streets. Is that accurate? WILLIAM BARR (Former U.S. Attorney General): No, that's completely false. That's completely false. Sunday night... MARGARET BRENNAN: The president did not demand that? FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR: No, he did not demand that. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you seem to have different recollections? FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: I don't know. You know, I wrote about this in my book that Bill Barr and I have different recollections. Of course, if you go through my story, you'll understand that the president calls over to the Pentagon earlier that morning and talks about 10,000 troops. That's when I'm first made aware of this request. And, look, I don't know why we have different recollections. I think, in all these cases, people hear or see different things. But I'm 110 percent confident of what the president was seeking that morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: The former attorney general said it was completely false. Do you think that was an effort to deliberately mislead the public? FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: I don't know. Again, people have different recollections. People have asked me about things that I simply can't recall. All I know is, the way we defused this is Bill Barr, to his credit, because he was a good partner on this stuff, put forward 5,000 law enforcement officers, and I put forward up to 5,000 National Guard to take care of this. I mean, do the math. 5,000 and 5,000. In my mind... MARGARET BRENNAN: You're trying to retrofit this 10,000 arbitrary number. FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: Well, I'm -- yes, I'm trying to kind of give him his 10,000 without giving him 10,000 active-duty troops. And we pulled it off, and thank goodness. It was -- it was the way to kind of get that down, get out of the room and get on with what we needed to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you concerned that, if the former president stands for election, that he will surround himself with people who you are deeply critical of who didn't try to short-circuit? I mean, you were very critical of Robert O'Brien, the national security adviser. You write about the chief of staff, Mark Meadows. You talk about Stephen Miller, all people who were egging on some of these instincts. FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: Yeah, absolutely, he will. He figured this out in 2020, after he beat impeachment. He talks about it. I describe this moment in the book, where he thinks about the people he should put into office. And so, yes, that is a concern of mine, if he runs and is reelected, absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: But should any of those people have any proximity to public office right now? FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE MARK ESPER: I don't think so, but that's my opinion. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they're names that we're watching and we will continue to cover. Mark Esper, a lot more in this book. It is worth reading. Thank you. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Watch the CBS Evening News With Norah O'Donnell tomorrow night for an exclusive interview with the president of the company that makes the Enfamil formula for babies. That's it for today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for Face the Nation, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "A group of hackers with ties to the Belarusian government broke into the Facebook accounts of Ukrainian military officials and posted videos calling on the Ukrainian army to surrender. According to Facebook's parent company, Meta, the posts appeared as if they were coming from the legitimate account owners.\u00a0 The group of hackers, known in the security industry as Ghostwriter, typically targets victims by compromising their email addresses and using them to gain access to social media accounts. \"When it comes to persistent threat actors, we've seen a further spike in activity by Ghostwriter,\" Ben Nimmo, Meta's global threat intelligence lead for influence operations, said on a call with reporters. He added that since February, \"they've attempted to hack into the Facebook accounts of dozens of Ukrainian military personnel.\" Meta's head of security policy, Nathaniel Gliecher, said the videos posted on the accounts of Ukrainian military officials were not seen by users and were taken down by the platform before it could be shared with others.\u00a0 Meta also removed a network of 200 accounts operating from Russia that were falsely filing hundreds \u2014 and in some cases thousands \u2014 of reports against users, mainly in Ukraine and Russia, for various policy violations. The mass reporting was an attempt to silence critics and Ukrainians, Meta said.\u00a0 The operation spiked in mid-February, just before Russia invaded Ukraine. The actors used a variety of fake, authentic and duplicate accounts to falsely report users for violations of hate speech and bullying. Meta said in an attempt to evade detection, the threat actors coordinated their mass reporting activity in a cooking-themed Facebook group that had about 50 members when discovered.\u00a0 \"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we've seen attacks on internet freedom and access to intensify information sharply,\" said Nick Clegg, president of global affairs at Meta. He said those attacks are manifested through Russian state propaganda, media influence operations, espionage campaigns and attempts to close the flow of credible information.\u00a0 Meta said threat actors with links to Russia and Belarus who are engaging in cyber espionage and covert influence operations have an interest in the Ukrainian telecom industry, defense and energy sectors, tech platforms and journalists. But Ukrainian officials believe Russia is behind the disinformation efforts, timed to coincide with conventional warfare. \"Cyberwar is a component of conventional war, provided by Russia against Ukraine,\" said top Ukrainian cybersecurity official Victor Zhora during a briefing with reporters on Tuesday. One group with ties to the Belarusian KGB, which Meta previously took down in November, returned with a new operation a day before Russia's invasion began. Meta said the group \"suddenly\" began posting in Polish and English about Ukrainian troops surrendering and leaders surrendering without a fight.\u00a0 On March 14, the group created an event in Warsaw calling for a protest against the Polish government, Meta alleged. The event was on the platform for \"a few hours at most\" and taken down along with the account behind it, Nimmo said. New information about threat actors with ties to Russia who are targeting Ukrainian officials and public figures on Facebook is part of the company's new quarterly Adversarial Threat report. It builds on the existing quarterly community standards report and the monthly coordinated inauthentic behavior report. The disinformation campaign by Russian-aligned actors targeting Ukrainians on social media and online comes at the same time as other cyberattacks targeting Ukrainian government agencies, media groups and telecommunications. The Security Service of Ukraine announced Thursday it uncovered another text message campaign pushing 5,000 SMS messages to Ukrainian military and law enforcement officers demanding that they defect and surrender to Russian forces.\u00a0 \"The outcome of events is predetermined!\" the messages said, according to Ukrainian officials. \"Be prudent and refuse to support nationalism and leaders of the country who discredited themselves and already fled the capital!!!\" Between March 23 and March 29, Ukrainian critical infrastructure registered 65 cyberattacks \u2013 five times more than the previous week \u2013 according to a report by Ukraine's State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection (SSSCIP).\u00a0 The agency said top targets included state and local authorities, the security and defense sector, financial companies, satellite telecommunications and the energy sector.\u00a0 \"We do not see serious and complicated attacks on critical infrastructure which can be successful so far,\" said Zhora, deputy chief of Ukraine's SSSCIP. \"We register attempts, but I hope we will be able to effectively counteract them and provide security to our IT systems.\" But hackers did launch a \"sophisticated and massive\" attack against the infrastructure of one of Ukraine's largest providers, Ukrtelecom, on March 28, Kirill Goncharuk, the company's chief information officer, told reporters on Tuesday. The attack against Ukrtelecom was launched from inside Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory, though Goncharuk did not disclose the specific location, citing security reasons. Goncharuk said hackers used an employee's compromised account to gain entry. The employee is currently safe, but the CIO declined to say whether the individual was physically coerced into handing over access.\u00a0 Traffic in the network fell to 13% of the regular regime of the network's functioning but, according to the SSSCIP, Ukrtelecom security experts detected the attack within 15 minutes after its launch and restored 85% of service within 24 hours.\u00a0 During the attack, intruders attempted to disable the company's servers and take control of Ukrtelecom's network by attempting to change the passwords of employees' accounts as well as the passwords to equipment and firewalls, according to Goncharuk.\u00a0 Investigators say it appears that the attackers did not access customer data. Officials have not yet attributed the attack. The investigation \u2013 in coordination with Microsoft and Cisco \u2013 is ongoing.\u00a0 \"The majority of [cyber]attacks that come to Ukrainian infrastructure at the moment have Russian origins,\" Zhora told reporters. \"And it doesn't matter whether the FSB or GRU originate it. Different APT groups can sit on the same floor in the same buildings.\" The hack follows an attack on U.S. telecommunications firm Viasat on February 24 that targeted terminals in Ukraine but also caused outages in Germany and other European countries at the start of the Russian invasion. \u00a0A U.S. official tells CBS News that American intelligence officials believe Russian state-actors were behind the Viasat hack, though the White House has not publicly said so. U.S. officials believe it was meant to disrupt service in Ukraine but spread beyond the intended targets. The Biden administration remains concerned that cyberattacks targeting Ukrainian critical infrastructure could \"spill over\" to the U.S. and its allies, similar to events surrounding the 2017 NotPetya malware attack. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell on Wednesday that Russian actors \"have not attacked our critical infrastructure in retaliation to the sanctions we've imposed.\" \"We are preparing for an attack,\" Mayorkas added, noting that U.S. officials are on high alert for potential breaches of critical infrastructure, including U.S. banks, the energy grid and water system. \"We are poised to defend ourselves.\" Testifying in the Senate this week, U.S. Cyber Command chief Gen. Paul Nakasone cautiously supported the creation of a \"social media data threat analysis center\" to help combat foreign influence campaigns.\u00a0 \"Based on my experience, watching two different election cycles and the work of our adversaries attempt to garner greater influence, I think such a center would be helpful,\" he told lawmakers, adding that researchers must evaluate \"the full spectrum\" of adversaries' capabilities, including tactics, tradecraft and procedures.\" CBS News reporter covering the intersection between politics and tech.",

            "article_content": "The following is a full transcript of an interview with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla that aired Sunday, March 13, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Here now is the Chairman and CEO of Pfizer, Albert Bourla. Welcome to Face the Nation. PFIZER CEO DOCTOR ALBERT BOURLA: Thank you very much for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's good to have you in person for this conversation. You know, just this past week, the global death toll from COVID hit six million people. And yet here in the United States, the last state is lifting its mask requirement. Where do you think we are in this recovery? DR. BOURLA: You know, I think we have done way better than while things could have been done, but clearly we are not where we would all like to be, which is COVID is behind us. I think that right now we have very significant tools in our hands so that we can go gradually, I think, back to our normal lives. But we need to understand that the COVID will not go away in the years to come. We will have to live- to learn how to live with it, and we can, as we are living with many- so many other viruses. MARGARET BRENNAN: Learning to live with it also means sort of preparing for what's next. And Omicron was the first variant to really pierce the immunity that the vaccine offered. Do you think that we will every fall have to prepare ourselves for a booster shot with COVID, just like we get a flu shot? DR. BOURLA: I think so. And I think this is what we are trying now to make. First of all, we try very diligently to stay ahead of the virus because, as you said, many variants are coming and Omicron was the first one that was able to evade in a skillful way, the immune protection that we're giving. But also, we know that the duration of the protection doesn't last very long. Not only of the vaccine, but also the people that are getting sick. They are not getting very durable immune protection. If you get sick, you can get sick again next year with the same-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --like four months or something like that-- DR. BOURLA: Exactly, exactly. So what we are trying to do, and we are working very diligently right now, it is to make not only a vaccine that will protect against all variants, including Omicron, but also something that can protect for at least a year. And if we be able to achieve that, then I think it is very easy to follow and remember so that we can go back to really the way used to live. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've seen some of that data on a- on a fourth dose, a second booster shot. You think it will be necessary. DR. BOURLA: Right now, the way that we have seen, it is necessary, a fourth booster right now. The protection that you are getting from the third, it is good enough, actually quite good for hospitalizations and deaths. It's not that good against infections, but doesn't last very long. But we are just submitting those data to the FDA and then we will see what the experts also will say outside Pfizer. MARGARET BRENNAN: And last time you submitted to the FDA on booster shots, there was this confusing back and forth with the public, with the FDA saying, no, it's not needed, and they changed their minds and said it was needed. Can you avoid that kind of confusion this time around? DR. BOURLA: I think so. I think so. And I think right now we need to be very well-coordinated, CDC, FDA and the industry so that we are all providing to the American people and to the world a cohesive picture rather than confusion. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the question that was number one on my list and I think for so many parents, is when will the vaccine be available for those children, five and under? This is the last part of the population that doesn't have any kind of protection from a vaccine. DR. BOURLA: You're right, and I hope that we will have those data next month. MARGARET BRENNAN: Next month? DR. BOURLA: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which would put us on track for potentially a May availability-- DR. BOURLA: Potentially May if it works, if the answer will do their utmost to review them fast. So and we will be ready with manufacturing. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, if you look at the effect of Omicron, this was the first variant that really hit kids in a measurable way, in a significant way, and we saw hospitalizations really climb there. And I wonder, because it was the one variant that really impacted kids. It hit when a vaccine could have been available. A two-dose vaccine could have been available, but the FDA slowed that down, said, let's wait for a data on three doses. Do you think that having made that vaccine available, it would have saved lives and helped kids stay out of the hospital? DR. BOURLA: First of all, I think I need to correct something. FDA was very keen to submit. Actually, they were the ones who asked us to submit on two doses. We were a little bit reluctant to submit to two doses because we felt that the three dose is what kids will need. Eventually, in reviewing the situation with them, we all agreed that it's better if we wait for the three doses to come out because it's one thing it is to have a vaccine out there, and the other thing it is to have a clear picture for the parents by all scientists that they all agree, CDC, FDA, the industry, academia, that it is the right thing to do for the kids. And I think the three doses likely will provide the very strong set of evidence, so everybody will agree. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you had a back and forth there. I mean, it was whiplash for parents. That was very frustrating. Was it frustrating for you? DR. BOURLA: It- it- not frustrating for me, but I understand the parents, what was very frustrating and it was a frustration that was caused by good intent. Everybody was trying to see if we can save lives by submitting earlier data, eventually concluded that the best thing to do for the kids, it is the way to have a full set of data that provides full, transparent proof about what the vaccine can do to the kids. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think that should have happened differently? DR. BOURLA: I think we could have managed it differently, but eventually we are in the right place as to what the situation is. MARGARET BRENNAN: So now that we're talking about a vaccine being available to kids five and up, it's readily available. But then in the state of Florida, for example, you have their surgeon general saying healthy kids in that age group shouldn't be vaccinated. That contradicts what the CDC is recommending. When you hear recommendations like that, what do you think? DR. BOURLA: I'm sad. I don't agree with this recommendation, clearly, uh, you know, authorities are the ones that they have the duty to recommend, but I don't agree with this recommendation. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, the specific statement was based on the data. Healthy children five to 17 may not benefit. The Florida health authorities are only recommending kids with underlying conditions. You know this vaccine. DR. BOURLA: I know. MARGARET BRENNAN: For healthy children, do they need to be protected? DR. BOURLA: I think they need to be protected. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you've seen the data to say that would make a difference, how? Because so many parents do wonder with these younger age groups if it's the right choice to go ahead. DR. BOURLA: It is the right choice. This is what I believe and this is also what the authorities of all the world believe, with the exception, of course, of Florida. MARGARET BRENNAN: Pfizer also announced that you're beginning a trial of a drug, or you're in the process of a trial of a drug that would help kids with COVID stay out of the hospital. So if they get sick, it would potentially lessen the severity of- of the virus. That's for ages six to 17. When does this become available to kids? Is this before they go back to school in the fall? What should parents be expecting? DR. BOURLA: It is a study- it's a very large study. It is the same treatment that it is right now available for adults 18 and above. And indeed, the results of the study demonstrated that when you take these pills, it's a treatment for mouth. Instead of 10 people going to hospital, only one will go. Nine of them will not. It's a 90 percent protection approach. The studies will be event driven. So we are going to a very big number of kids and we're waiting to see how many will go to hospital, how many want to go to hospitals. So will depend a little bit on- on the intensity of the disease and how quickly we can recruit those kids. But we'll take a few months and the goal will be to be before the schools open in the fall, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And then you'll look at it for children ages six and under? DR. BOURLA: We are looking for kids six and under, either in different doses or in different formulations. We are not about to start the study, but we are very intensively working for this population as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: So should there- taking a step back from the immediate and yes, I have young kids, so that's why I'm asking you all of this too. But a large portion of the population is concerned about what's safe and what's next. When you look at the question of pandemic preparedness, in hindsight, do you think that the US government should have focused more on treatments instead of going all in on vaccines? How would you change a US government approach for the next time? DR. BOURLA: Look, I think they did the right thing to focus a lot on vaccines. And by the way, it was the only thing available massively at that time. We had treatments that they could only be delivered in hospitals and they were having plenty of them. Now there is also oral treatment, which can prevent people from going to hospital once they get sick. But that should be complementary to the vaccination protocol. And I think that's exactly what the U.S. government is doing. And actually, actually this is what all the governments of the world are doing. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the pill you're talking about-- DR. BOURLA: --Yes-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --to keep kids out of the hospital if they get COVID. Would something like that have been available to people earlier if there had been an Operation Warp Speed for treatments like there was for vaccines? DR. BOURLA: I think there was pretty much an Operation Warp Speed for everything. It was covering treatments and vaccines. It was way more challenging to bring treatment that is effective, that it is oral. We have the antibodies that they were available from the- from the early days. MARGARET BRENNAN: --That's intravenous-- DR. BOURLA: But these are intravenous. You need really to go to the hospital to get it. The question is how can we avoid sending people to hospital? And once they get COVID, even before they have symptoms or serious symptoms, if they can just take the pills and know that will be a very light form of COVID, then you stay home few days, and that's it. MARGARET BRENNAN: In your book, you spend a lot of time laying out some of the conversations you've had with world leaders, with governments. The World Health Organization in particular, one of those global health institutions the world look to for solutions. They've been very critical of pharmaceutical companies, particularly when it comes to the question of equity, access to vaccines. How do you propose ironing that out? Because this- it seems like ones pointing to the other here, that it's not- it's not a last mile problem, the W.H.O. says. It's- it's not the host government's problem. Where is pharmaceutical companies' role here? DR. BOURLA: I think there is a unanimous acceptance right now by W.H.O.. I was in a meeting last week with, uh, with W.H.O. and WTO-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --The World Trade Organization-- DR. BOURLA: The World Trade Organization and the World Bank and everybody else. And it is very clear that there is plenty of eligibility of vaccines right now for everyone, which is exactly what, if you remember, I had predicted and I had promised to the world. MARGARET BRENNAN: You can manufacture it. DR. BOURLA: We already have manufactured it, so the vaccines are available to those countries and in fact, they are available free, completely free. Because the US government, the Biden administration, has an agreement with us. They bought a billion doses that we give at cost. We don't make money, we are not losing money. And then the government gives them completely for free to the poorest countries of the world. The problem with those countries is that they say now, don't give us anymore, we can't take it. Although the vaccination rates are very low in these countries. They cannot take more because they are lacking infrastructure and they have very high percentages of hesitancy. I had already from the first half of the year when, for example, W.H.O. was focusing much more on, you need to give them from what we didn't have at the time. I was saying that we need to prepare those countries, they don't have the preparedness level that when availability, when supply will become available, and it will become pretty soon in months, to be able to absorb it. And that, I think, was the mistake that we all did. We didn't focus much on that in the last year so that now that we have plenty of vaccines, the vaccines could also go into the arms. Lesson learned, I think. MARGARET BRENNAN: Set up more on the ground, what, clinics? Organizations? DR. BOURLA: It's very simple to do vaccinations, as you know. But for these countries, it's not necessarily given. They need someone that can make injection. They need to have syringes. They need to have a place that people can come and they need to do educational campaigns because the misinformation flies even more over there. And unfortunately, there is a lot of hesitancy on people receiving the vaccines. If you see the percentage of people that are not receiving vaccines in different countries in the world, it's highly correlated with the income of the country. And unfortunately, with the educational level of the country. The poorest countries, they have a bigger percentage of their population, which is not well-educated, and as a result, they are victims of misinformation. So they have why hire people that they don't get it? MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you attribute vaccine hesitancy in this country to then? DR. BOURLA: Look, the people that they are afraid or they don't want to get the vaccine, it's a small percentage, but sizable, right? But it's the minority. They are good people. Most of them are afraid. They are afraid, either of the needles. They are afraid either of putting something new into themselves. Sometimes this fear, they try to find a way out and they think COVID is not a problem because the fear of getting it is what it is there. They are good people. Who are professionally trying to profit from that are the people that they are feeding this misinformation, feeding misinformation to this population. And this is a very small percentage of people, but they are professionals. MARGARET BRENNAN: But there is skepticism of pharmaceutical companies profiting from this as well. You lay out how you landed on the price of the vaccine in your book. Explain that. DR. BOURLA: Well, you know, the way that we price medicines it is, we try to understand what is the value that they bring to society. So we try to say, for example, the medicines for heart attacks, as I say in the book, you give it to 100 people. If you have five of them less heart attacks, you calculate how much it cost to give to 100 people. How much will cost less, five of them heart attacks. And then you try to find what is cost effective. This is what typical we do. When we try to do that with COVID, clearly, we could price the the vaccine in the hundreds of dollars and still be-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --600 dollars-- DR. BOURLA: 600 dollars would be cost neutral to the health care system, not taking into consideration that the economy would open. And then you bring commander value. So we said we can't go there. Then our first thoughts was, let's price it the same way that we price any new vaccine of high technology, which is typically from one hundred fifty to hundred to two hundred fifty dollars in the US. But then I realized that because of the pandemic and because of the focus that everybody will have, if we had, because I didn't know at the time, a successful vaccine, we can have an opportunity to reset the reputation of the industry. That people could really realize that there is value to society from the existence of a thriving life sciences industry. So I decided, I said, what is the lowest price that the vaccine is sold? And they told me the flu vaccines, between 20 and 70. And I said go to the lower end for the high income countries, which is the price that you all know. The middle income countries, we started giving it at half this cost from the beginning and the low income countries, at cost. MARGARET BRENNAN: You just said help the industry's reputation. You write about this in the book. You said, \"the pharmaceutical industry had been under fire for the last two decades. In the United States, pharmaceuticals ranked near the bottom of all sectors right next to the government in terms of reputation.\" I'm sure right next to journalists too. But do you think that there has been a change in the perception of the pharmaceutical industry? I mean, Big Pharma is a very popular applause line on the campaign trail for both parties. DR. BOURLA: Correct. And it was for, as I said, for years. And there are mistakes that have been done also by the Big Pharma and by the industry. But I truly believe that there is no other industry that is producing so much good for humanity than the life sciences sector. What we see now after we were able to step up and provide solutions, a significant uplift on the reputation of the industry. And Pfizer, of course, is among the first ones. That's a fact, we can see it with polls. What is also true in my mind is that it can easily go down. If we do once the wrong move, it will go down. Reputation is something that you earn in drops, you can lose it in buckets. So I treasure what we have right now, the high reputation. And I am committed to make sure that we will always do the right thing so that will maintain it there. MARGARET BRENNAN: In his State of the Union address, President Biden talked about the inflation problem in this country, and he talked about drug prices and pharmaceutical companies. He talked about insulin. He says he also wants Medicare to help set pricing. What do you make of that? What would that mean for consumers? DR. BOURLA: Look, I think there is a significant problem with the pricing of drugs in the America, but there are two distinct. One is what is the cost of medicines to the system, to Medicare, to the government, to employers? And this is 12 percent of the total cost of health care costs, which by definition cannot be the big problem if you are 12 percent, but they occupy 90 percent of the headlines. Why? Which is the second problem, there is the issue of how much it cost to the American, to the- not to the system, but out of the pocket for the insured patient. And over there for medicines, Americans are paying like if they don't have insurance, although they have. And in fact, with a strange system of rebates, they pay almost double the price out of the pocket than what the insurance companies will pay us. So that is something that we need to fix. In the Biden suggestions there were in- in the Build Better Back, there were some provisions that I think that were absolutely right that were reducing the instituting out-of-pocket cap for medicines. I think that is something that we must do. And in fact, we also, in addition to that, make sure that any discounts that we give to the insurance companies, they also find their way to the patients. I agree absolutely with that. There are other parts that they don't agree. For example, what is called negotiation, there's no negotiation. It's a price setting. The Secretary of Health will say this is the price that I'm telling you to sell, and if you don't agree, you are getting 95 percent penalty. This is clearly price setting, it is not a negotiation. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, in your book, you do write about the Biden administration. You have a good relationship with President Biden. DR. BOURLA: Very good. MARGARET BRENNAN: You say. But you did have some political pressure from his administration as well. You say the administration repeatedly said that it will waive intellectual property protections in order to help global equity, essentially giving out your recipe to other manufacturers. Right? You say you felt betrayed by the administration when they announced that they would waive intellectual property rights. Betrayed? DR. BOURLA: Betrayed. Because I\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Did they tell you they weren't going to do it, and then they announced this? DR. BOURLA: No, it's not that. It is that they knew very well that this measure will not bring the results that was intended to bring. They knew very well all the details that there were not enough vaccines for all the world at a time, not because of intellectual property barriers, but because raw materials were not available at the time, because the MRNA technology that was the prevailing technology was very new. So we built everything from scratch. And they knew that even if they give the intellectual property to anyone, no one will be able to make. But nevertheless, they did it, and I think that was a mistake. But you know, this is happening in administrations. Not everybody, even within the administration agrees with every single point of the policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well specifically the US trade representative that you write about who had made the announcement and you said after it was made, presidents and prime ministers of many countries called you surprised that America made this announcement. And you said it was something toothless being given to the progressive wing of the party that was against the pharmaceutical industry. DR. BOURLA: I did say that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DR. BOURLA: I truly believe that. MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe that- that this was just playing politics? DR. BOURLA: Yes, when you say I support the waiver of intellectual property, you know that in an organization of unanimity. And you know that the whole Europe is against it. You know that this will never fly. So, but it is and is an easy give. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just a PR stunt, basically because it didn't go anywhere. DR. BOURLA: It didn't go anywhere. And by the way, we just had this discussion. Margaret's right that right now everybody knows what is the problem with this country is not the availability of vaccines, it is the availability of infrastructure and education. MARGARET BRENNAN: So would you be opposed to unauthorized versions of your vaccine? Your partners have- have said they won't go after those who violate in Africa? DR. BOURLA: Let me clarify for the pill, which is way easier to manufacture it, we waived already all our intellectual rights. We gave the rights to the Medicines Patent Pool, which is a United Nations backed organization, and every generic company in the world can apply, manufacture it and give it and we don't take any royalties. That's easy to do because it's a pill that's very easy to manufacture. RNA technology was highly sophisticated, and it was not possible for anyone to manufacture it unless they had extremely high scientific technical skills to manufacture at scale, which very few had in the world, very few. MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's not something that could, even if these intellectual property rights were waived, you're saying it couldn't be delivered on? MARGARET BRENNAN: It couldn't be delivered. And in fact, as I said, you're right, Moderna had said that they could do it, we don't enforce any intellectual property. No one did it. And by the way, we started it ourselves, also moving technology so that we can make parts of this, at least in Africa. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are a global corporation. How is the instability in Europe right now regarding Russia and Ukraine impacting you? DR. BOURLA: Look, the financial impact, it is very minimal in terms of, you know, Russia was maybe less than half percent of our total revenue. So this is not the point. But the- the security issues for all of us and the pain that we are witnessing right now because of this war, this invasion, of course, is heartbreaking. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect supply chain issues or pricing effects from this? DR. BOURLA: No, I don't think that we will have. We are very independent in terms of our supplying our ingredients from those parts of the world. We are not making over there medicines. We do- do make some medicines in Russia for Russia, but we do not export. We do not expect to see in the world any disruptions, right now at least, because of this war. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you- you don't plan then to divest from Russia? DR. BOURLA: We- we have very few things. You know, the- the issue is that during every time that you have bans or, let's say, trade restrictions, typically they don't apply to medicines because it's about lives. How can you say I'm not going to send the cancer medicines to Russians because of what they did? Usually they are exempt from- from this, let's say, situations, but clearly we are not planned to invest in Russia and you have very little investments there frankly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Currently, you have very little investments there-- DR. BOURLA: --Currently. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Operation Warp Speed and how all of this played out, because I think there are some lessons to be learned for the next time. So you, when you were last on this program, it was September of 2020 and you said at the time you were deciding not to take taxpayer dollars because you said \"it would liberate scientists from any bureaucracy when you get money from someone that always comes with strings.\" So you expected political pressure from the get go? DR. BOURLA: And not only political. Political I had anyway taking the money or not. There was tremendous political pressure. We need to make a vaccine, but if you take the money, then you have also bureaucratic pressure. So what would be the start when it starts? Are you going to do it in Brazil or in Argentina? I mean, all of that that the people think entitled to be part of the decision making and rightfully so, if it is taxpayers money they need to know where they go. Right? I didn't want that. I wanted our scientists that they sit and discuss quickly and make a decision how and where they will do the trials and how and where they are going to do the manufacturing. So this is- and we were right, right? We were the first ones to come out with an effective vaccine, although the size usually slows down. Right? We \u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. No go ahead. DR. BOURLA: We moved with a speed of of a sprint, although we have a site of an elephant. MARGARET BRENNAN: Operation Light Speed, right? Is that what you called it? DR. BOURLA: Operation Light Speed. We called it. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said, what instead of time is money, time is life. DR. BOURLA: That was the motto. And it was already in Pfizer we were using that: time is life. Because you delay a month, it is- you should measure coffins when you delay a month in cases like that. And that's why I said times life, just do it fast. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you could afford to make a decision like that because Pfizer is so massive. For those scientists who are at startups, I mean, they have good ideas, too. So what is the takeaway? Should they not partner with the government? DR. BOURLA: No, I think for them, they should have partnered with the government. I think, uh\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Moderna for example. DR. BOURLA: Yeah, I don't want to comment on their financials, but at the time, clearly they needed the money, right? And I think they did the right thing, and I think the government did the right thing. It was just- I didn't want to be part of that, and I don't think Big Pharma needed to be part of it. They had all the resources, the small yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but for next time, you would want to see, And God forbid. Right. Hopefully, the next pandemic is decades ahead of us, if not hundreds of years, but for the next time do you think that this project should be replicated? Should there be another Operation Warp Speed? DR. BOURLA: I think so. I think there were a lot of positive things. Now, there were also things that could have been handled differently. Everybody was doing that for the first time. But in general, they need to be mechanisms so that the private sector, if in situations when things need to be very fast, at least for those that they need resources, they should be given. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, there's been criticism of Pfizer from former Trump officials and books and the like. One of them called Pfizer the least transparent and least collaborative of all the vaccine manufacturers. What do you make of criticism like that? DR. BOURLA: Look, I think this administration was very frustrated because the vaccine came after the elections. And some of them felt particularly, I think, the president made it clear in some statements, President Trump I mean, that he was, uh, thinking that we did it on purpose, that we delayed the results. We didn't do that on purpose. But that frustrated them. And that is the genesis of every-. Every uh, let's say they were not transparent that one of the\u2014 (trails off a bit) There is also another item. I thought that they would be very happy when we told them we don't take the money, we are here. We don't need your money. We will do it on our own money. But you're here to collaborate. \u00a0That somehow they feel that they have less ownership on us. Somehow they felt that if we are the ones to cut the line, they cannot take that much credit. Not that anybody would have difficulty to take credit if we are successful because using their success has many fathers, as you know. But that was something that we faced, and we saw a lot of animosity in certain cases against us. Just because of that. Eventually we were able to manage the situation, and we were the first ones to cross the line with a good vaccine and we had a happy ending to it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is animosity another word for tweets? DR. BOURLA: I wish it was only the tweets. It was \u00a0even more. It was us trying to get the supply materials from suppliers that had place orders with our money well ahead. And then the supplier telling us, You are not in the list, I can't give it to you. MARGARET BRENNAN: You weren't on a US government list? Yeah. DR. BOURLA: Yeah. And I said, \"What do you mean? We are not in the list?\" You are not in the U.S. government list. You can't get the supplies that you asked, ask the U.S. government. And then we going to say there is a list. Why are we not on this list so? Well, you're not part of Operation Warp Speed. We are. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you had the first and only effective vaccine right out of the gate. But you were saying the Trump administration got in the way to hold up what disbursement of it because\u2013 DR. BOURLA: All of this was before the vaccine was proven to be right. Right? So don't forget that we were manufacturing, at risk, millions of doses before we know if it is successful or not. And for that, we needed a lot of components and materials and some of them, they were in short supply. So the Operation Warp Speed could play some roles. So these are- they were giving list of the suppliers under, uh, under that, let's say that war type of legislation. But they existed. Then we were not in this list. We complained multiple times and I sent emails, wanted to be back in the list and eventually they put us back in the list. MARGARET BRENNAN: But they were favoring those who were taking taxpayer dollars over Pfizer? DR. BOURLA: Yes, clearly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did that slow down production? DR. BOURLA: Yes, and created a lot of anxiety and created a lot of creativity of us to try to find alternative ways of doing my- our job. But that was clearly not a good situation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think you could have gotten a vaccine in less than nine months if this hadn't been an impediment? DR. BOURLA: No. Most of that affected how much we could manufacture. Maybe we could manufacture a little bit more in the beginning when, but didn't affect the study, the clinical study. MARGARET BRENNAN: And why do- Who was doing that? DR. BOURLA: I think there was a whole set of Operation Warp Speed that they were doing, let's say several- It was not always very clear- MARGARET BRENNAN: Led by Dr Moncef Slaoui. DR. BOURLA: Yes, I spoke to Mocef and he was trying to help on that. But he also himself didn't realize why and what things are happening frankly. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said the president never once spoke to you. President Trump never called you. DR. BOURLA. After the election. I think we had good relations and we were speaking before the election. And he called several times to-to find out what is the progress of our research. And I was giving him all the download as to how we are doing as I was doing from the presidential campaign and also the Biden campaign. So- and we were doing the same with, uh, the Speaker and or doing the same with, uh, both leaders of the aisle. So we were very transparent as to how we progressed. After everybody called me to congratulate me. As I said, the president didn't, and I think I know why, because he was frustrated that he believed wrongly that we did it on purpose and we came after the election. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it just seems contradictory. The administration is pressuring you to speed up before the election, but making it more difficult for you to get the supplies to produce the vaccine. DR. BOURLA: Yes, you're right. It's a\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you point that out to the administration? : I did. And also, I was trying to explain at the time that, of course, nobody knows who will be and who will not be successful. But clearly, we have a good track record as Pfizer. So at least we should be given a fair chance, like everybody else, to be able to cross the line because if we are successful, the U.S. government will take it. It's just that they will take it without having paying for studies. MARGARET BRENNAN: You also write about the decision not to order more vaccine earlier on, and that was a mistake the administration- the Trump administration made. And you recounted a phone call with Jared Kushner, the former president's son in law, and he threatened you if you didn't reallocate vaccine away from Canada, away from Japan, away from Latin America and back towards the United States. You said, \"Be my guest, Jared. I prefer to have Japan's prime minister complaining to you about the cancellation of the Olympics rather than to me.\" DR. BOURLA: Now, let me clarify first, there were issues and when Jared got involved and Jared got involved at least directly with me after the elections, actually in January, I think. He was able to resolve a lot of issues because she was practical and he got some of the bureaucratic nonsense and was able to do it. So that was the good thing. But then he was insisting that everything that we produce in the U.S. would only stay in the U.S. And I explained to him we can't do that because we are having manufacturing only in \u00a0the U.S. and Europe. So if you do that, then the Europeans do that, then only Europe and the US would be getting the vaccine. What about the rest of the world? MARGARET BRENNAN: These countries had already purchased the vaccine doses? DR. BOURLA: These countries had already purchased. And I told him look, I had asked you before, purchase, not you got it, but other people and you know, you didn't. You place the bet across multiple companies. You didn't- You didn't order as much as you are, for example. I can't do that now. This was where the disagreement was. That, in his mind, Americans first. So I don't care what you are saying, I'm here to provide vaccines to the American, so I'm going to enforce you to do it. Mm-Hmm. And this is what I said so then you will have to- to leave the political consequences of doing that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that different from the vaccine nationalism you've seen in other countries? DR. BOURLA: Look, it is to a certain degree, but everywhere we have this situation. But Europe, for example, allowed a significant portion of their- of the production of what was happening in Europe to be re-exported. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which caused huge political problems in Europe. DR. BOURLA: Yeah, but they did the right thing and the U.S. didn't. MARGARET BRENNAN: The US didn't? DR. BOURLA: No MARGARET BRENNAN: By prioritizing Americans. DR. BOURLA: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you say that? DR. BOURLA: Because this is what happened. We- we started sending to other places from the American production in May. All the way to May, only Europe was providing doses to the rest of the world, including Europe. MARGARET BRENNAN: This continued under the Biden administration. DR. BOURLA: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0So you think both the Trump administration and the Biden administration were wrong in prioritizing Americans before exporting doses to the rest of the world? DR. BOURLA: I think they were trying to protect the interests of the citizens of their country, but I feel that we could have been more flexible in allowing quantities going out of the US as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the global vaccine equity problems persisted. I mean, is any of this getting addressed now? DR. BOURLA: Oh yes, because now we have way more, production. Actually, we have production enough for all, but they want. Our problem is that we don't have many in those countries that they want, and they don't make it easy for them by knowing that there is, a vaccination center that they can go and get the vaccine rather than walk two days to be able to reach the vaccination center because this is the situation, there unfortunately. MARGARET BRENNAN: In rural parts of the world DR. BOURLA: Yes, in Africa or in other very poor countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: What was the toughest moment for you during this pandemic? DR. BOURLA: You know, there were a lot of disappointments because every day it was so complex project that things will happen, and some will be successful and some will fail. Some of them many times I felt that this is a fatal let's say incident, so that could kill the project. Eventually none of them were able to- were able to overcome all the challenges. But you can imagine when you feel the pressure of the entire world on your shoulders. Keep in mind, MARGARET, at the time billions of people were just hoping the Pfizer one of us would bring a solution, and that's it. That we were the only hope for the world so that you can feel that pressure on your shoulders. MARGARET BRENNAN: How did you deal with that? DR. BOURLA: I tried to rise to the occasion. I felt on top and that I am in this position. This is what I have to do. I convinced myself that failure is not an option, and then I try to convince everyone else, but we won't fail because we don't have this option. That would be that would mean very difficult things for the world. We need to bring a solution and we moved on. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it must be deeply frustrating to you when you see vaccine hesitancy or questioning of the industry? DR. BOURLA: I'm very sad. I'm very sad. Predominantly because a lot of this so good people ended up in hospitals or will end up in hospitals because of this wrong believe. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think with the technology, the technology that Pfizer used MRNA technology? It's still new and it seems like there are a lot of possibilities for where this could be used. What's the next solution around the corner? DR. BOURLA: I would say that the lowest hanging fruit is other vaccines. How to use this technology to bring vaccines that we don't have right now or we haven't, they are not good enough. Flu is a good example. The flu vaccines are not very good in general, and there are other diseases that we don't have good vaccines. So that would be, I think, the first. The second is oncology, cancer. Right now, a lot of research is happening by trying to use our to train our immune system through MRNA not to attack the virus as we do with Coronavirus, but to attack our cancer cells, to recognize them as an enemy and try to attack them. Highly rare that will revolutionize the field if we will be able to be successful with. MARGARET BRENNAN: How far are you from that? DR. BOURLA: You know, I think there's so much work happening even before the vaccines we started with, with cancer in RNA. We will know if we are successful, I think, in the next two or three years. MARGARET BRENNAN: So next two or three years? Does that mean a cure for cancer in the next two or three years? What does that mean? DR. BOURLA: I don't think we know yet. It could be that in some forms of cancer, we could have so strong responses that they will almost be like a cure for certain parts of the population. I don't think that we can see in the next two or three years. The cure of cancer per se for everything that we have, but the significant advancement, it is a possibility. MARGARET BRENNAN: To prevent it or if you have it or to lessen it? DR. BOURLA: If you have it right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that, you know, the President talks about his cancer moonshot is that this technology? DR. BOURLA: That could be a very prime example of technologies that can be used in this moonshot to find the cure of cancer. I'm not the only one, but it's one of the most important. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're working \u2013 so vaccines seem to be the thing you think Pfizer can lead on the most versus treatable? DR. BOURLA: There are three areas that we are working on. MRNA vaccines, other vaccines, oncology, cancer, and there's a third area that we didn't discuss which are genetically driven diseases, diseases that you or I or anyone can have. Because there's a mistake in our DNA and over there, there are high end technologies that these people are convinced, right\u2013 \u00a0they were born like that. There's nothing you can do to change your DNA. Now you can. And we are trying to use the MRNA technology to be able to edit your DNA where it is, where there is a mistake, if we will be able to resolve that. Some of the deadliest diseases usually rare. Of course, it's for a few people, but highly impactful for them. We can find the solution. MARGARET BRENNAN: You say at the conclusion of your book that there are a few things you would like to take away from this experience. And one of them is you wish there were less red tape for some of these other diseases that are being confronted that you could move as quickly as within nine months, for example, like you did with COVID. What specifically, are you talking to the Biden administration about that? DR. BOURLA: I think we are talking in general and with many, but I think one of the most exemplary examples of private property collaboration was the FDA with the industry. They were phenomenally good. The same was with EMA, the European Agency. They did things differently without cutting corners, which means that instead of replying to something in six months, which is the regular, you have a request to them. Shall I do the study this way or that way? It can take six months to get an answer. They were doing that thing for five days, right? I understand because that was their only singular focus and they put all the resources there. So, I understand that you can do that for everything, but also you can't accept that. OK, after the pandemic led to a back to six months, now we have seen what a good collaboration can do for humans. So, I think we need to find ways either through more resources to the FDA, either by doing things differently that also they can be the right partners for everyone who has promising solutions so that they can move them very fast. MARGARET BRENNAN: I can keep talking to you for days, but I think that we're at the time limit. So thank you, Dr. Bourla, for coming in today. DR. BOURLA: Thank you for having me.",

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - BONNIE GLASER PRODUCER: Olivia Gazis MICHAEL MORELL: Bonnie, welcome to Intelligence Matters. It's an honor to have you with us. BONNIE GLASER: And it's a privilege to be your guest, Michael. MICHAEL MORELL: So lots to talk about. I really want to unpack the Taiwan issue with you. We have not done that before on Intelligence Matters, and I'm excited to do that. But quickly, before we dig into that, I'd love to ask you how you came to study Asia and China and how you came to devote your life's work to it. BONNIE GLASER: Well, I started studying Asia when I was in college. In fact, I designed my own major in a political science department, although I started at Oberlin, ended up at Boston University and I did a deep dive into - as much as an undergraduate can do - into China as a case study in modernization. I studied Chinese a few summers in Middlebury College, where they have an intensive language training school, and then I went to Taiwan in 1979. I arrived there three weeks after the United States broke diplomatic ties with Taiwan. It was a bit tense at the time. It was a real transition for the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. And then didn't pay all that much attention to Taiwan for a couple of decades until we had the 1995-96 crisis. And I have been to Taiwan every year since then, probably several times up until COVID, so haven't been there for two years. But I studied China in graduate school as well. And I would say, the first 10 years of my career, I focused more on China itself and its foreign policy and decision-making and debates about its foreign policy. I was there visiting in the early 80s and U.S.-China-Soviet Triangle was what I was focusing on at the time. But in the last 10 years, I've been far more interested in how the world views China than how China views the world. Not surprising. MICHAEL MORELL: Right, right. It's changed a lot. So, what was it about Asia and China that drew you, do you think? BONNIE GLASER: I think I was looking for something that was extremely different from the West, I was attracted to studying the language, that was really challenging, and the culture and the history seemed - just, it was a draw to me. And I'm glad I did. I have watched China in Asia evolve in their importance to the United States, and it's it's never gotten boring. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Bonnie, Taiwan. Let's start with history. I think that's always the best place to start. Can you tell us sort of the short story of how we got to where we are today? BONNIE GLASER: Well, Taiwan was a Japanese colony from 1895 to August of 1945, and when Japan surrendered at the end of World War II, Taiwan's status was left uncertain. The KMT, or nationalist party, was fighting the communists in China. And when they were defeated in 1949, they retreated to Taiwan. And that's where the history begins to diverge a little bit in the interpretations of what Taiwan's status is. So China's position is that Taiwan was returned to China on what's called Retrocession Day in October of 1945. But Taiwan has a different interpretation and in fact, the KMT has one interpretation, and the opposition party, the DPP, has a different interpretation. So the KMT basically shares the People's Republic of China's interpretation. But it underscores that Taiwan was in fact returned to the Republic of China in 1945. And so to this day, the party holds that there's one China; Taiwan is part of China, which is also Beijing's position. But the KMT underscores that China is the Republic of China, not the People's Republic of China. DPP stance is different. That was officially put forward in 1999 and the resolution on Taiwan's future. And it states that Taiwan is a sovereign and independent state, and any changes to that status must be done through a popular vote. The United States says that Taiwan's status is still unsettled, and so it does not recognize Taiwan's claim to be an independent, sovereign state. It doesn't recognize China's One-China principle, which in its full statement is there is one China in the world, Taiwan is part of China, the government of the PRC is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. And so the United States basically says we just don't know if Taiwan is sovereign or not, and that remains to be determined. MICHAEL MORELL: Bonnie, can you shed a bit about how strong is the view in China that Taiwan belongs to it? Among the leadership, the elite, ordinary Chinese? Are there any differences of opinion within China on Taiwan? How salient a political issue is Taiwan in China? How salient is it within the internal politics of the Communist Party? Can you sort of parse that for us? BONNIE GLASER: Sure. For many years, I doubted that Taiwan was a very important issue for China, in terms of its public attention to the issue. It has certainly always been important to the elite, and every Chinese leader has said that reunification is an inevitability. And Jiang Zemin, when he was the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, even tried to set a deadline for the unification of Taiwan with China. But I always had the sense that it wasn't that important to the public, but that changed. And I think it was gradual, but particularly under Xi Jinping stoking nationalism, paying more attention to the importance of sovereignty and security, and bringing back the territories that China claims - so, attention to the South China Sea, of course, the Indian border, the territories that are the islands that are disputed with Japan. But particularly Taiwan, because the Chinese, they teach their people about this century of national humiliation, which began in the middle of the 19th century with the Opium Wars. And they say, 'This is the last piece that has not been reunified, reintegrated into the People's Republic of China.' So, particularly after Hong Kong has now been, of course, reabsorbed in 1997, but in recent years become, shall we say, less separate from China and more just like any other Chinese city, Taiwan is the last piece of removing that humiliation that the party faces. And I think for any Chinese leader and for the party itself, Taiwan is a legitimacy issue. If the Communist Party does not stand up for its sovereignty and the territorial integrity issue, if it were to not respond effectively if Taiwan declared independence, if other countries recognize Taiwan as independent - important countries, not just small island states - then potentially the Chinese Communist Party could come under a great deal of criticism. But I have to caveat at least the public opinion by saying that there really isn't good polling in China about public views. And when I've been in China and talk with individual scholars who probably tend to be more liberal, some of the younger scholars - I've actually heard scholars say, \"Well, eventually, even if Taiwan isn't reintegrated into China, it is not the highest priority for China,\" that it doesn't have to happen sooner. It can happen later. But I think there is a sense that eventually Taiwan has to return to what they call the motherland. MICHAEL MORELL: So we talked a little bit about the different views in Taiwan between the two political parties. Where does the public stand on the issue and how has that evolved over time? BONNIE GLASER: Well, the attitudes of Taiwan's public toward reunification in at least one way have been consistent for more than 20 years. The majority of the people in Taiwan want to maintain the status quo, at least for the time being. There are very small percentages of people - and there are very good public opinion polls in Taiwan; they ask the same questions every year. And today, those who support reunification as soon as possible is now just over one percent - very tiny. But if you go back to the early 90s, it was about four percent. So it hasn't changed all that much. But those who support maintaining the status quo, either just for the time being or indefinitely, is 87 percent. Why is this? Because the people in Taiwan know that if they declare independence that China's likely to attack, they're not certain that the United States will come to Taiwan's defense. They don't know if their own country can send off an attack from the People's Liberation Army. So they're really very smart. And in fact, I would say if there's a candidate that runs for president - which, the next elections in Taiwan will be January 2024, I think that the vast majority of people in Taiwan would not risk voting for a candidate if that candidate said, as part of his or her platform, \"If I am elected, I will make Taiwan independent. I will declare independence so we will become, in a legal sense, de jure independent.\" But what has really changed in Taiwan is, when they ask the question in these polls - you have a choice of saying, the respondent can choose between independence as soon as possible or independence eventually. And if you combine those numbers, that's now 31 percent of people who say, \"Yeah, eventually I would like to Taiwan to be an independent country.\" So that number has really been growing. The number of people who support a percentage, who support reunification either immediately or in the future is still about five percent. It's very low. BONNIE GLASER: So Bonnie, you mentioned Hong Kong earlier, and I'm wondering if what happened in Hong Kong over the past few years has had an impact in Taiwan, either politically or in terms of public opinion. BONNIE GLASER: Yes. Well, I think it had a major impact, though, it is true that China's model for reintegrating Taiwan into China, which is called One Country, Two Systems - we all think of that as the model for Hong Kong. But it was actually developed for Taiwan. And for many years, polls in Taiwan showed that the people do not support the application of One Country, Two Systems to Taiwan.\u00a0 So that is really, I think, the most important thing that affected the attitudes of people in Taiwan. It was watching China renege on its promises to Hong Kong that it was no longer going to allow the people freedoms. It has essentially taken away most of the media freedom. Of course, people are not allowed to protest. There have been obviously many people who have now been arrested and imprisoned. And I think the people of Taiwan looked at that outcome and said, \"Wow, this is not a country we want to be part of.\" And if China were very open and liberal and democratic, I personally believe the attitudes in Taiwan would be quite different. BONNIE GLASER: Bonnie, the Taiwanese relations with the United States. Can you talk a little bit about Taiwan's view of the United States, the importance of the relationship. You mentioned doubts about whether the United States would come to their aid if the Chinese attacked. Can you talk about maybe how that view has changed over time? Can you sort of unpack all of that for us? BONNIE GLASER: For Taiwan, the United States is their most important partner in the world. The United States, of course, is the only country that will sell weapons to Taiwan. The U.S. had a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan from 1954 to 1979, and even when the U.S. normalized relations with the PRC in 1979, it very quickly created the Taiwan Relations Act, which set out the parameters and procedures and the institutional mechanisms that would be used to manage and sustain the very close relationship between the United States and Taiwan. And I think it really has stood the test of time. It has been, perhaps, reinterpreted in some ways as the situation has changed. The United States, even though we say we have a One China policy, nevertheless, that has been fudged to some extent as China's threat to Taiwan has grown. The United States has, I think, developed, for example, more closer defense ties with Taiwan. We occasionally see leaks or read reports about how there's American military officers training in Taiwan. Sometimes there have been joint exercises, certainly information sharing. So that, I think, has been very consistent, but it has really expanded in the, I think, defense and security area. And the expansion, I think, really took off after the 1995-96 crisis, where the United States realized that we just didn't know very much about Taiwan's military. We didn't have enough direct dialogue with them. And at the time, Kurt Campbell was the deputy assistant secretary of defense. And he said, \"We need to have a dialogue with Taiwan,\" and he established what came to be known as the Monterey talks, which do not include just the military, but also have representatives from other departments from the U.S. and Taiwan. They used to do simulations, and that would help them to try to understand where they were misreading each other or what the expectations are of Taiwan in a crisis. But I think that the attitudes in in Taiwan towards the United States haven't changed very much. That is, they value the relationship. They want to continue to sustain it. They would like to hold the U.S. as close as possible. Most people in Taiwan think that the United States, I think, would help Taiwan if there is a crisis. But there's no confidence that the United States would full bore flow large scale forces to Taiwan and defend it. There's some people who hold that view, but there's always been doubts. And when the United States demonstrates that it doesn't have resolve in other parts of the world - such as when, for example, Obama drew a red line in Syria and then did not follow through - I think people in Taiwan ask themselves, \"Well, we, Taiwan don't even have a commitment from the United States, so what does that mean for us?\" BONNIE GLASER: So Bonnie, I want to switch from the views in both countries toward each other to policy. And I'm wondering what your sense is of China's strategy for bringing Taiwan back into the fold. What is that? And as part of that, what's your sense on the view that we hear sometimes that Xi Jinping has a timeline for reunification MICHAEL MORELL: For Beijing, Taiwan is first and foremost a political problem left over from the Civil War. So I like to describe it as a political problem with a military component, rather than the reverse. I think it's in China's interest to achieve unification without bloodshed, if possible. No leader, including Xi Jinping, would give up the option of using force. But I still believe that that's a last resort. China's strategy is aimed at inducing a sense of despair among the Taiwanese people, so they eventually conclude that their only viable future is to join the mainland. So, what we've seen recently and I think, you know, debates and discussions about Taiwan have emphasized the military threat to Taiwan, and it has grown enormously. And we heard Admiral Davidson, who was previously the commander of Indo-Pacific Command, say in testimony to Congress last year that China could use force by 2027, he said, in the next six years. And my understanding is that that statement was primarily based on an assessment of PLA capabilities. A few months later, our chairman of the Joint Chiefs said something different. General Milley said, \"Well, we have to look at capabilities and intent.\" And he said today, \"China does not necessarily have the intent to invade now.\"  So there there's a debate, I think, in the community about whether Xi Jinping has given up on using coercion and also economic enticements to unification. There's also debate as to what Xi Jinping's risk benefit calculus is. In my view, Xi Jinping sees the risks as quite high now. This year, Xi Jinping is going to get his third five-year term in office in the fall of the 20th Party Congress. So he's certainly not going to take risks this year. We can talk about later if you want, whether there is some connection with Ukraine, as many people believe there is, but the risks are high. I'll just tick off what I see as the risks. The PLA might be defeated. A significant portion of its navy and air force can be destroyed. China would be risking an all out war with the United States. There would certainly be implications for Chinese Communist Party legitimacy and domestic support if China lost that war, if they demonstrated they couldn't defend the territorial integrity of the country. I think that Xi Jinping would set back progress toward more important goals for China. And the most important goal, of course, is national rejuvenation, which requires competing successfully in advanced technology. And an attack on Taiwan could result in the formation of a much firmer anti-China coalition than we see today, with a willingness to prevent that technology from going to China. So I think for all those reasons, the risks are quite high. And Xi Jinping's priority is to prevent Taiwan independence, and he is confident he can do that today. The toolkit that China has to use to coerce Taiwan is huge. It's diplomatic. It is economic. It's military. It's cyber disinformation. It's quite significant. So the question is, again, what are the circumstances in which Xi Jinping would use force? And he might t lose confidence at some point that reunification could be achieved peacefully. He might see that there is an opportunity and that the risks are low; he could miscalculate. That's also possible. I also wanted to just comment on your question about whether there is a deadline. I think we have to recognize that at the 19th party Congress, Xi Jinping did say something different than prior Chinese leaders had said. He said reunification is a requirement for national rejuvenation, and the target date for national rejuvenation is 2049.  So we know that's the Chinese dream. But I still think that, you know, Xi Jinping probably won't be the leader of China in 2049. I think he'd be 96 years old. So actuarial tables, right? Probably won't be leader. Another leader or even Xi Jinping himself could modify that statement, so I don't see it as a hard and fast deadline, but he has at least linked the two together in a way that's worrisome. MICHAEL MORELL: So you mentioned, Bonnie, just now the impact of Ukraine on the Taiwan issue. How do you think about that?' BONNIE GLASER: Well, China is undoubtedly watching very closely the situation unfolding with Russia and Ukraine. And I think it is particularly interested in the responses of the NATO alliance. China will assess its cohesion and where weaknesses may lie, that can be exploited. So if the U.S. and its allies can prepare punishing sanctions to be used in the event of aggression, well, that might signal the will and ability to do the same in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Now, Beijing might potentially draw conclusions about U.S. resolve, based on the fact, at least today, where President Biden has said that he won't send troops into Ukraine. But I think that the Chinese know that for the United States, Taiwan is more important than Ukraine. American interests in Taiwan run far deeper. They have much stronger roots. As we've discussed, the U.S., even after breaking the diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, helped Taiwan transform from a poor military dictatorship into a prosperous liberal democracy, and that democracy stands today as a compelling alternative to China's autocratic system. There's statistics we could talk about. Taiwan is America's ninth largest trading partner. We know that it dominates the foundry operations for semiconductors. Everyone is talking about Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC. Taiwan's, I think, location is more strategic than Ukraine. It sits in the middle of the first island chain. And most importantly, for Japan, Taiwan is existential. And if the U.S. were unwilling or unable to defend Taiwan, I think that that would have huge consequences for Japanese confidence in U.S. resolve to defend Japan. And I think China knows all of that. So I don't think that the Chinese will conclude that if the United States does not use troops and military assets to come to the defense of Ukraine and prevent Russia from taking over that, that would make China's takeover of Taiwan a cakewalk. I don't think that's the way they see it. MICHAEL MORELL: So Bonnie, I couldn't agree with you more on everything you said about how the Chinese think about Taiwan and under what circumstances they would go to war and the costs they would pay. I agree with all of that. So given that, I'm wondering if you have a sense of what's behind all of the recent Chinese military maneuvers vis a vis Taiwan? Is it simply getting their building their military capabilities? Or is it that plus sending sending messages to Taiwan and to the United States? How do you think about all that? BONNIE GLASER: Well yo've already hit on some of the reasons, Michael, I think that training is important. I hear from people in the PLA that Xi Kinping has underscored the need to train realistically and sending their air force around Taiwan circumnavigating the island, conducting more realistic naval exercises. Training is definitely a part of it. Secondly, I think they want to stoke nationalism within the public, unify the party, demonstrate to their people that the Chinese Communist Party is resolved to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. And then thirdly, I think China clearly wants to warn both the DPP-led government in Taiwan and the United States to not cross Chinese red lines and deter them from going too far down the road towards Taiwan becoming independent. And they always warn the United States not to embolden Taiwan's leader to pursue independence - and I'll mention a couple of what I see as those red lines. The actual declaration of independence is certainly a red line. But if Taiwan were to hold a referendum on Taiwan's status - Chen Shui-bian held a referendum when he was president in the early 2000s, and that really provoked strong responses from China. So that's an example of, I think, crossing China's red lines. Or, you know, permitting the United States to deploy large-scale forces on Taiwan, I think, is also a red line.  But the last goal that China has, I think, is perhaps the most important. It takes me back to something I talked about earlier; that this coercion, this pressure on Taiwan, is part of a longer term Chinese strategy to induce this sort of despair within Taiwan that they really should just concede to Beijing, unify with Mainland China, that they should at least begin political talks and try to negotiate an outcome where Taiwan can retain some of the freedoms that it that it has and not have to be faced with a military takeover. But I think that so far, at least, China's military pressure and its other forms of pressure have really had a probably a contrary result. It's been counterproductive for China, and the Chinese may eventually see that, and that could lead them to adopt a harsher strategy, maybe even to use force or perhaps go in the other direction and conclude that they need to use somewhat of a softer hand. Xi Jinping is unlikely to draw that conclusion. MICHAEL MORELL: Bonnie, how do you think the Chinese think about the debates that occur in American think tanks about our China policy and our Taiwan policy? You know, I'm thinking in particular of the arguments that we should end the One China policy, recognize Taiwan again, or we should change our policy of strategic ambiguity in terms of the circumstances under which we would defend Taiwan, and we should just come right out and say we'll be there for them. How do you think the Chinese read all of that? Do you think they understand that as chatter in the think tank community? Or do you think they think about that more seriously? BONNIE GLASER: Well, the debate over whether the United States should abandon its policy of strategic ambiguity and adopt  strategic clarity, and that would mean a position where the president would say, \"Under all circumstances and contingencies, the United States will come to Taiwan's defense,\" which, the United States again has not had that obligation or had a clear policy on that since 1979. The Chinese are alarmed by that debate. When it first started a few years ago and was made quite popular by the article that Richard Haass published in Foreign Affairs with David Sachs and the Chinese that I was speaking to at the time wanted to understand what that meant, whether it was likely to happen and whether there was support within the administration. I recall at one point, maybe even more than once, our coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs in the Biden administration, Kurt Campbell, did say quite clearly that this was not something that would be in U.S. interests. He didn't go into great detail, but my sense is that it's not being considered at all by the Biden administration.  But that has not reassured the Chinese. And one of the main reasons is that there are many members of Congress that continue to push for adopting a position of strategic clarity. The Chinese have a very clear memory for past historical events, and when Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui wanted to visit the United States and the United States told China that they really were not going to give President Lee Teng-hui a visa. But there was a lot of pressure from Congress to do so, and at the end of the day, the U.S. caved in, allowed Lee Teng-hui to come. He went to his alma mater, Cornell University, and that speech in the aftermath led to the 1995-96 crisis where China was firing missiles toward Taiwan. And the Clinton administration ended up dispatching two aircraft carriers to the region around Taiwan in order to signal China that it was not going to tolerate this kind of coercion against Taiwan. So China remembers all that, and it concluded we would not want to see this change. Another thing that I think myself would be a dangerous outcome if we adopted strategic clarity is that the Chinese believe that this was part of the understanding that Nixon had with Mao, that Taiwan would be set aside. It would be dealt with in a way that the United States would not deploy troops in Taiwan. It would break its treaty with Taiwan, and its relationship with Taiwan would essentially be unofficial. Now today, China believes the United States has more than just an official relationship with Taiwan, but the U.S. has stuck to those really core commitments. And I think that returning to a position of strategic clarity could be interpreted by Beijing as an abandonment of our obligations and our commitments that we made as part of normalization. And China could end up concluding that it has no choice but to respond forcefully. And since we are in a moment where China has a conventional advantage over Taiwan - and there are lots of people in the defense community who think that this window of opportunity, even though China could end up losing, but it could believe that it might in fact be able to take Taiwan - that this could last a decade if the United States goes to war today, or five, even 10 years, it's going to go to war with the weapons it has today. We might have different operational concepts that enables us to be perhaps more effective at defending Taiwan than today, but if we push Xi Jinping into a corner and we say, \"We have abandoned our understandings of normalization and we are going to defend Taiwan no matter what, \"I think there's a higher possibility that Xi Jinping would attack. So I think it's a bad idea, and I think that the Chinese believe that it would really send this relationship into a tailspin and perhaps cause them to feel they have no choice but to go to war. MICHAEL MORELL: Bonnie, thank you so much for joining us. Fascinating discussion. We'll get you back at some point in the future to talk about the changing view of China in the world. I'd love to do that, but thank you so much for joining us today. It's been a real pleasure. BONNIE GLASER: Thanks for having me.\u00a0",

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS: MICHAEL MORELL ON THE TOP STRATEGIC THREATS OF 2022 PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Welcome to the new year.  Welcome to 2022.  I wanted to start the new year by providing some of my own thoughts on the two key national security issues facing the Biden administration - Russia/Ukraine and the Iranian nuclear program.    You are going to get me today rather than me interviewing a guest.  You are going to get my thoughts on the two most pressing global hot spots in the world as the new year begins -- Russia/Ukraine and Iran's nuclear program.  I should just add that we taped this on December 30th, so there may be some new developments that occur between our taping and our release of this episode.  These are fast-moving issues.  Let's start with Russia and Ukraine.  Right up front, I suggest we hit the pause button, take a few seconds to pull up a map of Ukraine and have it handy for this discussion.  It will help.    By the way, the reference to the map reminds me that CIA produces the best maps and the best graphics to display analytic information of any organization I have ever seen - inside or outside government.  The cartographers and the graphic designers at the Agency are the best.  They don't get a lot of attention outside the Agency, but they should.  And I just wanted to give them some.  So, let's start with: what is happening with Russia and Ukraine?  As most know, the Russians have amassed some 100,000 troops along the northern, eastern and southern borders of Ukraine.  The largest concentration of those forces lies to the east and to the south of Ukraine.  Look at your maps.  The Russians are coming as close as they can to surrounding eastern Ukraine, where a significant share of the population are Russians.  The share of the population that are Russians -- and who speak Russian -- grows as one moves east in Ukraine.  But it never gets over 50 percent.  Ukrainians remain in the majority in every province.  Only in Crimea is it over 50 percent, and Putin incorporated that territory into Russia in early 2014.  The 100,000 troops have more than 1,300 tanks, 1,800 pieces of heavy artillery, and missiles capable of carrying a 1,000 to 1,500 pound warheads some 250 to 300 miles into Ukraine.  These missiles are capable of carrying fragmentation bombs, submunitions, penetration bombs, fuel-air explosives.  These are sophisticated missiles.  As he has amassed these troops, Putin has demanded that the United States and western Europe agree to a red line - that Ukraine will never be given membership in NATO.  In fact, Putin has demanded the immediate start of negotiations to codify strict limits to NATO's expansion, particularly with regard to Ukraine.  Putin sees the expansion of NATO to his borders (already existing with Poland and the Baltics) as a significant national security threat.  He really does. These are not just talking points.  And, most important, Putin is signaling that he may well invade Ukraine if he does not get what he wants.  In his mind, he would guarantee his security by taking a significant part of Ukraine - the part that protrudes like a dagger into Russia.  Look at that map again.  So, why is Putin doing this?  By threatening an invasion, Putin is putting pressure on Ukraine and the West to act more in his interests, to come to his side of the fence on the NATO expansion issue, while giving him an ability to invade if he so chooses.  He also garners some other gains as well.  The military deployment plays to a domestic audience in Russia that wants its leaders to be tough, and it creates an impression, important to Putin, that Russia is a major player on the world stage.  Why is he doing this now?    I think Putin is being driven was several factors -- by the continued drift to the west of Ukraine since 2014, by Moldova making clear that it wants to join Ukraine in looking to the west for its future, and quite possibly by Putin sensing weakness in U.S. policy in the aftermath of our decision to withdraw from Afghanistan as well as by the chaotic nature of the withdrawal itself.  What's been the Western reaction?  For their part, Western officials have said that Putin's demand to impose limits on NATO expansion is a nonstarter.  The NATO position is that individual countries have the right to choose their own security arrangements.  The NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg put it best a couple of weeks ago.  He said, \"Ukraine has the right to choose its own security arrangements. This is a fundamental principle of European security. And a decision on whether Ukraine can join NATO will be taken by Ukraine and 30 NATO allies alone.\"  In addition, Western officials, including American and European officials have said directly that Russian aggression against Ukraine will be met with \"serious consequences,\" to quote Secretary Blinken.  Indeed, the United States, the European Union, and NATO have all said that any new Russian incursion into Ukraine would be met with harsh, intensified and extraordinary economic sanctions, including possibly killing the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, which bypasses Ukraine, a project important to Russia.  The United States has also suggested that NATO would beef up its troop presence near Russia's borders should Russia invade.  Having said all that, the U.S. has also just agreed to talks with Russia about security arrangements in eastern Europe.  Those talks are set to begin on January 10th.  This is very important and we will come back to it.  Is there some context here that can help us think about this and where this might be headed?  Yes, but let me start with another digression:  analysts talk about context all the time.  Former director of CIA George Tenet used to say that \"context is everything.\"  What is context to an intelligence analyst?  Context is just information that helps one understand a developing situation better, that gives one perspective on what is happening today.  It could be as simple as \"this development is just the latest in a long trend.\"  Or, \"this development is the first time we have seen this.\"  For example, a North Korean solider firing a weapon across the DMZ into South Korea sounds scary, but not if the context is that that sort of thing happens routinely.   I think there are three key pieces of context here.  The first is that Russia is acting fully consistent with how it sees its national security interests.  One of Russia's key foreign policy goals is controlling or having significant influence in those parts of the former Soviet Union that are no longer part of Russia.  Not only does this geography line up with the borders of the former Soviet Union, it is also lines up fairly close to the former borders of the Russian empire.  Russia sees this as a key way to protect Russia.  And, of course, to Russia, NATO membership for any of those countries is a direct challenge to this long-standing foreign policy goal.    And, Ukraine is the most important of those countries to Moscow. Why? Russia sees Ukraine as part of Russia.  Ukrainians and Russians are both ethnically Slavs. Ukraine was part of the original Russian state; indeed, the first capital of the first Russian state was Kyiv.   Most important, Putin fears that what happens in Ukraine could spill over into Russia.  This is why he reacted as harshly as he did to the color revolution in Ukraine eight years ago.  He, of course, did not want to lose Ukraine to the West, but even more important, he did not want his own population to mimic their brethren in Ukraine and come out into the streets of Moscow and say, \"We don't like the direction our country is going, we want a greater say in how we are governed, and, by the way, we want you to go away.\"  That's the nightmare scenario for Putin.  That is existential for Putin.  What's the point of this piece of context?  This issue of the future of Ukraine is extraordinarily important to Putin.  The second piece of context is that Russia has already invaded Ukraine, and it is already at war there.  As I mentioned earlier, Russia took Crimea in 2014, the first land grab in Europe since the Second World War.  And, it has been supporting Ukrainian separatists in eastern Ukraine for seven years.  Russian money, Russian weapons, and Russian special forces.  The fighting has been bloody, it has cost 13,000 lives, and the separatists hold Ukrainian territory.  What's the context meaning here?  Putin has invaded Ukraine before.  It should be no surprise if he does so again.  The third and final piece of context is Putin the man.  Who is he, and what does that mean for what we can expect of him?  Bob Gates, a former director of CIA and a former Secretary of Defense perhaps put it best when he said, \"When you look in Putin's eyes you see KGB, KGB, and KGB.\"  I think Putin is a thug and a bully.  He only believes in relative power - how much does he have and have much do you have.  He does not believe that a negotiation can end in win-win.  He only believes in win-lose.  He is not the brilliant chess master that he likes to portray.  He does not think multiple steps ahead.  He takes a step, sees how that plays, and then decides on the next step.  And, unlike most people who are risk averse, Putin is risk prone.  He is willing to take risks, and he is willing to take even more risk in the aftermath of having taken a risk and having had it pay off.  He is particularly dangerous from that perspective.    So, what does all this mean for where we might be headed in the days, weeks, and months ahead? How to think about the future?  As I just said, I do not believe Putin has a thought-out plan of what he is going to do.  What he decides to do next will depend on a number of factors -- a large number of factors.  What are those factors? I see four big ones.  The first is what the United States and Europe do over the next few weeks.  Do we stand tough or not?  Do we send the message that an invasion will really be extraordinarily costly to Putin in terms of sanctions or not? Do we make him think that the sanctions we are considering will have significant economic costs and could well lead to his nightmare scenario - his own people in the streets protesting against him?    Here also is where the U.S. willingness to talk comes in.  Can we walk a fine line here - between allowing Putin the public perception that he has gained something diplomatically without sacrificing our fundamental stand that each country gets to pick its own future.    The second factor is the political dynamic in Kyiv, how Ukrainian politics, is reacting to the threat of invasion.  Are Putin's actions here reinforcing the Ukrainian drift west or at least some Ukrainian politicians coming to Putin's side of the fence?  The third factor is the amount of military opposition that Putin thinks the Russian invasion force would face.  While being tough is popular in Russia, dead bodies coming home in large number would not be popular and Putin knows that.  While the Javelin missiles that the U.S. has provided Ukraine since 2014 could not stop a Russian invasion, they would inflict significant damage on the Russian military.  And the fifth factor is the degree to which Putin thinks that his occupation of eastern Ukraine after a successful invasion would face an insurgency, that would send, over an extended period of time, even more dead bodies home to Russia.    There is precedent for this - the Ukrainians have done it before.  The Ukrainian insurgent army (the UPA), formed in 1942 to fight for the country's independence, fought viciously against the red army when it marched into Ukraine in 1943. The UPS carried out thousands of attacks and inflicted thousands of casualties on soviet forces. The UPA continued fighting until the 1950s, forcing Moscow to mobilize tens of thousands of troops and secret policemen to restore control.  The Ukrainians could well do something like this again.  Putting all these factors together, I think there are three scenarios for the future:  Scenario one:  Putin stands down, calculating that he has chalked up at least some political and diplomatic wins, perhaps thinking that he has affected the psychology of both NATO and Ukraine with regard to future NATO membership, and, most important, calculating that the costs of an invasion are too high. In this case, he would probably keep his forces near the border for some time and only slowly remove them to save face.    And, back to the talks again between us and Russia: Again, they can play a role in helping us get to this scenario.  But, but, but: We cannot get to this scenario by giving him what he wants.  We cannot walk away from Ukraine.  We cannot give him Ukraine in those talks.  That would be appeasement.  Scenario two:  Putin significantly increases his support to the separatist insurgency, most likely with the separatists grabbing even more territory in eastern Ukraine.  In this scenario, Putin would keep his troops on the border to intimidate the Ukrainian government from fully responding militarily to the increased insurgency. This scenario would afford Putin the ability to demonstrate that he is serious about the NATO issue while publicly denying Russia's involvement.  This scenario becomes more likely the less he thinks he has won from what he has already done and the more he thinks that a full invasion would be too costly.    Scenario three:  Putin invades and takes significant territory in eastern Ukraine.  In this case, he would have two choices - take just those provinces with a high perception of Russians among the total population or take the entirety of eastern Ukraine up the Dnieper River, essentially taking half the country right up to Kyiv.  Look at your map again.  This becomes more likely the less he thinks he has already won and the more confident he is that he will not face a steep cost from an invasion.  There are so many factors here and so much that is still in flux that it is difficult to put probabilities on each of the three scenarios. I think at this point that, if you are a government or a private entity with an interest in Ukraine, you need to plan for all three, which means planning for 2 and 3.    Two final thoughts on Russia and Ukraine.  Two big-picture points.  The first is that the outcome here is not just about Ukraine and its future.  It is also about American credibility.  If we back away at all from the self-determination position we have taken, we would lose credibility.  If Russia invades Ukraine and incorporates Ukrainian territory into the Russian state, we would lose credibility.  Make no mistake this standoff is as, Richard Fontaine, the President of the think tank The Center for New American Security, recently said, \"If the United States says, 'Don't do this, you will regret it, there will be very serious costs,' and the Russians do it anyway, it does raise questions about America's ability to achieve outcomes.\"  Darn right.  The second is Putin's gain could well be Russia's loss.  What does that mean?  Think about it this way - what's the answer to the question, who was the big loser in the first Ukraine crisis? Yes, it was the Ukrainian people, who had their aspirations crushed.  Yes, it was the West for looking impotent in the face of Russian aggression.  But, most of all it was Russia itself.  Russia's only future is to be tied economically to Europe, and Putin continues to sabotage that.  And there was no bigger act of sabotage than 2014.  He may make a similar and even bigger mistake this time around.  Putin is not acting in the long-term interests of the Russian economy or the Russian state.  He is not going to go down in history as a great Russian leader.  He is going to go down in history as just the opposite.  Let's switch to Iran.  And let's start with some background.  The international community (in the form of the U.S., the other permanent members of the UN Security Council (that's the U.K., France, Russia, and China) along with Germany made a deal in 2015 with Iran that removed all nuclear-related economic sanctions on Iran in return for Iran, among other things:   Agreeing to cap uranium enrichment at 3.67 percent;   Restricting enrichment only to one facility, a place called Natanz;   No enrichment at a place called Fordow (which we will come back to later);  The use, for the purpose of enrichment, of only Iran's first-generation centrifuges, not its more advanced centrifuges;  A limit of 300 kgs for Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium (and remember, that would be only uranium enriched to 3.67 percent).  Significant changes to, and limits to activities at, an experimental heavy water research reactor called Arak.  This was designed to reduce the risk of plutonium production at that reactor.  And a broad international monitoring and verification regime.  The vast majority of these restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities were time-limited - that is, they would sunset at different points of time (anywhere from 8 to 25 years, with most in the 10-15 year time period).  Since the deal was struck in 2015, that means most, under the agreement, would have been removed by 2025-2030.  President Trump withdrew from this deal in November 2018; he announced the withdrawal in May 2018. He reimposed on Iran the U.S. nuclear-related sanctions that had been removed in 2015.    The Trump administration argued that the sunset provisions were a fatal flaw to the agreement and also that the agreement failed to account for Iran's missile program and its malign regional activities, including its support to international terrorist organizations.    In withdrawing, the U.S. did not cite any evidence of Iranian non-compliance on the specifics of the nuclear deal, but it did say that Iran's regional activities were inconsistent with a clause in the preamble of the nuclear deal that said the signatories to the deal would commit themselves to act in a constructive atmosphere, based on mutual respect, and to refrain from any action inconsistent with the letter, spirit and intent of the agreement.\u00a0   The Iranians condemned the U.S. move, but they initially took no action in response - hoping to divide the U.S. from the rest of the international community, hoping to make the U.S. look like the bad guys and the Iranians look like the good guys.  This lasted until May 2019, when the U.S. ended waivers it had granted under the reimposed U.S. sanctions. These waivers allowed a handful of countries to buy Iranian oil.    Iran responded almost immediately with two sets of actions.   First, it significantly increased its malign activities in the region, both to demonstrate that that it, too, could impose costs and hoping that the threat of instability would push the international community to pressure the United States to reverse itself in whole or in part.  These malign activities included attacking, both directly and through proxies, third-country tankers in the Persian gulf, attacking Saudi oil facilities with drones and missiles from Iran, and increasing attacks on U.S. facilities and personnel in Iraq.  The U.S. responded by killing Qassim Soleimani, the architect of much of Iran's malign regional activities, which brought the U.S. and Iran closer to all-out war than at any time since the tanker wars of the 1980s.     And, second, the Iranians started to take steps on the nuclear front that took them out of compliance with the nuclear deal.  These steps have become more aggressive over time.  They've included five significant steps.  One, increasing its stockpile of enriched uranium.  As of November, Iran remained under the 300 kg limit.  At that point, they were on track to breach.  They may have done so already.    Two, enriching uranium to higher levels.  Iran started violating the nuclear deal's protocols by enriching to 5 percent, just above the 3.67 limit, then went to 20 percent, and then to 60 percent.  A nuclear weapon requires enrichment to just over 90 percent. Somewhat counterintuitively, it is much easier to go from 20 percent to 90 percent than it is to go from 0 to 20 percent. The Iranians are getting very close to enriching uranium to weapons-grade.    Three, using advanced centrifuges, which are capable of enriching uranium at a much faster rate than Iran's first-generation centrifuges.  Four, enriching uranium at locations that were prohibited, namely the underground facility at Fordow.  We have to take a digression on Fordow here:  Fordow was designed to be a covert enrichment facility.  It is much too small to produce uranium fuel for a power reactor and just the right size to produce enriched uranium for a weapons program.  The Iranians only declared it to the IAEA after western intelligence agencies discovered the facility and publicly outed it in 2009. And Fordow is so deep underground that it would require special munitions to destroy from the air -- that only the United States has.  End digression.  And, five, producing uranium metal with 20 percent enriched uranium.  Uranium metal produced from 90 percent enriched uranium is what is at the very heart of a nuclear weapon.  It is the core.    Why are they so radically breaching the nuclear protocols?  Multiple reasons, I think.  Improve their negotiating position by creating facts on the ground that can provide more gains if they negotiate them away; improve their technical know-how that no agreement can ever take away from them; and get to the threshold of being able to produce a nuclear weapon - that is, get to their nuclear weapons objective.  It can be one of these or even all of them.  We need yet another digression here on the concept of threshold:  analysts have long debated whether Iran's goal is to actually have a nuclear weapon or to simply get to the threshold of having one - that is, having all the pieces and being able to put them together fairly quickly.  The 2007 National Intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear program said the goal was threshold, so we will use that as Iran's objective in this discussion.   Another factor for Iran's more aggressive behavior on the nuclear front is the shift in political power in Tehran from what some call \"the Reformers\" (still quite conservative from a Western view) to the hardliners.  The hardliners, who opposed the nuclear deal, were able, with Trump's withdrawal, to say, \"We told you so, we told you you could not trust the Americans, we told you you could not trust the head of the snake.\"  This political shift was clear in the February 2020 election of Iran's legislature, called the Majlis, in 2020, in which the reformers lost in a landslide.  This was followed by the Iranian presidential election this past July, won by a hardliner.    Just like we did with Russia/Ukraine, let's look at some context here.  First piece of context:  why does Iran want to be on the threshold of nuclear weapon?  A combination of three reasons, I think.  Nationalism.  Persian nationalism is strong in Iran.  Iran sees itself as a major regional power.  It looks around the world and sees other major regional powers having a weapon and they think, \"Why not us?\"  France is a country that the Iranian compare themselves to, and France, of course, has nuclear weapons.   Deterrence.  Iran fears the United States.  Iran believes that the United States wants regime change in Iran, and they see nuclear weapons as the ultimate deterrent against U.S. military action against Iran. In 2003, with the U.S. military to its east in Afghanistan and to its west in Iraq, Iran thought it was next.  It never wants to feel that way again.     Regional hegemony.  Iran wants to be the hegemonic power in the Middle East.  It is something it had at one time in its history.  Nuclear weapons would support such a policy objective, particularly given that its archenemy in the region, Israel, has nuclear weapons.  Second piece of context:  how close is Iran to being on the threshold?    There are three key pieces of a nuclear weapon:    Fissile material.  This is necessary to make that core of uranium metal that will generate a nuclear yield when detonated.  On this, it sounds to me as if Iran is only weeks away and they are certainly closer than they were when we began nuclear negotiations with Iran in 2013.  A workable bomb design.  This is the ability to put enough pressure on the fissile material to detonate it and create a nuclear yield.  We know the Iranians were working on this up to 2003 when they stopped.  I don't know if they have worked on it since or how far they got before they stopped.    A delivery system.  You have to be able to deliver a nuclear weapon to its target, usually either by missile or aircraft.  Aircraft delivery is risky, as the plane could be shot down.  If by missile, the nuclear device has to be small enough to be mated to the missile and the bomb design robust enough to withstand the pressures, the vibrations, the temperature changes of flight and reentry into the atmosphere.  The Iranians have worked on an ICBM, and they have a vast inventory of MRBMs.  I don't know where the Iranians stand in successfully mating a nuclear design to a missile.  Bottom line:  they are clearly close on fissile material but I don't know on the other two.  At minimum, they are a few months away, and at maximum a couple of years.  Where do the negotiations stand?  The negotiations that began in April to come up with a new agreement are not going well.  There have been seven rounds of talks, but they have not made progress.  The eighth round of talks just began.  Throughout, the U.S. and the Iranians are not even talking directly to each other.  We are talking through others.    The conventional wisdom was that the Biden administration would be able to come to agreement with the Iranian government.  It is what the Biden team said it wanted to do during the 2020 campaign.     That has not worked.  One reason - and we will talk about others in a minute - is that the talks did not start until April.  This turned out to be too late.  While the talks initially made some progress under the government of former Iranian President Rouhani, they did not conclude before the Iranian presidential campaign kicked off, the hardliners won the election, and Iran's position hardened.  Many experts are now questioning whether there will be a return to an agreement.  All of this has the attention of the Israelis, who see the Iran having nuclear weapons as a significant threat and who see the progress the Iranians are making toward a weapon.  There are those in Israel arguing for their country to take military action.  This would not be an easy military operation for the Israelis - there are many facilities that need to be hit, they are deep inside Iran, and Iran has one of the most sophisticated air defense systems in the world, purchased from Russia.  In particular, Israel does not have the special munitions they would need to destroy Fordow from the air, or even if they did, the ability to deliver them - one needs a B-52 or B-2.  But that does not make it impossible.  There are other ways to destroy Fordow, namely with a commando raid where Israel would know going in that most of the commandos would never return.  If Israel believes it is time to act militarily, what the Israelis would like is for the United States to go with them.  And that arguably is an option, and the Biden administration has not ruled it out in its public discussion about Iran.   So, what are the scenarios going forward?  Three, I think.  The first scenario is an agreement.  To be sure, there are many factors arguing against that.  What are they?  Let me list them.  Politics in the U.S. Biden is weak , he is entering an election year, and he never thought the original deal was worth the political cost.  He will not want to give the Republicans a nuclear deal with which to attack him in the mid-terms.  Politics in Iran.  As I noted earlier, the hardliners are in charge.  Most important from a political perspective in Iran are the views of Iran's two most important Iranian leaders.    The Supreme Leader.  He was a tough sell on the first agreement.  He's 82.  Does he want his legacy to be a deal with the Americans?  Does he want his legacy to be another deal where the Americans pull the rug from underneath him in 3 years?  I think not.    Then there's the new Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi.  He wants to be the next Supreme Leader.  He has every incentive not to make a deal with the Americans.  He does not want to undermine his credibility with the group of hardline clerics who will choose the next Supreme Leader.    And, there is no significant political constituency in reform for a deal. The effect of the U.S. sanctions have diminished over time, as leakage has increased and particularly as the Chinese have purchased more Iranian oil - in violation of our sanctions.  In addition, the costs of the sanctions have not fallen on the elite; they have fallen on the poor. But, those Iranians are not blaming their own government for their economic problems; they are blaming the United States.  Also, the Iranians never believed that they benefitted economically from the first agreement.  So, many are asking: what's the point of a deal?  In this regard, the Iranians have historically been a country that prefers not to be economically dependent on other countries, and the events of the last 10-15 years have only reinforced that.  So, from the point of view of the hardliners, sanctions are a forcing function for getting Iran to where it should be anyway - as self-reliant as possible.  From this perspective, the sanctions are a good thing.  All of this to say, both countries want, for political and for national security reasons, a better deal than they got the first time around.  So, the decision space for a deal has shrunk.  So, a deal has a low probability.  Say 15 percent.  But it is not zero, because diplomats routinely overcome long odds.  The most important leverage here for Washington is the perception of U.S. military action.  I don't believe a deal is not possible without Iran believing there is a real possibility that the U.S. might go to war without a deal.   The next scenario is war.  The argument in favor of war is to end the nuclear threat for the short term.  The arguments against war are many - in the short and long term, big downsides - economic consequences of war, namely in the form of sky-high oil prices, a new generation of hardliners in Iran, a strong incentive for a covert nuclear program in Iran, and a strong incentive to go beyond threshold to a weapon itself.    Even in Israel, one sees these arguments.  Roughly a month ago, a group of former senior Israeli national security officials published an open letter arguing against an Israeli strike - for many of the reasons I just outlined.  So, no guarantee that Israel will act.  Prime Minister Netanyahu wanted to strike Iran nearly a decade ago but he could not get the votes he needed in Israel's security cabinet.  But, because there are also strong voices in Israel arguing for military action, we can't count out an Israeli going it alone scenario either.  What about the U.S.?  I don't think President Biden wants another war in the Middle East.  And, politically, it would open him up to a significant primary challenge from the left if he decides to run again.  I also think this is the Iranian assessment of the U.S. at the moment.  Remember I said earlier that the Iranians need to think we will strike to change their calculus on a deal.  So, overall, what is the probability of war?  I'd say it is small but not zero - say 15 percent.  That leaves is with the third and most likely scenario -- acquiescence to Iran getting to the threshold of a nuclear weapon.  There are big downsides here as well.  The Saudis will pursue a nuclear weapon as well - or purchase them from the Pakistanis. The Emiratis could pursue one as well .  As nuclear weapons do in South Asia (India and Pakistan), the existence of nuclear weapons by so many states makes any confrontation potentially a nuclear confrontation.  This would also represent another blow to U.S. credibility - we failed to prevent something we badly wanted.  I put this scenario at a 70 percent probability.    There are many reasons why being President of the United States is the toughest job in the world.  Managing national security decisions is one of the biggest.  And Russia and Ukraine and the Iran nuclear program are two of the toughest I've seen.  It is going to be an interesting and important year.",

            "article_content": "Paris \u2014 French voters reelected President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday night, granting him a second term with a substantial victory over his far right-wing opponent Marine Le Pen. CBS News correspondent Elaine Cobbe reports that many had expected the weekend runoff election results to be very close, but even with his clear win, Macron likely won't rest easy for long. The significance of France's national election goes far beyond the country's own borders, and Cobbe says there were sighs of relief across much of France and far beyond as Macron's victory quashed the chances of an extremist president \u2014 hostile to the European Union and NATO, and with close ties to Russia \u2014 taking office, at least for another five years. President Macron's supporters partied until late into the evening under the Eiffel Tower, celebrating his decisive win with more than 58% of the vote against Le Pen's 41%.  \"We stood up against nationalism, we tried to show that today, we have to be more united than ever,\" said one reveler. But carrying more than 40% of the electorate, it was the closest the far-right has come to taking the top seat in any French election, so Macron's celebration will be short-lived. The election has shown just how deeply divided France is right now \u2014 a reality the president acknowledged in his victory speech.  \"We need to be respectful,\" he said. \"Our country is full of so many divisions, so we need to be strong, but no one will be left behind.\" He'll have a tough job uniting the French behind him. The results indicate that extremist voters far outnumbered those from the center, or the traditional left and right parties. After the results were announced, there were protests in several cities against both candidates. Fireworks were launched at police and tear gas was used to clear crowds. One banner derided Macron as \"the Robin Hood of the RICH.\"  Le Pen echoed that sentiment in her own speech, accepting defeat but urging her supporters to keep fighting \"this hoarding of power by a few,\" and vowing to continue her \"commitment to France.\" In an increasingly fractured France, Le Pen vowed to fight on. Congratulations to @EmmanuelMacron on his re-election. France is our oldest ally and a key partner in addressing global challenges. I look forward to our continued close cooperation \u2014 including on supporting Ukraine, defending democracy, and countering climate change. Congratulations for Macron have poured in from around the world, including from President Biden, who said he looked \"forward to our continued close cooperation \u2014 including on supporting Ukraine, defending democracy, and countering climate change.\" Germany's chancellor Olaf Scholz and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy were among the many other leaders to convey their well-wishes to Macron. They're relieved that France will continue to play a strong role in international diplomacy, but Macron's real fight now will be at home.",

            "article_content": "America might be ready for a \"fresh start\" with an alternative to President Donald Trump in 2024, says North Dakota GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer, and if that's the case, although he supported Trump in 2020, he thinks there might be another, better option. \"I would love to have four more years with Donald Trump, quite honestly,\" Cramer told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" podcast. \"I'm pretty close to him. I would love to have him start knowing what he knows now, start taking down the bureaucracy on day one rather than sort of trusting it. But at the same time, I think America, you know, would like a fresh start and maybe a Mike Pompeo. He's got the Trump doctrine down. He's believable on it. He understands it. He supports it himself.\"\u00a0 Cramer understands there are several Republicans, including some of his fellow sitting senators, ready to vie for the presidential nomination if Trump sits out 2024. Pompeo is the only Republican Cramer mentioned as a viable alternative. Garrett and Cramer also discussed \"replacement theory\" \u2014 a racist conspiracy that sees White Americans losing economic and political power unjustly to minority or immigrant populations. The alleged White shooter in a racially motivated mass shooting in Buffalo a few days ago reportedly posted a white supremacist manifesto that espoused the theory before he carried out his attack. Cramer said the racist massacre of those ten people and the wounding of three others in Buffalo was \"an awful, evil tragedy.\" \"I wept a little bit when I heard about it because the circumstances were just so awful,\" Cramer said. \"The shooter, his past comment, his white nationalism, racism\u2026adds to the evil and just illustrates a deep, deep evil in this individual.\" Some Republicans in Congress have been accused of using language aligned with replacement theory, which Cramer acknowledged. \"I believe that that is happening and I am against it,\" Cramer said. \"I'm sort of naturally against most conspiracy theories. I just I think in our hyper-media world\u2026there's just too much opportunity to elevate anger as opposed to de-escalate anger. And that's really affected our ability to communicate and to dialogue. I'm against it and I grieve it. I think those of us that have a larger platform are obligated morally to de-escalate.\" But Cramer is likely to oppose recently passed House legislation to create high-level federal working groups to monitor and combat domestic terrorism. \"I worry a little bit about the term domestic terrorism,\" Cramer said. \"I mean, crime is crime. Violence is violence. It is illegal and should be illegal. If we need to crack down more on it, we ought to provide local communities with the resources and the training for their policing. We all know what domestic means, but what's the difference if it's a domestic terrorism issue or whether it's a gang matter or whether it's just violence breaking out? It empowers a bureaucracy more than a community.\" Cramer worries that a federal definition of domestic terrorism could lead to politicizing crime and law enforcement, adding he has some concerns about politicization of the Biden Justice Department. Asked if he thinks the Trump Justice Department was politicized, Cramer said. \"I really don't.

            "article_content": "A Florida man was charged Thursday with human smuggling after the bodies of four people, including a baby and a teenager, were found in Canada near the U.S. border in what authorities believe was a failed crossing attempt during a freezing blizzard. The United States Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota said Steve Shand, 47, appeared in court earlier Thursday. \u00a0 The bodies were found Wednesday in the province of Manitoba about 40 feet from the U.S. border near the community of Emerson. The office said the dead were a family of four Indian nationals who were separated from others in a group crossing the border. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said it's believed they died from exposure while trying to cross into the U.S. \u00a0\u00a0 \"It is an absolute and heartbreaking tragedy,\" RCMP Assistant Commissioner Jane MacLatchy said. Minnesota was under a wind chill advisory Tuesday night in to Wednesday, CBS Minnesota reported. During that time, feels-like temperatures in northern Minnesota were as cold as 29 degrees below zero. MacLatchy said U.S. authorities had notified RCMP on Wednesday about a different group of people who had been apprehended after crossing into the U.S. near the town of Emerson, Manitoba. The group had items for an infant but no baby was with them. That led authorities to believe others may have been missing and the RCMP immediately began a search in Canada. MacLatchy said the search covered difficult terrain with deep and drifting snow. Officers used all-terrain vehicles to get around because it was \"virtually impassable.\" Officers located three bodies together - a man, a woman and a baby - about 10 yards from the border. The search continued and a teen boy was found a short distance away. A search for possible survivors or additional victims continued Wednesday night and officers were still patrolling the area Thursday, RCMP said. \"These victims faced not only the cold weather but also endless fields, large snowdrifts and complete darkness,\" she said. MacLatchy said others are often involved in arranging to bring people across the border, which is criminal and extremely dangerous. In the past, it has been more common to see crossings north from the U.S. into Canada, she added. Border crossings into Canada on foot increased in 2016 following the election of former U.S. president Donald Trump. That December, two men lost their fingers to severe frostbite after getting caught in a blizzard while walking from the U.S. into Manitoba. A few months later, a woman died of hypothermia near the border on the American side. In 2019, a pregnant woman who walked across the border was rescued after she became trapped in a snowbank and went into labor. Dave Carlson, the reeve of Emerson-Franklin, said instances of people crossing the border outside the checkpoint have dropped significantly in recent years. He was surprised to learn of the four deaths. \"If you look at the political climate on both sides of the border, it's just mind-boggling to me that anyone had that sense of desperation to try and cross in extreme conditions,\" he said. It has been extremely cold and windy in recent days, Carlson said. The area where the bodies were found is far enough away that people would not see lights from the town, he said, and it would be easy to get disoriented. The RCMP said it is working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Deputy Patrick Klegstad with the Kittson County Sheriff's Office in Minnesota said his department is supporting the American side of the investigation. Its officers patrol the \"desolate\" open fields near the border every day, he said. \"Why they picked that spot to travel would be the million-dollar question,\" he said. The weather this week was so cold that it \"takes your breath away,\" Klegstad said. There are no trees or shelter near the border, only quiet and inaccessible farm roads. Klegstad, echoing Canadian officials, said it's uncommon to have people make the harrowing journey from Canada into the U.S. \"It's not very often we do have southbounders.\" Mounties warned that people should not attempt to cross the border outside a checkpoint, in either direction, because it can be deadly. \"I am saddened there was loss of life and the fact a small child died makes it even more difficult,\" said Grand Forks Sector Chief Patrol Agent Anthony S. Good, in a statement. \"Our hearts go out to the families and loved ones. I am also incredibly proud of the Border Patrol Agents and our [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] partners who selflessly endured sub-zero temperatures for hours to search for the missing persons. Their dedication to duty and courage is commendable.\"",

            "article_content": "Thousands of Texans who tried to vote by mail during this month's primary elections had their ballots tossed out, many of which were rejected because of issues that voters had in trying to comply with the state's new voting law.\u00a0 A CBS News analysis of election data has found that at least 16,800 mail ballots were rejected across 14 of the 25 counties with the most registered voters. That's about 15% of all mail ballots returned in those counties.\u00a0 The rejections came in the first major election since Texas Republicans passed a sweeping new election law, known as SB1, after months of objections from Democrats and voting rights advocates. Republican Governor Greg Abbott signed the bill last September.\u00a0 County election officials told CBS News that the provision in the law that gave voters the most trouble was a requirement that they provide a driver's license number, personal ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number when applying for and returning a mail ballot. The number that voters provide must match the registration that's on file.\u00a0 County election officials have told the Texas secretary of state's office that the \"vast majority\" of mail-in ballot rejections stemmed from the failure to provide proper identification information, according to Sam Taylor, assistant secretary of state for communications at the Texas secretary of state's office. Harris County, the country's third most populous county and home to Houston, had 6,888 mail-in ballots rejected of the 36,878 returned due to issues complying with the new voting law,\u00a0 according to the Harris County elections department. That's nearly 19% of all returned mail ballots. Just 31 ballots were rejected for reasons not related to the new voting law. The number of mail ballots rejected this year far exceeded the rejection rate from the last midterm election primaries. In the 2018 primaries, officials said that just 135 mail ballots were rejected of the 48,473 mail ballots cast, a rejection rate of 0.3%.\u00a0 Harris County's elections department says it doubled the staff dedicated to voter outreach and contacting voters if there were issues. But ultimately, only 849 people corrected their ballots \u2014 out of the 7,750 flagged for rejection.\u00a0 Harris County Elections Administrator Isabel Longoria announced earlier this week that she would resign from her position on July 1 after county leaders criticized her handling of the March primary.\u00a0 But the problems weren't limited to Harris County. In Bexar County, which is home to San Antonio, nearly 22% of the 18,000 mail ballots returned were rejected.\u00a0 In the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, Collin County rejected about 14% of all mail-in ballots returned. Bruce Sherbert, the Collin County elections administrator, told CBS News that \"virtually all rejections were due to the new ID requirements under SB1.\" \u00a0 Also in suburban Dallas-Fort Worth, Denton County rejected nearly 17% of all mail ballots. Of those that were rejected, 84% were due to ID issues, according to the county elections department.\u00a0 In Austin's Travis County, a majority of the 896 mail ballots that were rejected \u2014 about 8% of the total cast \u2014 had issues complying with the new ID requirements, according to a Travis County clerk's office spokesperson. In Williamson County, just north of Austin, 73% of the 521 rejected mail ballots couldn't be counted because of ID issues. The next most common reason for rejection was returning a ballot past the deadline.\u00a0 Not all of the largest counties saw such high rejection rates. Brazoria County, near Houston, rejected 3.6% of returned mail ballots.\u00a0 Texas already has strict requirements governing which voters can cast mail ballots. In order to be eligible to cast a mail ballot, a voter must be at least 65 years or older, sick or disabled, expecting to give birth within three weeks of Election Day, out of the county during early voting and on Election Day or confined in jail but otherwise eligible to vote.\u00a0 There were signs of trouble for election officials in the weeks leading up to the primary when high numbers of mail ballot applications were rejected for failure to comply with SB1. Once ballots went out to voters, some counties flagged more than 30% of returned ballots for rejection, but were able to bring those numbers down through aggressive efforts contacting voters to fix their ballots.\u00a0 In Webb County, located along the Texas-Mexico border, officials ultimately rejected 31 of 734 returned mail ballots, about 4%. Webb County Elections Administrator Jose Luis Castillo told CBS News that 112 ballots were initially flagged for rejection, mostly because the ballots were incomplete; not all of the new requirements were initially met. \"(Voters) struggled, but it's more of an educational thing,\" Castillo told CBS News. \"They're used to the old system, not the new requirements or the new law.\" The Texas secretary of state's office encouraged voters to update their registration information online to ensure that they have all forms of identification associated with their registration. State and local officials also encouraged voters to fill out both ID numbers before returning a ballot.\u00a0 Taylor, who is with the Texas secretary of state's office, said state and local officials will focus a large amount of voter education on the new requirements for mail voters moving forward.\u00a0 \"While in years past we have focused our voter education efforts on in-person ID requirements, this year we are also devoting a significant portion of our voter education campaign to enhancing awareness of the new mail-in ballot ID requirements,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"We are confident we have the data and research we need to apply any lessons learned during the primary to an even more robust voter education campaign heading into the November General Election.\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday said the U.S. has brokered a \"historic breakthrough\" between Israel and Lebanon that would end a dispute over their shared maritime border, pave the way for natural gas production and reduce the risk of war between the enemy countries. The agreement, coming after months of U.S.-mediated talks, would mark a major breakthrough in relations between Israel and Lebanon, which formally have been at war since Israel's establishment in 1948. But the deal still faces some obstacles, including legal and political challenges in Israel. Israel welcomed the deal even ahead of Biden's announcement. Lebanese leaders made no formal announcement, but indicated they would approved the agreement. In Washington, Biden said that Israel and Lebanon had agreed to \"formally end\" their maritime dispute. He said he had spoken to the leaders of both countries and been told they were ready to move ahead. The agreement \"will provide for the development of energy fields for the benefit of both countries, setting the stage for a more stable and prosperous region,\" Biden said. \"It is now critical that all parties uphold their commitments and work towards implementation.\" Lebanon and Israel both claim some 860 square kilometers (330 square miles) of the Mediterranean Sea. At stake are rights over exploiting undersea natural gas reserves. Lebanon hopes gas exploration will help lift its country out of its spiraling economic crisis. Israel also hopes to exploit gas reserves while also easing tensions with its northern neighbor. Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid called the deal a \"historic achievement that will strengthen Israel's security, inject billions into Israel's economy, and ensure the stability of our northern border.\" Under the agreement, the disputed waters would be divided along a line straddling the strategic \"Qana\" natural gas field. Israeli officials involved in the negotiations said Lebanon would be allowed to produce gas from that field, but pay royalties to Israel for any gas extracted from the Israeli side. Lebanon has been working with the French energy giant Total on preparations for exploring the field, though actual production is likely years away. The agreement would also leave in place an existing \"buoy line\" that serves as a de facto border between the two countries, the officials said. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were discussing behind the scenes negotiations, said the deal would include American security guarantees, including assurances that none of the gas revenues reach Hezbollah. Many leading Israeli security figures, both active and retired, have hailed the deal because it could lower tensions with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which has repeatedly threatened to strike Israeli natural gas assets elsewhere in the Mediterranean. With Lebanon now having a stake in the region's natural gas industry, experts believe the sides will think twice before opening up another war. \"It might help create and strengthen the mutual deterrence between Israel and Hezbollah,\" said Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies. \"This is a very positive thing for Israel.\" Israel and Hezbollah fought a month-long war in 2006, and Israel considers the heavily armed Iranian-backed group to be its most immediate military threat. The agreement will be brought before Israel's caretaker government for approval this week ahead of the Nov. 1 election, when the country goes to the polls for the fifth time in under four years. An Israeli official said Lapid's Cabinet is expected to approve the agreement in principle on Wednesday, while sending it to parliament for a required two-week review. After the review, the government would give final, official approval, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss government strategy. It remains unclear if parliament needs to approve the agreement, or merely review it. Senior U.S. energy envoy Amos Hochstein, whom Washington appointed a year ago to mediate talks, delivered a modified proposal of the maritime border deal to Lebanon on Monday night, according to local media and officials. There was no formal response from Lebanon. But the office of President Michel Aoun said the latest version of the proposal \"satisfies Lebanon, meets its demands, and preserves its rights to its natural resources,\" and will hold consultations with officials before making an announcement. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was noncommittal in a speech late Tuesday. He praised his group's \"resistance\" against Israel and insisted that Lebanon is not afraid of another war against Israel. But he said Hezbollah would \"wait\" to issue its position on the agreement. Previously he has said the group would endorse the government's position. He said any agreement would require cooperation and unity among Lebanon's fractured political leadership. \"The upcoming hours are decisive,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Wall Street analysts are betting that Tuesday's midterm elections will flip control of Congress, with potentially significant implications for the U.S. economy. History backs them up: The president's party has lost between 25 and 30 House seats in nearly every modern midterm election. But this year, the economy is playing an outsized role. A recent Gallup poll found that the portion of registered voters calling the economy \"extremely important\" in who they support at the ballot box is at its second-highest level in two decades. Muddying the picture this year is that the economy is sending mixed signals. A historically strong job market and high rates of Americans starting businesses coexist with the highest inflation since the early 1980s and soaring energy costs.\u00a0 In poll after poll, Americans have cited the rapidly rising price of food, gasoline and housing as a major concern going into the election. Fuel costs, in particular, have long been correlated with the approval rating of the person in the White House. While prices at the pump have fallen from record-highs levels in June, they're still nearly 40 cents a gallon higher than a year ago for regular gas.\u00a0 One economic metric predicts larger-than-average losses for the Democratic Party, Goldman Sachs analysts recently wrote. Real disposable personal income \u2014 or the amount of money people have left over after taxes \u2014 has fallen precipitously this year.\u00a0 \"We find that headline CPI and gas prices are roughly equal in their  statistical significance for midterm election results, but neither is as  strong a predictor of election results as real disposable income growth,  which has declined more over the last year than in any midterm election  year since the data began,\" the investment bank said in a report. Real wages have also declined since last year, as prices rise faster than workers' pay.  Regardless of which way the vote swings, history shows one outcome is nearly certain: Stock markets will likely go up.\u00a0 \"Markets historically have done well in the year after midterms,\" strategists at LPL Financial wrote Monday. \"In fact, they have been higher 18 out of 18 times in the following year dating back to 1950, with nearly identical historical returns under Democratic and Republican presidents. Financial markets also tend to like divided government because the chances of passing sweeping legislation dramatically diminishes when opposing parties share power. And if pollsters' predictions bear out and Republicans gain control of one or both chambers of Congress, it could chill, if not freeze, the Democrats' legislative agenda.\u00a0 Some analysts see a path for limited legislation on areas both parties agree on, such as reining in tech companies, strengthening antitrust enforcement and regulating cryptocurrencies. With a divided Congress, however, Wall Street analysts think Republicans would focus on oversight hearings and measures on social issues, such as abortion, public education and trans women in sports, rather than legislation that could reasonably shift the economy. \"Republicans in the House are likely to focus on 'messaging bills' that highlight the differences between Republicans and Democrats, with little intent or expectation that they would overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate or being signed into law by President Biden,\" Benjamin Salisbury, an analyst with Height Securities, said in a research note this week. Since Congress will need to pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling early next year, a showdown could ensue over the federal government's borrowing limit, Salisbury noted. That could give a Republican-controlled House leverage to demand concessions on the party's priorities, including increasing military spending, funding the border wall, eliminating\u00a0federal regulations and making permanent the Trump-era Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Still, Despite Republican opposition to recent Democratic wins, including massive domestic infrastructure spending and beefing up the IRS' ability to go after tax cheats, \"the potential for a 180-degree turn in 2023 is extremely low because of the Senate filibuster and the Presidential veto,\" he said.\u00a0 Legislative gridlock in Washington would force the Biden administration to pursue its priorities through personnel appointed in the first two years. Those include Democratic majorities on the Federal Trade Commission and the National Labor Relations Board, as well as Mr. Biden's appointment of Rohit Chopra to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\u00a0 Taken together, those regulators are likely to continue the administration's pro-consumer agenda, taking a tough line on corporate mergers, banks and regulation of financial products like buy-now-pay-later loans and cryptocurrencies, according to Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.\u00a0 \"There is nothing Republican majorities on Capitol Hill can do to block expected increases in bank capital requirements, tougher rules on consumer finance, changes in housing policy, oversight of crypto or SEC rules on climate change reporting, SPACs or market structure,\" he said in a research note. Seiberg expects the CFPB to push for lower credit card fees and bank overdraft fees, and to reimburse consumers defrauded in Zelle payment scams. ",

            "article_content": "In the last few months, North Carolina has become a haven for abortion access in the south. It is one of the few states in the region that has not restricted it since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. Abortion is legal in North Carolina up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. \u00a0 Kelly Flynn runs a woman's choice clinic in Raleigh, which has been flooded with calls. She said the number of calls they receive a week from out-of-state residents has doubled recently. \u00a0 Before the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the longstanding Roe v. Wade, 35% of the patients at Flynn's women's clinic were from out of town. But now, with neighboring states like South Carolina restricting or banning abortion, Flynn said that the number stands at 56%.\u00a0 \"We just helped a patient from Alabama last week. They drove a 10-and-a-half-hour trip to make sure they were at the clinic at nine o'clock that morning,\" Flynn told CBS News.\u00a0 For some Democratic voters, the issue of abortion access is critical for them coming out and voting in next month's midterm elections.\u00a0 \"I have friends who are opening their doors to people in border states who can't have a safe and legal procedure. So, you just pray it doesn't happen here but it's definitely a real possibility if people don't come out and vote,\" North Carolina resident Mary Adams said.\u00a0 The fate of abortion access in North Carolina depends on what happens in the state legislature. Republicans are currently in the majority, but they don't yet have enough seats to override a veto by the Democratic governor. This could change in November's general election.\u00a0 Democratic Senate nominee Cheri Beasley said that the stakes for North Carolina's tight U.S. Senate race will drive voter turnout.\u00a0 \"I can certainly tell you that that even in the smallest rural communities, regardless of party affiliation, people want to talk about abortion access,\" Beasley said.\u00a0 But Beasley's opponent, Republican Congressman Ted Budd, who supports federal abortion restrictions, believes the election will hinge on the economy.\u00a0 North Carolina Republican pollster Paul Schumaker says there is little upside for GOP candidates like Budd to engage on abortion. \u00a0 \"Keep the discussion about the economy. Don't have the discussion about the abortion issue because quite frankly, he [Budd] runs a risk of stepping on his base enthusiasm for turning out,\" said Schumaker.\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The Department of Homeland Security is setting up a Disinformation Governance Board to try to counter the spread of false information. The board will focus on disinformation coming from Russia as well as misleading messages about the U.S.-Mexico border, the Associated Press reports.\u00a0 The immediate focus will be on misinformation from human smugglers, who spread false claims about U.S. border policy to migrants to help drum up business.\u00a0 White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing Thursday that the board will tackle misinformation on a range of issues, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said part of its intention is to counter misinformation in Hispanic communities especially. In a statement to CBS News, a DHS spokesperson said the department began its work on disinformation several years ago. \"The Department has created the Disinformation Governance Board to ensure this work does not infringe on the fundamental right of free speech and to further protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties,\" the spokesperson said. \"To provide this protection, the Board will coordinate the Department's internal activities related to disinformation that poses a threat to homeland security.\" Disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz will lead the board. Jankowicz, who has researched Russian misinformation tactics and online harassment, is author of\u00a0the book \"How To Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News, and the Future of Conflict.\" She has also advised the Ukrainian government on strategic communications, according to the Wilson Center think-tank, where she served as a global fellow. Asked about the initiative, Psaki said \"it sounds like the objective of the board is to prevent disinformation and misinformation from traveling around the country in a range of communities,\" adding, \"I'm not sure who opposes that effort.\"\u00a0 But Republicans made it clear they have objections. Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from Ohio who is the ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, criticized DHS's creation of the board. \"As the author of the bipartisan law that established the Global Engagement Center to combat the constantly evolving threat of foreign propaganda and disinformation abroad, I do not believe that the United States government should turn the tools that we have used to assist our allies counter foreign adversaries onto the American people,\" he said in a statement\u00a0on Thursday. \"Our focus should be on bad actors like Russia and China, not our own citizens,\" he said, adding that he looks forward to pressing Secretary Mayorkas for answers when he appears before the committee next week. CBS News has reached out to Senator Gary C. Peters, the Democratic chairman of the committee, as well as DHS for more information and is awaiting response.\u00a0 Earlier this month, FBI Director Christopher Wray spoke to \"60 Minutes\" about disinformation and other threats from Russian as the war in Ukraine rages on.\u00a0 \"The Russians engage in\u2026 very active disinformation, misinformation, and in fact information warfare as a key part of their arsenal,\" Wray told CBS News' Scott Pelley. Recent disinformation from Russia includes the false claim last month that American\u00a0National Guard troops\u00a0were killed fighting in Ukraine. In a\u00a0statement, the Guard said not only was the report \"false,\" but that the soldiers named in the report were not even in Ukraine.\u00a0 Misinformation on a number of other issues \u2014 from COVID-19 to the election \u2014 quickly spreads on social media. The heads of several large tech companies, including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, have testified before Congress about their efforts to try to address it. Blasting the problem of COVID-19 misinformation last summer, President Biden said, \"Anyone listening to it is getting hurt by it. It's killing people. It's bad information. My hope is that Facebook, instead of taking it personally that somehow I'm saying Facebook is killing people, that they would do something about the misinformation. The outrageous misinformation about the vaccine.\" Caitlin O'Kane is a digital content producer covering trending stories for CBS News and its good news brand, The Uplift.",

Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security, sits down with CIA operations director Dave Marlowe, and CIA analysis director Linda Weissgold about their careers at CIA and global hotspots. Marlowe and Weissgold talk about the skills and attributes CIA looks for when hiring officers, as well as their own career trajectories at the CIA. They also weigh in on current hotspots for the agency, including Ukraine, Iran and China.\u00a0 HIGHLIGHTS:\u00a0 Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. \"INTELLIGENCE MATTERS\" TRANSCRIPT: DAVE MARLOWE AND LINDA WEISSGOLD PRODUCER: PAULINA SMOLINSKI MICHAEL MORELL: It's really special to be on stage with you guys. We were colleagues for so long. It's not very often that a serving deputy director for analysis and a serving deputy director for operations speak publicly. And I don't think they've ever Been together on a stage before. So this is really cool. LINDA WEISSGOLD: Not that we can talk about. MICHAEL MORELL: Not that you can talk about. DAVE MARLOWE:\u00a0 We will see how it goes, it maybe the last time. MICHAEL MORELL: So I want to break the conversation into three chunks. One, I want to talk about your careers. I think students will want to hear about that. I want to talk a little bit about some of the hot spots in the world today. And then I want to talk about the CIA going forward. But before we get into all that, let me ask each of you, Linda, what is the fundamental responsibility of an analyst at CIA? And, Dave, what's the fundamental responsibility of an operations officer? LINDA WEISSGOLD: First of all, thank you all for coming and for letting us have this opportunity. When I think about what is at the heart of CIA's analytic mission, it really is about delivering objective analysis about the world to some of the most important people in it. So we are looking overseas. We're following individuals and groups and trends beyond our borders that affect our national security. And I think it's really important to highlight, as an analyst at CIA, you inform, you do not make policy. So that was part of why President Truman set up the CIA in 1947. We try to go beyond what's happening to examine why it's happening and then to talk about the implications of that. We try to give our leaders a decision advantage by pointing out leverage that they may have. And when it's done right, I guess what I would say is we give those we serve, starting with the president, new ways to think about dangers and opportunities around the world. Whether that topic is an enduring one, an emerging one or one that's way over the horizon. DAVE MARLOWE: Thanks also for the opportunity to be here. Thanks, Michael, for hosting us. The fundamental job of an operations officer, as I see it, is that we go overseas in somebody else's country and we understand them in their circumstances and in their world as they see themselves. And we're an apolitical organization. I like to say that the difference between policy and intelligence is that policy is about how you want the world to be. Intelligence is about how it is. And our job is to go to other people's countries, see them in their environment, see how they understand their problems, see how they see us, and understand what it is that's in their minds and bring some piece of that back that's useful for Linda's folks to digest. MICHAEL MORELL: One more question before we get to the career discussion. Movies, TV, series, paint CIA in certain ways what is it really like on a day to day basis to work at CIA? Dave, want to go first on this one? DAVE MARLOWE: There's fewer cocktails and tuxedos for sure. I can't think of a spy movie I've seen that I thought was an honest depiction. We're methodical, meticulous. We take our responsibility seriously. We're deliberate and disciplined. There's no flash. Very rarely flash anyway. And we're playing a long, careful game. We're not running something that can be accomplished in 90 minutes of a movie. We're doing things that are over the long term. And if we're leaving a splash, we've made a series of mistakes. Our job is to do what we're doing in the director of operations and not leave a trace that we've been there. LINDA WEISSGOLD: I'm not a big fan of spy movies because I find them really frustrating. Like Dave, I think I find that they're very distorted. I once, when I was a briefer, after I'd been briefed, I once was overseas and a liaison partner of ours very seriously asked me if my job as the president's briefer had been like- there was a series that had been done called The Briefer with Katherine Heigl, in which she would brief the president in the morning, jump on a plane, jump out of the plane, go kill someone. And he was asking me, was your job really like that? And I told him, absolutely.\u00a0 But when you really do ask, what is our job like? For me working at CIA, it is a form of public service. And I think that's a really important thing for people to remember. The place is filled with some of the most intelligent, most interesting, most determined people you are ever going to meet. And not once in my career. And as was mentioned, it's been a long one. Not once has anyone ever asked me what my politics are. And I don't ask other people because that's not what we're there for. We are all there united, I think, in one mission, which is the protection of the United States. And that makes it really special.\u00a0 People cry when they leave the CIA. And so I think that's something really important to think about. But if you get back to the movies, someday I still do want a computer where I can manipulate it in the air. And I notice that no one ever has to fill out like a travel voucher. There is a bureaucratic side to it. We are a government agency. I do think there's a little bit of that. it's a special place, but it's one that takes you wanting to be there and everyone else around you wants to be there as well. MICHAEL MORELL: So your careers. How did you each find your way to CIA? Linda wants to go first. LINDA WEISSGOLD: I always knew I wanted to do something international. I graduated from Georgetown School Foreign Service. I had lived overseas, but the CIA wasn't actually on my radar. So I often joke that my coming to CIA was really about serendipity and a lack of a social life because I had a roommate at the time who worked for a congresswoman on the Hill, and this was the mid-eighties. And my roommate was very much into women in leadership. She worked for Congresswoman Pat Schroeder, and she had bought tickets to a seminar that was going on about women in leadership. And something came up and she couldn't make it. And so she asked me, did I want to go, and I was free. I didn't have much of a social life. So I said, sure. So I go to this session and it was a two day session. And over the night there was a hijacking in Athens. And all kinds of people were talking about giving up their tickets. They were on the news. They were talking about giving up their tickets to go to Athens. And I remember I came in and I said, are you kidding me? And she said, really? And I said, It's not going to happen in the same place twice, right? Sure I would\u00a0 get on the next plane. This was the mid eighties, she was already teaching women in leadership courses for the agency. And she said, I have some people you should talk to. And she directed me there. The second part of the story goes. So I called thinking that I was going to be having an informational interview more with the idea that back then we didn't have the luxury of the website, which we're going to mention several times tonight, as you know, CIA.gov. So I thought I was calling up to get an informational interview and the guy said, Oh, Jinx said you should call. He said, We're having a test next weekend. I, again, wasn't busy, so I showed up for the test and hadn't filled out any paperwork. This would never happen today and apparently did really well on the test because they then started calling me, asking me to please fill out the paperwork. And here we have job offers for you. So it was total serendipity.\u00a0 I will just add when I tell the story in our organization, one of the things I say is that be open to opportunities when they come. If you end up at CIA or whatever your careers might be, there's going to be a lot of times when someone's going to come to you and say, hey, would you do this? And it may not have been. For those of you who are planners, it may not have been on your five year plan. It may not have been what you were thinking. And what I say is that you are going to learn the most from those jobs that you probably weren't thinking about. And you will get all kinds of experiences and it may set you on a totally different path. So be open to opportunities when they come. DAVE MARLOWE: So I graduated from William and Mary in 1984, and my objective in college had been basically to get out alive. And so the summer after I graduated, I started thinking about what I wanted to do with my life. I talked to the parents of some friends who worked in various national security roles. I traveled through Europe and I came back with kind of a job description of what I wanted to do. I wanted to be doing something, working overseas out of the embassy, maybe something in national security, something that was results oriented and something that wasn't in the spotlight, which kind of brought me into the director of operations. So I talked to some adults that I respected and laid out a path for myself, which was to go into the army, to go to the military. And I chose the army and got some kind of background experience that would make me more marketable than where I was at the time. So I enlisted so that I could pick my particular path. They taught me Arabic for about a year and a half in California. And then I went to school and I spent the next couple of years in the Army and ended up coming here in 1991, right after the Gulf War. MICHAEL MORELL: So outside your current jobs, what's the best assignment you ever had at CIA, Dave? DAVE MARLOWE: I'm not going to say where, but I had a number of assignments in the Middle East and in some of those places, nobody spoke English at all. And if you can go live in a country that is sort of unadulterated by the Western experience, it's something absolutely different from going to Europe, which is like America, but they don't speak English. And it was just fantastic. I lived on local food. I lived in Arabic every day. I knew the names of all the different kinds of fish in the fish market and the fruits and vegetables and all that kind of stuff. I was part spy, part diplomat, part adventurer, part anthropologist, part sociologist. And just having an absolute blast. LINDA WEISSGOLD: I said, I've had a ton of amazing opportunities. I've actually followed you in several jobs. First I want to say why I've been at CIA so long, because it does get to what my favorite job has been.\u00a0 The CIA is about your capability, not your rank. And so one of my very first jobs was my account in the Middle East. I was working on Lebanon, and I had only been on the account for a very short period of time, a couple of months when the Sunni prime minister was assassinated. And my part of the account was I was following, among other things, the Sunnis who were considered the less important account. What amazed me at the time was that I was not asked to hand over my research to a more senior officer. It was me. I was front and center and I was hooked. I was hooked from the very beginning that it was about your capability. So I guess I would say you can't be more front and center at CIA than being the president's briefer. And I would say that was probably my favorite job, because it really was a tremendous honor to be the one to go in every morning to represent the work of the agency, whether that be the analytic work, the operational work, to be the one to kind of see history happening, how intelligence was really being used every day, how important it was and how relevant it was to make the timing window right. All of those kinds of things. It made me a better analyst. And so I guess what I really saw was how intelligence informs policy debate, and that would probably be my favorite job. MICHAEL MORELL: Probably the two most important career related questions that we're going to talk about tonight. Number one, what advice would you give to any student here who might be interested in a career as an analyst or an operations officer? LINDA WEISSGOLD: This is where you are going to see the difference, one of the differences between the DO and the DA. I brought notes because I wanted to make sure that I gave you guys really good advice and didn't forget anything. So first off- DAVE MARLOWE: I'm just going to copy hers. LINDA WEISSGOLD: So he stole the information and gave it to me. It was fine. So I'm really thrilled you're asking about a career as an analyst, but I really would be remiss if I didn't talk about the other directorates as well. And to really highlight the idea that at CIA, we are looking for people who do all kinds of things. We hire for almost every imaginable skill, graphic artists, accountants, engineers, logisticians, data scientists. So it's about more than just our directorates. And again, if you don't hear something from us, go to the website because there's all kinds of opportunities. So first, if you're currently a student and you have time before you graduate, I highly encourage you to participate in our student programs. It is the perfect opportunity for you to get a chance to look at us and for us to get a chance to look at you. Like I said, it was a black box when I joined. It was kind of a leap of faith. But this is something that gives you that opportunity to really understand what it would be like.\u00a0 In the director of analysis, if you are a student intern or a graduate grad fellow, you are doing the exact work of an analyst. You're writing for the president. You're just getting more help in doing it. So we're not going to ask you to make coffee or go make copies or anything like that. You are an analyst, so if you want to do that, you should try and get your resumes in by the end of this year for next summer. It does take some time. I also want to point out that we're in the process of hopefully rolling out soon a bit of a change in how you apply. And so rather than being an application, it will be a resume based system. So I want to tell you it's okay to have a beefy resume. Like two pages are good. And I know that may be counterintuitive for some jobs, but it really is a way for us to get to know you a little bit more. And particularly as a student, when you may not have as many job experiences. We're going to be looking at some of the traits that you have. So it'll help us understand the depth and the breadth and your skills. Just a couple more things. Don't be afraid to show passion and enthusiasm for this choice.\u00a0 The people who will be interviewing you at CIA, they're not professional recruiters. They are officers. And so for us, they are analysts who are on rotation trying to make sure that we are bringing in for the next generation the best and the brightest. So if you talk to them about patriotism and about really why you want to come, it's not going to sound corny to them. It's the same reasons that they came. So like I said, don't be afraid to show that passion and enthusiasm. And then last thing I'll just say is stop doing marijuana at least 90 days before you come. We do still follow the federal law guidelines. So while it may be legal in Maryland and other places, we follow federal law.\u00a0 DAVE MARLOWE: The one piece of advice I give you by coming to the director of operations, and I'm sure this is true for for all the directors is if coming to the CIA is your plan B or your sort of fallback thing that you're going to do if something else doesn't work out, that is the wrong approach. For every 100 applicants that we receive, it's a very small percentage that actually make it through to be hired, probably less than 5%. And the people who get through get through because they're determined. And so if you apply now or this summer and you don't get through the process, you're sent a very nice no thank you letter. That doesn't mean you should quit it. What it means is you should think about, is this what I really want to do? And if it is what you really want to do, then go out and build your resume and add some life experience.\u00a0 So what life experience do you put on your resume? Well, I'll tell you, we hire all kinds of people and the kinds of people that you would predict somebody who's had military experience or business experience, or we would hire people who are out of law school. All those things are true. But we've also had I'm not sure if he's still with us, a world famous rock and roll guitarist, professional athletes, ballet dancers, college professors, people that you would not imagine would end up working in the Directorate of Operations. And what they've all brought is not necessarily the things that are on their resume, but a determination, a determination to win and resilience. And that's what we're looking for in the director of operations. If you're an officer, you have to be comfortable when you've kind of fallen back to Plan G because you're already forming the elements of Plan L and Plan M because you're going to have to adapt. And so really that's the most important thing for us is determination and resilience. And then, of course, Linda will probably tell you as well, integrity. We're entrusted with a great deal of responsibility that's unique to us. And whether it's me having tens of thousands of dollars in cash to hand to somebody in an alley for a very sort of minimal receipt or Linda sitting in front of the president and saying, this is the thing I know and this is a thing I don't know. Integrity is absolutely paramount. MICHAEL MORELL: So I'll speak from experience. It's great to have one of those former professional athletes on your intramural basketball team. Very, very helpful to winning. Dave, you answered the second question already, which is what do you look for in terms of a skill set? What about an analyst? What do you look for? LINDA WEISSGOLD: A lot of them are things you'd expect: strong writing, strong briefing, intellectual curiosity, thoughtfulness and definitely integrity. What we do is high stakes, as Dave said, and it involves really sensitive information and telling policymakers things that they don't want to hear. But that takes some courage. That integrity, it's something we can't teach. And so it's something you need to show us when you before you get hired. Expertise is absolutely important. It's the coin of the realm for the director of analysis.\u00a0 Either show that you have some in a discipline, like you're a kick ass economist or you are a military analyst or that you have some substantive expertise. Whether you are a quantum physicist or you have expertise in Latin America. Again, we're looking for something that you can use to develop the insight that we provide. Language skills, of course, are a plus for the entire agency, as are overseas experiences. I would say diversity of thought is really important, diversity as a whole. We can't afford to have groupthink. So I look for people who actually may have some outside of the box thinking or come from left field ideas. And then the last one, I'll just say is humility. It's really important. What we do is hard. We are not going to get it right all the time. We have to admit when we're wrong, we have to think about when it's time to actually reevaluate and adjust our analysis. And you're not always the smartest person in the room, right? So you have to be open to the ideas. What we do is a lot of teamwork. So I often like to say that thinking may be a solitary skill, but analysis is not. We need people who are team players and have the humility to be open to ideas from others. DAVE MARLOWE: Great. Can I just follow up and pick up on something that Linda said. I remember very well being in my late teens and early twenties and trying to figure out who I was. And I think it's important that when you're looking at a potential career at CIA, you know what motivates you and you're not going to get paid as well as you can if you go into the private sector. And they're going to be demands placed on you that normal people don't have to deal with. Some of it has to do with your freedom of movement. You have to tell people when you're going places, you can't bring your phone into the office. There's a lot that you surrender, including the potential for a fat paycheck when you come to work for CIA. And the folks who do it and do it well are genuinely motivated by patriotism and not the kind of patriotism that shows up on the 4th of July, the patriotism that drives you when things are difficult or mundane or scary or professionally challenging. And if that's what drives you, then you probably have a place here. If you're thinking, well, I can do this for a little bit and then make some money. This is not the place. MICHAEL MORELL: Let's turn to global hotspots in the world today, which we could talk about for hours. I want to do this a little bit differently than I would normally do this. What I'd like to do is just throw out an issue and just get each of you to respond fairly quickly, fairly briefly, on what you think is the most important thing that all of us should keep in mind with regard to that issue. Dave, I'm going to go to the operator. Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\u00a0 DAVE MARLOWE:\u00a0 I'll tell you what this looks like to the Directorate of Operations. I'm not an analyst, so I can assess that issue at will. Putin was at his best moment the day before he invaded because he had all the course of power that he's ever going to have. And his objectives were to squeeze things out of Ukraine, to threaten NATO and affect NATO unification and to show off to the world that Russia is powerful militarily, economically, diplomatically. He squandered every single bit of that. And so for the director of operations, we're looking around the world for Russians who were are disgusted with that as we are because we're open for business. LINDA WEISSGOLD: I would say that it's important to note Putin has not given up on the expansive goals that he had for Ukraine. And actually, let me backup and just say I totally understand why you made the link, because actually everything we're going to talk about, I think on hot spots, it's all interconnected because the world is actually watching what we are doing and how we are reacting in Ukraine. China is watching that. And so I totally understand where you're coming from.\u00a0 Putin hasn't given up. This isn't going to end anytime soon. I think this could certainly drag on. It's important. I think a lesson we all need to take. It's really important to know what you're fighting for. The Ukrainian soldiers know that, the Russian soldiers not so much. That interconnectedness, allowing a country to take territory just because they can, is likely to embolden others to do the same at a really high human cost. MICHAEL MORELL: Now, China-Taiwan. LINDA WEISSGOLD: I was saying before about China-Taiwan, I guess the things to think about, as I was saying, Xi is certainly watching what's going on. And he has not been shy about the idea that he wants to have control of Taiwan, even if that requires military movements to do so. I think one of the things it's really important for us to think about, as China has graduated, if you will, from being a rising power to really being the largest, most important geopolitical issue for us. And it's because I think really what we're seeing is China in so many domains, more than the Cold War and Russia, is now a competitor. So whether we're talking about militarily, economically, through technology, space, in just about every domain you can think of, China is a competitor with us now. And I think that that is something for us to think about when we think about China. DAVE MARLOWE: I would just add that five, ten years ago everybody was being polite about the competition with China, and now it's plain and it's in the open. It's the challenge of the next generation of intelligence officers. LINDA WEISSGOLD: Can I just add one other thing, which is that we talked about languages. It sure wouldn't hurt if you want to go learn Mandarin. The agency, and we're not alone in this in the government, we are putting a lot more resources to working on China. And so we've created a new China mission center. We're looking at China. China is now trying to be a global power. And so we're looking at China and Africa, China and Latin America. Regardless of maybe your area of expertise, if you're thinking regionally, if it is Latin America or Africa, it doesn't hurt for you to also learn about China, because that's something for us that we are all thinking about them globally. MICHAEL MORELL: Iran's behavior, whether it's toward its own people, whether it's toward its regional neighbors, whether it's about nuclear weapons.\u00a0 LINDA WEISSGOLD: I think the thing I would say about Iran at this point, a couple of things. One, we do not believe we do not assess right now that Iran is in the process of making a nuclear weapon. But what we do assess is that Iran is doing more and more to be ready to make a nuclear weapon. So whether it be improving their enrichment capabilities, you know, they are exceeding all of the limits that were part of the JCPOA. And so I think that that's an important thing for us to think about with Iran.\u00a0 I think it's important when we talk about Iran, to remember that Iran is a threat not just to U.S. interests, but to the interest of our allies in the region. And that is also something that we care about. We don't just talk about U.S. national security interests. We talk about the interests of our allies as well. And then in the context of the current protests that are ongoing, I think it's really important when you think about Iran to think through the fact that we talk about moderates and reformers and conservatives, but it's all in the context of a conservative theocracy. So when you talk about a moderate in Iran, it's not necessarily someone who is looking to have a democratic freedom of speech, all of those kinds of things. I remember President Bush used to ask me and when we would talk about Iran, he would say, it's not a free and fair election. Can they stand up in the middle of a town square and say whatever they want to say as part of that? And he said, until they can do that, it's not a free and fair election. And it still isn't today. MICHAEL MORELL: Dave, you had a lot of time in the Middle East. Your thoughts on this? DAVE MARLOWE: Iran is fascinating. Back to what I said earlier about going to other people's countries and understanding them as they understand themselves. You've got a theocracy with an apocalyptic vision. Is there a modern government. You've got echoes of their Persian past and then you've got the conflict between Shia and Sunni that sort of defines their relationship with their neighbors, whether their Sunni neighbors or mixed neighbors like they are in Iraq. It's absolutely a fascinating human intelligence challenge to understand what's happening there. And where are the levers and where are the opportunities for the US government? MICHAEL MORELL: North Korea in its flurry of missile tests, Dave. DAVE MARLOWE: \u00a0I just think their petulant child having a tantrum. I'm sorry. 'Look at me. We're still here.' t's the most closed society on the planet. And even more so with the COVID lockdown, the image of the Russian diplomats working their way out on that old fashioned train railcar. It's an extremely hard intelligence problem, not insurmountable. LINDA WEISSGOLD: I would just add, I totally agree. North Korea doesn't like to be ignored and they will find ways to make sure that we're paying attention. But back to that kind of interconnectedness, I think it's really important to think about the idea that for North Korea, what China thinks and does is actually more important than what we do in some ways. They are very dependent upon China for a lot. And so sometimes when you work on an issue, it's not just about knowing that issue. You need to know what's going on in the region. You need to know what others and how others think about a country like North Korea. MICHAEL MORELL: International terrorism in the aftermath of Afghanistan. LINDA WEISSGOLD: So I'll keep it short on that and just say the threat is not gone. And we have made tremendous strides in diminishing that threat. But it's not over. And we can't afford to take our eye off the ball, and we're not going to.\u00a0 DAVE MARLOWE: And as Zawahiri would tell you, you can't hide. MICHAEL MORELL: Excellent. LINDA WEISSGOLD: We can find you. MICHAEL MORELL: Let's switch gears again and talk about the future of the organization. And it struck me when earlier on the first question I asked you, what's the job of an analyst? What's the job of an operations officer? Your answer was true 75 years ago. And it's true today. So I want to start by actually asking you, what are the keys to successful analysis? What are the keys to successful operations? And how do you make sure in the future that those factors remain in place?\u00a0 LINDA WEISSGOLD: How we do our jobs as CIA analysts I think is what sets us apart from whether it be the media or think tanks. They're important. I don't see them as competitors. It's just we do our jobs very differently. And I think what makes successful analysis, we rely on three privileged accesses. The first is access to the time, the thinking and the goals of our country's leaders. That is what allows us to understand what they need and when they need it. The second is access to a vast range of information. We are all source analysts, so that includes unclassified and classified information. And that information really gives us this huge sandbox to develop insights, hopefully unique insights. And then it's the access to CIA's reputation. CIA's reputation gets us a seat at the table. It gets us a chance to be heard. But all of those are grants of trust. They are not grants of power. They are things that we have to be, I think, cognizant of all the time. And we have to be living up to that. MICHAEL MORELL: What's the reputation you're talking about? LINDA WEISSGOLD: So the reputation I'm talking about really comes from, I think, our tradecraft. And that's that when we are going to, as I said earlier, we're going to call it like we see it. We're going to be objective. We're going to be honest about telling people what we know, what we don't know. But often when I talk about tradecraft, I boil it down to the idea, it's about being able to tell our customers why we think what we think. And that's really hard. If you guys try to unpack that as students and you're thinking about this from a paper you're writing, to actually go back in and be able to explain to a professor why you think that. And then I'll add an extra twist to this. Several years later, when you're sitting in front of Congress and you're being grilled on why you thought what you thought for some inevitable investigation. To be able to do that, too. And that's the kind of reputation I'm talking about. I think, you know, we have to be able to do that. DAVE MARLOWE: I think for operations officers, it's the same kinds of traits. But in a different scenario. We really need to be humble and be dispassionate and objective. And if you think about what we do, so we say that we spy. But what we really do is we have relationships with people who spy, and we give them some kind of compensation in exchange for that. And so if we're going to invite somebody into a relationship where they're risking prison or death, when they're betraying their tribe or their institution or their country because they believe in what they're doing with us, we have to be very judicious about that. And we have to know what we're doing and why we're doing it.\u00a0 We have to be sure that we should be doing it in the first place, that we're after something that can only be obtained through our unique function. So ultimately, it comes down to being honest with yourself and being honest about the situation you're in. Am I doing this the right way? Should I be doing this? What part of this relationship is about me and what part of it is about the agent? It really requires a cold blooded, dispassionate objectivity. And it's really not any different than when Linda's folks are figuring out, what am I saying here to the president? MICHAEL MORELL: When we go into a relationship with one of those individuals, their security is paramount. DAVE MARLOWE: It's our top priority. Absolutely. And if we fail on that, we're failing fundamentally.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0 Last question. The challenge is going forward. For each of your professions, each of your directorates, how do you think about what the big challenges are that you have to deal with successfully in order for the agency to continue to be successful? DAVE MARLOWE: I would say two things. The first is that the world is a much more intrusive space. It used to be when I was a young officer, I could fly to a country, take a train across the border to another country, check into some hostel, scribble my name on the register or pay in cash, meet my guy and leave. And I was never there. And now, if you travel any place, you don't have a reservation. You're not using a credit card, you don't have your smartphone with you. You haven't been scanned in every imaginable way along your trip. That's anomalous. So we have to actually raise our prioritization. So that we're really expanding that risk on things that truly, truly matter. The other thing that I am concerned about and that we talk about regularly is all the relationships that we've built up over the past 20 years that allowed us to be effective in the counterterrorism effort. We absolutely need those if we are to work in a unified way against our principal adversary now. And that's China. LINDA WEISSGOLD: I would say we are swimming in data and information and technology is a great thing. It should help us. It also is going to increase the difficulty of us figuring out misinformation. And so part of our job is really going to be this idea of leveraging technology to our advantage and at the same time making sure that we are kind of sorting through what should we be believing and what shouldn't we as we work through things. MICHAEL MORELL: So the changes the director made, I don't know, 18 months ago now, the media focused on the creation of the China Mission Center. But it kind of missed the creation of a chief technology officer, the creation of a new directorate focused on technology. So huge, huge emphasis seems to be on technology at the agency to help you do your job, to protect you and doing your job right. Could you just talk about that for 30 seconds each? LINDA WEISSGOLD: Absolutely. Dave and I actually spent some time together in a meeting today on this very topic. And the idea being looking at things on, as you said, how can we- when I think about technology from the analyst's point of view it is a topic that we study, right? So we're looking at emerging technology, new weapons systems, all of those kinds of things. So set that aside. We've always been doing that. But looking at technology on how we can leverage and take advantage of what's happening in open source. But at the same time, as I said earlier, this idea that we have to be able to explain to people why we think what we think, and if we don't understand the algorithm that is being used by AI. I don't think the president's going to be very accepting if I were to go in and say, the black box just told me so. And I don't know why it said that. So being able to really understand, again, applying our tradecraft in this brave new world of technology is, I think, something that's really important for us to work at.\u00a0 DAVE MARLOWE: I would say we're users of technology on offense. We're concerned about technology on defense, and we collect on technological issues. And then we have been, CIA has traditionally been a driver of innovative technologies. And we had a former director who was an Air Force general before he showed up. And we want to park a plane outside, which is the predecessor to the S.R. 71, as a visible demonstration of that fact. LINDA WEISSGOLD: Can I plug the website again one more time? Because there's a great, there's a lot of really cool information on there for our 75th anniversary. And one of them is a list of technology that probably wouldn't exist if CIA hadn't invented it. So you can thank us for the battery in your cell phone, that kind of small lithium battery. That was us. And there's a whole long list of the other kinds of inventions that came out of CIA.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Democratic U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan and Republican JD Vance, who are running for Ohio's open Senate seat, soon went on the attack against each other in their first debate Monday night, with each blaming the other for job losses and putting party loyalty above the needs of voters.\u00a0 Vance accused Ryan of supporting policies that led to the rape of a 10-year-old girl in Ohio. Ryan said Vance had started a \"fake nonprofit\" to help people overcome addiction issues. Each also said the other was too beholden to his party, with Ryan echoing a comment from former President Donald Trump in calling Vance an \"a**-kisser\" and Vance saying Ryan's 100% voting record with President Joe Biden means he's not the reasonable moderate he says he is. The face-off between Ryan, a 10-term congressman, and Vance, a venture capitalist and author of \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" for the seat being vacated by retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman was one of the most contentious debates of the general election season so far. The race is one of the most expensive and closely watched of the midterms, with Democrats viewing it as a possible pickup opportunity in November. Both candidates sought to tailor their messages to the working-class voters who could determine the election in an evening peppered with barbs and one-liners. Ryan sought to paint Vance as an extremist, someone who associates with \"crazies\" from his party who falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen, support national abortion restrictions and contributed to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. \"You're running around with Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who wants to ban books. You're running around with (Sen.) Lindsey Graham, who wants a national abortion ban. You're running around with (Rep.) Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's the absolute looniest politician in America,\" Ryan said.  Vance suggested Ryan's focus on allegation of extremism was meant as a distraction from pocketbook issues important to voters, such as inflation and the price of groceries. \"It's close to Halloween, and Tim Ryan has put on a costume where he pretends to be a reasonable moderate.\" Had he been, Vance said, \"Youngstown may not have lost 50,000 manufacturing jobs during your 20 years.\"  Ryan said: \"I'm not gonna apologize for spending 20 years of my adult life slogging away to try to help one of the hardest economically hit regions of Ohio and dedicating my life to help that region come back. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, JD. You went off to California, you were drinking wine and eating cheese.\" Vance countered that he left Ohio at the age of 18 to join the Marines, and after working in Silicon Valley, he returned to Ohio to raise his family and start a business.  During questioning about China, Ryan said Vance invested in China as a venture capitalist, the type of business move that exacerbated job losses in Ohio's manufacturing base. \"The problem we're having now with inflation is our supply chains all went to China, and guys like him made a whole lot of money off that,\" Ryan said. Vance countered that it's Democratic economic policies that have harmed manufacturing, saying, \"They have completely gone to war against America's energy sector.\" He said he could not remember investing in China. On abortion, Vance did not answer whether he would support Graham's proposed national ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Vance said he thinks different states would likely want different laws but \"some minimum national standard is totally fine with me.\" He called himself \"pro-life\" but said he has \"always believed in reasonable exceptions.\" Ryan said he supports codifying the abortion rights established in Roe v. Wade, which was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in June. He said he opposes Ohio's law banning most abortions after fetal cardiac activity has been detected, as early as six weeks into pregnancy, which was blocked Friday. Vance agreed with Ryan that a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim should not have had to leave the state for an abortion, but he said the fact the suspect was in the country illegally was a failure of weak border policies. \"You voted so many times against the border wall funding, so many times for amnesty, Tim,\" Vance said. \"If you had done your job, she would have never been raped in the first place.\" On foreign policy, the pair parted ways on what the U.S. response should be if Russian President Vladimir Putin were to launch nuclear weapons in Ukraine. Ryan said the U.S. should be prepared with a \"swift and significant response,\" while Vance countered that the U.S. needs a \"foreign policy establishment that puts the interests of our citizens first.\"  Ryan responded, \"If JD had his way, Putin would be through Ukraine at this point. He'd be going into Poland.\"  \"If I had my way,\" Vance retorted, \"you'd put money at the southern border, Tim, instead of launching tons of money into Ukraine.\" It echoed comments Vance had made in an interview before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, saying he didn't \"really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another\" because he wanted to see Biden focus on his own country's border security. Vance said, however, that Taiwan was a \"much different situation\" than Ukraine because of its importance to U.S. national security. \"The reason why Taiwan is different is because they make so many of our semiconductors, our computer chips. The entire modern economy would collapse without it,\" Vance said. Ryan sought at points to put some distance between himself and his party, repeating his earlier comments that Mr. Biden shouldn't run for a second term in 2024 and calling Vice President Kamala Harris \"absolutely wrong\" to say that the southern border was secure. \"I'm not here to just get in a fight or just tiptoe the Democratic Party line,\" Ryan said. \"I'm here to speak the truth.\" Ryan said Vance didn't have the courage to stand up to people in his own party, noting that during an Ohio rally last month, Trump, who endorsed Vance, said, \"JD is kissing my a--, he wants my support so (much).\" Vance retorted: \"I'm not going to take lessons on dignity and self-respect from a guy caught on video kissing up to Chuck Schumer and begging him for a promotion to his next job. That's the kind of guy Tim Ryan is.\" While the general election debate between Ryan and Vance was acrimonious, it didn't lead to a near-physical altercation, as an Ohio GOP Senate debate back in March during the primary season did. Former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and investment banker Mike Gibbons found themselves face to face on the debate stage, shouting at each other, while Vance told the two to stop fighting. \"Sit down. Come on,\" Vance said, sitting in a row with the remaining candidates. \"This is ridiculous.\" At the end of Monday's debate, Vance and Ryan shook hands.",

And this week on Face the Nation: Five days after the 2022 election, control of the House of Representatives remains undecided, while Democrats keep their Senate majority. How will this midterm muddle change life for Americans? Democrats braced for defeat last Tuesday, but they breathed a sigh of relief after their better-than-expected showing. (Begin VT) SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-New York): A victory and a vindication for Democrats, our agenda and for the America -- and for the American people. JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): I'm not surprised by the turnout. I'm incredibly pleased. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Here's how Republican's Senate campaign chief described the outcome. (Begin VT) SENATOR RICK SCOTT (R-Florida): Here's what happened to us. Election Day, our voters didn't show up. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: What do the results mean for Washington and the rest of the country for the next few years? We will hear from a senior adviser to President Biden and key members in Congress from both parties. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We begin this morning with a CBS News projection. Democrats will keep their thin Senate majority for two more years, after Senator Catherine Cortez Masto's narrow win over Adam Laxalt in Nevada last night. It was Democrats' second victory this weekend, following Senator Mark Kelly's projected win over Blake Masters out in Arizona. But we are still awaiting results in key House races on the West Coast that will determine the shape of Congress. CBS News estimates that Republicans maintain an edge in clinching control of the House of Representatives. But Democrats still have a shot at the majority. President Biden called it perilously close. At this hour, CBS estimates the GOP will win at least 214 seats and Democrats 210, but a majority requires 218 seats, and neither party will reach that number until a handful of closely contested districts finish counting. CBS News senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann has more from Atlanta. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): For days to come, many states will still tally ballots. But the biggest midterm winter is already clear: democracy. It held, without mobs in the streets, without violence, despite all the election denialism out there. KARI LAKE (R-Arizona Gubernatorial Candidate): Are you ready to take this state back? (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) MARK STRASSMANN: Arizona's gubernatorial race between Republican Kari Lake and Democrat Katie Hobbs could still go either way. Lake, a Trump protege, accuses elections officials of slow-rolling returns. Reality check: No state counts all ballots by midnight Election Day. BILL GATES (R-Maricopa County, Arizona, Supervisor): We're not doing anything wrong at all. And that someone from here would suggest that we are doing something wrong, that's frustrating. MARK STRASSMANN: On the same ballot in Arizona, Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters has yet to concede. He tweeted: \"Voters decide, not the media. Let's count the votes.\" And although nearly 60 percent of GOP election deniers are projected to win their races this year, none were top election officials in critical battleground states. Democratic candidates nationwide defied expectations, despite Republicans beating them up on inflation and the relentless GOP drive to yoke them to an unpopular president. But another worry drove many voters. WOMAN: Abortion, you know, just the right to have autonomy over one's body. MARK STRASSMANN: And take John Fetterman's narrow win as Pennsylvania's next senator, flipping a key swing state seat to Democrats. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-Pennsylvania Senator-Elect): I never expected that we were going to turn these red counties blue. MARK STRASSMANN: In rejecting Republican Mehmet Oz, Pennsylvania voters ranked abortion as their number one issue. Oz also had the Trump seal of endorsement. Among disappointed Republicans, Trump's impact on races has led to a finger-pointing election postmortem, complaints about unelectable candidates with extreme positions. SENATOR PAT TOOMEY (R-Pennsylvania): If fealty to Donald Trump is the primary criteria for selecting candidates, we're probably not going to do really well. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Focus on the Senate now shifts to Georgia's run-off next month, Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker squaring off December 6. Democrats want a win here to build a stronger majority and create leverage for Senate leaders -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann, thank you. We turn now to CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto for more on the trends that influenced the midterm election results. Anthony, I know you haven't slept... (LAUGHTER) ANTHONY SALVANTO: Nope. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... at all. And you're still tabulating here. But, big picture, Democrats defied history. How did they do it? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, this was a turnout story, first and foremost, in my mind, and it was sort of as we expected. The people -- our viewers may remember, a couple of weeks ago, when we were talking about the effect that turnout could have, and how Republicans were on path to a narrow majority, but that the House could become even if younger people especially turned out in force. And what happened, they did. Their numbers started approaching the 2018 record levels. There was a particular group subset we called the young and restless that we were watching. And not only did they turn out, but they even shifted a little bit more Democratic, almost two-thirds of them voting for Democrats. So that certainly helped the Democrats in a lot of states, a lot of districts. But the other thing it did was it offset, in a relative way, the impact of the MAGA Republicans, we would call them, the Trump true believers. And they certainly turned out and had impact, but not as much in that relative way, again, because the Democrats and the younger people had turned out. MARGARET BRENNAN: At this hour, Republicans still hold an edge in gaining control of the House. It's a slimmer majority, if they get it. What broke in their favor? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, let me start with another group that you and I talked about throughout this campaign, and that was the pressure parents. These were folks who said that the COVID pandemic had been stressful, stressful on their kids. Also, their finances were under stress. Well, they actually voted narrowly Republican by three points, really reflective of the way the country overall did. And then the other part of that I should mention are the restoring Roe voters. These were women for whom abortion and abortion rights were a priority in their voting. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that momentum had slowed. ANTHONY SALVANTO: That momentum did slow during the campaign. And then it seemed to come back, because we saw them move in the end, when we did our Election Day polling, move even more for the Democrats, going from eight in 10 to nine in 10 voting for Democrats, which suggests that the Democrats' messaging there in the closing, that that definitely helped the Democrats as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do we watch for next? ANTHONY SALVANTO: OK, there's a handful of congressional districts that are going to be the sort of center of political universe. We're all going to watch out West in the Central Valley, California, Southern California especially. And we're probably going to have to go district by district until somebody gets to 218. Going to be a couple of days, maybe a couple of weeks. This is typical. These places, I should say, often count their ballots over days and weeks. But that's we're watching. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, get your coffee going. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Indeed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. We go now to Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who was a regular on the 2022 campaign trail boosting GOP candidates. He's out with a new book called \"Only the Strong,\" and he joins us this morning from McLean, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator. And on this Veterans Day weekend, I do want to thank you for your past military service. SENATOR TOM COTTON (R-Arkansas): Well, thank you, Margaret. That's kind of you. And thanks to all our veterans for their service in all of our nation's wars. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me get to the story of the moment. Democrats faced historic headwinds. Eight out of 10 Americans said they felt it was out of control. Republicans had issues like economy and crime really break in their favor. President Biden has a low approval rating. How did Republicans end up with this complete disappointment? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, Margaret, I wouldn't say it was a complete disappointment. On the one hand, we had strong Republican leaders running on positive records of accomplishments who won very big victories, if you look at governors like Ron DeSantis in Florida, Brian Kemp in Georgia, Mike DeWine in Ohio, Kim Reynolds in Iowa, Greg Abbott in Texas. We had senators with the same victories, like Marco Rubio in Florida and Tim Scott in South Carolina, Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. But, on the other hand, obviously, we hoped that we would have won more seats. I think the lessons in our victories can be applied to some places where we came up a little bit short. We need to focus on serious substantive accomplishments and issues like crime, like our wide-open border, like addressing runaway inflation. Even in places where we came up a little bit short, like Lee Zeldin's race for governor in New York, he performed very well, compared to Republicans in recent elections, and he probably helped save the House of Representatives by bringing four new Republican congressmen-elect across the finish line in New York. MARGARET BRENNAN: But... SENATOR TOM COTTON: So, I think we have lessons in the places we had victories... MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. SENATOR TOM COTTON: ... that we can apply to places where we were disappointed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, but you lost the ball game in the Senate. Karl Rove blamed candidate quality, and specifically put the blame on former President Trump. He said: \"Mr. Trump turned what should have been a referendum on Mr. Biden's terrible record into a choice between himself and the current president. As in 2020, lots of voters chose Mr. Biden.\" Should Mr. Trump remain the leader of the Republican Party? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, Margaret, when the party -- when any party is out of power, as Republicans are now, we don't have a single leader. The former president is obviously very popular with many of our voters. MARGARET BRENNAN: He's the center of gravity. SENATOR TOM COTTON: But we also have important other leaders as well, like some of those victors I just mentioned earlier, like Brian Kemp in Georgia, Ron DeSantis in Florida. Last year, you had Glen Youngkin have a great victory in a bluish democratic state like Virginia. I hope to remain a leader in the United States Senate as well, in addition to people like some of those I just mentioned who were reelected, like Tim Scott. So, when you're in opposition, you don't have a single leader. That won't be the case until we're through the '24 -- '24 nominating season, and we have -- and we have a new nominee. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you're not going to run for president in 2024. The former president says he intends to announce he's running on Tuesday. Should he be the automatic nominee, or should he face a primary? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, Margaret, since I opted against being a candidate in 2024, I -- I don't plan to be a pundit or a strategist in 2024. I will say that... MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you just throw out a whole bunch of names of guys who might be running for president, Senator. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you endorsing them? SENATOR TOM COTTON: And I -- and I know almost -- I know almost all of them personally. And I respect their accomplishments, not just their big victories on Tuesday, or last year in Glenn's case, but also their accomplishments in office. But, you know, I know everyone already wants to focus on 2024. I just want to remind everyone that we're still in the middle of the 2022 midterm, because we're in overtime in Georgia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TOM COTTON: And the most important thing we can do is elect Herschel Walker to make sure that we can keep the pressure on Democrats in the Senate not to veer far to the left, as they have over the last two years. That's where I think everyone should remain focused for these next three weeks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Should leadership elections in the Senate be delayed until December, and should Mitch McConnell remain as Republican leader in the Senate? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I don't see why we would delay the election, since all five or six of our leadership elections are uncontested. You know, the great wrestling champion Ric Flair used to say, to be the man, you got to beat the man. And, so far, no one's had the nerve to step forward and challenge Senator McConnell. So, I support Senator McConnell. I support the other slate of candidates for our leadership elections. I think it's better that we move forward with these elections, so we can focus, again, on the Georgia run-off. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. I want to ask you as well about what will be a consequential meeting tomorrow between President Biden and President Xi Jinping of China, their first to face -- face-to-face of the Biden presidency. Mr. Biden says he wants to talk through red lines to understand critical interests. Can the U.S. avoid conflict with China at this point? SENATOR TOM COTTON: We want to avoid conflict with China most certainly in the military sense. I don't think we can avoid conflict and tension in terms of diplomatic and economic and political competition. I would urge the president to be very firm in drawing those red lines. We don't want to see a repeat of what happened last summer in Russia, when Vladimir Putin walked away from their summit in Europe tempted to go for the jugular in Ukraine, especially a month later after the collapse in Afghanistan, or a replay of something I write about in my new book, \"Only the Strong,\" of the disastrous Vienna summit in 1961 between John Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev, which encouraged Russian leaders to rampage all around the world for the next year. So I hope the president is very clear in drawing red lines, for instance, saying that the recent rule against China using American semiconductor technology is only the first step. I hope he's very clear about Taiwan, that we will continue to arm Taiwan so it can defend itself, and, if China goes for the jugular in Taiwan, then we will come to their aid. That's the simplest way to avoid military conflict, is to be clear and firm up front. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what would you recommend in terms of China not going for the jugular, but a slow strangulation to take over Taiwan, which I know you know is one of the scenarios national security officials are concerned about? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, the simplest thing we can do for Taiwan is what we should have started doing for Ukraine before Russia invaded Ukraine, is to provide them with the weaponry that they need to stop an invasion. It's urgent that we do so now, because, unlike Ukraine, Taiwan is an island, which means China could blockade it, and we might not be able to resupply them once China might start military conflict. So, it's urgent that we accelerate arms sales to Taiwan, the kind of anti- ship, anti-aircraft missiles and sea mines that they need to fend off a potential evasion from the communist Chinese. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. With China, it's a hard problem set because, as you know, our economies are so interlinked; iPhones are made in China. We learned during the pandemic how dependent we are on the supply chain. They own an enormous amount of us debt. You're arguing to separate the two economies, but people like Hank Paulson of the Bush administration have said that'll end up with a less stable world with really dangerous economic forces here. How do you possibly do that? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, Margaret, as I write in \"Only the Strong,\" it was a bad mistake by leaders in both parties going back 30 years to allow China to get itself so entangled in the United States and to allow us to become so economically dependent in so many ways, whether it's things like high-tech electronic equipment or low-tech basic pharmaceutical ingredients or medical equipment. What I say in \"Only the Strong\" is that we should try to decouple in a strategic sense, so we don't harm our own people, but we're no longer dependent on those critical sectors that we depend on to keep ourselves safe -- safe, healthy and prosperous. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TOM COTTON: It's one thing if Americans buy, say, children's toys or plastic Christmas trees from China. It's another thing if China has the market cornered on things like basic pharmaceutical ingredients or the rare earth elements that are so vital to all modern electronics. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, we will watch. SENATOR TOM COTTON: We have to do so in a smart way, but we have to be aggressive and quick about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll watch to see if there's congressional action on any of that. Senator, thank you for your time today. And I'm joined now in studio by Maryland Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin, who also serves on the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Welcome. Democrats still have a shot here, although Republicans have the edge in taking the House. What do Americans need to be prepared for what the next two years looks like? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN (D-Maryland): Well, first of all, don't count us out, the way we were counted out from the very beginning in this election. They were saying the Republicans were going to pick up 40, 50, 60 seats But the party of democracy and freedom and progress for the people held. And so we've had a very impressive election. And we're going to continue to fight for social progress. And we're going to fight for the political rights of the people, which means against gerrymandering, against voter suppression tactics, against manipulative use of the filibuster and the Electoral College to thwart the will of the majority. So, we're going to continue to fight for a strong democracy program. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, it's going to be hard to legislate though, any way we look at it. I want to ask you about what you're working on with the January 6 Committee. Former President Trump's basically going to defy the subpoena you issued. He's planning to announce he's running for the presidency on Tuesday. Is the prime achievement of the January 6 Committee simply going to be this written report? You're not appearing to stop him from running. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, in a democracy, the people have the right to the truth. And what we withstood was a systematic assault on democratic institutions and an attempt to overthrow a presidential election. So we have set forth the truth in a series of hearings. And we're going to set forth the truth in our final report, along with a set of legislative recommendations about what we need to do to fortify American democracy against coups, insurrections, electoral sabotage, and political violence, with domestic violent extremist groups involved. So, we're going to put all of that out there. Look, when -- when I was over in the Senate with the impeachment team, I told the Republicans there that this was our opportunity to deal with the problem of Donald Trump, who had committed high crimes and misdemeanors against the people of the United States. And they needed to act on behalf of the country and the Constitution, but, if they didn't, he would become their problem. And, at this point, Donald Trump is the problem of the Republican Party, and he may destroy their party. MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you get an Electoral Count Act passed in this lame- duck session? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: I think we can. That's the bare minimum of what we need to do. It's necessary. It's not remotely sufficient to the task because what we saw in -- in 2021 and earlier, in 2020, was a systematic assault on the right to vote and an attempt to steal a presidential election by Donald Trump, an attempt to overthrow the constitutional order. So, I think we can reform the Electoral Count Act, passing the legislation that Zoe Lofgren and Liz Cheney have proposed. But that's just one small part of what needs to be done... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: ... needs to be done to protect American constitutional democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Election deniers didn't prevail in the key battleground, but CBS tallied it, and at least 155 House Republicans in the new Congress have raised unfounded doubts about the validity or integrity of the 2020 election. These are going to be your colleagues that you will be working with. What change is that going to affect in the working? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, that's a statement about the political contamination of the GOP by Donald Trump. And, again, Kevin McCarthy and other leaders within the Republican Party are now required to make a decision about whether they're going to try to rid themselves of Donald Trump and his toxic influence on the party. MARGARET BRENNAN: But these 155 House Republicans are his constituency. Kevin McCarthy, if he wants to be leader, will need to consider the views of everyone. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Yes. Well, it's a real problem for Kevin McCarthy now, because there are certain pro-Trumpists within his House caucus who refuse to accept that he's really with Trump, and they want to get rid of McCarthy. And some of them, they have names very early in the alphabet, like Biggs. And they might just vote for Trump when they, you know, take the roll call for speaker. So we know that the -- the hard-right Freedom Caucus people are in search of another candidate. And one potential candidate whose name has been floated is Donald Trump himself, because the speaker of the House does not have to be a member of the House. And they are talking about putting Trump right there. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not a real option, though. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, they talk about it repeatedly. And if Trump decided he wanted to do it, it would pose a profound problem for their party, because they refused to do the right thing early on. I mean, today, it seems like the spell has been broken. It's begun to dissolve. We don't have Republicans around the country claiming that they really won when it's been certified that they lost their elections. And yet there is still this big lie dogma, which, as you say, has been embraced by 150 members within their caucus. And so that is going to create profound cognitive and political dissonance within the GOP. Is it really Trump's party? Or does it stand for something else? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: And Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger are going to force that question. They're going to force the Republicans to choose. MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you urge President Biden and the White House to comply with all these House Republican investigations that have been promised? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, the -- obviously, everybody's got to comply with the law, such as the law is. You know. We would hope that they would feel chastened by the voters of America, who dealt them an historic repudiation. I mean, they were talking about picking up 40 or 50 or 60 seats. We -- the Democrats may indeed win the House, the way, yesterday, we won the Senate. So it is a repudiation of that kind of right-wing big lie, election- denying, character assassination politics that Donald Trump brought right to the heart of the Republican Party. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for being here and joining us today. We'll be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR, or we're available on demand, and you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. We're also replayed on our CBS News Streaming Network throughout the day on Sundays. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with President Biden's senior adviser, Anita Dunn. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We turn now to Anita Dunn. She's a senior adviser to President Biden and she joins us this morning from Chevy Chase, Maryland. Good morning to you. I assume it was a late night for you given that Democrats have defied expectations. You still will have only a thin majority in the Senate. Republicans still have a shot at gaining the House. What becomes possible now? ANITA DUNN (Senior Adviser to President Biden): You know, the precedent and the Democrats accomplished a huge amount with a 50-50 Senate and an extremely narrow House majority in the first two years of President Biden's term. So, you know, the president's been clear, as he was in his press conference this week, Margaret, which is, he's going to reach out his hand to work with the Republicans. And the question is whether they will reach out their hand to his. But given these narrow majorities, you know, obviously the Senate, we -- Democrats will control. The House is still up in the air. Voters in this country are going to expect their leaders to work together. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has said he wants to take it slow in terms of defining priorities over the next few weeks in this lame duck session. What's the business you need to get done? ANITA DUNN: Well, Margaret, as you know, we have to keep the government open and funded. That is obviously priority number one. Then -- and it's going to take a little while still for lame duck priorities to really be set given the uncertainty about the outcomes of the elections still. I don't think anybody would have predicted that we would still not know who would control the United States House of Representatives the following Sunday. But other lame duck priorities will certainly include additional funding for Ukraine, which has been, and the president has said, he hopes will continue to be a bipartisan issue in the United States Congress. You know, obviously, emergency funding for the natural disasters that Florida and Puerto Rico suffered earlier this year. And additional priorities for the administration as well. But keep the government open and running is the number one priority. MARGARET BRENNAN: It looks like Democrats owe a big part of their better than expected performance to young voters who turned out. About 26 million Americans are now stuck in limbo because they've been promised student debt relief. Now it's caught up in the courts. If you lose in court, I know you're waiting for that, will this just be a broken promise? ANITA DUNN: So, Margaret, we believe we're going to prevail in court because the arguments that -- and the law are on the administration's side. And make no mistake about it, the administration -- you know, President Biden made this commitment to people in America. It's not just young people. It's also people of every age. We've gotten letters at the White House from people who have retired, who are talking about what a difference loan forgiveness is going to make. And we're not going to give up and we're not going to back down. MARGARET BRENNAN: But is there a plan b if the court strikes it down? ANITA DUNN: We believe we're going to prevail in court. And, at that point, we will swiftly move to make sure that the over 26 million people at this point who have -- whose information this administration has, then we'll move swiftly for loan forgiveness. MARGARET BRENNAN: Voters in key states, like Pennsylvania, rated abortion access as a top concern for them. But if Republicans take the House, what is it that the president can actually do here? And is there room for compromise on restrictions with some of the Republicans who have said they're open to securing abortion access? ANITA DUNN: So, the president has been very clear, he believes Congress needs to codify Roe versus wade so that it is the national law of the land. And he has said, if Democrats control the House and the Senate, that he will send a bill to codify this nationally. He will continue to work, as our administration has, since this ruling came down, to make sure that the travel of women who want to go to states where abortion is legal is not impeded, that people are able to get reproductive health care, that women who have other medical issues aren't denied care, which is happening, Margaret. And, at the end of the day, you know, the president said when this ruling came down it was going to be a political issue that voters needed to go to the polls and make their voices heard. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ANITA DUNN: And there's a huge amount of evidence that's exactly what happened. So, the real question is whether the Republicans will listen to those voices. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if there's any compromise there. On -- what happens if the Republicans do get this slim majority? It ups the chances of all of these investigations that Kevin McCarthy has promised are coming. Would you say today that the White House will comply with them? The Trump administration was heavily criticized for defying Congress' request for appearance and documents. Will the Biden White House comply? ANITA DUNN: You know, Margaret, many of the Republicans who have been talking about these investigations, and even potential impeachment, have made no secret of the fact that they have a political agenda that they are trying to advance through these. Obviously, the White House has, and will continue, to apply with fair and legitimate oversight because we are a White House that respects norms and the rule of law. But I think that, you know, the American people didn't vote for Congress being used to conduct political vendettas over the next two years they voted for. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know we're still counting votes from this election. But as you know, former President Trump plans to announce he's running in 2024 this Tuesday. You've already been involved, as you said, just being prudent, in planning for President Biden to also run. Does the Trump announcement change any part of your planning or calculus? ANITA DUNN: You know, the president has made it clear he intends to run. And that he will make a formal decision later this year or early next year. You don't run for president because of what the other side is doing or what another candidate may be doing. The president will run because he feels that he is the best person to continue the progress that we have made in this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be watching and listening. Anita Dunn, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For some analysis on the election and its impact, we are joined now by a panel of political pros. Ashley Etienne, a CBS political contributor and a former aide to Vice President Harris and Speaker Pelosi, Joel Payne is a Democratic strategist and also a CBS political contributor, Leslie Sanchez is a Republican strategist and also part of the team here at CBS, and Brendan Buck is a former top aide to Speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner. It's good to have you all here. And I know you're going to explain everything that happened. But, Brendan, I want to start with you. We were just hearing about how slim the majorities could be if the GOP does pull off this win in the House. Conservative Republicans from within the Freedom Caucus made your last two boss' lives very, very difficult. What is it that Kevin McCarthy would face if he steps into leadership of the Republican Party in the House? BRENDAN BUCK (Republican Strategist): Yes, it's a really difficult moment. You know, when we had trouble sometimes keeping everybody in line, we had a pretty healthy majority. Sometimes 10, 15, 30 seats. This is a potential situation where you could have two seats to play with. And that's almost impossible. Being Republican speaker of the house is almost impossible to begin with. With a two-seat majority, that means every member has leverage over the speaker of the house. That's what they're trying to assert. If you want to be speaker, you have to do things the way I want things done. And that makes a weak speaker. Each one doesn't care about leadership. They get a lot of power - a rank and file Republican gets a lot of their power by attacking leadership. And it plays to the base and the grassroots. So, we're in this -- this cycle where they're just going to keep attacking each other. They're going to benefit. All it's going to do is hurt the speaker. And I -- ultimately, I don't know that much is going to get done legislatively. But these oversight investigations are still going to be going forward. All you need is one more seat. So, I still think it's going to be a pretty active, busy House. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Ashley, to that point, you know, one Democratic strategist said to me, because of what Brendan described, it's going to be a knife fight for two years. And you don't put someone untested in the leadership role on the Democratic side. That sounded to me like Speaker Pelosi, at 82 years old, is staying in Congress. ASHLEY ETIENNE: Well, I'll just say this, we -- take a step back. I was just thinking how to describe -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you don't want to say if she's staying or not. ASHLEY ETIENNE: No, no, no, I do. I'm happy to get into it. But I was just - you know, as a Democrat I just want to sort of absorb this moment that we're currently in. You know, I was thinking, I'm not a linguist, but, like, there's got to be something worse than a shellacking that happened on Tuesday. You know, I think that the speaker is in the power position. I mean, I've always known the speaker to be in a power position. But after the results, we - we overperformed in the election. There was no wave. This really solidifies her legacy as the most accomplished speaker in American history, in my opinion. And I think there's no doubt about that. But what, you know, when she -- she recently gave an interview, and she basically said this morning, listen, we're still in this fight. Let's not make any assumptions. Let's hold off on it. I'm always willing to bet on the speaker. But there's two things I know about her. One, she's going to make her decision on her own terms and, two, she's going to keep us all guessing. MARGARET BRENNAN: And on her own terms after this horrendous attack on her husband recently. ASHLEY ETIENNE: Oh, absolutely, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which says a lot. Joel, we were talking with Senator Cotton about the other question of leadership over in the Senate, where Democrats have this razor-thin majority. What is going on, from your understanding, within the ranks -- and I want Leslie to jump in, too -- of leadership on the Senate side. JOEL PAYNE: Well, I think it's pretty stable on the Senate side. If you're a Democrat, you've got to feel really good about Chuck Schumer delivering on that Democratic agenda, particularly in the last kind of quarter of the last Congress. You've got someone like Gary Peters, who ran the Democratic campaign machine to a lot of aplomb. You've got a really strong, experienced leadership core. So I actually think that, you know, for maybe, gosh, Ashley, we've got relative peace, peace and prosperity in the Democratic leadership ranks of the Senate, which I think is -- ASHLEY ETIENNE: And in the House, by the way. JOEL PAYNE: And - and in the House, by the way. She knows I'm a Senate guy. But, yes, I actually think it's a time of a lot of peace. And, by the way, Chuck Schumer probably among the winners when you look at what happened this week, leaning into that kind of Democratic agenda. By the way, Biden Democrats did well. And there's a lot of Biden Democrats in that Senate caucus. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the best he can get done, if Republicans take the House, is to confirm some judicial nominees. Is that it for the next two years? JOEL PAYNE: That's interesting because I've - because I've been talking to some folks, some high-ranking Democrats, and they'll tell you, we're going to double down on prescription drugs, we're going to go after insulin pricing, we're going to try to codify Roe, we're going to keep pursuing anti-inflationary measures. MARGARET BRENNAN: They don't have the votes. JOEL PAYNE: Well, that's why that race in Georgia becomes really important because in a era where Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema exist, and also when you have Dianne Feinstein in your caucus, who is a little older, it helps to have that extra insurance of another vote. LESLIE SANCHEZ: I think the only assurance coming out of that is going to be judicial appointments because everything else is going to be really difficult, especially if you're talking about an economic agenda and getting Republicans to come on board. And, Margaret, I'm just going to jump in since I started on this part. MARGARET BRENNAN: Please. LESLIE SANCHEZ: I want to say about Tuesday, Republicans were expecting a revolution. They got a revelation. And the revelation is a lot about the impact of women voters in this area and how they are activated. We know from 2018 and 2020 that they're -- with a sense of urgency, you see women run, donate, you know, protest, and get engaged. Come the Dobbs decisions - the Supreme Court Dobbs decision in June, it did have that impact that a lot of Republicans are not talking about in areas that matter, whether it was a ballot initiative or something you had like Michigan or a suburban area like Philadelphia and Pennsylvania. And the second part of that, we did see positive sides with women and the Republican Party when it came to strong governance, or when governors who looked like they were really holding the line, whether they were male or female, they were rewarded by those suburban white women and also working- class Latino and white women. So, I think there's a big takeaway that gets lost in this conversation, and that will be a part of the agenda moving forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, let's talk about that and the governor's mansions. So, in addition to Florida's governor, DeSantis, other Republican governors who signed abortion restrictions into law also won re-election. I'm thinking of Ohio's DeWine, Brian Kemp, Georgia, Greg Abbott in Texas. They all won by significant margins. Then you look at those who won with healthy backing from women, DeSantis, Abbott, Sununu, DeWine. These Republicans won women. LESLIE SANCHEZ: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it wasn't about abortion. LESLIE SANCHEZ: No. MARGARET BRENNAN: What was it about? LESLIE SANCHEZ: The economic issue overall. I mean the economic - so single-issue voters, people that were voting on abortion, in those critical swing areas, they made the difference. But if you back up, if you take an aggregate view of a state like Florida, for example, when it was important to get people back to work, you have a lot of working class families who didn't have the luxury of working from home, that realized their small businesses need to keep moving and tourism was a big part of Florida's industry. Getting that going helped -- he was rewarded dramatically. And you have a lot of small business owners that are women who cared about those types of issue. So, that's a very good model. But if it's an extreme model, I would say, on one side or the other, is when you get a lot -- mostly white, college educated women who come out against those extremes. And, in many cases, the extreme can be a Donald Trump. He - he activates women to respond. The counterresponse is visceral one way or the other. And I've been speaking to some MAGA supporters, some loyalists on his side, and they say, well, they still love the former president. The thrill is gone. They are tired of the big ego and the name calling and I think it's a caution for the Republican Party. ASHLEY ETIENNE: Yes, I was just going to say, Leslie, I think that's the top takeaway. The question that remains is, what -- when are Republicans going to learn the lesson? The MAGA movement has been a loser since day one. You've lost three cycles now in a big way. You know, there's calls inside and outside the party for Republicans to take back their party. Rupert Murdoch and all his properties are sort of abandoning the president. And so, for me, it's - it's - it's, you know, the - the party, the Republican Party is at a crossroads now. The question is, what are you going to do? And I think the challenge for them and the problem is, you can't win with a MAGA movement, but you can't walk away from them. As you said earlier, Margaret, there's 150 of them that are in the House caucus and then the president -- and former president is suggesting that he's going to run again. He's omnipresent in this whole debate. So, that's really the challenge. And I think in the next week it's going to be interesting to see if the MAGA movement sort of loosen its grip on the GOP going forward. I mean it's a big, big week for Republicans coming up in terms of their organizing. But that's the real question, when are you going to learn the lessons? BRENDAN BUCK: Yes, and I don't know that we will. I mean how many times have we been given the opportunity to learn the lesson after - after January 6th. And we've had leaders say it's time to turn the page. Mitch McConnell was on the Senate floor, Kevin McCarthy was on the Senate floor saying it's time to move on. ASHLEY ETIENNE: Sure. Yes. BRENDAN BUCK: But every time that runs into voters. And voters aren't ready to move on. And so we could have another moment where all the people in Washington say we don't -- we want somebody else, but if voters don't, they're probably going to backtrack very quickly. I thought your interview with Tom Cotton was fascinating earlier. He was saying, as much as all of us could hear, he wants somebody else to be the nominee. He's name-dropping other people that he wants to be the nominee, but he wouldn't say it's time to move on for Trump. ASHLEY ETIENNE: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BRENDAN BUCK: Because they can't do that. Because you're going to lose base Republican voters. We have an example of this in the Senate race. Joe O'Dea, who is running in Colorado, was running a really great race, everybody thought, and he was doing it a little different than usual. He was saying, I'm not a Trump Republican. An was trying to say, like, I'm, you know, appealing to a middle. He pissed off Donald Trump. Donald Trump attacked him and he lost significantly because Trump voters ran away from him. MARGARET BRENNAN: A Trump adviser I asked who -- because they are planning this announcement on Tuesday for the former president to announce his candidacy. I asked about, don't you need to show unity with the party since you have this Senate race in Georgia? And the answer was, it's unity with the base that we are showing. So, is he forcing a question? JOEL PAYNE: I just think that's a mistake. And also like -- look, I love all this, you know, deep introspection of the Republican Party but I do think you should think about Democrats here, particularly President Biden. So, you know, talking to folks who are pretty familiar with the president's thinking -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you're saying they didn't lose, you won. JOEL PAYNE: That's what I'm saying. If you talk to people who are familiar with the president's thinking they will -- MARGARET BRENNAN: You're bringing that curve, though, you know that. JOEL PAYNE: I am. They will tell you that the Biden coalition is pretty durable. It showed up, obviously, in 2020. It looks like it showed up mostly here, college educated, young voters, Latinos, particularly in some of those areas where we thought they wouldn't show up, African Americans, independents being competitive with them. That coalition showed up in '20, showed up in '22 and I think they think it could show up in '24. Also, candidate quality matters. Some of the folks that you referenced, those are some of your better Republican candidates. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. JOEL PAYNE: The reason why Republicans struggled, I would say, is because the candidate quality imbalance was way in the favor of Democrats. MARGARET BRENNAN: Most of those candidates endorsed by the former president. LESLIE SANCHEZ: And it looked -- I was going to say, on the fundamentals, people would say that the Trump coalition very much, to this point, is going to show up, that it is very strong. What I'm saying is different. 2016 it was refreshing to have someone elect Donald Trump and now it is more like fatigue post-pandemic. And these are their words, not mine. That's why I think the cautionary wind is not (ph) Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: But pick up, would you, on what Joel was talking about with Hispanic voters because I know you've been looking at this very carefully in Texas and you think Democrats shouldn't bank on that. LESLIE SANCHEZ: Absolutely not because what we saw is there is a transformation that's happening with working class Latino families. They're not necessarily on the education line but on the income line. If they're moving out to those exerbs (ph), those suburban areas, those rural areas, in red precincts, they are breaking the way of Republicans increasingly. Married families, very traditional in that sense that feel they're not -- they may still self-identify as a Democrat but they feel the party has left them. That's an opportunity and Republicans closed that gap by 50 percent this last cycle. JOEL PAYNE: I agree with that. Republicans do have an opportunity there. And I think, by the way, both sides would be -- they would be wise to not overcorrect to either of their kind of far bases. I think there is a -- an agenda, the Biden agenda, that works, that's proven to work. I think you'll see a lot of Democrats who are maybe late adopters who will be a little bit more eager to jump on that Biden agenda. And I actually think there's probably a muted Biden coalition out there that doesn't get represented in the public opinion polling, in a lot of the public discussion that, again, I think it does show up pretty reliably. ASHLEY ETIENNE: But, Joel, let's talk about what actually did work for the Republicans. Tom Cotton mentioned Kemp and DeSantis. Both of those two candidates and governors ran away from Trump and ran away from the MAGA movement. So as - so I love that we're having this debate - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ASHLEY ETIENNE: But it seems divorce of the reality that there was not a wave and that there doesn't need to be some corrections on the part of the - of the Republicans in that the playbook has been laid out. And I think DeSantis and Kemp have laid it out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ashley, let me ask you about 2024, the Democrats' playbook. ASHLEY ETIENNE: Yes. It feels good. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Harris was out there talking a lot about reproductive health. ASHLEY ETIENNE: Yes, I think - MARGARET BRENNAN: Health. Did she deserve any credit for this? Because we don't talk about her much in the realm of 2024. ASHLEY ETIENNE: Yes, she actually - I mean, well, a, I will start by saying, I expect that the president will run in 2024 and I think he should. I mean he's got an incredible record. He's defied all expectation, all odds. You know, he's probably the most underestimated politician in recent history. But in terms of the vice president, she did yeoman's work in -- I think the number's like 36 states, talking about abortion and women's rights and reproductive rights and democracy. So, she had a really big impact on the ground that doesn't really bubble up to Washington, but really drove people out and drove local -- local stories and, you know, energy on the ground. So, I just expect the president will run, and he should. MARGARET BRENNAN: With the vice president on the ticket? ASHLEY ETIENNE: Oh, absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE). ASHLEY ETIENNE: Yes, of course. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just have to ask. We're talking a lot about 2024 since it starts really right now, frankly. ASHLEY ETIENNE: Definitely. MARGARET BRENNAN: It gets underway. Just, very quickly, before we go, Joel, closing thought from you on what clinched it in Pennsylvania. JOEL PAYNE: Well, what clinched it in Pennsylvania looks like was abortion. If you look at the exit polling, abortion outperformed inflation. Doesn't mean inflation is not important but it does mean that Democrats, as Anthony referred to earlier in the show, did hit a chord with abortion that really resonated with voters. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, good to have all of you here in person no talk. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: In these challenging times, we pause to reflect and thank those in the military for their service and sacrifice as we do each November. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): At the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918, fighting in World War I stopped. The war to end all wars did not prevent a global one 20 years later. Again, and again, and again, American service men and women have continued to sacrifice. Defending against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Today, less than 10 percent of American adults are military veterans, according to the VA. Just 1 percent of adults serve on active duty. That makes it hard for most to relate to combat survivors battling traumatic stress. Retired Army Colonel Chris Colenda (ph), who served four combat tours in Afghanistan, told me that he has lost more of his unit to suicide and substance abuse than he did to enemy fire. MARGARET BRENNAN (on camera): How should people ask veterans about their service? CHRIS COLENDA (Retired Army Colonel): Tell me about your service. What was the best experience you ever had? What was the most awesome thing about your service? I mean, those sort of very safe questions, very positive questions, are just easy ones that get people talking. MARGARET BRENNAN: Simply trying to understand is one way to honor the dead and serve the living. (END VIDEOTAPE) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

And today on Face the Nation: As Americans pause to reflect this Christmas and Hanukkah Sunday, we will too. What happened in 2022 is not likely to stay in 2022, as the biggest stories from the past year are poised to be front and center in 2023. We will look to the new year in our annual correspondents roundtable, a 72-years CBS News tradition. Our Washington beat reporters will weigh in on what's ahead, with the news, the policies and the politics they're expecting in the year ahead. Plus, what lessons were learned from the January 6 Capitol attack investigation, and what impact will they have in 2023 and beyond? We will talk with one of the top House committee investigators, Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We wish you a merry Christmas and happy Hanukkah. Thank you for joining us this holiday Sunday. The clock is still ticking on the final days of 2022, but there's a lot that's going to carry over to 2023. Today, we want to take a look at some of those stories. We're joined now by Maryland Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the committee investigating the January 6 attack. Good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN (D-Maryland): Hello, Margaret. Pleased to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is an incredible body of work, all coming to this conclusion now. What do you think Americans at home need to know? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: It's a story of some real villainy and some real danger to democracy, but also of real heroism and commitment to American democratic freedom. And with democracy under attack all over the world, like with Putin invading Ukraine and the Ukrainian people standing up for their democratic freedom, and tyrants and autocrats on the march everywhere, it's good to know that we have a strong, resurgent democratic spirit in America. MARGARET BRENNAN: The institutions held. But, at the conclusion of this, because you've spent almost two years investigating, what happens next for you? Are there pieces of this that, in the new Congress, even under Republican control, need to be further investigated or somehow legislated around? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, when you say the institutions held, they did hold just barely. The truth is that we need to continually be renovating and improving our institutions. MARGARET BRENNAN: How so? What do you mean? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, I think that the Electoral College now, which has given us five popular vote losers as president in our history, twice in this century alone, has become a danger, not just to democracy, but to the American people. It was a danger on January 6. There are so many curving byways and nooks and crannies in the Electoral College, that there are opportunities for a lot of strategic mischief. We should elect the president the way we elect governors, senators, mayors, representatives, everybody else: Whoever gets the most votes wins. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you don't think that this reforming of the Electoral Count Act, which is really just making clear that the vice president's role is just ceremonial with the electors, you don't think that solves the issue? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: It doesn't solve the fundamental problem. I'm for that, and that's the very least we can do and we must do. It's necessary, but it's not remotely sufficient. You know, we spend hundreds of millions of dollars every year exporting American democracy to other countries, and the one thing they never come back to us with is the idea that: Oh, that Electoral College that you have, that's so great. We think we will adopt that too. You know, Thomas Jefferson said that he deplored the sanctimonious reverence with which some people look at the original handiwork of the framers, when they should be looking to their own experience. He said, the framers were great and they were patriots, but they didn't have the benefit of the experience that we've lived. And we know that the Electoral College doesn't fit anymore, which is why I'm a big supporter of the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, where it's bubbling up from below, but there are now 15 or 16 states and the District of Columbia who've said, we're going to cast our electors for the winner of the national vote once we get 270 electors in our coalition. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's get back to the work that you have just concluded, because you did make this historic decision to refer to the Justice Department for potential prosecution a former president of the United States. It's never been done before. But, in doing so, it doesn't have the requirement that the Justice Department act. Why did you think making that referral was necessary? Why not just let your work stand on its own with the public hearings? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, because of the magnitude of the attack on democracy. You know, we don't have a formal statutory offense called crimes against democracy, but that's what everything was together. And then there were hundreds of actual statutory offenses under that. And we identified four. There was a deliberate attempt by Donald Trump to interfere and obstruct and impede a federal proceeding. That was the whole plan, 'stop the steal,' meaning go in there and blockade the House and the Senate and the vice president from doing their job. It was an attempt to defraud the United States. There was a conspiracy to defraud the United States to exchange an honest-to-goodness presidential election for a counterfeit election, complete with fake electors, and forcible violence being used to overthrow the process. It involved the introduction of false statements, these fake electors that were put in. And, finally, there was aiding and abetting an insurrection, giving aid and comfort to insurrectionists. That's an old crime in America. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Our Constitution repeatedly opposes insurrection and condemns it. And, of course, we thought we had solved that problem in the Civil War. But that statute that we referred to there was passed after the Civil War to make sure that people who incite insurrection and aid and abet it and give aid and comfort to the insurrectionists by saying things like, I love you, you're very special, that those people are guilty of an offense against the United States, even if you're president when you do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't you fear, in some ways, because this referral you're making doesn't have the weight of prosecution behind it -- that has to be up to the Justice Department to decide to move forward. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: And that's a good thing too. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you fear that, because it is a political body making this recommendation, that it makes it easier for people to brush away some of what you just laid out, that it makes it easier to characterize it or dismiss it as political in nature? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Look, in a democracy, the people have the right to the truth. And so our bipartisan panel, with overwhelmingly Republican witnesses coming to testify, has laid out the truth, the best that we could find it. It's not been contradicted or undermined in any way that I'm aware of. And we're turning it over to the people and we're turning it over to the Department of Justice. And, at that point, your point is correct. It's up to them. And it should operate like that. Congress doesn't prosecute, but, like everybody else, if we're aware of offenses, we've got to turn that evidence over to people who are prosecutors. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're in that process now of sharing with the Justice Department some of what you found. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: The Department of Justice has a far vaster panoply of investigative resources available to them than we do. MARGARET BRENNAN: And a higher benchmark they have to meet to actually move ahead and prosecute. So, you know, one of the things I have heard people often parse the language, coup, attempted coup. And the -- those skeptics that you referred to earlier would argue that, to substantiate a coup, you'd need to actually prove that the president was cooking up this plan, directing people to do things, and that he had the support of the military in there, whereas some of what has been laid out, it's kind of this unwieldy, muddy plan. How do you actually assert that it was almost democracy that was lost at that moment? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Well, in our report, we lay out every element of the plan, including going to the legislatures to try to get them to nullify the popular vote and pass new statutes that would just appoint Trump's electors. That failed. We lay out his plan of going to election officials like Raffensperger in Georgia, but he wasn't the only one \u2014 there were more than a dozen cases like that \u2014 and trying to get them just to concoct votes: \"Just find me 11,780 votes.\" That wasn't Donald Trump trying to stop election fraud. That was Donald Trump trying to commit election fraud and a conspiracy to perpetrate it right there. So, we lay it out. It's not muddy at all. It's very clear. This is really about the future, because the political scientists and historians tell us that the best sign of a successful coup coming is a recently failed coup, where the coup plotters get to diagram the weaknesses in the existing structure. And they're emboldened if they're not held accountable for what they did. I know Mike Pence said that it would be divisive for the government to prosecute the case. That's not the test for whether or not prosecutors prosecute a case. The test is whether there was a crime committed. It's the facts and the law. I mean, you could just as well say it will be divisive not to hold a president accountable who's guilty for offenses. But, in any event, it's not part of the calculus. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to follow up on what you've just said, which is sort of a dress rehearsal for a coup. Congress is putting millions of dollars towards bolstering security for members of the House, for members of the Senate when they are home, and for those who were involved in the prosecution of those who carried out January 6. Are you fearful of your own security? I mean, what does it say about where we are now, this far after January 6? REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: There's very dangerous rhetoric going on out there that's a real break from everything we've known in our lifetimes. What it means to live in a democracy with basic civic respect is that people can disagree without resorting to violence. But the Internet has played a negative role, especially for the right wing, the extreme right, which now engages in very dangerous, hyperbolic rhetoric that exposes people to danger. But democracy also requires courage. I'm so impressed by the elected officials around the country who have stood up against all of the threats and all of the intimidation. And those people don't get enough credit. MARGARET BRENNAN: We agree. Congressman, thank you for your time. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a quick break and be right back. Stay with us.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our annual CBS News correspondents roundtable. Joining us this year, chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford, national security correspondent David Martin, chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes, plus senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge, and chief national affairs and justice correspondent Jeff Pegues. Good morning to all of you. (CROSSTALK) DAVID MARTIN: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's so good to have you here on the holiday. David, I want to start with you, because, at this point last year, the world was watching Vladimir Putin build up his military forces around Ukraine and wondering what he was going to do next. And then he did the unthinkable. What is happening on the ground? How is the cold affecting the combat now? DAVID MARTIN: Right now, the fighting has died down, except in the center. But the important thing on the battlefield is whether, when the ground freezes solid, Ukraine can take back enough territory or Russia lose enough territory, so that both sides conclude, this is the best we can do and start negotiating. Whether that happens remains to be seen. You know, it sounds counterintuitive, but the Ukrainians have not yet demonstrated the ability to conduct offensive operations. All these Russian retreats are cases in which the Russians outrun their supply lines, bog down, pull back, and then the Ukrainians rush in. Whether Ukraine can now, with American weapons, dislodge them over these winter months remains to be seen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's no sign that Vladimir Putin is interested in negotiating, according to the CIA, according to the State Department, at this point. DAVID MARTIN: No sign that he's even given up on his original war aim, which, as improbable as it seems now, is to take all of Ukraine west of the Carpathian Mountains. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's hard to overstate what a massive impact this invasion had on the world. And, Nancy, it certainly pushed to the front burner for President Biden rebuilding the European alliance and really funding Ukraine to continue putting up this fight. It's been $68 billion worth of U.S. aid to date. They're asking Congress for another $35 billion. How confident is the White House that they can sustain this kind of support? NANCY CORDES: Well, it's very difficult for them to make any headway with Kevin McCarthy right now. What he has said is, Congress is not going to write a blank check on Ukraine or anything else, that they want to see what the money is going to be used for. And there are some Republicans who have gone farther than that and have said, we've got a lot of priorities in the world. It's not just Ukraine. And they feel that there's been more than enough money that has gone towards Ukraine already. DAVID MARTIN: And that's what Putin is counting on, that donor fatigue and partisan politics undermine this consensus of supporting Ukraine with, as the words go, whatever it takes for as long as it takes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is what President Biden has vowed. Jan, the unexpected can really disrupt all political plans. You correctly predicted that Roe vs. Wade would be overturned in 2022. And you did that on this panel. It was still a shock for the country, though. JAN CRAWFORD: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what's ahead for the court in 2023? What do you need to warn us about, in terms of impact? JAN CRAWFORD: Well, I think that, you know, last term, we got a pretty clear picture of what the Supreme Court is: six justices, largely six conservative justices willing to look at all swathes of the law, including abortion rights, gun rights, religion. We saw them of course, overturn Roe vs. Wade, expand gun rights, expand religious expression. And, normally, when you cover the court, they'll have a big term, and then they kind of have a quiet term. But that's not the case with the Supreme Court this year. They've got several cases that stand to be very controversial, including affirmative action. I expect\u2014 and I guess I can just say my prediction now. I mean, I expect this court to overturn the use of affirmative action in college admissions. That, I think, will have a significant impact on the political discourse that we saw last year with women's rights. There's a case that gay rights groups are very interested in this year. That one, I think, is a tougher call for the court. But you're seeing a court that is set on a solidly conservative path. How is that affecting the political process? This is the court we have. It's not going to change for years. And how does that affect the political process? That means, if you want something done, and are looking to effect change, and you're liberal, the Supreme Court is not going to be your best outlet. You're going to look to the political process. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have to legislate. JAN CRAWFORD: You're going to have to look to your state legislatures. You're going to have to look to Congress. And that, I think, is the message of this court. They're withdrawing from these social issues and saying, go take it up with your legislatures. NANCY CORDES: Student loan forgiveness hanging in the balance as well. JAN CRAWFORD: In February, they just added that case. That, I think, is a hard case, and one that this Court may agree with some of the lower courts and say that the White House went too far. MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty-six million Americans have been more or less promised forgiveness by the Biden administration. JAN CRAWFORD: The question is, does he have the authority to do that? MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. JAN CRAWFORD: And promises can be empty if they're not grounded in proper authority. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a cost politically to making a promise you can't deliver on? NANCY CORDES: Sure. I mean this is something that was cheered by the left, had been pushed by\u2014 certainly by progressives for a long time. Republicans were outraged. They said he didn't have the authority. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff and Catherine, I want to get to you both, because this is a very busy beat, the Justice beat, and I think it's going to get busier. Jeff, what can you tell us about the timeline for the dual investigations being carried out by the special counsel? JEFF PEGUES: Jack Smith, the special counsel, he's been sending out a flurry of subpoenas across the country connected to this fake electors scheme, this scheme to overturn the election results. And so he's been moving fairly quickly, wouldn't you say? And he's\u2014 clearly, he has a plan in terms of how he wants to prosecute this case. Where it ends up, we don't know yet. But he's covering some ground the Department of Justice prior to his arrival hasn't covered. And so they're moving pretty swiftly in that case. We should probably take our vacations soon... (LAUGHTER) JEFF PEGUES: ... because I feel like, after the new year, we're going to have to start running even faster. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does it run right into the 2024 presidential race? JEFF PEGUES: I don't think so. Do you? CATHERINE HERRIDGE: I think it wraps up before then. Former senior Justice Department officials I have been speaking to, when they look at this broad array of investigations, they believe that, if criminal charges are brought, they see the Mar-a-Lago case as one of the more likely options, because it's a more discrete set of facts that's easier to wrangle, for lack of a better legal term. January 6 is a more challenging case, they say, because so many of the actions were taken while he was the top executive within the U.S. government. So, there are all these questions of privilege. My question is, if there is a Mar-a-Lago prosecution, how does that go with the public sentiment? I mean, it's\u2014 it's a records case, right? And is that going to have the same impact as a January 6 prosecution, especially when you're seeing people who are looking at multiyear prison sentences who say they went to Capitol Hill if not but for the direction of that president? MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. Jan, as lawyer do you want to weigh in? (LAUGHTER) JAN CRAWFORD: I mean, I think that analysis is exactly right, and also how the\u2014 it might land with the public. So, I\u2014 kudos, Catherine. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: Well, I feel very... JAN CRAWFORD: Yes. (LAUGHTER) CATHERINE HERRIDGE: Thank you. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we won't even get into the political part of it, but you rightly point out that that's also got to be a factor here. I do want to go to the other case that I know you've been tracking, Catherine, and that is the one before the U.S. attorney in Delaware regarding the president's son Hunter Biden. This case has been under way since 2018. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: When will it wrap up? CATHERINE HERRIDGE: Boy, I guess I would start by saying that that's just been the big looming question for several months now. We see upticks in activity. We think there's going to be movement on that case, and then it sort of recedes into the background again. My question is, when you look at the big picture of foreign money here \u2014 and we see this with Republicans and Democrats \u2014 what was it all about at the end of the day? Was it about trying to enrich a family by influence or access? If -- if that is not the case here, as the White House says, then it should be put to rest. That's the big question. What will the U.S. attorney in Delaware do? Now that a special counsel was appointed in the Trump investigation... MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: ... I think there's generally a feeling that there's more pressure for the appointment of a special counsel or some kind of adjudication of the case. Will there be an indictment or no indictment? MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and, Nancy, the White House would point out that the U.S. attorney in Delaware was a Trump appointee... NANCY CORDES: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... and that it will ultimately, though, still go to Attorney General Merrick Garland. NANCY CORDES: Mm-hmm. MARGARET BRENNAN: How is this factoring in at all to the thinking at the White House? As we know, the president is making a decision about whether to run for reelection. He's talking about it over the holidays, as he said. You can't say that his own son and what happens next isn't part of some conversation here. NANCY CORDES: Sure, although he knew that his son would be a likely target, even before he ran the first time. So you could argue that that was sort of baked into the equation. I think they're preparing not just for that, but also for the likelihood that congressional Republicans are going to start investigating that laptop and every action... MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's a certainty, isn't it? NANCY CORDES: ... that Hunter\u2014 that Hunter Biden has ever done once they take control. And the White House is beefing up their Counsel's Office for that very reason. And their position right now is, when they think that the investigation is legitimate, they'll cooperate. They clearly don't believe that the Hunter Biden investigation on Capitol Hill is legitimate. But, you know, they're going to have to respond to it in some way when it happens. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: I think one of the just sort of wild cards here, and it's a big if, but if there is an indictment of Hunter Biden, that, I would argue, would frustrate the Republican House investigations, because it would put him and his legal team in a position to say, listen, we're facing a criminal indictment. We're not really in a position to cooperate with Congress, because it creates more legal exposure. So, to me, that's always sort of in the back of my mind, because it brings a sort of certainty to the situation, a sort of resolution, in some respects. JEFF PEGUES: I wonder if there's going to be some sort of plea deal, because I just don't\u2014 the people I have talked to on this case, they\u2014 they're sort of curious about whether, at the end of the day, this is going to be something that the Biden family even wants to go away: Let's agree to a plea deal and we\u2014 and move on. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're going to move on and take a short break. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR, or we're available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. And we're replayed on our CBS News Streaming Network throughout the day Sundays. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back with our CBS News year-end roundtable. And I will start with you, Jeff. Is\u2014 drug issues, fentanyl, crime, this is a continued story since 2020. When do we see improvement in some of these issues? JEFF PEGUES: It's going to be a while. It is flooding the country, no matter where you go. I have been out to Colorado, I have talked to families there who've lost loved ones. It's almost as if the American public doesn't get how deadly and potent fentanyl, this synthetic drug \u2014 they make it in a lab. They ship it in. It's hard to catch coming across the border. And it's seeping into every neighborhood in this country, no matter income, no matter where you live. It's in your neighborhood. JAN CRAWFORD: And people don't even know. They don't even know often that they're taking it. JEFF PEGUES: They don't know that they're taking it. JAN CRAWFORD: They think they're taking some kind of generic drug or something they got off TikTok or Adderall, and you're seeing kids dying. I mean, it's now at the leading cause of death in people 18 to 45. JEFF PEGUES: Yes, more than guns, more than car accidents. I mean, the statistics are incredible. And I think if we weren't talking about Trump and all these other issues, the Department of Justice, law enforcement, they would like to focus on fentanyl. That's really all they want to talk about these days, is fentanyl, because it's having such a pervasively deadly effect. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Catherine, on that, but also gun violence on just major city crime. When is there going to be an improvement? It's become such a potent political issue. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: I think it was very well said by Jeff. The thing that I feel like I keep coming back to at the end of this year is this question of radicalization and domestic violent extremism. You know, 20 years ago, when 9/11 happened, there was this idea that you had to have this in-person kind of mentoring relationship to get someone to cross a threshold to violence. What we see now is that this generation that's grown up with the technology can cross that threshold in a virtual world. So what we're seeing now with domestic violent extremism on both extremes is this same process that we saw with al Qaeda and ISIS after 9/11, but now it's here at home, and fueling these divisions and -- and the violence. And I think about things that I have heard in the past from intelligence officials who say it's so\u2014 it's so difficult to defeat the United States from the outside, but the enemy has to defeat us from within and these divisions. David Martin, what was the most undercovered story of 2022? DAVID MARTIN: Over 2022, the Chinese air force became more and more aggressive about buzzing U.S., British and Australian patrol planes that were flying around the periphery of China. And these jet fighters would pull up on the wing of the much slower patrol plane within tens of feet, and then cut in front pop flares, and dump chaff, which are these aluminum strips which are supposed to confuse radar, but can also get sucked into an aircraft engine. There is just very little margin for error there. And it goes almost completely unreported because the Pentagon is sitting on all the videotapes of these intercepts. They don't want to release them. MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a feeling you're asking for those tapes. (LAUGHTER) DAVID MARTIN: Nagging would be the right word. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nagging for them. DAVID MARTIN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that risk of miscalculation is so\u2014 is so high. One of my undercovered also is China. And that is just how difficult it is going to be for the U.S. to reverse or even lessen the amount of linkage there is technologically and financially with China. DAVID MARTIN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's going to become more and more of an issue as tension grows. The other thing I would say is North Korea, Kim Jong-un's growing nuclear capabilities. DAVID MARTIN: Well, I think it's safe to say that the American policy of negotiating away Kim Jong-un's nuclear program has reached a dead end. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DAVID MARTIN: And we're back to deterrence, threatening him that, if he ever uses a nuclear weapon, it won't be the end of his regime. JAN CRAWFORD: There hasn't been a year-end roundtable without David scaring us all. (LAUGHTER) DAVID MARTIN: Just to get that good feeling back. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Jan, what is most undercovered but should have been covered? JAN CRAWFORD: You know, I think, as we emerge from the pandemic, we have really failed to deliver any kind of account of what went wrong with our COVID policies, the lockdowns, the mandates, the school closures. What difference did any of those policies make? I mean, we know the costs. We know the cost of those policies, the learning loss, the mental health crisis, the destruction of our cities that are still trying to recover, the homelessness, the addiction, tremendous costs from those policies. But what we have not done is any kind of after-review look at what an impact that they had. We got a lot wrong. And we need to look at what it was and -- and acknowledge that it was wrong. And the reason is, people's trust in public health is crumbling. That is a problem, because if we have another public health crisis, which we will, if the public doesn't believe in our public health policymakers, that is bad for America. MARGARET BRENNAN: Catherine, I'm going to go to you on that, because I think you have a similar idea in terms of what's undercovered. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: Yes. I think there are two components for me with COVID. One is COVID origins. You just have to look at the data, 6.5 million COVID deaths, of that, a million in this country and more than 600 million infections. And we still don't know whether it was this zoonotic link, so it spilled over from nature, or whether there's a link to the lab in Wuhan. I think most important... MARGARET BRENNAN: And an accident there. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: Correct. Right. So, most important to me, though \u2014 and I speak as someone, for full transparency, who has a child who needs special education. He had a transplant. He was developmentally delayed. The policies for special education children with COVID have just been crushing. You look at the levels of literacy, math, and you look at middle school, high school, and they slid back to elementary school. And our family is fortunate to have that ability to use resources to get our son to a full-time special education school now, but so many of the children that he was in the public system with don't have those resources. And I really believe children are resilient. But I have come out of these two years questioning whether these children have the access to the tools that their families also need to help bridge that gap. And I really question the course it's set them on in the future. I did some research, and when you look at rates of incarceration, there are incredibly high rates of adults who have learning disabilities or had special education needs. So, I think understanding what happened to those children and how we can do more to support them to try and close that gap is something that's been extremely underreported. And I agree with Jan. MARGARET BRENNAN: And none of those things are on the to do-list in terms of congressional investigations. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: They are not. MARGARET BRENNAN: No. JAN CRAWFORD: And if we don't learn from the mistakes of our policymakers, then we're going to repeat them. And that erodes public confidence in our public health system. MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC is saying it's doing self-analysis, but people like Dr. Gottlieb would say they need Congress telling them what... JAN CRAWFORD: And we need to be, as the media... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. JAN CRAWFORD: ... asking those hard questions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff, and then Nancy, what do you think are the most underreported? JEFF PEGUES: People feel unsafe in their neighborhoods. And the Police Executive Research Forum, which is a policing think-tank led by a guy named Chuck Wexler, it said that police post-George Floyd, the training is the same. You'll recall that, post-George Floyd, there were a lot of people who said \u2014 who said, you know, we have to train police better. What hasn't changed, according to this research, is that police training is still done on the cheap and quickly. You know, these young aspiring police officers are coming on to the force. They're facing more challenges on the streets than ever before. And yet the training, according to this Police Executive Research Forum, is lacking. I think that's an important story, especially given what police officers are facing day to day on the streets, and what the community needs right now amid these spikes in crime. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nancy, your underreported? NANCY CORDES: Well, I think we've done an amazing job covering the war in Ukraine itself, but I think one of the things that's been very undercovered is one of the tragic after-effects of that ongoing war, which is growing food insecurities, especially in Africa, where they are facing possibly the worst food crisis in recorded history. You know, part of it has to do with the war in Ukraine and the reduction in grain and other crops coming from Ukraine and Russia. But it also has to do with the pandemic and the fact that a lot of aid dried up, because countries had to redirect that aid, particularly European countries that are now dealing with an energy crisis as a result of the war in Ukraine, and then climate change, which has had an incredibly destabilizing effect, particularly in Africa. They've missed four consecutive rainy seasons there. You've got 500,000 kids who are facing the prospect of famine in Somalia alone. This month, the president committed another $2.5 billion to help with the problem in Africa at the Africa Leaders Summit here in Washington, D.C. But they're looking for way more than that, a lot of help from around the world. And it's just not clear right now whether they're going to get it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that actually transitions into where I was going to go for predictions for 2023. So I will take a point of personal privilege, because my prediction has to do with Africa and the 54 countries on that continent. The White House is going to have to choose which ones it's going to get more involved with. And some of them are run by people that have very difficult human rights records. But the White House is going to have to make some decisions here because of the green revolution, because of the reliance on special earths and ingredients for the electric vehicles and other alternative energies. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they have 70 percent of the essential items like cobalt and lithium required for electric vehicle batteries. So this is a supply chain controlled by China, coming out of countries like the DRC. And the administration is going to have to make some difficult human rights choices who they want to do business with in the course of going green. So, I'm going to watch that. But we're going to take a break and talk to you about your predictions for 2023 in just a moment. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: David, what's your 2023 prediction? DAVID MARTIN: So, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Mark Milley, retires in 2023. I predict he will be replaced by the chief of staff of the Air Force, General C.Q. Brown, making him the second African American, after the late Colin Powell, to become the highest ranking military officer. And the current commander of Transportation Command, General Jacqueline Van Ovost, will become the next chief of staff of the Air Force, making her the first woman to ever sit on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. You can grade that later. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: David, I usually take what you say to the bank. DAVID MARTIN: Just do it on a curve. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Jan? JAN CRAWFORD: I don't think we have any retirements from the Supreme Court. That is not big news, right? No one thinks they're going to retire. But I see this Supreme Court staying intact not only through the end of President Biden's first term, but, if he were to be reelected, I do not think he gets another Supreme Court nomination. This court is this court. Whether it will be the court that is the longest in history of nine justices to go without a change of membership, I don't know. That was 11 years. That was after Justice Breyer joined the court in 1994. But it will be this court for some time, so people can get used to some different rulings. MARGARET BRENNAN: Catherine? CATHERINE HERRIDGE: I think many Americans forget that there's still been no resolution to the 9/11 military prosecution at Guantanamo Bay. And we're entering a second year of negotiations between the military prosecutors and the attorneys for the defendants. I think this could be the year where there are plea deals in the 9/11 case for some or all of the men. So, let's just let that sink in. I think it's going to mean the death penalty is off the table, and, in return, there are guarantees that the men will have certain medical care, and that they will live out their sentences at the Guantanamo Bay prisons. That means that this goal of closing the prisons, which has been held by a couple of administrations has\u2014 has run its course. It's not going to happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff? JEFF PEGUES: Fani Willis, do you recognize that name? MARGARET BRENNAN: Georgia. JEFF PEGUES: You did. Georgia, Fulton County, the one sort of Trump-related investigation that really flies under the radar. She's a tough prosecutor. She's been subpoenaing everybody connected to this case, powerful people in Washington. But my theory is that she doesn't care about the power in Washington. She knows she has power in Georgia. And I think, my prediction is that she will bring the first charges related to President Trump. Remember, that was the call where he said, hey, Brad... MARGARET BRENNAN: Find the votes. JEFF PEGUES: ... 11,780. It's evidence on tape. Anybody else who said something like that would be in big trouble. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nancy? NANCY CORDES: I predict that sometime in the first few months of 2023, President Biden will announce his bid for reelection. To me, it's not much of a mystery. This is what he has wanted to do his entire adult life for the last 50 years is to be president of the United States. He feels good about what he's accomplished. in his first two years. And I think it would take something very serious to cause him to change his mind about running again. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to go to good news from 2022. I will start. David, NATO is not brain-dead. And the French president, Emmanuel Macron, once called it that. DAVID MARTIN: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the lesson from 2022 was that it's not. That's mine. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: That was my good news, good news for the West. (CROSSTALK) DAVID MARTIN: Good news for us, bad news for Putin. My good news is much more limited, retired Army Major John Duffy, who received a long overdue Medal of Honor, for leading \u2014 and being the only American adviser leading a South Vietnamese battalion against an entire North Vietnamese division. He went in with 471 troops. He came out with 37. MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow. DAVID MARTIN: He did four combat tours in Vietnam. So he's obviously a remarkable warrior. But he also turns out to be a remarkable poet. And he wrote a poem about that battle which is the single best account of combat I\u2014 I have ever read. So, I know we don't do poetry readings on \"Face the Nation.\" (LAUGHTER) DAVID MARTIN: But just\u2014 just let me give you a couple lines. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. DAVID MARTIN: \"The battle raged back and forth, the dying, wounded moaning softly. Despair and hurt are common. Is this glory?\" We're lucky to have people who can fight like that and write like that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well said, David. Jan? JAN CRAWFORD: You know, I \u2014 that's hard to follow that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know. It is. JAN CRAWFORD: But I'm going to follow it with a story of perseverance, inspiration, courage, and believing in yourself. And these are stories that we see in the world of sports. I think sports plays a valuable role in kind of bringing us together and emphasizing our common bonds. And one of the best stories in 2022 is Hansel Emmanuel, who is a young man who lost an arm and an accident when he was a child, had it amputated, but never gave up on his dream of being a basketball star. He moved to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic, led his Florida high school to the state championship game, got a college scholarship to play basketball in college, and, earlier this month, scored his first points in a college basketball game with one of his signature, thunderous dunks with his one remaining arm. And it is to me a reminder that, if you believe in yourself, keep working, never give up, that you can do great things. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's also an incredible story, Jan. Thank you. Your good news, Catherine? CATHERINE HERRIDGE: Well, to sort of follow up on what David said, I have really had the honor of meeting a lot of service members this year who work in the shadows and do very high-risk work, with no expectation of public acknowledgement, no expectation of medals, or even promotion. And I think that they just embody what is so great about this country. We have a phrase in our house, which is that these people really come from a different shelf of the library than the rest of us. And thank goodness for that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff? JEFF PEGUES: It's so hard on my beat to find a good news story sometimes. But, all right, so I went to Ohio. I was taken to a cigar shop by \u2014 it's Mason, Ohio, by the way \u2014 by this businessman, friend of mine happens to be African American. So I went, waiting for my flight. We sat down outside. And these two guys \u2014 we were dressed in suits. They were dressed in overalls. And they walked by and said: \"Hey, how you doing?\" And I said, \"Wow, oh, OK,\" because I'm not used to, in D.C., a stranger just kind of \u2014 it was like, whoa. I asked my friend: \"What was that?\" And there were two farmers. And he said: \"That's the way it is around here. It doesn't matter who you are, where you're from. We just \u2014 they'll stop and sit.\" And they did stop and sit. We were talking about politics. We were talking about the state of the country. And how great this country is. Then it turned, because he started about \u2014 talking about COVID and how he lost his wife. MARGARET BRENNAN: Oh. JEFF PEGUES: It was really incredible the conversation that these strangers from different worlds had. And, as I was asked this question, what kind of positive can you bring to the table, to me, that is America, where you have all these people with different point of views come together, not fighting, smoking cigars, chatting on a beautiful day, and getting up walking away and saying: Hey, take care. Nice talking to you. MARGARET BRENNAN: A human connection. Nancy? NANCY CORDES: My good news is related. And it's not really on my beat either, but I say this more as a mom. I think that this was the year that life got back to normal or close to it. You know, at this time last year, Omicron was just emerging. In January of 2022, there were a million cases of COVID every day. Now we're down to about 150,000 a day, which isn't great, but it's better. And, you know, we're able to gather inside. We're able to travel much more easily. You know, it's not exactly life as we knew it before the pandemic, but it feels more normal for us and, most importantly, for our kids. So, that's my good news. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you all for joining us and sharing your insights. And thanks to all of you. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the many surprises we were witness to here in Washington in 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's whirlwind trip to the nation's capital last week. His story will definitely continue into the new year. MARGARET BRENNAN (voice-over): This lightning-fast Washington trip, his first foreign visit since Russia's full-scale invasion, it was less perilous than the front lines, but no less important. The U.S. has given the lion's share of Western military support. But as that price tag now nears $100 billion, a number of lawmakers have voiced skepticism. Zelenskyy shared his gratitude. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (Ukrainian President): I thank every American family which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to other people. MARGARET BRENNAN: There was no holiday cease-fire. Ukrainians kept up their fierce resistance, celebrating in subway shelters, decorating makeshift Christmas trees and finding innovative ways to light them amid a near-nationwide blackout. (MAYOR VITALI KLITSCHKO SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) MARGARET BRENNAN: Kyiv's mayor said lighting the tallest menorah in Europe shows that light always wins, not might. That resilience has inspired the world and led many Americans to see themselves in the civilians caught in the crossfire of a conflict they did not choose. Whether that continues is up to us. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. All of us here at Face the Nation want to wish you and your family a very happy holidays. Until next week, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

Joining us this year: Chief Legal Correspondent Jan Crawford, National Security Correspondent David Martin, Chief White House Correspondent Nancy Cordes, plus Senior Investigative Correspondent Catherine Herridge, and Chief National Affairs and Justice Correspondent Jeff Pegues. Good morning to all of you. It's so good to have you here on the holiday. David, I want to start with you, because at this point, last year, the world was watching Vladimir Putin build up his military forces around Ukraine and wondering what he was going to do next. And then he did the unthinkable. What is happening on the ground? How is the cold affecting the combat now? DAVID MARTIN: Right now the fighting has died down except in the center, where the Russians are still making a major push to take this town called Bakhmut. But the important thing on the battlefield is whether when the ground freezes solid, Ukraine can take back enough territory, or Russia lose enough territory, so that both sides conclude, this is the best we can do and start negotiating. Whether that happens, remains to be seen. You know, we\u2014 it sounds counterintuitive, but the Ukrainians have not yet demonstrated the ability to conduct offensive operations. All these Russian retreats are cases in which the Russians outrun their supply lines, bog down, pull back, and then the Ukrainians rush in. But every time the Russians are shortening their lines and digging in behind reinforcements, whether Ukraine can now with American weapons, dislodge them over these winter months, remains to be seen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's no sign that Vladimir Putin is interested in negotiating, according to the CIA, according to the State Department at this point. DAVID MARTIN: No sign that he's even given up on his original war aim, which, as improbable as it seems now, is to take all of Ukraine, west to the Carpathian Mountains. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's hard to overstate what a massive impact this invasion had on the world. And Nancy, it certainly pushed to the front burner for President Biden, rebuilding the European alliance and really funding Ukraine to continue putting up this fight. It's been $68 billion worth of U.S. aid to date. They're asking Congress for another $35 billion. How confident is the White House that they can sustain this kind of support? Nancy Cordes: Well, it's very difficult for them to make any headway with Kevin McCarthy right now, the man who we assume will be Speaker of the House come January, he's in a tough spot. He's trying to keep his conference together. You know, he can't make any moves that look like a concession or meeting in the middle right now. Instead, what he has said is, Congress is not going to write a blank check on Ukraine or anything else. They want to see what the money is going to be used for, and there are some Republicans who have gone farther than that. And they've said, you know, we've got a lot of priorities in the world. It's not just Ukraine. And they feel that there's been more than enough money that has gone towards Ukraine already. So this is going to be a conversation, it's going to be an argument that consumes the White House and Congress in the beginning of 2023, as they try to figure out this new balancing act, this new relationship for this White House after controlling the White House, the House and the Senate for the last few years. And that's DAVID MARTIN: And that's what Putin is counting on that donor fatigue and partisan politics, undermine this consensus of supporting Ukraine with, as the words go, whatever it takes for as long as it takes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is what President Biden has vowed. Jan, the unexpected, can really disrupt all political plans. You correctly predicted that Roe vs. Wade would be overturned in 2022. And you did that on this panel. It was still a shock for the country, though. Right. So what's ahead for the court in 2023? What do you need to warn us about in terms of impact? JAN CRAWFORD: Well, I think that you know, last term, we got a pretty clear picture of what the Supreme Court is: six justices, largely six conservative justices willing to look at all swaths of the law, including abortion rights, gun rights, religion. We saw them of course, overturn\u00a0Roe vs. Wade, expand gun rights, expand religious expression. And normally when you cover the court, they'll have a big term, and then they kind of have a quiet term. That's not the case with the Supreme Court this year. They've got several cases that stand to be very controversial, including affirmative action. I expect, and I guess I can just say my prediction now, I mean, I expect this Court to overturn the use of affirmative action in college admissions. That I think will have a significant impact on the political discourse that we saw last year with women's rights. There's a case that gay rights groups are very interested in this year. That one, I think, is a tougher call for the court. But you're seeing a court that is set on a solidly conservative path. How is that affecting the political process? This is the court we have, it's not going to change for years. And how does that affect the political process, that means if you want something done, and are looking to to affect change, and you're liberal, the Supreme Court is not going to be your best outlet, you're going to look to the political process. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have to legislate.\u00a0 JAN CRAWFORD: you're gonna have to look to your state legislatures, you're going to have to look to Congress. And that, I think, is the message of this court. They're withdrawing from the social issues and saying, go take it up with your legislatures. NANCY CORDES: And student loan forgiveness hanging in the balance as well. JAN CRAWFORD: In February, they just added that case. That I think is a hard case. And when one that this Court may agree with some of the lower courts and say that the White House went too far. MARGARET BRENNAN: 26 million Americans have been more or less promised forgiveness by the Biden administration. The JAN CRAWFORD: The question is, does he have the authority to do that? MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.\u00a0 JAN CRAWFORD: And promises can be empty if they're not grounded in proper authority? MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a cost politically to making a promise you can't deliver on? NANCY CORDES: Sure. I mean, you know, this is something that was cheered by the left, had been pushed by, certainly by progressives for a long time. Republicans were outraged. They said he didn't have the authority. They said the U.S. didn't have the money to be forgiving these loans. And certainly the people who got them were what got the forgiveness, were thrilled. But I think everyone realizes that this is a tenuous situation right now. And that we really won't know for a couple of months, whether they're gonna see that money back or not. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff and Catherine, I want to get to you both, because this is a very busy beat, the Justice beat, and I think it's gonna get busier. Jeff, what can you tell us about the timeline for the dual investigations being carried out by the Special Counsel?\u00a0 JEFF PEGUES: Is it just dual investigations, you sort of\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well you tell us. JEFF PEGUES: Because there's so many things going on at the same time. But John, Jack Smith is what I like to call him, Jack Smith is a special counsel, he's been sending out a flurry of subpoenas across the country, connected to this fake electors scheme, this scheme to overturn the election results. And so he's been moving fairly quickly, wouldn't you say? And he's, clearly he has a plan in terms of how he wants to prosecute this case where it ends up we don't know yet. But he's covering some grounds. The Department of Justice prior to his arrival hasn't covered, and so they're moving pretty swiftly in that case. Also the January 6 case, and all of this is sort of leading up to President Trump and the Mar-a-Lago case. So there is a lot hanging out there. And we\u2014 I feel like it's going to\u2014 you know, we should probably take our vacation soon, because I feel like after the new year, we're gonna have to start running even faster. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does it run right into the 2024 presidential race? JEFF PEGUES: I don't think so, do you? CATHERINE HERRIDGE: I think it wraps up before then former senior Justice Department officials I've been speaking to when they look at this broad array of investigations, they believe that if criminal charges are brought, they see the Mar-a-Lago case as one of the more likely options because it's a more discrete set of facts that's easier to wrangle, for lack of a better legal term. January 6th, is a more challenging case, they say, because so many of the actions were taken while he was the top executive within the U.S. government. So there are all these questions of privilege. My question is, if there is a Mar-a-Lago prosecution, how does that go with the public sentiment? I mean, it's\u2014 it's a records case. Right? And is that going to have the same impact as a January 6th prosecution, especially when you're seeing people who are looking at multi-year prison sentences who say they went to Capitol Hill if not but for the direction of that president? MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, as lawyer do you want to weigh in? JAN CRAWFORD: I mean, I think that analysis is exactly right. And also how the- it might land with the public. So I kudos.\u00a0 [CROSS TALK AND LAUGHTER] MARGARET BRENNAN: We won't even get into the political part of it. But you rightly point out that that's also got to be a factor here. I do want to go to the other case that I know you've been tracking Catherine and that is someone before the U.S. Attorney in Delaware regarding the president's son, Hunter Biden. This case has been underway since 2018. When will it wrap up? CATHERINE HERRIDGE: Boy, I guess I would start by saying that that's just been the big looming question for several months now. We see upticks in activity. We think there's gonna be movement on that case, and then it sort of recedes into the background again. We've done an independent forensic review of the laptop data that took several months, we went to great lengths to get what we believe is the cleanest copy of the data, a clean chain of custody, we did not get it through a third party or a political operative. And we found there was no activity after March of 2019. And that date matters because it's just a few weeks before it was dropped off at that repair shop in Delaware. The investigators told us, they saw nothing that was faked or tampered with. So we've been through the records, the videos, the photos, the voicemails, the text messages. My question is, when you look at the big picture of foreign money here, and we see this with Republicans and Democrats, what was it all about at the end of the day? Was it about trying to enrich a family by influence or access? If- if that is not the case here, as the White House says, then it should be put to rest? That's the big question. What will the U.S. Attorney in Delaware do now that a special counsel was appointed in the Trump investigation? I think there's generally a feeling that there's more pressure for the appointment of a special counsel or some kind of adjudication of the case, will there be an indictment or or no indictment? MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and Nancy, the White House would point out that the U.S. Attorney in Delaware was a Trump appointee, and that it will ultimately though still go to Attorney General Merrick Garland. How is this factoring in at all to the thinking at the White House, as we know, the president is making a decision about whether to run for re election? He's talking about it over the holidays, as he said, You can't say that his own son, and what happens next isn't part of some conversation here. NANCY CORDES: Sure, although he knew that his son would be a likely target, even before he ran the first time. So you could argue that that was sort of baked into the equation. I think they're preparing not just for that, but also for the likelihood that congressional Republicans are going to start investigating that laptop\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that's a certainty isn't it. NANCY CORDES: and that Hunter that\u2014 Hunter Biden has ever done. Once they take control. And the White House is beefing up their Counsel's Office for that very reason. They know they're going to be hit with a deluge of subpoenas and requests for- for-for interviews and the like. And their position right now is when they think that the investigation is legitimate, they'll cooperate. They clearly don't believe that the Hunter Biden investigation on Capitol Hill is legitimate. But you know, they're going to have to respond to it in some way when it happens. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: I think one of the sort of wildcards here, and it's a big if but if there is an indictment of Hunter Biden, that I would argue, would frustrate the Republican House investigations because it would put him and his legal team in a position to say, listen, we're facing a criminal indictment, we're not really in a position to cooperate with Congress because it creates more legal exposure. So to me, that's always sort of in the back of my mind, because it brings a sort of certainty to the situation, sort of resolution in some respects. JEFF PEGUES: I wonder though\u2014 I wonder if there's going to be some sort of plea deal, because I just don't, the people I've talked to on this case, they-they're sort of curious about whether at the end of the day, this is going to be something that, you know, the Biden family even wants to go away. Let's agree to a plea deal and move on. MARGARET BRENNAN: David, I want to come back to you. China, Taiwan, very much a growing issue of concern for the administration, the Secretary of State will be making his first visit to Beijing in the new year, trying to cool off rising tensions. What are you hearing in terms of the level of concern of an actual clash between two great powers? DAVID MARTIN: Well, if you're talking about China invading Taiwan, I think the U.S. military puts that, still a pretty low probability. When you look at a map, it looks like Big Bad China could just swallow little old Taiwan and a single gulp, but it is a major military operation to get troops across the Taiwan Strait, which is about 100 miles wide. And-and then you have a mountainous island with 23 million people on your hands to deal with. And that doesn't even count the prospect that the U.S. might come to Taiwan's aid. And you just got to believe that President Xi is looking at Ukraine and saying, Whoa, what looks like a sure thing on paper doesn't necessarily turn out to be a sure thing. I know, we in the West, perhaps underestimate the-the importance of Taiwan unification in the Chinese core values, but I just do not see, the risks outweigh the- I'm sorry, the benefits outweigh the risks here. MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you say invasion, you're thinking of an actual military operation to do it. When I talk to sources, I hear stro- slow strangulation, destabilization of the government, bring it into China without actually firing a shot. DAVID MARTIN: They're doing that now. I mean they try to cut off all of their diplomatic relations, they fly these bomber flights into their air identification zone, and across the midline of the Taiwan Strait. And that wears out the Taiwanese Air Force, which has to scramble every time, and of course, China just puts in another squadron to do it again. But it's the same squadron responding each time for the Taiwanese. So they are- they are trying to slowly grind them down. And, you know, that's sort of a political decision that the people of Taiwan have to make or whether they're going to allow themselves to be ground down. MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. It's something we're gonna have to continue to keep tracking. You know, one thing I want to make sure I get to the both of you on, and I'll start with you, Jeff, is drug issues, fentanyl, crime. This is a continued story since 2020. When do we see improvement in some of these issues? JEFF PEGUES: It's gonna be a while. It's gonna be a while, in fact, I've done some reporting and Norah O'Donnell has done some reporting on fentanyl as well. She talked to the Deputy Attorney General the other day, and, you know, it's one of these issues that I think doesn't get enough attention. And it is flooding the country, no matter where you go- I've been out to Colorado, I've talked to families there who've lost loved ones. It's almost as if the American public doesn't get how deadly and potent fentanyl, this synthetic drug, they make it in a lab. They ship it in, it's hard to catch coming across the border. And it's seeping into every neighborhood in this country, no matter income, no matter where you live. It's in your neighborhood, JAN CRAWFORD: And people don't even know\u2014 they don't even know often, that they're taking it.\u00a0 JEFF PEGUES: They don't know that they're taking it. JAN CRAWFORD: They think they're taking some kind of generic drug or something they got off TikTok or, you know, Adderall, and you're seeing kids dying. I mean, it's now at the leading cause of death in people 18 to 45. JEFF PEGUES: Yeah. More than guns, more than car accidents. I mean, the statistics are incredible. And I think if we weren't talking about Trump and all these other issues, the Department of Justice, law enforcement, they would like to focus on fentanyl. That's really all they want to talk about these days is fentanyl because it's having such a pervasively deadly effect. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's Chinese ingredients and manufacturing through Mexican drug cartels that are currently in the DEA head was on this program last year warning us about this. And Catherine, on that, but also gun violence on just major city crime. When is there going to be an improvement? It's become such a potent political issue. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: I think it was very well said by Jeff, the thing that I feel like I keep coming back to at the end of this year is this question of radicalization, and domestic violent extremism. You know, 20 years ago, when 9/11 happened, there was this idea that you had to have this in person kind of mentoring relationship, to get someone to cross a threshold to violence. What we see now is that this generation that's grown up with the technology can cross that threshold in a virtual world. So what we're seeing now with domestic violent extremism on both extremes, is this same process that we saw with al Qaeda and ISIS after 9/11, but now it's here at home, and fueling these divisions and-and the violence. And I think about things that I've heard in the past from intelligence officials who say, you know, it's so impor- it's so difficult to defeat the United States from the outside, but the enemy has to defeat us from within and these divisions. So I think was very well said by Jeff, but that's kind of where I'm looking forward to in 2023. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we're going to take a break and talk to you about your predictions for 2023 in just a moment, stay with us. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back with our CBS News year-end roundtable. David Martin, I want to start with you what was the most under covered story of 2022. DAVID MARTIN: Over 2022, the Chinese Air Force became more and more aggressive about buzzing US, British and Australian patrol planes that were flying around the periphery of China. And these jet fighters would pull up on the wing of the much slower patrol plane within tens of feet. And then cut in front pop players and dump chaff, which are these aluminum strips which are supposed to confuse radar but can also get sucked into an aircraft engine. There is just very little margin for error there. And it goes almost completely unreported because the Pentagon is sitting on all the videotapes of these intercepts. They don't want to release them. MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a feeling you're asking for this.\u00a0 DAVID MARTIN: Nagging would be the right word. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nagging for them. But that risk of miscalculation is so\u2014 is so high. One of my under covered also is China. And that is just how difficult it is going to be for the U.S. to reverse or even lessen the amount of linkage there is technologically and financially with China. And it's going to become more and more of an issue as tension grows. The other thing I'd say is North Korea, Kim Jong Un's growing nuclear capabilities.\u00a0 DAVID MARTIN: Well, I think it's safe to say that the American policy of negotiating away Kim Jong Un's nuclear program  has reached a dead end.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0 DAVID MARTIN: And we're back to deterrence, threatening him that if he ever uses a nuclear weapon, it won't be the end  of his regime. MARGARET BRENNAN: But he might test one. DAVID MARTIN: Yeah JAN CRAWFORD: There hasn't been a year-end roundtable without David scaring us all. DAVID MARTIN: It's good\u2014 get that good feeling back.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So Jan, what is most under covered but should have been covered? JAN CRAWFORD: You know, I think as we emerge from the pandemic, we have really failed to deliver any kind of account of what went wrong with our COVID policies. The lock downs, the mandates, the school closures, what difference did any of those policies make? I mean we know the costs. We know the cost of those policies, the learning loss, the mental health crisis, the destruction of our cities that are still trying to recover the homelessness, the addiction. Tremendous costs from those policies. But what we have not done is- to use a military term, I guess, any kind of after review, look at what an impact that they had. Remember, we took a different approach than many other countries in the world in Europe, schools opened much more quickly after only a couple of months. Masks were not required for young children, per World Health Organization advice. Vaccine boosters are not required for young adults. In fact, they're cautious not to get those vaccine boosters. So we went a different path. And we got a lot wrong. And we need to look at what it was and\u2013and acknowledge that it was wrong. And the reason is, people's trust in public health is crumbling. That is a problem. Because if we have another public health crisis, which we will, if the public doesn't believe in our public health policymakers, that is bad for America. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's something we tried to talk about and Face the Nation. I know Dr. Gottlieb would agree strongly  with a lot of the bigger questions you just raised. Catherine, I'm gonna go to you on that. Because I think you have a similar idea in terms of what's under covered. CATHERINE HERRIDGE: I think there are two components for me with COVID. One is COVID origins. You just have to look at the data. I went to Johns Hopkins website this morning. It's a 6.5 million COVID deaths of that a million in this country and more than 600 million infections. And we still don't know whether it was this zoonotic link so, it spilled over from nature, or whether there's a link to the lab in Wuhan. I think most important\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: And an accident there.\u00a0 CATHERINE HERRIDGE: Correct, right. So most important to me, though, and I speak as someone for full transparency, who has a child who needs special education, he had a transplant, he was developmentally delayed. The policies for special education children with COVID have just been crushing. You look at the levels of literacy, math, and you look at middle school, high school, and they slid back to elementary school. And our family is fortunate to have that ability to use resources to get our son to a full time special education school now, but so many of the children that he was in the public system with don't have those resources, and I really believe children are resilient. But I've come out of these two years questioning whether these children have the access to the tools that their families also need to help bridge that gap. And I really question the course it's set them on in the future. I did some research and when you look at rates of incarceration, they're incredibly high rates of adults who have learning disabilities or had special education needs. So I think understanding what happened to those children and how we can do more  to support them to try and close that gap is something that's been extremely underreported and I agree with Jan. MARGARET BRENNAN: And none of those things are on the to do list in terms of congressional investigations. CATHERING HERRIDGE: They are not. MARGARET BRENNAN: No.\u00a0 JAN CRAWFORD: And if we don't learn from the mistakes of a of our policymakers, then we're going to repeat them. And that  erodes public confidence in our public health system. MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC is saying it's doing self analysis, but people like Dr. Gottlieb would say they need Congress  telling them and we\u2014 JAN CRAWFORD: And we need to be as the media asking those hard questions.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, I have a show for you to watch.\u00a0 JAN CRAWFORD: Let's do it.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff, and then Nancy, what do you think are the most underreported? JEFF PEGUES: I wanted to talk about an issue that we saw come to the board during the midterm elections. People feel unsafe in their neighborhoods and the Police Executive Research Forum, which is a policing think-tank led by a guy named Chuck Wexler. It said that police, post-George Floyd, the training is the same. You'll recall that post George Floyd, there are a lot of people who said\u2014 who said, you know, we have to train police better. There was all this talk about defunding the police, which happened in some cities, and then they refunded the city, the police departments in other cities. However, what hasn't changed, according to this research, is that police training is still done on the cheap and quickly. You know, these young, aspiring police officers are coming on to the force, they're facing more challenges on the streets than ever before. And yet, the training, according to this Police Executive Research Forum, is lacking. I think that's an important story, especially given what police officers are facing day to day on the streets, and what the community needs right now, amid these spikes in crime MARGARET BRENNAN: And police reform efforts, the bipartisan one failed on Capitol Hill.\u00a0 JEFF PEGUES: Yeah, what is really changed since George Floyd? That's the thing.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Nancy, your underreported? NANCY CORDES: Well, I think we've done an amazing job covering the war in Ukraine itself. But, you know, I think one of the things that's been very under covered is one of the tragic after effects of that ongoing war, which is growing food insecurities, especially in in Africa, where they are facing possibly the worst food crisis in recorded history. You know, part of it has to do with the war in Ukraine, and the reduction in grain and other crops coming from Ukraine and Russia. But it also has to do with the pandemic and the fact that a lot of aid dried up, because countries had to redirect that aid, particularly European countries that are now dealing with energy crisis as a result of the war in Ukraine. And then climate change, which has had an incredibly destabilizing effect, particularly in Africa. They've missed four consecutive rainy seasons there. You've got 500,000 kids who are facing the prospect of famine in Somalia alone. This month, the President committed another $2.5 billion to help with the problem in Africa at the Africa Leaders Summit here in Washington, D.C. But they're looking for way more than that, a lot of help from around the world. And it's just not clear right now, whether they're going to get it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that actually transitions into where I was going to go for predictions for 2023. So I'll take a point of personal privilege, because my prediction has to do with Africa and the 54 countries on that continent, the White House is going to have to choose which ones it's going to get more involved with. And some of them are run by people that have very difficult human rights records. But the White House is going to have to make some decisions here because of the Green Revolution. Because of the reliance on special Earths and ingredients for the electric vehicles and other alternative energies. In the Democratic  Republic of the Congo, they have 70% of the essential items like cobalt, and lithium required for electric vehicle batteries. So this is a supply chain controlled by China, coming out of countries like the DRC. And the administration is gonna have to make  some difficult human rights choices, who they want to do business with, in the course of going green. So I'm going to watch that. NANCY CORDES: Another undercovered story is this sort of proxy war, economic war going on in Africa between the U.S. and China are both funding big infrastructure projects. They're to try to win those countries over because they both need access to those rare minerals. JEFF PEGUES: I spent the first 13 years of my life on the continent of Africa and I know that it's about time, the U.S. sort of got into this battle over the future of Africa because there are so many natural resources there that have yet to be tapped into. So it's interesting that it took this long for the U.S. to take a real focus look at the potential that that continent offers. MARGARET BRENNAN: David, what's your 2023 prediction? DAVID MARTIN: So, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley retires in 2023. I predict he will be replaced by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General CQ Brown, making him the second African American after the late Colin Powell to become the highest ranking military officer. And the current commander of Transportation Command, General Jacqueline Van Ovost, will become the next Chief of Staff of the Air Force, making her the first woman to ever sit on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. You can grade that later. MARGARET BRENNAN: David, I usually take what you say to the bank. DAVID MARTIN: Just do it on a curve.\u00a0 MARGARET\u00a0 BRENNNAN: Jan?\u00a0 JAN CRAWFORD: Well, if we're talking about retirements, I guess I will predict\u2014 JAN CRAWFORD: Well you said retirement! So I guess I'm gonna retire. No, I don't think we have any retirements from the Supreme Court. That is not big news, right. No one thinks they're gonna retire. But I, I see this Supreme Court staying intact, not only through the end of President Biden's first term. But if he were to be reelected, I do not think he gets another Supreme Court nomination. This court is this court, you've got six conservative justices, they're going to overturn affirmative action in college admissions, like I said earlier, and it's the court we're going to have for a while\u2014 whether it will be the court that is the longest in history of nine justices to go without a change of membership. I don't know, that was 11 years. That was after Justice Breyer joined the court in 1994. But it will be this court for some time, so people can get used to some different rulings.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Catherine?\u00a0 CATHERINE HERRIDGE: I think many Americans forget that there's still been no resolution to the 9/11 military prosecution at Guantanamo Bay. And we're entering a second year of negotiations between the Military Prosecutors and the attorneys for the defendants. I think this could be the year where there are plea deals in the 9/11 case for some or all of the men. So let's just let that sink in. I think it's going to mean the death penalty is off the table. And in return, they're guarantees that the men will have certain medical care, and that they will live out their sentences at the Guantanamo Bay prisons. That means that this goal of closing the prisons, which has been held by a couple of administrations has\u2014 has run its course, it's not going to happen. And second, I think\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: It becomes a nursing home\u2014 CATHERINE HERRIDGE: These are older people, hard living people, and they're not in great health. Second, I think it's an admission that once these defendants went into the CIA interrogation program that critics called torture, there was no turning back. There was no way to take these men and prosecute them in any kind of legal system. Things always have a way with this case of taking longer than expected. But I do expect a resolution before the 2024 presidential election.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff?\u00a0 JEFF PEGUES: Fani Willis, do you recognize that name?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Georgia.\u00a0 JEFF PEGUES: You did. Georgia, Fulton County, the one sort of Trump related investigation that's really flies under the radar. She's a tough prosecutor. She's been subpoenaing everybody connected to this case, powerful people in Washington. But my theory is that she doesn't care about the power in Washington. She knows she has power in Georgia. And I think, my prediction is that she will bring the first charges related to President Trump. Remember, that was the call where he said, 'Hey, Brad, those 11,780\u2014'. It's evidence on tape. Anybody else who said something like that would be in big trouble. You know, so let's see where this goes. But I think that is the case that people sort of forget about. They're focused on the special counsel, Fani Willis. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We'll watch Fulton County. Nancy?\u00a0 NANCY CORDES: I predict that sometime in the first few months of 2023, President Biden will announce his bid for reelection. I know it's a big parlor game in this town to debate whether he's going to run again and if he didn't, who might run instead. To me, it's not much of a mystery. This is what he has wanted to do. His entire adult life for the last 50 years is to be President of the United States. He feels good about what he's accomplished. in his first two years and I think it would take something very serious to cause him to change his mind about running again. JAN CRAWFORD: Can I ask, does Ron DeSantis run? NANCY CORDES: That's a great question. And, you know, that is something that consumes this White House as well. You know, I will say that they don't discount former President Trump for a minute. They say it's very hard to find anyone else in this country who has got 30% of the country that is willing to go to the mat for them. And certainly, Ron DeSantis is, you know, is, is getting a lot of traction getting a lot of interest in the Republican Party, but they still think that the former president would be tough to beat in a Republican primary. MARGARET BRENNAN: He's tapped into a lot of the anger related to COVID that you referenced there. JAN CRAWFORD: And he's is polling much better right now. JEFF PEGUES: Didn't he sell out those NFTs things? JAN CRAWFORD: Trump did.\u00a0 JEFF PEGUES: Did he sell those out?\u00a0 JAN CRAWFORD: Like 45 pics?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You can come back for our political panel. But I want to, I want to go to good news from 2022. I'll start, David, NATO is not brain-dead. And the French president Emmanuel Macron once called it that. And the lesson from 2022 was that it's not. That's mine. That was my good news. Good news for the West. DAVID MARTIN: Good news for us, bad news for Putin. My good news is much more limited. Retired Army Major John Duffy who received a long-, excuse me, overdue Medal of Honor, for leading\u2014 and being the only American adviser leading South Vietnamese battalion against an entire North Vietnamese division. He went in with 471 troops. He came out with 37.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow. DAVID MARTIN: He did four combat tours, and Vietnam. So he's obviously a remarkable warrior. But he also turns out to be a remarkable poet. And he wrote a poem about that battle, which is the single best account of combat I\u2014 I've ever read. So I know we don't do poetry readings on Face the Nation just\u2014 just let me give you a couple lines: \"The battle raged back and forth. The dying wounded moaning softly. Despair and hurt are common. Is this glory?\" We're lucky to have people who can fight like that. And write like that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well said, David. Jan? JAN CRAWFORD: You know, I\u2014 That's hard to follow that. But I'm going to follow it with a story of perseverance, inspiration, courage, and believing in yourself. And these are stories that we see in the world of sports. I think sports plays a valuable role and kind of bringing us together and emphasizing our common bonds. And one of the best stories in 2022 is Hansel Emmanuel, who is a young man who lost an arm and an accident when he was a child headed amputated, but never gave up on his dream of being a basketball star. He moved to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic, led his Florida high school to the state championship game, got a college scholarship to play basketball in college, and earlier this month, scored his first points in a college basketball game with one of his signature thunderous dunks with his one remaining arm. And it is to me a reminder that if you believe in yourself,  keep working, never give up, that you can do great things. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's also an incredible story, Jan, thank you. Your good news, Catherine?\u00a0 CATHERING HERRIDGE: Well, to sort of follow up on what David said, I've really had the honor of meeting a lot of service members this year who work in the shadows and do very high risk work with no expectation of public acknowledgement, no expectation of metals, or even promotion. And I think that they just embody what is so great about this country, we have a phrase in our house, which is that these people really come from a different shelf of the library than the rest of us. And thank goodness for that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff?\u00a0 JEFF PEGUES: it's so hard on my beat to find a good story sometimes, but alright, so I went to Ohio. And this is not related to my beat. But I went to Ohio I was taken to a cigar shop by it's Mason, Ohio, by the way by this businessman friend of mine happens to be African American. He said hey, come come to Mason, Ohio. I went to school in that area and never been to Mason, Ohio. So I went, waiting for my flight. We sat down outside and these two guys we were dressed in suits. They were dressed in overalls, and they walked by and said hey, how you doing? And I said, wow, oh, OK, because I'm not used to in D.C., stranger just kind of like, whoa. I asked my friend what was that. And there were two farmers. And he said, that's the way it is around here. It doesn't matter who you are where you're from, we just, you know, they'll stop and sit. And they did stop and said one guy had, it was like his arm was hanging on by a thread after some sort of machinery accident. And he had a long beard much longer than mine. He was so well read. And he had- we were talking about politics, we were talking about the state of the country. And how great this country is. Then it turned because he started about talking about COVID. And how he lost his wife. It was really incredible the conversation that these strangers from different worlds had. As I was asked this question, what kind of positive can you bring to the table? To me, that is America, where you have all these people with different point of views come together, not fighting, smoking cigars, chatting on a beautiful day and getting up walking away and saying, Hey, take care. Nice talking to you. MARGARET BRENNAN: A human connection. Nancy?\u00a0 NANCY CORDES: My good news is related. And it's not really on my beat, either. But I say this more as a mom, I think that this was the year that life got back to normal or close to it. You know, at this time last year, Omorcron was just emerging. In January of 2022 there were a million cases of COVID every day. Now, we're down to about 150,000 a day, which isn't great, but it's better. And you know, we're able to gather inside we're able to travel much more easily. You know, it's not exactly life as we knew it before the pandemic, but it feels more normal for us and most importantly for our kids. So that's my good news. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you all for joining us and sharing your insights. And thanks to all of you.",

            "article_content": "The Republican candidates for Senate in Arizona faced off in a heated debate for the first time on Thursday night as the closely watched race is becoming one of the most expensive primary battles in the country. GOP hopefuls vying to take on incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly include Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Jim Lamon and venture capitalist Blake Masters. Kelly defeated incumbent Republican Sen. Martha McSally, who had been appointed to fill out the rest of late Sen. John McCain's seat, in 2020. Kelly is considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the evenly divided Senate as Republicans hope to retake control in the midterm elections. \u00a0 With early voting for the primary set to begin in two weeks, Republicans have already spent nearly $40 million on TV advertising, according to AdImpact, which keeps track of political ad spending.\u00a0 Lamon, who is self-funding his campaign and has pledged to spend $50 million, has poured $7.8 million into TV ads. Masters is backed by Saving Arizona, a super PAC funded by billionaire Peter Thiel that has spent over $8 million on ads this cycle.\u00a0 Recent polls show Brnovich, Lamon and Masters pulling ahead from the other candidates in the field. But Brnovich's early lead in the race has now diminished. A poll from earlier this month showed Masters ahead with 28%, followed by Brnovich at 23% and Lamon at 17%. The poll was conducted days after former President Donald Trump endorsed Masters, saying he will be \"strong on border security\" and \"tough on crime.\" Thursday's forum, hosted by conservative advocacy group FreedomWorks, is the first time all three top candidates debated since Trump's coveted endorsement.\u00a0 Masters was quick to remind the audience that the former president supports his campaign, saying \"weak establishment Republicans\" have helped Democrats accomplish their goals.\u00a0 \"I am the only candidate that understands and is addressing the new and modern threats we face,\" Masters said in his opening statement. \"No more defense. Offense. That's why President Trump endorsed me.\" The top-polling candidates spent much of the time attacking Democrats and President Joe Biden on issues like inflation, border security and foreign policy \u2014 but they didn't hold back on attacking each other, too.\u00a0 Brnovich and Lamon both attacked Masters for his ties to Thiel, saying Big Tech is a threat to Americans and Masters represents their interests. \"I am going to call it like it is up here,\" Lamon said, \"do we really need (Thiel) to buy a seat for Arizona from California?\" \"I know that the answer to Big Tech is not having someone that's financed by Big Tech and made all their money in Big Tech,\" Brnovich added. Masters fired back, saying Arizonans should vote for someone \"who actually understands\" tech to take on companies like Google and Facebook. The 35-year-old venture capitalist said he worries most about Google and called for a team of software engineers to monitor the search engine's headquarters leading up to elections.\u00a0 \"I know how it works, I am telling you they have the motive and opportunity and capability to swing a presidential election,\" Masters said.\u00a0 Masters and Lamon have relied on advertising to raise their profiles with voters but the two campaigns are now increasingly using the ads to attack each other. A new ad from the Save Arizona PAC claims Lamon is \"associated with forced slave labor\" in China and that his company imported supplies from Chinese markets.\u00a0 Lamon was the founder and CEO of DEPCOM Power, an engineering company that built utility-scale solar power plants, before he sold it in November to Koch Industries. According to ImportGenius, which tracks imports and exports of U.S companies, Lamon's solar power company routinely ordered materials from LONGi, a Chinese company that exports parts needed for solar panels. It sent nearly 10 million pounds' worth of solar panel parts across 248 containers to DEPCOM.\u00a0 According to the Helena Kennedy Centre for International Justice, LONGi is a strategic partner of Xinte, which is the subsidiary of Xinjiang-based manufacturer TBEA. Researchers at the Kennedy Centre for International Justice said that TBEA \"enthusiastically heeded the call to engage\" in forced labor programs against Uyghur Muslims in China.\u00a0 In November, weeks before Koch Industries announced its deal to buy DEPCOM from Lamon, LONGi said in a filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange that U.S. Customs and Border Patrol detained shipments of its products to America.\u00a0 The confirmation from LONGi that its products were seized by U.S. officials came months after the Biden administration promised to crackdown on imports of Chinese-made products used to make solar panels, following an international pledge to rid the global supply chain of human rights abuses.\u00a0 Lamon said Thursday night that a large portion of solar panel parts come from China and his company was at the forefront of pushing to lower American reliance on Chinese manufacturing. \"We worked hard with American suppliers and companies to get that number down,\" Lamon said. Lamon also called for Chinese individuals who are in America on a visa \"to go home.\"\u00a0 \"I know how the Chinese play. They do not need to be in this country,\" Lamon said.\u00a0 The new ad from Saving Arizona aired nearly 80 times in two days this week across the Phoenix market, according to AdImpact. It started airing just a day after Lamon's campaign pulled one of their ads where a supporter of the businessman says Lamon has \"always opposed China,\" adding, \"don't believe Blake Masters or his pro-China, big tech billionaire.\" Earlier this year, Republican candidates running to be the Senate nominee in Pennsylvania spent more than $25 million combined attacking each other on the airwaves during the primary. Trump-endorsed Mehmet Oz ended up winning that race by just 951 votes.\u00a0 Now, the GOP Senate primary in Arizona is turning out to be just as expensive and the results could be just as close.\u00a0 Kelly's campaign, meanwhile, has reserved more than $23 million in ad time between Primary Day and General Election Day in November.\u00a0 According to AdImpact, Democrats are set to spend more than $80 million during that period to defend Kelly while Republican groups have reserved over $55 million in ad time to flip the seat.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the intersection between politics and tech.",

            "article_content": "On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast, moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click\u00a0here\u00a0to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: The midterm elections are just hours away, and candidates are spending the weekend barnstorming their states with some of the biggest names in politics. Democrats argue democracy is on the line. Republicans say the party in power is wrecking the economy. It's a mad dash to get out the vote. And the stakes are high, as both parties vie for control of Congress for the next two years. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. The most important and probably most competitive midterm election in years is now down to the wire. More than 39 million votes have already been cast. And across the country, candidates are out in full force, hoping to persuade the persuadable, turn out their true believers and, perhaps their most difficult challenge, explain to people why this election is so important and why they need to vote. In their words, here is what it comes down to: (Begin VT) GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS (R-Florida): They came into office, and they created the worst inflation crisis that we have seen in four decades. BARACK OBAMA (Former President of the United States): The Republicans like to talk about it, but what's their answer? What's their economic policy? They want to gut Social Security. They want to gut Medicare. They want to give rich folks and big corporations more tax cuts. MEHMET OZ (R-Pennsylvania Senatorial Candidate): Young couples want to make that first investment for a starter home. They can't afford the interest rates. We have families all over the commonwealth worried about crime, so much so, they won't send their kids outside. JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): Your right to choose is on the ballot. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Your right to vote is on the ballot. There's something else on the ballot: character. Character is on the ballot. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) HERSCHEL WALKER (R-Georgia Senatorial Candidate): But you heard him say the biggest threat to democracy is voting for the Republican. Are they serious? The biggest threat to democracy is having Joe Biden in the White House. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: The main event is Tuesday, control of the House, which has been shifting in Republicans' favor in these last weeks -- they need five seats to take over -- and control of this Senate, where just one turnover will put them on top. We are tracking 10 key battleground races, five of which are hotly contested toss-ups. Our Kris Van Cleave is in Arizona, our Nikole Killion is in Georgia, and our Robert Costa has been reporting in Pennsylvania. And that's where we begin this morning. (Begin VT) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: It's a choice, a choice between two vastly different visions of America. ROBERT COSTA (voice-over): It's a choice that's as competitive as ever. Right now, the Senate race between Republican Mehmet Oz and Democrat John Fetterman could not be closer. Three presidents barnstormed the state this weekend. DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States): If you want to stop the destruction of our country and save the American dream, then, this Tuesday, you must vote Republican in a giant red wave. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) ROBERT COSTA: On the Road from the campus of Penn State to the suburbs of Philadelphia, voters told us that the economy is front and center. Are you feeling economic pain in your life? MAN #1: Yes. I'm a fixed income. ROBERT COSTA: Fetterman, who is recovering from a stroke in May, says that voters who want to blame Democrats for inflation should think again. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JOHN FETTERMAN (D-Pennsylvania): What I would say to them is, is that you need a senator that is going to push back against corporate greed and the kind of price gouging as well too. I mean, like that -- this is my point. ROBERT COSTA: Oz has courted frustrated voters. Last night, near Pittsburgh, he urged his supporters to win over neighbors by asking them if they're happy with the nation's direction. MEHMET OZ: I want you to contact 10 people. Do it at church. Do it before the Steelers game. Just find the time. ROBERT COSTA: But the Pittsburgh Steelers don't play this week, and the remark gives Oz's critics another chance to claim he is out of touch. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: This is Kris Van Cleave in Arizona, where both the Senate and governor's races appear to be in dead heats. Battling for his political life, Senator Mark Kelly rallied in Phoenix with first lady Jill Biden. SENATOR MARK KELLY (D-Arizona): Women have lost a constitutional right, and that is taking us in the wrong direction. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Republican challenger Blake Masters has closed the gap by hammering Kelly on the economy, crime and the border. BLAKE MASTERS (R-Arizona Senatorial Candidate): Mark Kelly, Joe Biden, they have opened up our Southern border. They have given our sovereignty over to the Mexican drug cartels. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Kari Lake is a rising star in the Republican Party and one of three election deniers at that top of the state's GOP ticket. Democrats have seized on that. FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Democracy as we know it may not survive in Arizona. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: That is quite a statement, that you are a threat to democracy. KARI LAKE (R-Arizona Gubernatorial Candidate): I wonder what he'd call Hillary Clinton, because she's denied so many past elections. And she's already denying the next election in 2024. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: But she's running for governor. KARI LAKE: We have the right -- we have the right to question our government and our elections. It's called the First Amendment. And I intend to continue to use that right. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Her opponent, Secretary of State Katie Hobbs: KATIE HOBBS (D-Arizona Gubernatorial Candidate): Kari Lake is focused on being as extreme as possible, whether it's the issue of abortion, whether it's the 2020 election. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Starkly different campaigns on a collision course over the future of Arizona. NIKOLE KILLION: I'm Nikole Killion in Georgia. MAN #2: From the great state of Georgia, Herschel Walker! NIKOLE KILLION: It was a homecoming for Herschel Walker at the University of Georgia, where the former football star was game-ready. HERSCHEL WALKER: Just like the Dawgs are going to win today, that's what's going to happen on Tuesday. SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-Georgia): The way to have a voice in a democracy is to have a vote. NIKOLE KILLION: Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and Walker are locked in a heated contest that could determine control of the U.S. Senate. STACEY ABRAMS (D-Georgia Gubernatorial Candidate): I'm here to tell you, we have got the power, Georgia! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) NIKOLE KILLION: In the governor's race, it's a rematch between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican incumbent Brian Kemp. STACEY ABRAMS: Polls tell us that this is a tight race. GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP (R-Georgia): We need a big turnout on Election Day. (End VT) NIKOLE KILLION: More than 2.5 million Georgians have already voted, a state record, but, here in Cobb County, elections officials say more than 1,000 absentee ballots were never mailed, calling it a critical error. They blame overworked staff, but say that's no excuse, and they're working to contact impacted voters -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nikole Killion, Kris Van Cleave, and Robert Costa, thanks to all of you. We turn now to Keisha Lance Bottoms, the former mayor of Atlanta. She now serves as a senior adviser to President Biden, but the White House tells us that, this morning, she's appearing only in a personal capacity. Good morning to you. KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS (D-Former Mayor of Atlanta, Georgia): Good morning. Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said last month you were concerned about a lack of voter enthusiasm in Georgia, but the secretary of state says there is a historic level of turnout. What does that signal to you now? FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: Well, I'm glad that people are turning out to vote. When I said that last month, I was sounding the alarm. And we have seen a record number of people turn out in the early vote, but we still have an election on Tuesday, and we cannot let up until this election is over. I was on the ballot five years ago, seven points down going into Election Day, and I won by less than 800 votes. It doesn't matter what the polls say. People still have the ability to show up to vote on Tuesday and to make a difference in Georgia. The thought of Herschel Walker going to the Senate is frightening. MARGARET BRENNAN: That is the Republican candidate for the Senate. Black voters helped turn Georgia blue back in 2020 and send two Democratic senators here to Washington. How do you explain to Black voters now, who are so key in Georgia, that they should help support the party, given that, when Democrats held the majority for these past two years, top priorities like police reform and voting rights really haven't been addressed? FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: Well, we have to remember that there has been a very thin margin, but there have been a number of issues that have been addressed that impact not just African-American voters, but voters across this country, student debt relief, $10,000, $20,000 if you are Pell Grant-eligible. A vast majority of African-American students are Pell Grant-eligible. There's also been a reduction in prescription drug costs. Insulin will be capped at $35 a month, $2,000 a month annually. MARGARET BRENNAN: Starting in January. FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: Absolutely, starting in January. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the loans are -- the student debt relief is caught up in the courts and you know a part of dispute. FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: They are caught up in the courts because Republicans are pushing back against relief to American families across this country. African-American voters are key in Georgia; 29 percent so far have shown up in the early vote. That means that there are a lot of people left out there, not just African-American voters, but voters across the state, who can still show up on Tuesday and make a difference in this election. And that's what Democrats will need in Georgia for us to continue to send Raphael Warnock to the Senate and also to have Stacey Abrams elected as governor. MARGARET BRENNAN: In our polling, we see consistently that it is the economy and inflation that are top of mind for voters. The president said just a few days ago that he has passed so many good things, but people haven't realized how good they are yet. Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin said, the truth is: Democrats have done a poor job of communicating our approach on the economy.\" DNC adviser Cedric Richmond, you know him well. He told CBS: \"The president's message of what he's been able to accomplish has not gotten out there.\" Hillary Clinton just said: \"The work done by Democrats is impressive, but we got to get that message across more effectively.\" If the policies are so good, why is communicating them such a problem? FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: Well, it's been a very difficult couple of years. We have been in the midst of a pandemic. There's been a lot of misinformation flooding the airwaves. We see it in waves, not just on television, but we're seeing it through YouTube. We're seeing it on other social media platforms. So, it is more difficult to get the message out. But I'm sitting here today getting the message out. This administration, Democrats in Congress have delivered for the American people. And to turn back the clock and not allow us to keep pushing through will be devastating for people across America. If we want prescription drug costs to remain low, then we need Democrats in Congress. If we want voting rights finally passed in Congress, we need Democrats in Congress. If we don't want a national ban on abortion and for doctors and health care providers to be sent to prison for offering an abortion to a woman whose life may be in danger, then we need Democrats in Congress. And that's the message that we will continue to push out, not just through Election Day, but beyond, because we know that elections happen quite frequently, and we can't have people so discouraged that they think their votes don't matter. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said this week at a fund-raiser, if Democrats do lose in the midterms -- so, he's entertaining it is a real possibility -- he said: \"It'll be a horrible two years. The good news is, I will have a veto pen.\" Is complete gridlock what America needs to prepare for? FORMER MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS: Well, we know that President Biden ran on being able to work across the aisle. So, of course, the American people want us to be able to get things done. But when you have Republicans say that they will pull back aid to Ukraine, that their -- their entire platform is based on doing what Joe Biden doesn't want done, that's not what the American people want. We want progress in this country. And we want leaders who believe in democracy. We don't want leaders who deny elections. I heard Kari Lake say that people have a right to question their government. They absolutely do, but they don't have a right to overthrow their government, in the way that we saw that on January 6. So, when you have election deniers who have the -- who may go to Congress, who may be elected to statewide office -- we have one in Georgia, Burt Jones, who's running for lieutenant governor, an election denier -- that's -- that's not just a danger to Democrats. That's a danger to everyone who believes in what this country stands for. MARGARET BRENNAN: Keisha Lance Bottoms, thank you for joining us this morning. And we go now to Newfields, New Hampshire, and that state's Republican governor, Chris Sununu, who is up for reelection on Tuesday. Welcome back to the broadcast. Governor, our public polling that we're looking at indicates that you're likely to keep the governor's seat after Tuesday. Back in 2021, you canceled your own inauguration due to security threats. You've personally experienced the threat of political violence. I'm wondering, how concerned are you in this moment now? And will you hold an inauguration if you win again? GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU (R-New Hampshire): Yeah, so a couple of things here. Obviously, with -- with Speaker Pelosi and what happened recently, I think that is kind of re-looking at -- everyone's kind of looking at what this political violence is. It's on both sides. It's everywhere. The heat is too high all across America. Good leadership brings that down. I will be holding my inauguration, fully plan to do so. But, again, we have got to, as leaders, bring the temperature down. It's OK to disagree, but, at the end of the day, you got to be able to move forward. And we fully plan to do that here in New Hampshire. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I want to come back to that topic in a moment, but, first, inflation. It's top of mind. New England is facing its highest energy costs in more than 25 years. Could be a cold winter. Your largest utility in the region is asking the White House to prepare emergency measures to prevent a natural gas shortage this winter. What -- what's the federal response been so far? And are you, at the state level, prepared for what could be a safety threat? GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Yeah, I will say the federal response so far has -- has been very underwhelming. All the governors got on the phone recently, about a month ago, with the secretary of energy and tried to talk about what those opportunities were in terms of increasing natural gas. New England is really at the end of the line for natural gas, right? All of our natural gas comes through Albany. And, in previous years, if there was a high demand or a big cold snap, folks come home, they turn their heat on, the Marcellus Shale would increase production. But no one's incentivized to do that. There's no -- no opportunity to do that right now. And I think that's where a lot of the utilities, and rightly so, are telling this administration, you've put policies in place. It's having a very drastic effect on energy and fuel oil prices today, and likely is just going to get worse. So we need to see something across New England. There's nothing political about energy prices, right? But when you have all the ability in the world to produce your own fuels and refuse to do it, obviously, folks in New England are quite frustrated. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's record production right now, as you know. But this is a very real problem. GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Yes. And, because of the Jones Act, because -- and because of the Jones Act, that is this antiquated 100-year-old union-driven policy that President Biden refuses to get rid of, we have very minimal opportunity to bring natural gas from even parts of our own country and land it right here in -- in New England. So it's not just New Hampshire. It's Massachusetts. It's Maine. It's all of these states that are that are -- that are feeling record high prices because, again, we've shut down natural gas plants. We've disincentivized fossil fuels. It's -- look, we all want to transition into renewables. And, of course, that's a very smart thing to do, but it must be a transition. This administration went all or nothing. So that's why you see your -- it takes -- costs twice as much to fill your gas tank, your fuel oil, your energy prices. And, in New England, when it gets cold, it's going to be -- there's going to be some real pain for all of us. And, again, we're just asking the administration to reverse some of these policies, in -- incentivize more production and more natural gas through Albany, New York, to get us what we need. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden, in one of his closing arguments, is framing a selection is protecting democracy against extreme Republicans. Listen. (Begin VT) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: The extreme MAGA element of the Republican Party, which is a minority of that party, as I said earlier, But it's its driving force, is trying to succeed where they failed in 2020, to suppress the right of voters and subvert the electoral system itself. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree that parts of your party are emboldening violence and posing a threat to democracy? GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Look, what is shocking to me about all of this is, you have the Democrat Party, which is now using the president of the United States, not as leader of our country, but leader of their party, as a political tool, right before the election, to drive and effectively tell half of America that they're too extreme for America. It makes absolutely no sense. And to say... MARGARET BRENNAN: You think the MAGA element of the Republican Party is half of America? Because I wouldn't necessarily put you in that half. GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: No, well, definitely not. But again, to say that that extremism belongs in one party, and it doesn't appear in the Democrat Party is -- is nonsensical. Nobody buys that... MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying the party is all one now... GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: ... because we see it on both sides. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... unified, that extreme MAGA is part of the Republican Party's ideology? GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: No, no, absolutely not. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Absolutely not, no. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it seemed like that's what you were implying. GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: It's an absolute minority. But what I'm saying is, extreme -- no, no, no, no, definitely not. Extremism is on both sides. And for the president of the United States to come up and be more of a political tool, as opposed to a uniter -- remember, he got elected because he said he was going to unite folks, not threaten them. He was going to bring everybody together and get stuff done and not polarize this country, which is exactly what has happened. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: If that was not the reality, then Democrats wouldn't be in for the rude awakening they're going to come -- that's going to come Tuesday. But it is coming, and not because of politics. Because of what is happening in people's homes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: What's happening at their kitchen tables, what's happening with trying to balance a checkbook. And the president has to take a lot of responsibility for that. It's easy to blame ex -- just blame extremism. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well... GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: But most of us are not extreme. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, President -- former President Donald Trump is expected to announce his candidacy for the presidency. CBS is reporting that. That could be within a matter of days. What does that do to your party? Does anyone have a chance of actually beating him in a Republican primary? GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: What does it do to our party? Nothing. Nothing. It'll have no effect on anything. And I mean that quite sincerely. First off, announcing you're going to run for office between an election and Christmas is a terrible idea, because one thing I can say for America is, we're all going to be really happy, one way or the other, that the election is over come Tuesday, and everyone's going to want to take a breath and reengage with their families and deal with some really serious issues. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well... GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: And then politics really gets back into the mix of things in early '23. Whether the -- President Trump decides to run or not, it's not going to make any difference in terms of the fact that you're still going to see eight to maybe even a dozen other candidates jump in the race. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: He doesn't keep anybody out of the race, right? So it's still going to be, I think, on both sides. I think -- I don't think President Biden is going to run again. I think on both sides of the aisle, you are going to have maybe a dozen individuals over the next six to nine months come out and decide to run. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, and your name's floated as one of them, potentially. I know you're not going to give me an answer to that question right now. But you did turn down the invitation to run for Senate. GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has voiced some concern about candidate quality in this midterm election. You told \"The Washington Examiner\" that the Republican majority would just obstruct President Biden until 2024. You didn't want to be a roadblock for two years. You're setting pretty low expectations for what a Republican majority would actually mean. Is that what we should expect, just nothing for two years, total gridlock? GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: No, I -- look, I think -- well, I think both sides both sides of the aisle -- both sides of the aisle in Washington have set a horribly low expectation for Washington. I mean, think about it. They pass -- one way or another, they pass a bill, Republicans or Democrats or both, and we cheer it. It's supposed to be this great, great success because they got something done? It is just an absolute gridlock mess there on both sides of the aisle. So, as a governor, I can have so much more impact on what is happening on the ground level, redesigning systems, implementing better mental health services, implementing better opioid services, whatever it might be. And this is New Hampshire. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: And if you spent -- anyone who spends more than 10 minutes in New Hampshire knows now not an easy place to leave. So I just want to get stuff done. If I'm going to put my family through the difficulties of public service and all that comes with it, I'm sure as heck going to get something done. And you can do that far more effectively as a governor than you can as a senator or congressman. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: Now, leadership can change that. Leadership in Washington can absolutely change that on both sides of the aisle. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU: And I think that's what America is looking for. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, I'm -- sounds like we'll be talking to you again. Governor, thank you for your time today. We're joined now by Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. He's a CBS News expert and analyst. Good morning to you, Chris. Good to have you back. How do you react to this idea of President Biden characterizing the MAGA element of the party as an extreme threat to democracy? CHRISTOPHER KREBS: The area that I'm most focused on right now is the undermining of the legitimacy of American elections. And Governor Sununu mentioned leaders need to stand up and -- and speak truth to power, and -- and particularly the elements of the GOP that continue to repeat countlessly debunked claims. I mean, we even have the GOP candidate for governor, Kari Lake, in Arizona just the other day making a joke about there's no way that President Biden got 81 million votes. In fact, he got more than 81 million votes. But the point here is that we do need leaders like Governor Sununu to stand up and say that this is not acceptable behavior in American democracy, and that we need the -- those that continue to push these narratives for clout, for political influence, for -- for money, for fund-raising, that they need to let it go, and we need to move on, if this American experiment is going to continue. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we're going to continue this on the other side of that, but, just to your point, there are 308 Republican candidates who have raised doubts about the integrity and validity of the last election. They're standing for office now. There's a reason they are using that as a political message. We're going to talk about that in a moment. So, stay with us on Face the Nation. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Tune in Tuesday for our CBS News election coverage. We start at 5:00 p.m. on our streaming network and then go on the air at 8:00 p.m. on our broadcast network. So, join me, Norah O'Donnell, Gayle King, John Dickerson, and the whole CBS News political team. Chris Krebs will be there too. Full coverage of the midterm elections. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Join me Tuesday, Norah O'Donnell, Natalie Morales, Nikole Killion, Caitlin Huey-Burns, all of us. On Monday, we will also have a Twitter Space conversation about the role of women voters in the midterm elections. That's Monday at 3:00. And you can listen live on the CBS News and Face the Nation Twitter handles Tuesday, full election coverage. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation now about election security with CBS News cyber security expert and analyst Chris Krebs. Chris, I want to talk about something that's happening right now. Social media has already changed the way we communicate, and certainly our political world. President Biden said a few days ago that he has concerns about billionaire Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter. He said the platform spews lies all across the world. There's no editors anymore in America. There are no editors. How do we expect kids to be able to understand what is at stake. It's not just kids, right? What concerns do you have about this happening just days before the election, these changes to Twitter? CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, I think - I think the government, for one, has a mechanism by which they can review the acquisition. The Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States can take a look at particularly the second and third ownership positions in Twitter, including Saudi Arabia. That is something that I'm assuming that the Treasury Department is taking a look at right now, see if they can put in place a national security agreement or even potentially unwind the purchase. But I think more specifically to what's happening right now with Twitter, I think there are kind of -- there are two Elons that we're seeing. There's the public Elon that's, you know, trolling and saying $8, please, on all the complaints about some of the shifts in the moderation and other activities. Then there's what's happening behind the scenes, the conversations with the civil rights groups, with advertisers, with the teams, which, perhaps, may be a little bit more stable. And I think if you look at the platform itself right now, not a whole lot has changed. That may not be a popular opinion, but I think the reality is that most you haven't seen too much of a change in the moderation. Now, the concern, though - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Is what happens tomorrow where you can buy the blue check for $8 a month. The Twitter Blue. MARGARET BRENNAN: And just for our viewers who don't use Twitter. CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: A blue check is a sign of credibility. CHRISTOPHER KREBS: It has historically been a marker of trust in that Twitter has said, we have confirmed and authenticated the identity of this person, which tends to be a politician or a news media personality or a journalist, an academic or someone that may be a popular voice in certain civil rights, civil liberties issues. MARGARET BRENNAN: Now you can buy it for $8 a month. CHRISTOPHER KREBS: And along with a number of other features of editing and longer form video posting. But, again, to have such a dramatic shift in that marker of trust, now you can buy it, in advance of, as we've been talking about, a very contentious and important election, it opens the information space to a broader community of influencers, clout chasers, election denialists and - and is -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Foreign actors? CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Absolutely. I mean we've seen reports lately of Russia, China and Iran back at their old tricks. And it is going to create a very chaotic environment. MARGARET BRENNAN: To that point, in 2018, during the midterms, cyber command took offensive operations to take out Russian trolls who were spreading misinformation. \"The New York Times\" has a story today saying, Russia's back at it. What does that say to you about U.S. defenses? CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, I think - so, recorded future and graphic of two research firms have released information that Russian bots, trolls associated with the internet research agency, which is a group that targeted the 2016 and the 2018 election, are back at it and are undermining this time Democratic candidates for Senate in some of the - the - the more contentious races. I think what it says is that the - that there's a broader community of actors. They recognize that political discourse is very divisive here in the U.S. and they have more opportunities probably than ever before to continue to undermine confidence, to create chaos, which is really their primary objective here is not necessarily that a winner wins, but that we've all lost confidence and they degrade the American, you know, democracy experiment. MARGARET BRENNAN: There are also a number of sitting senators, and, of note, Ambassador Richard Grenell of -- former President Trump's acting director of national intelligence, has been posting some misleading information -- that's him on the screen -- about the election. He said any state which doesn't count all the votes and announce the winner Tuesday night is incompetent. Now, votes - CHRISTOPHER KREBS: So, all 50 states then by that formulation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because what you're saying is just the fact that votes are never finalized on election night. But why do you think someone who knows better is posting something like that? CHRISTOPHER KREBS: Well, whether he knows better, I can't assume that. But the point here is that it's for clout-chasing. It's for influence. There is a reward system and structure set up right now within the far right of the GOP that provides additional engagement. So, you tweet something like that and you can see your likes, your retweets, your amplification really take off. And if you're just talking about some other, you know, more mundane domestic issue, nobody cares. But there's a reward system and incentive structure that's set up where exactly this sort of messaging is - is rewarded. It's encouraged. And - and this is, again, going back to Governor Sununu's comments. We need leaders to lead. We need the presumptive leaders of the Republican Party to stand up and say, this is unacceptable. This is not how it works. We need to be good-faith actors in this process and, unfortunately, leaders aren't leading right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Chris Krebs, thank you, as always for your analysis. And we will see you on election night as part of CBS coverage at our democracy desk here at CBS News. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: This year CBS News has been tracking four groups of election influencers who could prove decisive in this year's midterm campaign. One group, Pressured Parents. They say they're anxious about the post-Covid era, particularly when it comes to their finances and their children's well-being. For a closer look at some of the concerns facing this group, we're joined now by Laura Meckler, national education writer at \"The Washington Post,\" Scott Gottlieb, as you know him, the former commissioner of the FDA and a board member at Pfizer, and Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University, and she joins us from Providence, Rhode Island. Good morning to you all. Emily, I want to start with you. You wrote an article about pandemic amnesty. You said, basically, we need to forgive public officials for what they didn't know during the worst of the pandemic. You had argued early on for opening of schools when the pandemic was still raging. What do you think we need to be focused on now? Because some of the debate still seems to be stuck two years ago. EMILY OSTER, (Economist, Brown University): Yes, so I'm an economist, but I'm also a parent. And I talk to a lot of parents. And what I can say is right now parents are very worried about the next steps for their kids. They see the historic test score declines. They see the declines in routine vaccination rates for kids. And they want us to be looking to solutions. They don't want to be looking to rehash the debates that we had two years ago. They want to know, what investments are we going to make as a policy group to fix the problems that they're seeing for their kids. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, amen to talking about solutions, but we aren't, Laura, talking much about them as a country. To those scores that we just heard mentioned, the Education Department reported appalling historic declines. Twenty-five percent of fourth graders are below the basic level in math, 37 percent were below the basic level in reading. How much of it is linked to the pandemic closures? How much of it is linked to a broader problem? And why aren't we hearing more about it? LAURA MECKLER, (National Education Writer, \"The Washington Post\"): Well, we're talking -- some of us are talking a lot about it. I think that it is really important. We have seen historic declines in -- particularly in math, but also in reading. And it is certainly linked to the pandemic. Some of it is linked to the schools that were remote for an extended period of time. But even schools that were not remote, also we've seen -- I mean that were not remote for very long, I should say - MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. LAURA MECKLER: Have also seen significant declines in academic achievement. So - and I think that compared with the sort of social, emotional mental health real crisis that we're seeing among children and teenagers right now is really putting enormous amount of pressure on schools and on families. MARGARET BRENNAN: To your point, because we looked at it, New Hampshire, which opened earlier, Georgia, Florida, where schools reopened faster, they may have fared better but they still saw declines. LAURA MECKLER: Exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there's still something happening. LAURA MECKLER: Exactly. And I think that what most experts will tell you is that, you know, the pandemic was still happening. Even if kids were back in school. First of all, there were closures. There were quarantines. People were in and out of school. But beyond that, you know, people were experiencing loss. They were seeing stress all around them. They didn't have their normal lives. So, I think that, you know, the pandemic had a deep effect on families and on children and on schools. And I think those are going to be continuing for really many years to come. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know I don't like it when people say the pandemic's over because I still feel like I'm living through this haze, Dr. Gottlieb. School closures are still a live issue. I mean we've seen upticks in RSV, in flu and other viruses and some schools have closed. In Indiana we just saw one. Virginia. Should communities just take this out of the tool kit and keep schools open no matter what? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, (Former FDA Commissioner): Well, look, we have a major epidemic of RSV. It may be peaking right now. We're going to enter into a major epidemic of flu. And we haven't been taking the actions that we would normally be taking to try to mitigate these kinds of pandemics because. I think a lot of public health officials and I think a lot of school districts are a little bit gun shy right now given the backlash to what we did during the pandemic. Closing a school for one incubation cycle for two or three days when you had a major outbreak of flu or RSV in the past was not that uncommon. If you had 40 percent, 50 percent of the kids out of school, you might close for a day or two. Now when a school does in Indiana, it's national news. We know hand hygiene, for example, is very effective at stopping flu transmission. Do you hear any school district talking about hand hygiene right now? We know wearing a mask if you have the flu or RSV when you go out is effective at preventing forward transmission. Nobody wants to say that. So, I think that there's a lot of reluctance now, in part because of the failures of public health messaging during the pandemic and the things we got wrong and the backlash to it. So we don't have a good solution for what we're entering right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of - of Emily's premise here, that there needs to be amnesty? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think we need to distinguish - and she was at the vanguard, to your point, at arguing for schools to opened. A lot of kids got back in the classroom because of her efforts. So she's - she's advocating on behalf of others when she talks about amnesty. I think we need to distinguish between structural failures of institutions and mistakes that were made because we were in the fog of viral war and we didn't understand the - the virus itself. There were institutions that failed. CDC. There were a lot of systemic failures there. Even people talk about the teachers union not working to get people back in the classroom. And then there were things we got wrong. We didn't recognize the virus was airborne. We thought it was droplet transmission, so we advocated the use of cloth masks when they weren't effective. So, there were things we did wrong because we didn't understand the virus. We need to learn from that. But I think the - the structural features that we got wrong, where institutions failed, that we can't move on from because we need to reform those institutions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Emily, parental rights has been harnessed effectively by Republicans in certain places on the campaign trail. But our CBS News polling shows this is broad concern, to your point. Seventy-two percent of those polled say they're concerned about learning declines after Covid. Seventy-two percent said they're worried about bullying at their kids' school. Sixty-eight percent said they're worried about gun violence. Fifty-seven percent said discussions of sexuality and gender concern them. There's so much concern about the classroom. What -- where does the focus need to be and where does it need to come from here? EMILY OSTER: I think that the focus needs to be on what we need to do to move forward for solutions, and, you know, and -- to give you a concrete example, when we look at something like test scores, which many parents are very worried about, we see that over the last school year there's been some test score recovery, but that's uneven. Some school districts have recovered to where they were in 2019. Some school districts haven't recovered at all. At this point, if we want to speak to these concerns of parents, we need to think about, what are the investments we're making to figure out, why have some school districts been successful, what did they do that was successful? How can we comport those lessons over to districts that haven't been successful? This kind of solutions-based focus has to be where we go rather than rehashing the discussions we had two years ago. That's how we're going to find solutions and get kids back on track because it's, frankly, exactly as you say, kids are really suffering and we're losing time on getting them back. MARGARET BRENNAN: Laura, the focus that we are hearing about the classrooms is on like the content of what's being taught in them. And we saw that in that 57 percent discussion of sexuality and gender. Is that just because it's easier to access or understand or - you -- why? LAURA MECKLER: I think that the sort of culture wars that are -- have gripped schools in the last couple of years are now coming to the question of gender and sexuality. For a long time we saw them centered on issues of race. Like, so-called critical race theory and there was conversation -- discomfort among conservatives of conversations - of talking about systemic racism, for instance. And - and that has kind of given way now to concerns around gender identity, and transgender, transgender women competing in sports. All of those things, I think, are - are concerns among many conservatives and there are a lot of candidates for office and political figures who are playing on that and talking a lot about that. And I think when they talk about parental rights, that's what they're talking about. They don't want - they - they will assert things like, you know, schools are trying to turn boys into girls and girls into boys. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. LAURA MECKLER: I don't think that that's true. But that's the kind of fears that -- because I think there's still a lot of discomfort with the idea of questions around gender identity and there are people really working to tap into that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. I mean what Emily has argued is like, we need data on how to make up for educational deficits. LAURA MECKLER: Well, this has nothing to do with that. I mean -- MARGARET BRENNAN: That - that's (INAUDIBLE) on a bumper sticker? LAURA MECKLER: Yes. I mean, right. Exactly. I mean, yes, that is the core problem facing education today, right now. Actual academics. Can kids do math? Can kids read at the levels they need to? Those are skills you're going to need on into your education and into life. These other things are just much more emotional and tapping into sort of these culture war conversations that we're having in this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Gottlieb, I mean when you look at parents, it's like a formula shortage, completely incoherent messaging from the CDC that you just laid out here, child care shortages in part due to what's going on with infection rates. It is hard not to have anger and emotion about public health and how it's communicated. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, I think that there's a pervasive sense, rightly so, that public health institutions have failed the public and that they weren't equipped to tackle the challenges that people have been facing. We shouldn't have had this shortage that we had with the formula. We should have responded to it more adequately than we did. CDC didn't put out practical guidance, didn't advise families on what to do. They required them for six feet of distancing is what kept most schools shut well into the spring of 2021. So, there's a pervasive sense that public health institutions didn't work on behalf of families. They were slow to integrate new information. And there's not a - there's not real evidence that they've reformed themselves. There hasn't been an effort by the administration to try to, you know, try to reform - fundamentally reform CDC. CDC s working to reform itself, but that's not usually the way it works. It's hard to self-organize around a new mission if you're an agency. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: So, I think if the administration had been more aggressive at addressing these deficits, they'd probably -- people wouldn't feel so much angst. MARGARET BRENNAN: Or you need to hear that from perhaps the new Congress, the pressure to reform. Emily, you also raise, in your article, the question of mandates for vaccines. Are you arguing for flu and Covid vaccine mandates, because that's very controversial? EMILY OSTER: In the article I discuss routine vaccinations, measles pertussis, where we don't typically have mandates, but the rates have been very high. They have gone down over time. We haven't seen schools move to Covid vaccine mandates, and I don't expect them to. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. EMILY OSTER: And, similarly, we haven't seen flu mandates, and I don't expect to see those either. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. And I know Dr. Gottlieb also is against mandates of - of flu. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I don't think this vaccine reaches the threshold of being mandated in schools. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. All right. Thanks for all of you. We could do a whole hour or more on all the parental tensions right now, but we've got to leave it there. We'll be back in a moment with more on how the fight over abortion rights is impacting the midterms. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by our chief legal correspondent, Jan Crawford, and our political correspondent, Caitlin Huey-Burns. Good to have you both here at the table. Caitlin, I want to start with you. You've been covering abortion access in states around the country. And that's where the decision about access will be made, at the state level. There are five states where abortion access is literally on the ballot November the 8th. What's the expectation on whether this election will make access looser or tighter? CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: Yes, and in three of those states, California, Vermont, Michigan, the question is whether to amend the Constitution to enshrine abortion rights into law. And then the other two states there is either a ban or attempts to criminalize it. But the biggest one I'm watching is in Michigan, that ballot measure, because there's such a competitive governor's race there with Gretchen Whitmer, the incumbent, the Democrat, very much campaigning on this issue of abortion access and rights, trying to galvanize her base of support and reach out to those independent suburban women in particular. And it's interesting because Tudor Dixon, who's the Republican running against her, is trying to say to voters, look, you can vote for this measure and also vote against Gretchen Whitmer and vote for me. The biggest question that we've been having this election cycle, when it comes to ballot measures is, you know, does this actually translate to support for the Democratic candidate? MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: I was in Kansas covering that ballot measure where we saw overwhelming turnout, where we even saw Republicans vote for it. But that was a direct question to voters. And so when it's on the ballot with candidates, does that have the same effect? And I think Michigan will be an interesting test of that. We're also looking at states like Wisconsin and North Carolina, that don't have ballot measures, but the makeup of the state legislatures and other competitive races there could shape how this comes out because that's really where this is being decided, it's at the state legislative level. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is what the court intended. JAN CRAWFORD: Sure. I mean it said that, you know, this is not a federal constitutional issue. This is an issue the state should decide. And leave it to the political process. And that's what we're seeing. I think what's interesting, though, is, you know, some of the - the - the debate and the outcry among Democrats back in July has kind of receded a bit. I think once people realize the Supreme Court hadn't banned abortion when it overturned Roe versus Wade and that many state laws weren't really changing at all has kind of taken a backseat to issues like crime, inflation, the economy. But it does still have an impact. And then, on the flip side, I think it's important to remember for Republicans what that decision has done. Had the court refused to overturn Roe versus Wade, it would have really demoralized a key segment of the Republican base. Those voters who care deeply about social issues. The pro- lifers, the evangelicals, people who care about religious liberty. Instead, in order turning Roe, they're galvanized. Those voters are excited, enthusiastic about voting. And -- and that's an important segment for Republicans. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're also seeing, at the national level, where there isn't a law protecting abortion. The conversation from President Biden is, if Democrats win, I will enshrine abortion access, specifically at that 24- week -- the language that was in Roe. But then you have Senator Lindsey Graham trying to start the conversation and say it's got to be up until 15 weeks. Is the bottom line that we will just not see any national law, period, that it will stay at the states? CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: Well, what we're seeing is both sides are using it to galvanize their supporters, right? Democrats are threatening that Republicans get control and then there will be a ban. And Lindsey Graham handed them kind of a gift in saying, look, I would like to implement national restrictions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Restrictions but not a ban? CAITLIN HUEY-BURNS: But not an outright ban at 15 weeks. But I think, you know, and you talk to Republicans and they don't want to say at this point, yes, I'm supportive of a national ban, because they don't want to turn voters away. That they need to attract here. And it also kind of flies in the face of their argument that this should be a state's issue. But there - there is no question that this is a base amplifying issue and -- and Democrats need it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, I want to ask you about a case that is also getting politicized potentially here. Moore versus Harper. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about it to a progressive group and said it's about right-wing extremists having a plan to literally steal the next presidential election. That's a big statement. What is this case about and what's the outcome? JAN CRAWFORD: Well, she's talking about a case that the court's going to hear arguments on next month. And it involves this kind of -- called the independent state legislator theory. And to opponents, that's a radical theory that would really strip state courts from having any oversight into the election laws and procedures that are adopted by state legislatures for federal elections. Now, supporters of this new theory say, well, the federal constitution gives that power to the state legislatures, not to the state courts. And if you've got a problem, take it to federal court and they can deal with it. The question I think is not so much would it directly address things like seating presidential electors. The concern for opponents of this theory, and it is a serious concern that they have, is that if the court adopts this theory, then that sends a message, Katie bar the door, state legislatures can do anything they want. And that, they believe, is dangerous in terms of what they may try to do in some of these election laws and procedures. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, ladies, for tracking that for us. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. We will see you Tuesday for election coverage. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS WITH ANDREW WEISS \u2014 TRANSCRIPT PRODUCER: PAULINA SMOLINSKI MICHAEL MORELL: Andrew, welcome to Intelligence Matters. I am really excited about this conversation today. So it's great to have you. ANDREW WEISS: Thank you so much. It's great to be here. MICHAEL MORELL: Andrew, you've just published a very unique book titled Accidental Czar: The Life and Lies of Vladimir Putin. So congratulations. I'd like to start by asking you why you wrote the book. What art form you chose for the book, and why you chose that art form. ANDREW WEISS: I am a policy guy by background. I worked in different policy staff roles at the State Department, the Pentagon, the White House in an earlier stage of my career. And now I sit at a think tank. And one thing that's become pretty clear to me, the longer I work at a think tank, which is a great existence, is how the people who do what I do for a living are oftentimes pretty insular. And we're talking just to each other a lot of the time. And it's not really reaching the kinds of audiences that I think have right now- notice that Vladimir Putin is having an outsized impact on their daily lives. And we in our fields, I'm lucky to be an expert on Russia, have a pretty big, I think, obligation to help people grapple with some of these foreign policy things.\u00a0 And it's part of why I love your show so much. And I'm not just saying that. Because people care about what's going on in Ukraine and they want to know more. And this book in part was aimed at them. It was also aimed at young people who really love graphic novels. And then graphic novels themselves are just magical. And I don't know if you've looked at some of them, but they deal with hard subjects a lot of times. But they grab you in a very heavy duty way. And it was all of those motivations wrapped up together. MICHAEL MORELL: And then can you say a few words about your illustrator, Brian \"Box\" Brown because the illustrations are just knock your socks off. ANDREW WEISS: Thanks for saying that. I'm sure Brian will be really gratified to hear that. I was, like a lot of people, I'm not super nerdy about graphic novels, but the ones I've read all tend to look pretty literal. And when I was first connected to the editor of this book, who's a graphic novelist himself but runs an imprint at Macmillan, he gave me a bunch of books to read as a source of inspiration. He gave me books about the theory, like the academic theory of how comics work and why they're so effective at grabbing people and your emotions and your brain. And then he gave me these books by Box Brown, and the books Brian had written are on pretty wacky topics. He's written about Andre the Giant. He wrote about Andy Kaufman, the comic actor from the eighties, a book on Taxi. He wrote a history of Tetris, so he's never illustrated someone else's book. But when I heard from my editor, Mark Siegal, that Brian was interested in drawing this book, even though he'd never drawn someone else's book, I was just shocked because Brian's work doesn't look like a kind of latter day Dick Tracy. It has this really unique, kind of minimalist feel. And then the last thing I'll say is that when Brian and I started working together, I gave him tons of visual hints of what I wanted to be depicted in the book. But I was really adamant like, no dancing bears, no matryoshka dolls. Let's steer clear of visual cliches and let's build something new. MICHAEL MORELL: Andrew, the title.\u00a0 I want to ask you about three words in the title, Accidental, Czar, and Lies. Could you explain the use of each of those in the title? ANDREW WEISS: Sure. Vladimir Putin was plucked out of obscurity in the waning days of Boris Yeltsin as president to be his successor. And the reasons why he was plucked out have now increasingly either been lost to history or embellished. We all take it for granted that this guy has been around for two decades, and surely it was preordained that Vladimir Putin was going to be this formidable player on the world stage. Nothing of the sort. The Yeltsin presidency was unraveling. His family was deeply worried about retribution, imprisonment or worse. And they needed a loyal set of hands. And they turned to someone who had done that for a previous boss who had been the disgraced mayor of St. Petersburg, Anatoly Sobchak. And as kind of the fixer around Sobchak, Putin helped get him out of the country, one step ahead of the law, and had made sure that his boss never faced any kind of accountability for crimes committed in office. And Putin lived up to that role.\u00a0 The other thing that happened at the time was the people around Yeltsin wanted to figure out who the Russian people would embrace. And when they did focus groups, and this is a big part of the book, I tell the tale of how they went out and did testing of different historical figures of average Russians to try to figure out who they would rally around. And the person they found people would like the most, and it's kind of perverse, was a Nazi movie hero who was an undercover Soviet intelligence operative named Otto von Stierlitz, and he was played by a character actor who looked a lot like Jon Hamm from Mad Men. And so in the early days, when Putin was first being rolled out to the Russian public, they dressed him up to look like a dashing guy. And he flew in a jet fighter and he wore a Navy suit, a sailor suit, and did all these things to kind of look like an action hero. And it was a big managed effort to convince the Russian people that the country was in good hands. But unfortunately, over time, people in the West never really were in on the joke, and they never really understood why Putin's image was so cartoonish. And that was a big part of the motivation of writing it. MICHAEL MORELL: So that's accidental. ANDREW WEISS: Accidental. And then the czar stuff, is that at every point Putin has tried to legitimize himself. And the two easiest ways to do that are to embrace Russia's great victory or the Soviet Union's great victory over the Nazis in World War Two. And to treat that as like the sacred moment and the full legitimizing of whatever Putin does as he's the inheritor of this great thing that saved the world from Naziism. As well as harkening back to the great imperial legacies of the czars. And that's why you always see Putin and the Kremlin and these golden rooms and various Russian philosophers and things like that. But most of this is artifice. A lot of this is deliberately intended to create several things. One, a sense that it's historical, and whatever Putin's doing, therefore, is okay, as well as to harken back to this notion that Russia is surrounded and that they're a besieged fortress, surrounded by Western enemies, that will only survive if people rally around Vladimir Putin. So it's totally self-serving and it's artificial. MICHAEL MORELL: And then lies. ANDREW WEISS: The lies are just constant and there's not that much we know for sure about Vladimir Putin, like even writing a book like this, where I'm trying to tell the story of recent history, like why is he at war in Ukraine? What is motivating him? The lies are pervasive and it's a part of Russian and I think Putin's political culture to assume that you know that I know that you know that I'm lying. And that there's no perception on his part that lying is necessarily a bad thing. And that's one of the problems for people observing this from the outside is the things Russia says and does are often justified solely on the basis of things that are totally made up. And if we don't recognize that and we take at face value, for example, the idea that it's NATO enlargement that forced Russia to invade Ukraine, we're going to miss and totally not comprehend what our own interests are and what the dangers that we're facing actually are. MICHAEL MORELL: I walked away from reading the book with a handful of themes about Putin. And let me ask you about each one of them. And for each one, if you could explain sort of how the theme plays out, where it came from in terms of Putin's background and his history and how it impacts his decision making today. And the first one that jumped out to me was that this is a highly emotional guy. ANDREW WEISS: So the book starts literally, the very first scene in the book is to convey this notion that Putin can be highly emotional and impulsive. And there's a side of him which is very cunning and very opportunistic and nimble. And I don't want to deny the man all that he's accomplished as a result of those characteristics. But Putin spent ten years, he spent his whole childhood dreaming of joining the KGB, and then he spent ten years in a series of menial low end jobs and backwater assignments. And when the time came, this is literally the first scene in the book, for him to go into the training program to go overseas. He totally screwed it up. He was back home in his hometown of Leningrad on a subway train, and he got into a fight with some random people who were bugging him and he broke his arm. And the scene that opens the book is him talking to his best friend and saying, I don't think people in Moscow are going to really understand this. And I think there are going to be consequences. And I can't prove it, but I think it's a big part of how he ended up in East Germany in a backwater assignment in Dresden working in a tiny villa with six operatives. It was not where you put high flyers. It's where you put someone who's a hothead and who has real trouble keeping his emotions in check. MICHAEL MORELL: I was interested that you sat in on President Clinton's last call with Putin and how emotional Putin got in that call. ANDREW WEISS:\u00a0 So to set the scene, this was in early January of 2001, and we didn't use the call for simply exchanging pleasantries. It was done for policy purposes. And at the time, we knew that this hothead side of Clinton, of Putin, rather, was something that you could exploit, that if you made him lose his cool, especially compared to a smooth as silk person like Bill Clinton. It provided a little bit of leverage and an advantage to the U.S. side. And we were pushing the Russians to stop bullying one of their neighboring countries, Georgia. And as Clinton went through the talking points, Putin just lost it. And you can find the declassified memorandum of conversation in the Clinton library. I'll probably post it on my Twitter account after the show. And you can see that the person taking notes very politely says, at this point in the call, Putin becomes very enraged and loses control of himself. MICHAEL MORELL: And what was he enraged about? ANDREW WEISS: It was the classic thing of you shouldn't be bossing me around. And you don't understand what a dirty rat the leader of Georgia is. And just a grievance, an inventory of grievance. And this is something that now CIA Director Bill Burns talks about a lot, just that Putin, over the course of 20 plus years in power, has accumulated endless grievances against the United States for these things that he believes we've done wrong to Russia. And a lot of this is in his head. A lot of it is maybe based on his sense of inferiority or his sense that the U.S. is so much more powerful than Russia. But it animates him in a daily way and it really shapes his agenda. MICHAEL MORELL: The second theme, Andrew, that jumped out to me is that Putin is impulsive. And it sounds similar to being emotional, but it's but it's a bit different. Could you talk about that? ANDREW WEISS:Two really pivotal moments of Putin's impulsivity. One is in 2014, when he's presiding over this great party at the Sochi Winter Olympics and he's trying to show off how prosperous Russia has become under his rule. And the revolution breaks out in Ukraine. And in an impulsive moment, he decides that this is the moment to seize Crimea. And at the moment, it's a masterstroke. No one's killed. But then he pushes further and launches a covert war in eastern Ukraine, which becomes a total debacle. And you have different competing parts of the Russian intelligence apparatus supporting different groups of separatists. And this culminates in the shoot down of a passenger jet, a Malaysian airliner in July, that kills almost 300 people over eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 The second is when Putin believes, and I think it's key to why he's at war today, he watches the fall of the Afghan government in summer of 2021. And we had come pretty close to war in Ukraine in the spring. And that crisis was defused somewhat mysteriously by Joe Biden offering a meeting to Putin where he says, let's talk about some of the stuff. So the Russians pulled back their forces in early 2021. But it's really the fall of the Ghani government, Afghanistan, plus the departure of Angela Merkel as Germany's leader and the fact that the Zelensky government in 2021 was mired in endless trouble and mishaps that pushed Putin to feel like, hey, this is my moment. I can just invade this country and do it with a very small force which was not equipped to manage any kind of complicated insurgency or pushback by the Ukrainians. And he goes all in on a large land invasion of a neighboring country that's as big as Ukraine. It was incredibly foolhardy. MICHAEL MORELL: The third that jumped out to me was that he constantly seems to be seeking tactical advantage. ANDREW WEISS: Putin is nimble. And the way the Russian decision making system is set up, there aren't any checks and balances anymore. Those existed earlier on in his tenure. And you had people who had served with him in the KGB or who had been his lifelong associates who were in senior positions. And you had something that looked a lot more, not exactly like the Politburo, but at least created some semblance of checks and balances. That has gone out the window over the course of the two decades Putin's been in power. And increasingly, the people who surround Putin are implementers. They're either much younger or less experienced, and there's no one who gets ahead in the Kremlin these days by challenging the boss.\u00a0 And so the problem we've got is as Putin gets more and more backed into a corner in Ukraine and the losses keep mounting, is how does he respond to that? And is that sort of tactical, nimble side of him, which has brought great reward, for example, by saving the Assad regime in Syria in 2015? Is that becoming a source of risk and escalation? And I think that's a big part of why leaders like President Biden are so worried about all the nuclear saber rattling, because we just don't know what Putin might resort to if he starts to feel desperate. MICHAEL MORELL: What are Putin's overriding goals as the leader of Russia? What does he want from a big picture perspective? I'm not talking about just Ukraine here, but rather rather overall. And what's the fundamental source of his objectives as the leader of Russia? ANDREW WEISS: A big part of why I wrote the book was precisely to get at that issue and to dispel some of the myths and self-serving narratives that circulate in Western media or even an official discourse about Russia, and not to mention Russian discourse. The three things that I think animate Putin every day are first, regime security. So he's deeply concerned about staying in power, and he's been worried over the course of these two decades about spontaneous grassroots demonstrations in various parts of the world, most famously in the Arab Spring and then before that in a series of color revolutions in post-Soviet countries. He's really worried that people might take things into their own hands and say to him, you're out. So that animates him.\u00a0 Second factor is the notion of a strong state and that when he took over as president in 2000, the Russian state had really atrophied. The Yeltsin years had been a period of great devolution of power. And what he's done over the course of the 20 years is re-centralized power in the Kremlin. And there's a word in Russian which means a believer in a strong state, and the interests of the state should trump everything. It should trump the rule of law, should trump the rights of the individual.\u00a0 And then lastly, and this is where the United States comes in, he has been believing for the better part of almost 20 years now that the U.S. is overbearing and that it's important for the new international system to emerge where the U.S. is not at the center, we're not creating the rules. And that other rising powers, whether it's China, Russia, India, Brazil, you can come up with your own list that they should have more of a leadership role in setting the rules and that effort to kind of undermine the U.S., to chip away at our legitimacy on the international stage, to humiliate us, to show us to be hypocrites. That's a big part of Russian foreign policy, and it's been that way since the era, which you'll remember a former Russian prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, who, of course, before being prime minister, had been the head of the SVR, the Russian intelligence service. MICHAEL MORELL: There was a number of stories that you tell in the book. You've mentioned some of them are ready. All of them grabbed me when I read the book. And what I would love to do is I'd love to throw out some of those stories and get you to talk about them and talk about how they fit into the narrative of who Putin is and what he's doing in the world. And the first one, it comes to my mind, is the attempted overthrow of Tsar Nicholas I in December 1825. I found this fascinating. ANDREW WEISS:\u00a0 At that point there were a group of nobles who had been meeting in secret societies. Russia was an aristocratic society and there were people of means who would get together to talk about the ideas of the Enlightenment. And the Decemberists tried to overthrow the Tsar and insist on having some of the more basic aspects of representative constitutional monarchism introduced into Russia. And it's worth reminding people, because this is just a key part of how Russia diverged from the West, that, for example, the notion of private property and allowing aristocrats to own the land that they were in charge of emerged 500 years after it emerged in England. So Russia has just lagged behind all the rest of Europe. And what happened when the failed overthrow of Nicholas I occurred was he set about building a much more repressive state. And so the forerunners of the secret police that the Tsarist era and then the Soviet era, modernized and expanded, were created in that time frame. Intense level of censorship over people in the world of culture and arts was introduced and to give Tsar Nicholas I some credit. There were a wave of popular revolutions across Europe in the 1840s. And Russia totally dodged that bullet. MICHAEL MORELL: This seems very linked to what you just talked about in terms of the strength of the state, regime security. Is that the right way to think about it? ANDREW WEISS: Absolutely. And it was a much lighter touch form of repression. It was mostly aimed at people in the elite. And I think that lays some of the seeds for what we've seen in the subsequent 100 plus years, which is the Russian elite tends to be pretty servile and it doesn't tend to get up on its hind legs and say things like, stop the criminal war in Ukraine. We can't take it anymore. They more or less know what's expected of them, and they understand that if they don't obey, and this comes out in the book. For example, prominent aristocrats were stripped of their titles for participating in this December's rebellion. Others who wrote long essays criticizing some aspect of the Tsar system were put in an insane asylum for having challenged the tsar. The view then which I think is still the view today is you should keep your opinions to yourself and obey. MICHAEL MORELL: Another story that jumped out at me was the impact of World War Two on Putin's family, particularly his parents and his brother. ANDREW WEISS: It's a horrible story. And it really is the collective sense across Russian society and all the post-Soviet successor states that losing 27 million people in a war is a big deal. And it affected Putin's family very directly. His father came home from fighting during the siege of Leningrad, in which nearly a million people died of starvation or during the shelling of the city. People resorted to eating the glue on the back of wallpaper and boiling leather goods to stay alive and eating nettles and things like that. Putin's older brother died. He was taken away from the family and put in an orphanage so he'd have enough to eat. Putin never met his brother. His brother is buried in a mass grave somewhere in Leningrad. And Putin's father supposedly came home one day and found his wife on a cart laden with corpses. And he said, she's not dead yet. And he badgered the people driving the cart to pull her back into his apartment. MICHAEL MORELL: And in what way did all of this affect Putin himself? ANDREW WEISS: Putin grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, and his parents were a simple working class family. He was an only child. So he definitely got a lot of attention, but he didn't really perform well as a kid, and he fell into the wrong crowd. He spent a lot of time getting into trouble as a teenager. And his family, this is literally in the first pages of the book, gives up on him. And what changed his life was he became obsessed with pop culture, glorifying the KGB, which was very prevalent in the time when he was a teenager in the sixties and then later in the seventies. And when he was in ninth grade, he walked up to the main KGB building in Leningrad and knocked on the door and said, I want to work here. And the person who answered the door said, we don't take walk-ins, kid, beat it. And Putin then said, what do I need to do to work here? And the guy said, you need to go to college or go serve in the military. And Putin threw himself into school work and to give the man his due again. He is a seriously hard worker who spent a lot of effort in high school getting into the hardest law school, most selective law school in Leningrad, and then wormed his way into the KGB. He shows the power of persistence and careerism in that system. MICHAEL MORELL: Another one that jumped out at me was the protesters outside the KGB villa in East Germany during the collapse of that country. And of course, Putin was inside. ANDREW WEISS: This comes back to what we were talking about earlier, which is the lies. And when Vladimir Putin was stuck in this nowheresville assignment in Dresden, there were several things that were happening. And I think they are cardinal to understanding what motivates him today. The then East German regime unraveled really quickly over the course of 1989. You had people power. You had people on the move trying to escape out of East Germany, to get to the west, to get to freedom. And then you had people on the streets and they attacked the main Stasi building, the East German secret police building. And at some point, Putin sees the protesters leave the main Stasi building and prison where they've liberated political prisoners. And they came to the villa where he was working as this member of a small KGB team and as the hagiography of Putin has run and accelerated over the course of two decades. What was once just a small, pretty nothing incident has now been transformed at the hands of Kremlin propaganda into a situation where Putin single handedly staved off a crowd of thousand plus people and fended them off with a gun. And they broke through the fence and all the stuff. Again, it's all artifice. He basically told people,\u00a0 scram, this is a Soviet military facility. Please leave me alone. And ultimately, they went away. MICHAEL MORELL: And then two stories about the U.S., the first President Clinton's stop in Moscow on his way to Vietnam in 2006. ANDREW WEISS: This was a moment when the U.S. policy toward Russia was largely to ignore Russia in the wake of the Iraq war. You'll remember national school adviser and then Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had this slogan, which was punish France and ignore Russia. And that at that point, the president wanted to fly from the U.S. to an Asian leaders summit, and they needed to have a refueling stop and to just show you how low Russia's stock was in the world when they made the plan for the president to refuel Air Force One. They didn't want him to go into Moscow and meet Putin at his office. They insisted that Putin come to the airport, sort of like the poor relation or the supplicant, and have a meeting with the president in an airport lounge. And that's in fact, what happened. MICHAEL MORELL: It must have been humiliating for Putin. ANDREW WEISS: Absolutely. MICHAEL MORELL: And then the second are the protests that occurred in Russia after the presidential election there in 2011. And Putin's perceptions of those protests. ANDREW WEISS: This is a great illustration of both why, even if you're paranoid, you do have enemies. There was a spontaneous outpouring of anger in 2011 when Putin announced that he was going to come back to the Kremlin and that the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev was basically a big sham and that he'd been term limited out by the Russian constitution, and he had just stuck his friend and longtime associate Dmitry Medvedev in a make believe presidency.\u00a0 The protests that broke out in Moscow in late 2011, though, which were spontaneous and showed the main beneficiaries of the Putin regime coming out on the streets and saying, we can't just be subjects. You need to treat us like citizens. At that moment, when the very first protests had occurred, Putin very opportunistically came out and claimed falsely that the State Department had orchestrated the whole thing and that anybody who was out on the streets was just in the employ of the evil U.S. government and was out there trying to bring Russia back to the bad old days of the 1990s.\u00a0 That has been a very successful tactic for Russian politics for the past 20 years. If you portray your enemies as being a fifth column or the agents of George Soros, that is the way to discredit them. The other thing that- and this connects to a big theme of the book is Putin put on this kind of make believe clothing around this time as a family values moral conservative. And he tried to use that set of themes as a way of discrediting anyone who was out on the streets protesting. Ultimately, people around the world have come to see Putin as someone who stands, for example, against LGBT equality, and they don't seem to really understand that again, that's artifice, that that's not really who the guy is. MICHAEL MORELL: I'd love to ask a couple of questions about Ukraine. Why did Putin do this? Why did he invade Ukraine? ANDREW WEISS: About a year ago, one of my Carnegie Endowment colleagues and I, who's the former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia, Eugene Rumer, and I wrote a paper about why war was coming. And the name of the paper was Ukraine: Putin's Unfinished Business. And what we looked at was how after the first phase of the war had begun in 2014, there were a series of things happening inside Ukraine that made the Russian leadership, particularly Putin, very uncomfortable. And you had basically every year more and more funding going in for strong bipartisan support to modernize Ukraine's military, to do other security type things. And it was basically creating an aircraft carrier parked off the coast of southern Russia in metaphorical terms. And Putin, looking at this, definitely thought, wow, if this mushroom is going to grow, it would be better to get it now.\u00a0 The other thing that we looked at was how there was something about the failure to protect strategic depth made Putin and the Russian leadership feel more vulnerable vis a vis the United States and Europe. And if you look at one of the major animating factors of Russian foreign policy going back a couple hundred years, it's really this concern about control over the land between Moscow and Berlin and the loss of strategic depth and basically having a NATO friendly country right along Russia's borders is what made them so nervous.\u00a0 And then lastly, and this is it gets at the kind of bizarreness of how the pandemic treated Putin, who is, as I've been joking, had the worst work from home experience of any major leader. He marinated himself during that pandemic and social isolation with a handful of bodyguards, one or two friends, and read a ton of archival releases from the Russian state archives of diplomacy and vague history about why Ukraine is not a real country. And he really convinced himself that the people of Russia and Ukraine are just the same and that we should be together. And he wrote this really long treatise. It's about a 7,000 word article in the summer of 2021, laying all this out. And every time you asked the man a question, he repeats the same pseudo historical portrayal of Ukraine as a country that just doesn't really exist. And it's a fantasy. MICHAEL MORELL: So how dangerous is the situation? This talk of the use of nuclear weapons, the risk of escalation given our involvement. How do you think about that question? ANDREW WEISS: I think it's remarkable how much the Ukrainian side has been able to achieve. A lot of us got that wrong and thought that the Russians would walk all over them. The Ukrainians showed incredible pluck and creativity and they've had a ton of help. They've obviously gotten $19 billion worth of American weapons and a ton of intelligence and other support from us and our European allies. It's a remarkable coalition that is supporting them. But the danger is that escalation can still happen. And we've seen a couple of attacks in the last couple of months. For example, the attack on the bridge to Crimea. There was an attack on the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet. About two weeks ago, there was a car bombing, a targeted killing in Moscow. So there are things that are happening that suggest that something may happen, which none of us can predict, that sends this crisis into a new, more dangerous phase. And then there's the fact that the Russians aren't done yet. And we just need to keep reminding ourselves that the goal Russia has, which is regime change, forceable destruction of Ukraine as an independent sovereign nation, and its reabsorption into Russia, those are still what's driving Vladimir Putin. And there's nothing we can give him that's going to make him go away. MICHAEL MORELL: How do you think about his staying power in Russia as a result of what he's done here? ANDREW WEISS: I think we all overstate our hopes that something, whether it's a street protest or an unhappy bodyguard or some group of well-placed tycoons are going to march in Vladimir Putin's office some day and say, knock it off. But Putin has built 20 plus years of regime that is aimed at keeping him in power. And the economy has been shattered by what he's done in Ukraine. He's deglobalized his country after 30 odd years of integrating it into the global mainstream. He has made Russia undoubtedly more backward, more isolated and poorer than any previous Russian leader going back into the Soviet period.\u00a0 You'd have to look there to see someone or Gorbachev.\u00a0 And the problem is, there just are no counterbalances. There's no public pressure on him. The public is heavily atomized and de-politicized. They're worried about their kids being called up and sent to Ukraine. But what you see is that the people who are resisting the call up are the most worldly and educated, highly educated segment of Russia's population. So it creates a kind of more downtrodden segment of the country that's left behind. And in fact, that creates more of an insurance policy for Vladimir Putin. All of that said, it's a rickety place and stuff happens. And we've been surprised multiple times by the collapse of the Soviet bloc in '89, by the collapse of the Soviet in '91. People in my line of work have got to be very humble about our predictive capabilities. MICHAEL MORELL: There's a great quote on the jacket cover of the book, and it says that Putin has successfully cast himself as a cunning, larger than life political mastermind and that the rest of the world has played into his hands by treating him as one. Can you talk about that? ANDREW WEISS: There's a tendency to portray Putin as like a chess master who always thinks things through and who's two or three moves ahead of stuff. And in fact, what we see is someone who most of the time is improvising and engaged in trial and error. And the most recent examples of this are the horrible attacks on civilian infrastructure where he's trying to make it miserable and cold and unpleasant. There'll be no drinking water, there'll be no heat in people's apartments during the brutal winter that lies ahead in Ukraine. He's similarly destroyed Russia's very lucrative energy relationship with Europe. He's engaged in a series of trial and error experiments right now to somehow get an edge and to get the momentum that he's never had on the ground in Ukraine in military terms.\u00a0 We shouldn't assume that Vladimir Putin knows where his red lines are. That is a big part of the problem of dealing with someone like him, is he doesn't communicate what his goals are. And by keeping them shrouded, we're all forced to just keep guessing. What is it Russia really wants or what does Putin really care about? There's a good line that was true in the first phase of the war, and it's true today. It's possible that Putin really doesn't know what his red lines or know what he actually wants out of Ukraine and that he's just making it up in a very ad hoc way and that makes him all the more dangerous. MICHAEL MORELL: Andrew, last question. There's a spot in the book where you say that a senior Western diplomat once gave you the best explanation you've ever heard about what it's like to deal with Putin. Can you share that? ANDREW WEISS: This is one of my favorite illustrations, and it really captures why Brian Brown is such a genius artist. So I was briefed by a Western diplomat once about the three sections of Putin's brain. And the first section is all the garbage that's poured into his brain every day by the Russian intelligence services and the career bureaucracy. It's conspiracy laden, hall of mirrors, carnivalesque stuff that just is wacky. The second hemisphere of his brain is what's accumulated over 20 plus years of actually being in the room and doing all these important things. And it's the grievances and the historical understanding of how the world came to be in his mind so unfair and all the ways Russia's been mistreated. And then the third hemisphere is the one that we all live in just by reading the newspaper and being attentive to what's going on. And the problem when you're talking to Putin is he toggles among those three hemispheres back and forth in the course of any conversation. You just never know which of the three is what's driving what's coming out of his mouth. MICHAEL MORELL: The book is Accidental Czar: The Life and Lies of Vladimir Putin and the author is Andrew Weiss. Andrew, thank you so much for joining us. ANDREW WEISS: It's a pleasure to have been here. Thank you, Michael.",

And this week on Face the Nation: December kicks off with some bright spots when it comes to the economy. How will they impact that cloudy financial forecast for next year? The race to get as much done before the holidays as possible is on here in the nation's capital. International diplomacy has stepped up on a number of fronts, but will Vladimir Putin bend to new overtures to end Russia's war in Ukraine and return U.S. prisoners? With continuing protests in Iran and new challenges when it comes to China, we will talk to the Biden administration's top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Then: Last week saw positive economic news on the jobs front, a surge in holiday shopping and a drop in gas prices. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): The Americans are working, the economy is growing, wages are rising faster than inflation. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But there have been some big layoffs in media and the tech sector. And the Fed is likely to raise interest rates again later this month. We will talk with Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. And as new House leaders prepare for the next Congress, we will talk to Mike Turner, the presumptive Republican Intelligence Committee chair, and the new number three Democrat, California Congressman Pete Aguilar. Finally, that last Senate seat will be decided in a Tuesday run-off in Georgia. We will tell you what's at stake, and we will check in with the Obama administration's Attorney General Eric Holder. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We've got a lot to get to today, but we want to jump right in with our first guest, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who joins us from the State Department. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary. ANTONY BLINKEN (U.S. Secretary of State): Margaret, good morning. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start with some breaking news overnight out of Iran. They have abolished the morality police. This is after months of protests following the death of Mahsa Amini, who died because she was taken into custody since her head wasn't adequately covered. Does this stop the protests that have been raging? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: That's up to the Iranian people. This is about them. It's not about us. And what we've seen since the killing of Mahsa Amini has been the extraordinary courage of Iranian young people, especially women, who've been leading these protests, standing up for the right to be able to say what they want to say, wear what they want to wear. And so if the regime has now responded in some fashion to those protests, that could be a positive thing. But we have to see how it actually plays out in practice and what the Iranian people think. This is about them, and it's up to them. MARGARET BRENNAN: We've also seen protests in China because of these COVID lockdown policies. They seem to have died out in recent days. Is that because the police state stopped them, or have they actually had an effect? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Well, we've seen, apparently, some easing of the COVID restrictions in recent days, but very hard for us to -- to speak to that. There again, we've been standing up for the basic principle that people should have the right to make their views known peacefully, to protest, as the case may be, to vent their frustrations. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your deputy, Wendy Sherman, gave a speech here in Washington on Friday, where she said: \"I think war is potentially possible because Xi Jinping now has absolute control in China.\" You're about to go to China. Do you agree with that assessment? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: So, Margaret, we're in an intense competition with China. And, of course, there's nothing wrong with competition itself, as long as it's basically fair and on a level playing field. And we're working with countries around the world to build convergence on the approach to China, which I have seen get very strong in Europe, in -- in Asia. And the president has a strong determination to ensure that the competition does not veer into conflict. That's one of the reasons that he spent three hours with Xi Jinping in Indonesia on the margins of the G20. It's one of the reasons that he asked me to go to China early next year, making sure that we're talking, we're communicating, we're making clear what we're about, what our intents are, what we're doing. That's vitally important. The world is threatened. MARGARET BRENNAN: But war is potentially possible, is what she said. SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: The determination that we have is to make sure that the competition does not veer into conflict. And this is also what the world expects of us. They expect us to responsibly manage the relationship with China. This is something that I hear from countries around the world. It's exactly what President Biden is doing, standing up strongly for our interests and values, working with other countries who are similarly situated to advance them, making sure that we're keeping the context open, keeping the dialogue open. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Russia. President Biden says he has no plans to speak with Vladimir Putin, but he would if there was an indication he wanted to end the war. The president's top military adviser, Mark Milley, has said that, during this cold period, combat will slow and there could be a window for diplomacy. You're the top diplomat. Do you think there's value in trying to start talks? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: There's always value in diplomacy, if the parties in question and, in this case, Russia are actually interested in meaningful diplomacy. And what we've seen, at least recently, is exactly the contrary. Even as President Zelenskyy, from Ukraine, came to the G20 countries, the leading economies in the world, and put out a proposal for how to move forward toward peace, what did Vladimir Putin do? He doubled and tripled down on everything he was doing, mobilizing more forces, annexing territory in Ukraine, and now trying to weaponize winter. He's been unable to win on the battlefield, so he's taking -- he's basically turning his ire and his fire on Ukrainian civilians, going after the energy infrastructure, trying to turn off the lights, turn off the heat, turn off the electricity. That's what's going on. So, unless and until Putin demonstrates that he's actually interested in meaningful diplomacy, it's unlikely to go anywhere. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration did put an offer on the table when it comes to a prisoner swap with Russia. That was back in July. SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Two weeks ago, you said Russia has a failure to seriously negotiate. Has that changed? Is Russia serious now? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Margaret, as you know, we did put a significant proposal on the table many months ago. And, since then, we've been engaged repeatedly in any way that we can to try to advance it and to look to see if there are different permutations that could achieve what we're trying to achieve, which is to get our people home, Brittney Griner, Paul Whelan. We're engaged in that on a -- on a regular basis. And it's my determination that we bring our people home. We will not stop until we do. MARGARET BRENNAN: But if these talks are now active and ongoing, as the White House said, that suggests you think there is some reason to believe they're serious now. You said they weren't serious a few weeks ago. SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: As they say, Margaret, the proof will be in the pudding. We have to see if the engagements that we've had, the discussions that we have produce an actual result. That's the most important thing. But we are not resting on -- on the laurels of having put forward a proposal some months ago. We've been actively engaged over these many months to try to move things forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: The offer, for our viewers, was to release a convicted arms dealer known as the Merchant of Death, Viktor Bout. There are two Americans being held. You named them right there, Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan. Brittney has been in custody for less than a year. Whelan, a former Marine, has been in captivity since 2018. Russia wants a one-for-one swap. How do you decide which American gets left behind? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: So, I'm not going to get into the details of this. It would be counterproductive for me to get into the specifics of anything that we're saying or that the Russians are saying and that we're hearing. My determination is, one way or another, as long as it takes to get people home. My efforts, the efforts of the entire administration are to bring both Paul and Brittney home. MARGARET BRENNAN: To bring them both home, but Russia wants a one-for-one swap. SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Again, I'm not going to get into the -- into the details of where we are. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's what Russian media has been reporting. So, in your view, is it all or nothing? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Well, Russian media -- Russian media reports a lot every day that I wouldn't necessarily take at face value. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that's not what the Russians have told you? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Again, I'm not going to get into the details of it. Look, the -- the other side gets a vote in this. It's not just what we want. It's what they're prepared to do. And this is something that we're working on almost every day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. And I know their families would love them home by Christmas, which is why I'm asking you. I want to also, before I let you go, ask about Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu is on trial for corruption, but he right now is trying to piece together an alliance to form a government. If he does, he'll become prime minister again. I know you know this. But he's been allying himself with figures who have spewed anti-Arab, anti- gay hate, as well as discrimination against non-Orthodox Jews. One of them wants to cancel gay pride parades. At least two have called for mass deportations of Palestinians, including the man who may head Israel's police force. Doesn't this makeup really jeopardize your intention to have peace in the region? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Margaret, we have worked and we will continue to work with Israeli governments of every kind, just as Israeli governments have worked with American administrations of every kind. And we're determined to do that going forward. Our focus is less on personalities and more on policies. The important thing is, what policies does the government pursue? The government -- or the incoming government, at least, knows our views on a number of these issues. But we have an absolute commitment to Israel's security. That's not going to change. And, as we always have in the past, we'll -- we'll speak directly to each other. We will be very clear about what we think and what we believe with our Israeli allies. I'm sure they'll do the same. And, again, we'll focus on the policies, not the personalities. MARGARET BRENNAN: But these -- this extreme right-wing government, as it has been described, being put together does complicate your relationship? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Again, let... MARGARET BRENNAN: Because then you also have to spend time talking about not canceling gay pride parades, not deporting people, all these policies here. That's not what you want to focus on, which is settling peace, a two-state solution, which is being rejected by many of these figures. SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: I think we can run and chew gum at the same time. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not concerned about this? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Again, we're going to focus on what the government does. And, as we have with every past Israeli government, and as Israelis have with every past U.S. administration, we will work closely together. MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Blinken, you're a busy man. Thank you for your time this morning. SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Thanks, Margaret. Great to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Ohio Congressman Mike Turner, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. Congressman Turner, good to have you here in person. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Thank you. Yes, it's great to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, just yesterday, the director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, said that Russia was perhaps struggling to keep up with the amount of munitions that it's using in this war in Ukraine. The cold weather is slowing combat. The secretary of state, though, didn't really give hope for diplomacy at this moment. Given what you know, when will this war end? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, the one thing that we know is that the - - the gains that Ukraine is making are real. They're real in the battlefield. They're real in the support that they have around the world, they have with democracies on the floor of the United Nations in condemning this aggression by Russia. But Ukraine really has to be the one that decides that if, when, and how negotiations are entered into. And, at this point, they're battling for their country. They're losing lives for democracy. President Zelenskyy says -- I was just in Ukraine just before the elections. He says openly he understands that he's the front lines for democracy. And he's fighting an authoritarian regime. And I think, obviously, Russia has to reevaluate how they look at this conflict and how Putin looks at what he has started. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you agree with the administration on this? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I agree, absolutely, that this is -- this is something where -- look, this is a war of aggression that Russia needs to reevaluate and to withdraw from Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said -- because you are poised to run the Intelligence Committee, since you are at the top Republican, when Republicans take control in January, is this going to be an area where, as you promised, you can take politics out of it and actually work across the aisle? What does that mean? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right. So, we've -- when I went -- we went on a bipartisan trip to deliver to President Zelenskyy a message that there's bipartisan support for Ukraine. I think there's a number of issues that we're going to be working on, on a bipartisan basis. What should the United States policy be? How do we make certain that the -- I serve on the Armed Service Committee and the Intelligence Committee. How do we make certain that they get the weapon systems that they need? How do we hold together this world alliance that -- that we have, where the world is condemning what Russia is doing? And, of course, the expansion of NATO. We're looking forward to Sweden and Finland joining NATO, which is the opposite of what Putin believed he was going to achieve in attacking Ukraine. He now sees the expansion by two valuable partners with great military capabilities joining NATO. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to show our viewers some pretty extraordinary video that the Pentagon unveiled this week, a B-21 Raider. It's the first U.S. nuclear stealth bomber aircraft in more than 30 years. And it's being packaged as this deterrent to China -- to China. How concerned are you about the pace of Beijing's nuclear development? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Extremely. And I want to commend the administration, because they've been very forward-leaning in releasing and declassifying information about what China is doing. They are expanding their nuclear weapons, their nuclear weapons capabilities, their ICBMs that are targeting the United States. This plane is incredibly important. I served as chair of the Air and Land Subcommittee, as we, on a classified basis, began the process of working on this plane. And it gives us an additional balance, because it's an additional delivery vehicle, additional way to combat what China's doing. MARGARET BRENNAN: To drop nuclear weapons? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: To cause people not to drop nuclear weapons. I mean, that's what's so... (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's really -- it's really the deterrent, right. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right. It is to make certain that the balance of power is there, so that people understand that the -- that the cost is just too great. When China is expanding the nuclear weapons, they're looking at the United States. If we blink, if we don't -- if we don't respond, then they assume that they can get first strike capabilities that not only holds us at bay, but really holds us at risk, because then you have the leader of a nuclear power that might make that miscalculation, and, of course, cost unfathomable lives. MARGARET BRENNAN: You talked about being open about intelligence. I'm wondering, in your new role, will you be asking the director of national intelligence for a briefing and a damage assessment related to Mar-a-Lago and the documents the former president took to his private home? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: That's already in process. I mean, we've already talked... MARGARET BRENNAN: It hasn't happened. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: It has not, but it's been largely a schedule... MARGARET BRENNAN: In the new Congress, will you ask for it? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes. And I have just talked to the director of national intelligence about this particular issue. One issue that we have -- I have discussed with the director which is very, very interesting is, is that, prior to the Mar-a- Lago and raid, no one in the intelligence community or in the national security community was engaged at all by the FBI to request an assessment as to what the risk of the documents that had been surrendered from Mar-a- Lago or that might have been at Mar-a-Lago, or that were even perceived as being missing. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you think the Justice Department should have... (CROSSTALK) REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: This was just the FBI and the -- and the archivist, which is basically a glorified librarian, coming together and deciding to raid Mar-a-Lago. Now, we need to get... MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're not downplaying that taking classified material to your private home... REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Absolutely not. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... is a problem, particularly for the commander in chief? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There were just -- there were other options that the FBI had vs. the escalation that -- that they did. That certainly is going to be one of the questions we have. The -- the director of national intelligence indicated they have conducted their risk assessment, and they are prepared to give both of our committees on the Senate and the House presentations as to what those are. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a sense of when or what the scale of the damage is? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: At this point, it's just a scheduling issue. We just had a meeting with the director, both Senator Warner, myself, and Adam Schiff. And, as they look to, how do we get everybody scheduled together, and those who've done the assessment -- because, again, it's not just a director that will be coming. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: They'll have to come forward to give us, what did they see, what do they have, and how do they perceive the threat that may or may not have existed from some of these documents? MARGARET BRENNAN: This may seem a basic question, but all elected leaders swear to uphold the Constitution. Does calling for its suspension, is that disqualifying for a presidential candidate? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: It's certainly not consistent with the... MARGARET BRENNAN: You know why I'm asking this question. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I do. It's certainly not consistent with the oath that we all take. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, yesterday, the front-runner for the Republican nomination, the standard-bearer for your party, posted on TRUTH Social -- and we know he lost the 2020 election, but continues to claim he did not -- \"A massive fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution.\" Should the standard-bearer for the Republican Party, the front-runner for the nomination for the presidency for your party in 2024, say this? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, you know, I -- first of all, I vehemently disagree with -- with the statement that Trump has made. Trump has made 1,000 statements in which I disagree. There is a political process that has to go forward before anybody is a -- before -- before anybody... MARGARET BRENNAN: Constitutional conservatives are pretty clear about where they value the Constitution. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right. Exactly. But be -- there has to be... MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there any scenario where suspending the Constitution... REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: You do get to pick the questions, but I do get to pick my answer. There is a political process question... MARGARET BRENNAN: I know. I'm trying to get you to answer the question I'm asking. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There is a political process that has to go forward before anybody's a front-runner or anybody is a -- even the candidate for the party. And I think that -- and I believe... MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you condemn him saying something like this? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Absolutely. And I believe, answering your question, that people certainly are going to take into consideration a statement like this as they evaluate a candidate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. I also have to ask you about the other statement and the people that he has been spending time with. A neo-Nazi, pro-Putin misogynist named Nick Fuentes came to have dinner with the former president at his home, alongside Kanye West, who just this past week praised Hitler. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: This is atrocious. This is -- everybody, I think -- everyone both condemns and is shocked and is as disgusted and nauseated by the fact that we're even, in this year, in 2022, having anyone that would make statements like that, nevertheless have anybody who would engage in a conversation with someone who's having -- making statements like that, absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: So having classified documents at the same place where they're having the dinner... REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well that's -- that's not... MARGARET BRENNAN: ... which were not necessarily securely held, and they're government records that should be in government property, all those things together, they're a problem. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, as you know, the FBI raided his home. And, supposedly, there are not classified documents there. But all of these are issues of judgment. And, as you... MARGARET BRENNAN: The premise of saying he doesn't know who he's having dinner with at that home. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: These are all issues of judgment, and a political process has to go forward. And I believe voters are smart, and they'll take those things into consideration in a political process. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for coming on and answering questions. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Good seeing you. Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in just one minute, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Midterm voting will finally, fingers crossed, be over after Tuesday's Senate run-off in Georgia between incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker. Democrats will control the Senate, but that 51st seat, if Warnock wins, will give them more power when it comes to building committees. And it means potentially fewer headaches for Democratic leaders over those single- senator holdouts we saw frequently in the last two years. CBS News congressional correspondent Nikole Killion reports from Atlanta. (Begin VT) WOMAN: Go, Dawgs! Go, Dawgs! NIKOLE KILLION (voice-over): On this SEC college football championship weekend, legendary Georgia running back Herschel Walker is hoping to follow the Bulldogs' win over LSU with a victory of his own Tuesday. HERSCHEL WALKER (R-Georgia Senatorial Candidate): We got these weak leaders in Washington. And I say, enough is enough. Now what we got to do is, we got to get out there and vote. NIKOLE KILLION: Georgia won the SEC Championship by 20 points. There's no way Tuesday's Senate election margin will be anywhere near that. Neither candidate made the required 50 percent threshold on November 8, forcing the race into overtime. Since then, the state's been bombarded with campaign ads and out-of-town visitors. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina): Starting for the state of Georgia, Herschel Walker! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) NIKOLE KILLION: The current president and his predecessor stayed away during the run-off, but one president who did return to Georgia, Barack Obama. BARACK OBAMA (Former President of the United States): Mr. Walker has been talking about issues that are of great importance to the people of Georgia, like whether it's better to be a vampire or a werewolf. (LAUGHTER) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: This is a debate that I must confess I once had myself... (LAUGHTER) FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: ... when I was 7. (LAUGHTER) NIKOLE KILLION: Here's what the former president was talking about: HERSCHEL WALKER: Vampires are some cool people, are they not? But I'm going to tell you something that I found out. A werewolf can kill a vampire. Did you know that? I never knew that. So, I didn't want to be a vampire anymore. I wanted to be a werewolf. NIKOLE KILLION: The Republican challenger has repeatedly struggled to combat controversial headlines, ranging from allegations of domestic abuse to revelations of tax records indicating his primary home is in Texas, not Georgia. Democrats say the controversies cut to Walker's character. SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-Georgia): What we're seeing is a disturbing pattern from Herschel Walker. And all of these women can't be lying. (End VT) NIKOLE KILLION: Voters here in Georgia had about a week of early voting. That's now ended. More than 1.8 million ballots have been cast. That's about a quarter of active voters. And, in just two days, we will find out who wins -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nikole, thank you. And this programming note: There will be a special Georgia run-off edition of Red & Blue on our CBS Streaming Network starting at 9:00 p.m. Tuesday. And we will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by California Congressman Pete Aguilar, the new number three Democrat in the House. Good to have you here. You are the highest-ranking Latino in congressional history. That is historic in this new job. It's a generational shift for Democrats in January. But, as you go into the minority, you also have less experienced leadership. What does that mean, because this is going to be a knife fight over the next two years with Republicans? REPRESENTATIVE PETE AGUILAR (D-California): Well, first of all, just how far we've come. And it's not lost on me the significance of being in this chair at this moment, with Hakeem Jeffries and Katherine Clark. But we're also going to be benefiting from the leadership of Jim Clyburn at the leadership table. MARGARET BRENNAN: And... (CROSSTALK) REPRESENTATIVE PETE AGUILAR: And -- and Nancy Pelosi and Steny Hoyer will be members of Congress. So, we're going to continue to do what's right for the American public. That's -- that's our number one message. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to talk substance in a moment. Stay with us. We have to pay the bills with this commercial break. One moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to continue our conversation with California Congressman Pete Aguilar. I had to cut you off and I apologize for that. I want to pick up where we left off. You are now finishing up this lame duck session before you move into this leadership role. We are seeing the focus really just being on keeping the government funded. As part of that, will you be able to put in the hundreds of millions of dollars that so many mayors are asking for to shore up border security in the next few weeks? You're from California. I saw a number of California mayors wrote this letter this past week. REP. PETE AGUILAR, (D-CA): I'm not familiar with the letter. I'm a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Committee, though. I can tell you these are conversations that we continue to have with our Republican colleagues each and every year as part of the regular order of the appropriations process. The number one goal is to fund government. And we're going to have to rely on reasonable Republicans to help us do that because so much is at stake. Just in your segment earlier, Mike Turner talked about the Ukraine funding. And I appreciate his willingness to meet us and to talk about the importance of Ukraine funding. But there are so many Republicans who are tied to this MAGA extremism who are talking about putting conditions on Ukrainian aid. We can't have that. That's the reason why we have to have reasonable budgets. And an important point of why we have to have this time right now, we need to have government funding. And we look forward to working with Republicans to get that done. MARGARET BRENNAN: The specific respect is for $500 million for FEMA and $300 million for humanitarian assistance because of this concern about Title 42 lifting at the end of this month. PETE AGUILAR: We need to do - MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't know if that's going to be it (ph) or not? PETE AGUILAR: We need to do everything we can to make sure that our border communities are taken care of. We had to do that previously. And we appreciate the administration and homeland security doing everything that they can to give humanitarian aids and grants to those communities to make sure that they could deal with - deal with those effects. It's important for us. There are so many ways that we can be helpful. And on the heels of the Trump administration separating children from parents, we appreciate the Biden administration coming in and being so thoughtful about how they do this. But it's going to - it's going to be a process. And we look forward to working with our local government and state allies to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: So -- also in a lame duck you are continuing to serve on this January 6th committee, which is coming to an end at the end of the month. Your colleague, Zoe Lofgren, was on this program a few weeks ago and she said, all the evidence for good or ill will be out within the month. When? How? When will we know when you've come to a conclusion? PETE AGUILAR: Well, I'm not going to get in front of Zoe Lofgren if she wants to - to tell you that. But I can tell you that Chairman Bennie Thompson, Vice Chair Liz Cheney, we're all committed to the transparency of this process, to putting out a fulsome report that talks about the facts and circumstances about what happened on January 6th. And Zoe Lofgren also talked - has talked about it, and Adam Kinzinger has talked about, there are important things that we have learned along the way within January 6th that we feel should be shared to the American public. And so we're going to do that. We're going to do it in a thoughtful way. Members are working each and every day, editing and looking at the documents that we will be putting out. In accordance with House rules, we are preserving the important documents and we're going to be transparent about this process. The American public will see a full report. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Will the Justice Department get all the underlying documents? Merrick Garland said at a press release - at a press conference earlier in the week that they'd like to get ahold of your evidence? PETE AGUILAR: We look forward to the Department of Justice and the American public seeing all of the work that we have done. And that includes transcripts and documents. There are -- MARGARET BRENNAN: When? PETE AGUILAR: Soon. Very soon, Margaret. I think in the next, you know, couple weeks. But clearly our - our committee ends on January 2nd. And so we're going to do this, this month, and put this information out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you personally believe that at this point there is enough evidence to send a criminal referral to the Justice Department regarding the former president? PETE AGUILAR: I'm not going to get ahead of what our report may or may not say. And I know you're asking personally -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Schiff and Cheney have said that. PETE AGUILAR: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not, sir? PETE AGUILAR: Look, I think -- I think that the evidence is - is pretty clear. I think we laid out a case to the American public who is responsible, who is primarily responsible for whipping up that crowd, sending them to the Capitol, and people's lives being endangered and Capitol Police officers losing their lives. I think it's pretty clear, based on the evidence, based on the hearings that we've done, who was responsible. But, right now, we're to the point, we have a couple weeks remaining here, and we're going to have more to say, the committee is going to have more to say on this, through our documents and through our public releases. So, I don't want to get ahead of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: The possibly incoming speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, has vowed to hold hearings about why the Capitol complex wasn't secure on January 6th. And he has faulted your committee for not focusing enough on this. How do you respond to that question of why there isn't more of a focus on security breakdowns? PETE AGUILAR: If and when that individual becomes the possible speaker and can count the votes to get there, I have my - I have my doubts. Look, we stand willing for anybody to stand the test of time and to look at the history of the documents of what we've put forward. But we are talking about security. We are talking about what happened that day. I think that what's happening is Kevin McCarthy has to do anything he can to appease the MAGA extremists within his party. He's trying to count to 218. If that means sending subpoenas to the committee members, if that means being tough to committee members, that's what he has to do right now because he's practically auctioning off real estate in the Capitol in order to secure the votes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he is also one of the people that your committee has asked to come speak and share information. Has -- he has refused to do so. Jim Jordan also potentially in a leadership role has refused to do so. What consequences do you think there should be? Should there be criminal referrals? I don't even know if you can do that, can you? PETE AGUILAR: No, that's not our -- that's not our intent. What we wanted to lay out to the American public is that those individuals, Jim Jordan and Kevin McCarthy, are fact witnesses to the events that happened. They talked to the president multiple times on that day. There's information that they can share. There's information that they shared on national TV and to their own colleagues in that moment. The fact that they don't want to share it to us so we can put together a fulsome report just shows that they aren't unbiased. And so that's why there's a little smirk when you asked me about Kevin McCarthy and January 6th because he's someone who hasn't been completely honest about what he knows and what happened that day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, congratulations on the historic achievement. I know you said it means a lot for your family and for people back home. And I do want to acknowledge being the first is a big deal. PETE AGUILAR: Thank you so much. I appreciate it, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for joining us. We'll be right back with former Attorney General Eric Holder. So, stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to former Attorney General Eric Holder. He now heads up the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and he has a book, \"Our Unfinished March,\" which examines the current state of America's democracy. Welcome back to the program. ERIC HOLDER, (Former Attorney General): It's good to see you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a number of things I want to get to with you, but I want to start on something I know is immediate this week. An organization that you run, that we mentioned here, that focuses on redistricting, is involved in a Supreme Court case. Moore versus Harper. It's going to be heard on the 7th of this week. And it boils down, as I understand it, to the question of what the Constitution means when it assigns state legislatures the task of regulating elections. That sounds really wonky, but you phrased it as the future of democracy being at stake. What are you worried is actually going to happen here? ERIC HOLDER: Yes, this case is all about something called the independent state legislature doctrine. It's a - it's a fringe theory that North Carolina Republicans are trying to use to make sure that the North Carolina Republican legislature has the sole responsibility of doing redistricting in the state and excluding from that determination the state court system. It is something that if the Supreme Court goes along with it, would really up-end our system of checks and balances, and it, for that reason, that I am extremely concerned. It is a fringe theory. This is something that if the court, I think, does the right thing, you should have a 9-0 opinion by the court that rejects this notion of this independent state legislature doctrine that has been rejected by conservative scholars, by practice Republican lawyers, by former Republican judges and by this conference of state Supreme Court justices as well. This is a very, very dangerous theory that would put our system of checks and balances at risk. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there are a number of Democratic senators who actually filed a brief urging the Supreme Court not even to hear the case. So, there are some heavy hitters here saying, don't even talk about it. What does that tell you about the potential harm here? I mean is there value in the Supreme Court hearing this and striking it down, or does them hearing it at all indicate something more to you? ERIC HOLDER: Yes, it's hard for me to see how this case was ever taken by the court. I think the better thing would have been for the court to simply have rejected it. But now, having taken the case, I would hope that the court would drive a stake through this notion of this independent state legislature doctrine and get it off the - off the books and out of our consideration once and for all. It truly is -- I cannot emphasize this enough, that it truly is a fridge theory that should result in a 9-0 rejection of the - of the theory. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we mentioned you're working on redistricting. Democrats are suing to overturn congressional maps in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Ohio, and Texas. I read a quote from you in \"The Washington Post\" that said the work you've been doing on redistricting has paid off in the most recent midterms. Do you think that your legal battles will help Democrats make gains in 2024? What are you trying to say there? ERIC HOLDER: Yes, I think that what we have seen, there have been studies that said that we have had the most fair redistricting process in the last 40 years as a result of the work that we have done. Seventy-five percent of the redistricting is considered to be fair, which also means that 25 percent of it is unfair. And that is still problematic. I think, for instance, the House of Representatives is going to be in play for the entirety of this decade. Very contrary to where it was it the past decade where after the successful Republican gerrymandering that occurred in 2011 and in 2012. But it was really difficult for Democrats to take the House back. I think Democrats would be able to take the House back as early as 2024, but it doesn't insure -- what we have done doesn't ensure that Democrats are going to hold onto the House for the entirety of the decade. It will be for the American people to decide. Fairness will reign in that determination. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were last on this program in May, you shared at the time that you had changed your mind recently, that you did believe that the Justice Department and Attorney General Merrick Garland should hold former President Trump accountable for his actions. You previously thought it would be too divisive for the country. Now, where we are with this special counsel, what is your assessment and how should Merrick Garland, who has to ultimately decide, weigh the question of a risk to political violence in this country from any decision he makes regarding the former president? ERIC HOLDER: Well, I think the attorney general has said it quite well, that he'll make the determination without fear or favor. There is -- everybody has to be held accountable to the same system. The determination that he's going to have to make will have to be based on the facts and the law. And we'll just have to deal with the consequences. The reality is that if he makes a determination one way or the other, it is going to be divisive. And so the best thing simply is to make sure that everybody who is under consideration for possible criminal treatment, including the former president, is treated just like every other American. And that's what that opinion out of the circuit court this week essentially said, that you can't craft things, as a district court judge, you can't craft things for a former president that doesn't exist for regular American citizens. Treat everybody in the same way, make the determination based on the facts and the law. And the United States, I think, has the capacity to absorb a possible indictment and to deal with it fairly and to get on with the business of - of the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: As someone who's been an attorney general, I wonder as well how you think about the case before the U.S. district attorney in Delaware regarding President Biden's son Hunter. CBS has reported the FBI has sufficient evidence to charge him with tax and gun-related crimes. How would you handle this? A plea deal? Is the attorney general boxed in to take a hardline decision because of working for the president? ERIC HOLDER: No. I mean you have -- they left in place the Republican -- the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware to consider the case. You've got career lawyers working on it, career FBI agents. You want to listen to their recommendations. And then again, make a determination base on the facts and the law. The defendant should not be treated any more harshly because of who he is, who he is related to, should not be given breaks because of who he is or who he is related to. He should be treated as former President Trump. Should be treated just like any other American citizen. If there's culpability, that person should be held liable for his or her acts. And if there is not a basis for a case, a case should not be brought. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it will ultimately come to the attorney general's desk? ERIC HOLDER: That's certainly the way I would run the Justice Department. And my guess is also that that would be something that Merrick Garland will be doing as well. That determination will be made, I suspect, in Washington, D.C. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. General Holder, thank you very much for your time today. And we'll be right back with much more FACE THE NATION. (ANNOUNCEMENT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and the mixed signals about its future. Brian Moynihan is the CEO and chairman of the board of Bank of America. And it's good to see you back here in person. BRIAN MOYNIHAN, (CEO and Chairman of the Board, Bank of America): It's good to be back here. It's been a couple years. Last time was right when the pandemic started. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know. I know. And I remember what a chilling moment that was and yet we are still living through the implications of that pandemic. Your firm is predicting a recession in 2023, but a brief and a mild one. I wonder when it hits, and what a mild recession feels like for the average American. BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, just to sort of be concrete on numbers, they basically picked negative growth around 1 percent or so for the next -- for the first three quarters of '23, and then it comes back to positive growth. That means the year is negative overall. But -- but it's just 1 percent. So, you think about a recession, we were sitting here, we went down 30 percent that next quarter and stuff. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BRIAN MOYNIHAN: So this is a more mild recession, largely because down the line activity is still strong. And that's the tension and the Fed trying to cool down inflation, while at the same time not drive the economy into a deep recession. MARGARET BRENNAN: But when people hear recession, it - it affects their planning for the future. It affects their feeling of security in the jobs they have. I mean just this past week we saw a string of job cuts being announced at tech companies, at media companies. Is this the beginning of a wave? BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, this is -- this is what happens. And when you - when you raise interest rates, you know, the Fed is trying to slow down economic activity. And where does it slow down first? The most rate sensitive. Houses. Housing's tipped over. You know, cars. Prices go up. Although sales have stayed strong on new cars because they weren't there and they just have become available. But used car prices have tipped back down. So they're -- the most rate sensitive are affected by it. What takes longer to happen is the final demand for entertainment, for hotels, for travel is still very strong. And so if you look at spending and our customers, the month of November was about 5 percent over last year. If you go back and think early in the year it was running 10 percent, 12 percent. So, what's happened is consumers are slowing down their spending. They still have money in their accounts. It's starting to come down a little bit. They still have borrowing capacity, but they've started to use it. So, all that means that the Fed rate hikes are slowing down the economy. The question is, when will inflation tip down and then they can back off. And that's the (INAUDIBLE). So we've gone from what's temporary - with inflation, temporary, which was last year's discussion, to it's real. Now the question is, how long will they have to hold rates here? How long will they have to hold rates at this level to keep the economy - to get inflation down without hopefully hurting the economy? And that's the debate we're going through right now. But you're seeing the signs in terms of job openings declining a little bit. You're seeing the signs of turnover slowing down at companies. And while those may not be good signs for the individual involved, it's actually good signs for the economy in terms of it starting to get into a better situation that it can grow at a more normalized rate. MARGARET BRENNAN: You - you're fairly characterizing all the different pieces here, but you do sound more optimistic than many of your peers, even those who are predicting a recession, like JP Morgan. They famously -- their strategist said a category one economic hurricane is on the horizon. What would move you from mild to gale force winds? I mean how - how do we - - what changes things along the way? BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, the belief was when the Fed started raising rates that there would be an immediate snap to the economy. The - the thing that didn't happen. Those predictions were from the, you know, spring of this year, in '22. What didn't happen because the consumers remained strong and the amount of stimulus (INAUDIBLE) in the economy was so high, it didn't happen the way people thought. Unemployment is still 3.7. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BRIAN MOYNIHAN: They just had 200,000 jobs. So how could you have an unemployment-less recession? That's almost hard to posture, right? So, all the math and science that people looked at for years has kind of gotten thrown straight because a massive stimulus went in. So, if you looked where -- all of the guests you had on this morning talked about parades of horribles, the Russia/Ukraine situation, what's going on in China. Those things all would change the basic outlook. But if they just stay - right now it's kind of (INAUDIBLE) they stay sort of status quo and it doesn't solve but it doesn't get worse. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Oil prices stay around $100 a barrel more or less. They were there for five years, between 2010 and 2015. So none of that kills the economy (ph) on its own. But all those things going in a very wrong direction, you'd see a massive change in the economic activity. And that's what -- that's what people are trying to hamstring. In the base projections most people have, the Wall Street firms and stuff, it's all pretty similar. So, a shallow recession with a recovery later. Rates stay a lot, a lot higher than people think for a longer period of time, meaning all the way into the end of '24 because inflation is harder to choke off because there's such underlying cash in the system. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BRIAN MOYNIHAN: And that - that's what nobody's ever dealt with. Now, where does that cash come from? The government gave out a lot of stimulus. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BRIAN MOYNIHAN: The problem is, the government's running high deficits. And that's why, when you talked earlier about det ceilings, those are important things to not have create problems in the economy. And I think all business people -- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's one of your worries for - for 2023? BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Yes. All - all business people don't like surprises and we'd like to make sure that we got through a normal budget process and a normal, you know, debt ceiling process and - MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're not confident about that because of -- BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, I just -- I've been CEO for 13 years now and I've had some interesting times on this, but generally it works out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. BRIAN MOYNIHAN: And I have confidence that people come to the table, there will be a lot of discussion. You talked about it with some of your guests. But ultimately it has to get there because ultimately we have to run this great country because it's got 300 million people that the world depend on. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the economy and the market not the same thing but the political - you know, the adage was that political gridlock is good for the markets. That's the way it used to be. I wonder if the environment's different now. Your strategist also said they're bearish. They worry unemployment in 2023 will be as shocking to main street consumer sentiment as inflation was in 2022. So, how do you recommend to clients they protect themselves if we're going to see the markets possibly take a downturn? BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Well, and that's - so, unemployment -- our team would predict it gets up - back up to 5 percent. That's say a percent and a half from where we are now. That is 150 million odd workers. So, that is - but that's where it was, you know, two years before, you know, '17, '18. So, '17, '16. So, we didn't feel horrible then. The question is, it's just a change. Will people lose their jobs? And that's a horrible thing to contemplate. And that's what they're worried about. The compounding effect of the worry about having a job versus actually losing your job changes consumer behavior, and we're seeing that go on a little bit right now and that's -- the Fed has to create that sort of nervousness to help tip the inflation back down. Wage growth is strong, which is a good thing, but also strong means they have to slow it down to match the - MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BRIAN MOYNIHAN: Otherwise, we're going to have a wage inflation spiral. So, all that - all that comes together. So, as you think about it, think about next year as really important to see the mitigating impact of these things. The employment market gets less tight - is already less tight, continues to get less tight, therefore, wage growth slows down. Therefore, inflation will slow down. If that doesn't happen, then the Fed is going to have to go a lot higher. There's economists that think they should. But if they get it there, they can hold it there and let the system catch up to it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are savings yields so much lower than where the inflation rate is? Why aren't people making more money on their savings accounts? BRIAN MOYNIHAN: There's a lag effect to the change of rates and prices in everything. And what - and so what they'll do is they keep coming up and each month you'll see them come up as people pay higher rates to retain the funds. The big difference between the last time we went through a rate tightening cycle and now is the amount of cash in the system is so high that companies have a lot of liquidity - banks have a lot of liquidity. They're well capitalized. They're very strong. And if that's -- even going back to our discussion in March of '20, the difference, the banks are very strong. They helped the clients through it. They didn't cause any problems. They're very strong. So, what's going to happen is, they're going to be more conservative to recovery to 15 years, a low rate environment where they underearn. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BRIAN MOYNIHAN: They're recovering. But ultimately they'll come to - come to reach more equilibrium MARGARET BRENNAN: Brian Moynihan, thank you for your time today. We'll have more on the economy and the forecast for 2023 next week with Jamie Dimon, the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. We'll be back in a moment.

FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: You too. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, having seen what you saw up close for four years, do you think there is a danger in Donald Trump being president again? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I'll always be proud of the record of the Trump-Pence administration and for four and a half years, President Trump was not only my president, but he was my friend. We worked very closely to create a record of prosperity at home, 7 million good paying jobs. We rebuilt our military. We saw more than 300 conservatives appointed to our courts. We took down the ISIS caliphate. We brought about peace in the Middle East. But obviously it didn't end well. And while the president and I parted amicably I- I believe as we look to the future that we'll have better choices, and I'm very confident Republican primary voters will choose wisely in the days ahead about who should be our standard bearer, but again, I'll- I'll always be grateful for the opportunity to have been vice president during four consequential years in the life of this nation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Mr. Trump is unfit for office. Do you agree? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, as I said, the president and I were very different, but we- we worked together very closely, and I think the combination and the entire team and our administration, created a record that frankly, the American people cherish, particularly in the wake of the failed policies of the Biden administration at home and abroad. Whether it be the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, whether it be an economy now in a recession, a gusher of spending in Washington, D.C., that's ignited the worst inflation in 40 years. Everywhere I've gone for the last two years, Margaret, I've heard people tell me that they want to get back to the policies of that administration. The Trump-Pence administration delivered for the American people. But I truly do believe that the times call for leadership that can unite our country around our highest ideals and demonstrate the kind of respect and civility and I think the American people show each other every day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you support the Republican Party nominee even if it is Mr. Trump? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I- I look forward to being involved in the process in some way. I can tell you that my wife and I will take some time when our kids are home this Christmas- it'll be the first time in three years with two in the military that we'll all be together and we're gonna give prayerful consideration about what role we might play. And whether we are in the debate as a candidate, or in the debate as simply as an active Republican, I look forward to getting behind the Republican cause and supporting candidates around the country as well as our nominee to get this country turned back to the policies that will make us strong and prosperous again. MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like you prefer he's not the nominee, but you didn't say no. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I just think there'll be better choices. And you know, I hold the view Margaret that no one could have beaten Hillary Clinton except Donald Trump in 2016. You know, as I write in my book, \"So Help Me God,\" I actually endorsed another candidate in the primary in Indiana. But when I saw the way Donald Trump came through Indiana, and inspired people who literally felt left behind by the elites in Washington, DC, literally for decades, I knew that he was going to be elected president of the United States. Republican primary voters knew we needed a fighter in the White House, we needed- we needed to have that energy that could turn back on the policies of the American left, but I think- I think now calls for a different time. I think now, I think the American people will want to see us move forward, solve some of the intractable problems that have literally gone unsolved for more than a generation. I think, everywhere I go, the encouragement that I've received is always predicated on- on the message that we- we love the record, but we like- we'd like new leadership. And I am confident Republican primary voters will give us just that in whoever the man or woman is, that is our standard bearer. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you talked about moving forward. The idea of re-litigating the 2020 election continues to circulate, as you know that, amongst members of your party. Homeland Security is warning of the risk of political violence and they have drawn a direct line between domestic violent extremism and this false belief that the 2020 election was somehow rigged. Do you think that continuing to push these claims as the former president does is a direct threat? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: The 2020 election was not stolen. We have a process in this country, where states conduct elections. Questions of irregularities and fraud are then adjudicated in the courts, the states then certify electoral votes, and as we did on January 6, in the wake of that terrible violence, the role of the Congress is to open and count those votes and to certify the election. We did that, until Biden was elected President of the United States of America. But I do think there's been far too much talk questioning the integrity of our elections. I'm all for election reform, I'm glad to see states around the country that are strengthening election integrity. Because the truth is there were irregularities in the election, even where there wasn't ever evidence of widespread fraud, Margaret, there- in the state of Wisconsin\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: 50 lawsuits at the state and federal level that were shut down, that were put forward by the former president. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well in the state of Wisconsin, their Supreme Court found that their state had actually violated their election laws in two instances a year after the election. The Supreme Court of the United States sequestered votes that had come in beyond the deadline in Pennsylvania. There were irregularities, and I think the American people do well to continue to strengthen election integrity, but those that continue to propagate language that undermines our election, including those who following the 2016 election referred to it as stolen. You know, it's remarkable to me as much attention as there is in the national media on election deniers, that there's little talk about the fact that Hillary Clinton said for years that our election was stolen. She- she and her party-- MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know that\u2013 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: \u2013blamed Russia and our campaign for colluding. Of course, all of which turned out to be itself a fraud. And all of that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But I don't have to tell you that January 6 was an horrendous and unique event predicated on this false claim, which is why I wanted to ask you about that. According to a CBS tally, there are going to be 156 members of Congress that will be sworn in in January who continue to raise questions about the validity of the 2020 election. That's more than back in 2020. Isn't that a risk? Doesn't the party need to stop that? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, look, there's a- there's a First Amendment in this country that people can hold the opinions that they hold even if I disagree with them. But I have every confidence that the new Republican leadership in the Congress, the new Republican majority when Nancy Pelosi hands the gavel to Kevin McCarthy, is going to draw the lessons from the midterm campaign which for me give evidence of the fact that the American people want the Republican Party and frankly, all of our leaders to be focused on the future. Look, the people of this country are going through a lot right now. The cost of groceries, the cost of living going through the roof, the cost of a tank of gasoline up 60%, crime in our major cities, the worst crisis on our southern border in history. And I think what you're going to see is Republican leadership and the Congress that's going to focus on those issues. And I think that's where people want us focused. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did it surprise you then that Republicans didn't end up with a larger margin, given all the factors you just laid out which were arguably in their favor? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I-I was surprised. I was disappointed at the outcome of the election in that regard, although, you know, I was there, Margaret, as I write in my book. I was there the last time that we defeated Nancy Pelosi's majority and I'm- I'm looking forward to the day that Kevin McCarthy is elected speaker of the United States House and leads the Republican majority. A win is a win. But I would have liked to see more Republicans elected to Congress, I would have liked to have seen a Republican majority in the Senate. And my- my conviction is that as you look around what happened on Election Day, candidates that were focused on the future, candidates that were focused on the issues the American people are focused on, did quite well in the main. I think of- I think of a Governor Brian Kemp in Georgia who went through a contentious primary in what people said was a divided Republican electorate won decisively \u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Opposed by the former president.\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Was indeed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Endorsed by you. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I was proud to support Governor Brian Kemp in that primary. But then he went up against unquestionably the most formidable Democrat candidate in the country, and he won handily. But Brian Kemp, like so many other candidates around the country, was focused on the future and what people of the country were dealing with everyday. By contrast, I think the candidates that were focused on the past focused on the past \u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: 2020? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE:\u00a0 \u2013relitigating the past did not fare as well. And it's my conviction that the Republican Party is going to earn the right to lead this country in the days ahead on an increasing basis that we've got to be known as the party of the future. And I'm confident that new Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, Senator McConnell and Republicans in the Senate will do just that. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Party of the future would mean not the party of Trump. That sounds like what you're saying. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, as I said\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do I have that right? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I- look, that's up to the American people. Particularly it's up to Republican primary voters. MARGARET BRENNAN: You had such an eyewitness view, sir, for four years.\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I did. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have a credibility to say to the American public, whether there is a risk or not of him being commander in chief. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, Margaret, look. January 6 was a tragic day. I'll always believe that I did my duty under the Constitution and the laws of this country in the midst of that. And I've been very clear as I am in my book that the president's words and actions in and around January 6 were reckless. The tweet that he issued the day that I was in the loading dock before- below the United States Senate endangered my family and endangered people that were in the Capitol and was indefensible. But, I must tell you that I couldn't be more proud of the response of Republican and Democrat leaders in the Congress who came together, the response of Capitol Hill police and federal law enforcement to quell the violence, made it possible for us to reconvene the Congress on the very same day of that riot and complete our work under the Constitution as- as I say that, in the book, I- I believe a day of tragedy became a triumph of freedom. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you've received bipartisan praise for having done that. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: But beyond all of that, I don't- I don't want to confuse the tragedy of that day with what- with the extraordinary accomplishments of our administration and when you think at home and abroad, the progress that we made - 7 million good paying jobs, unemployment at a 50 year low, by cutting taxes, rolling back regulation, unleashing American energy. We created unbridled prosperity in this country. And on the foreign policy stage of which you're a well-known expert, with the direction of- of our commander in chief, the armed forces, the United States crushed the ISIS caliphate, took down their leader without one American casualty, held Assad and Syria accountable when he used chemical weapons on his own people, re-established the credibility of American force. MARGARET BRENNAN: This sounds like a campaign platform issue for you. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, no for me, Margaret, it really is\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you're going to have to defend the administration you served in. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: For me, it is all evidence of what we were able to do during the four years of the Trump-Pence administration. And while we- while we had our critics then and today and in the future, I'll always be proud of what we did for this country. We left America stronger and more prosperous than any time in my lifetime. And while it didn't end well, I'll always be proud of the record that we created for the American people. MARGARET BRENNAN: I have interviewed you many times throughout the years and I always know you to be very measured and very careful with your words. But I think a lot of Americans when they saw those pictures of you with your family, with your daughter, with your wife, with your brother, sheltering for your lives that day, would ask, why did it take you two years to talk about your anger? Weren't you incandescent with rage that your family was put at risk like that? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Margaret, I was angry that day, and many days since. But on January 6, I have to tell you that I had to put that aside. The President had decided to be a part of the problem. I was determined to be a part of the solution, to work with leaders in Congress, leaders at the Pentagon, leaders in law enforcement to do our part to finish our work under the Constitution. But let me also say I- I've spoken about this many times over the last two years. I communicated correspondence to the Congress and the American people on January 6 about the reasons for my actions. After the first 100 days of the Biden administration, I was- I was back on the road speaking about the differences the president and I had. Earlier this year when the president once again said that he believed I had the right to overturn the election, I- I made it clear that there's- I had no right to overturn the election. That there's no idea more un-American than the idea that any one person could choose the American president.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You\u2013 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: So I've spoken over the course of the year but I must tell you it's a great privilege for me to have the opportunity to- to tell my story. Literally from my upbringing in a small town in Indiana, being raised by a combat veteran and a precocious, red-headed, first generation Irish American, to have met the girl of my dreams, to have stepped into the political arena early in life and learned lessons, but then had the privilege of being able to serve in the Congress as a conservative leader, to go home to Indiana to be a governor. And then the four consequential years of the Trump-Pence administration and it was important for me to have the opportunity to put it all into context and- and also underpin it all with my faith. You know, the Bible says be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry, and in the immediate days after nine- after January 6, I- I sought to do that. I prayed to do that. We still had the people's business to do until the end of the administration. And- but I'll be candid with you, it wasn't easy. And I continue to pray for the grace to be able to focus forward and to do my part to help move our country toward a more prosperous and peaceful future. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Do you- I mean that day you were- you were calling and trying to get the National Guard to come in and restore order. You were making those calls. Did you feel you had to do that because the commander in chief was derelict in his duties? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Margaret, I didn't know what the president was doing at the time. I wasn't at the White House. I had no contact with the president or the White House that day. When I spoke to the congressional leaders in our first conference call, they informed me that they were getting mixed messages from security personnel. And I asked them if they wanted me to get involved. And they did. They asked me to see if I could get some answers.\u00a0 And so I began to make some calls. I- You know, I was determined not to leave my post that day. I thought it was important for me to stay at the Capitol. And- and to do whatever I could to facilitate a federal response. But I give credit to the leaders in both political parties that day, because on that very first call, there was a unanimous agreement that whatever needed to be done, we needed to reconvene the Congress that day and finish our work. I remember Speaker Pelosi telling me that she'd actually heard from one source that it could be up to three days before we could be back in the Capitol and to all of their credit, the Democrat and Republican leaders all said that was completely unacceptable.\u00a0 I remember in that call I reflected about an experience that four of us on the call had had in agreeing with the sentiment. And that was- that was on September 11. When I was a freshman member of Congress. I write about it in the book. I thought the best thing members of Congress did that day was that we- we reconvened on the steps of the Congress itself. We had a- a press event, but members broke into a spontaneous rendition of \"God Bless America.\" I thought that sent the right message to the nation and to the world on a day of unspeakable violence against the United States of America that we were here, our government was attacked.\u00a0 And I expressed that to the leaders on the call. Three of whom had also been at that very same event on the steps of the Capitol. And they all were in complete agreement that whatever was necessary to be done, we had to reconvene that day. We had to show the American people and the world that we would complete our work under the Constitution of the United States and achieve the peaceful transfer of power for which our nation is celebrated the world over. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what- what some people will hear from what you just said is you compared January 6 to the terrorist attacks on this country on 9/11. There was responsibility for those terrorist attacks on 9/11. Do you think President Trump needs to be held responsible in his events - in the events that led to January 6 and the violence of that day? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I think everyone that perpetrated the violence at the Capitol needs to be held to the strictest account of the law \u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about those who fed it? What about those who gave it oxygen, \"the lie\" oxygen to mislead people? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well I- you know, what I would tell you is I'm confident that the American people will hold all those responsible at the end of the day, and history will be their judge. In my book, I- what I've tried to do is share a candid story about the evolution of that controversy. You know, it's- the president and I have developed a \u2013 (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: You say the president came to you at least five times. You lay it out in detail leading up to January 6, and it's almost like you couldn't believe this because you kept telling him over and over, 'this is not legal, this is not constitutional.'\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I did. Many people did. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you look back and say I wasn't forceful enough. I mean what could you have done differently? Or was it just that he was so determined, the fact was not useful? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I did tell the president many times that after he exhausted every legal challenge that the campaign had every right to pursue, that he should simply accept the results. And my hope was that he would eventually come around before January 6, you know, we had developed not just a close working relationship that I described in the book, Margaret, but we had developed a friendship. The president and I were always candid with each other and but I always- whenever I had a difference of opinion with the president, and I thought my role as vice president was to share that opinion in private. I believe it's the job of the vice president to be loyal to the president of the United States.\u00a0 The only higher loyalty you have is to God under the Constitution, and that precipitated the confrontation that we had, in and around January 6, but along the way, it was my hope that while the president was hearing from a cadre of attorneys who, frankly should never been let on the White House grounds, let alone in the Oval Office, telling him what, as the Bible says is itching ears wanted to hear. My hope was in- at the end of the day, he would come around. I remember on the night of January 4, we had a meeting with the president and part of that legal team in the Oval Office. The president left on the helicopter. There were no harsh words between us but he was continuing to make his case and I was continuing to make my position clear. But at his rally in Georgia, which I watched on television, the president actually opened up the rally by speaking about me, saying our great vice president's gonna have to come through for us, adding that if- if Mike doesn't come through for us, I won't like him so much. But then he paused and he said to the crowd 'now- now one thing you know about Mike Pence is he always plays it straight.' MARGARET BRENNAN: And then he called you the next day.\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, but I remember in that moment, thinking he might be coming around.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But he wasn't.\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: At the end of the day he wasn't and I leave that to others to explain why it was, my continued hope was that at the end of the day, he would recognize what our duty was on that day, as the presiding officer under the Constitution to oversee the candidate electoral vote of an election that we lost, but, but it was not to be. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I move on, I want to ask you though, do you intend to ever sit and answer questions written in person for the January 6 committee? Do you believe though, that the public deserves that? Is this interview \"it\"? Is this book \"it\"? Or will you answer questions about that day before Congress? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I shared my heart and I shared my story in this book, I will continue to speak openly about it. I expect to some degree for the rest of my life. But from the time the January 6 was formed, and every member was appointed by the Democrat Speaker of the House, I was concerned \u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: But your chief of staff spoke to them Marc Short, your legal counsel Greg Jacobs testified\u2013\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I'll get to that MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't want to engage with them at all? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I served for 12 years in the Congress. It's inconceivable to me that one party would appoint every member of a committee in Congress, that's antithetical to the whole idea of the committee system. That being said, I never stood in the way of senior members of my team cooperating with the committee and testifying. But Congress has no right to my testimony. We have a separation of powers under the Constitution of the United States. And I believe it would establish a terrible precedent for the Congress to summon a vice president of the United States to speak about deliberations that took place at the White House. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're - you're closing the door on that entirely? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I am closing the door on that, but I must say again, the partisan nature of the January 6 committee has been a disappointment to me. It seemed to me in the beginning, there was an opportunity to examine every aspect of what happened on January 6, and to do so more in the spirit of the 9/11 Commission, nonpartisan, non-political, and that was an opportunity lost. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Republicans are open to doing that to have some self-reflection about January 6? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I'd leave that to others about the fate of the committee structure and decisions that would be made. But- but for my part, I think it's important as I did on January 6, that we- that we uphold that separation of powers in the Constitution of the United States, two co-equal branches of government and, and that's where we'll stand.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And so the lawyers and the chief of staff to the president at the time that Mark Meadows who let those lawyers you said had no business on the White House grounds you think, no consequence? Only prosecute the people who actually physically went to the Capitol? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I know there are those that are speaking in defense of people that rioted at the Capitol created the conditions where lives were lost. But I believe everyone that was rioting in the Capitol that day of perpetrating violence needs to be held to the strictest account of the law. I remember watching it unfold only on cellphones that we had in that parking garage in the Senate. And I was filled with indignation. It's the people's house. I served there for 12 years. I dreamed as a boy to someday be able to serve there and I just remember thinking, not this not here, not in America. And I truly do believe that it's one of the centerpieces of our law that those that do the crime are responsible for the crime. But- but I do believe that at the end of the day, the American people will hold accountable of those that permitted the circumstances around which January 6 was able to flourish into violence that day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Throughout the book, you mentioned some of the more controversial episodes you had in exchanges with the former president. After Charlottesville, you said the president was not a racist, not a bigot, and the debate about a statue could indeed have well-meaning Americans on both sides. About the phone call that led to the first impeachment after the president asked Ukraine's leader to investigate Hunter Biden, you said 'it was not how I approached interactions with foreign leaders, but the president had done nothing wrong.' During the pandemic when you're standing next to him and the president talks about using disinfectant to treat COVID. You described it as an unforced error. It sounds like you're excusing his behavior or enabling this behavior. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Or explaining what happened. We were in an environment where much of the national media simply assumed the worst about Donald Trump for the first day of our administration. I'll never forget\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Were you more forceful behind closed doors than you let on in this book?\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Say again? MARGARET BRENNAN: Were you more forceful behind closed doors, than you let on?\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: The president- whenever the president and I had a difference of opinion, he knew my opinion. But I always shared it in private, as I think a vice president should. And the American people don't don't elect two presidents. And the vice president's job is to be loyal to the president and share his opinion directly. And I think privately, to give the president his counsel, and I did and I chronicle that some in the book, but I I have to tell you, Margaret, as I started to say, it is extraordinary to me to think of the level of opposition that that our administration faced literally from day one, the headline of the Washington Post on our Inauguration Day, in 2017 was 'the quest to impeach Donald Trump starts today.' Never in my lifetime, and you covered it as well as anyone in the national press, did I see the level of opposition, they even call themselves the resistance, that each and every day took the worst version of events and assumed the worst about everything? And in \"So Help Me God\" what I try and do is- is is explain my perspective on those incidents, whether it be in the campaign, or in the course of our administration, where, where I believe our administration was understood, misunderstood, where, where things were mischaracterized and, but- but again, I was proud in those moments, nonetheless to stand by the president. You know, as I say in my book\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't have any misgivings? You're putting this on the press \u2013 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Let me speak about- let me speak about a couple of the incidents. Charlottesville. Its a place that's very, very special to you, as a UVA grad. Visited there last year to speak to students myself and I-I paid my respects at the alley where we lost Heather Heyer that tragic day.\u00a0 But as I speak about that moment, I recite what the president said, but but I but I express my regret that he had not specifically denounced the KKK, White supremacists and White nationalists that had been present. So when I arrived in Colombia, I sought to do that. I squared my shoulders before the international media, I stated our administration's position and specifically rejected those groups, said they had no place in American public life. The president had denounced the extremists that were there in his first remarks, but he would go on within a day to denounce those groups, explicitly. And as I said, the- the assertion that President Trump is an anti-Semite neglects the fact that he has Jewish grandchildren, his daughter and son-in-law are Jewish. And as I wrote in my book\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: But, the language he uses now is not\u2013language FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: \"He's not a bigot, he's not a racist,\" if he was I would have never been his vice president.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You admit, the language he uses is not what you would use to refer to people who\u2013 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: We were different men.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. You could say that\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: We were very different men. But\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you were- you are giving him the Mike Pence stamp of approval when you say he's not a racist and not a bigot. That's what I'm asking you about. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: What I'm telling you is that in all my time around him when the cameras were off, I never saw the president mistreat anyone on the basis of- of race or creed or color. And I know that, I know that's hard to hear for some of his harshest critics, but it happens to be true. But it was just one of the criticisms that was leveled at the president in that time. Now, I- I will tell you, he and I- he and I were different people. He was- he was elected on an agenda that I endorsed. But I think he was also elected with a style of politics that is different from mine, and as vice president. I thought my job was to stand by the president, to be loyal, and to support the presidency both in substance and in its efforts that he was elected to advance. And that's just what we did. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've made clear that you also think the FBI executing a search warrant to take classified material from the former president's home was not the way the Justice Department should have handled it. But to be clear, were you ever personally concerned about Mr. Trump's handling of classified information? And for the record, do you think he can declassify just by thinking about it? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well I was- I don't recall ever being concerned about the president or anyone on our administration's handling of classified information, at least among the senior staff, of which I had regular contact. MARGARET BRENNAN: But if he had, he would be prosecuted, you would think. I mean, certainly you talk about your family members who are in the military. If they took classified material home, they would face steep consequences. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, let me say, you know, no one is above the law. But as someone that served on the Judiciary Committee for more than 10 years, having oversight over the Justice Department, I just think there were many better ways to obtain those classified materials from Mar-a-lago, than to execute a search warrant against a former president in the United States of America, something that had never happened in American history, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And never been prosecuted. Do you think that that should happen?\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, my- my hope is that the Justice Department will think very carefully about next steps. This is a very divided time in the life of our nation. I think our nation needs to heal. But the idea of executing a search warrant against a former president of the United States sent the wrong message to the American people and, frankly, sent the wrong message to the wider world that looks at the United States of America as the standard. And that was my disappointment in the decision to execute a search warrant. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know we're running out of time, but I do want to ask you about what you have talked about as restoring the sanctity of life, which was, you say, 'the calling of your life.' I know this is very important to you, so if you'll let me, I want to ask you. You're very proud of the Supreme Court Justices put on the court who just recently struck down Roe v. Wade. Do you think the decision on abortion access should stay in the states? Or should there be a national law banning it? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, it's a fair question, but let me back up for one second. You know, the most important decision I ever made in my life that I recount in my book is when I put my faith in Jesus Christ. And as I opened up the Bible, I read that, \"Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. And an admonition to choose life so that you and your children may live.\" And from very early on in my public career, I- I was determined to be a champion for life. Whether it was in my years as a radio broadcaster, I advocated the right to life or my time in the Congress of the United States, where I worked closely with the late Henry Hyde, who was the lion of the right to life. I- I just always purposed to advance the sanctity of life. And I always believed that Roe v. Wade would be sent to the ash heap of history. It's- you know, it's interesting that Ruth Bader Ginsburg even said, who was one of the great Supreme Court Justices of our time \u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, she questioned the legal basis not seeming solid enough, but\u2013 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: She questioned the legal foundation of it, and- and she was right, but- from my perspective\u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But does what you're talking about, the moral imperative\u2013 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that trump states' rights? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, the Dobbs decision this summer that I- I was so grateful to see, the majority of which was made up by Supreme Court justices that we- we appointed and confirmed to the- to the Court really gave the country a new beginning for life. And it did return the question of abortion to the states and the American people. Many alarmists on the American left in the beginning spoke about it banning abortion and taking away their right, and actually, I think most Americans figured out pretty quickly that, in fact, this question that bears so deeply on the- the life of the nation, it's simply been returned to the people and their elected representatives\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: So no national ban? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: And so, for my part, I- I will tell you that I will always support efforts to strengthen protections for the unborn. I think it's most likely that it will be resolved at the state level, but the 15 week legislation in the Congress, had I been a member of Congress, I would have supported because I think it actually\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not too liberal for you? Because it would allow access up to 15 weeks of pregnancy.\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's where the majority of abortions are performed. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: I would have supported it as a beginning, because I thought it- it did a service of exposing the fact that while the Democrats speak about extremism among pro-life Americans, the truth is, the Democratic Party supports abortion all the way up to the moment of birth, and taxpayer funding of abortion. And that's a position that isn't supported by more than 25 percent of Americans\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about because of exceptions to life of the mother.\u00a0 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: And so I thought there was usefulness in that- in that debate. But I believe \u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: But the 15 week- the Rubio-Graham Bill, the 15 weeks you're talking about, also has exceptions for life of the mother after the 15 weeks. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Right, and those in support of the Hyde Amendment as a member of Congress, I supported those exceptions during my career. But, Margaret, I do believe it's more likely this is going to be resolved at the state level. It may take as long to restore the sanctity of life to the center of American law in all 50 states as it did to overturn Roe v. Wade, but people that know me and my family know that so long as we live we'll- we'll seek to be about the business of life in this country and doing our part to support sanctity of life. MARGARET BRENNAN: I was- I was interested to read that you and your wife Karen underwent IVF therapy \u2013 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: We did.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And so \u2013 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Many times. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And there are- which is a lot to go through. And there are people who are concerned that if you start with abortion access restrictions that it will also lead to restrictions on IVF treatment. If you believe life begins at conception, you can make that argument. Should it be protected as a right? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Oh, I- Karen and I struggled for more than five years with unexplained infertility. And in fact, I'll never forget the day that I called home, driving off to a work appointment, and Karen answered the phone and said 'Happy Father's Day.' And our son would come along, then a daughter, then another daughter, all within three years. We were busy, but joyful. But in the midst of all of that, we- we also received word that we had- we had made the list for an adoption for a young woman with an unexpected pregnancy. And you know Margaret, we prayed a lot about that.\u00a0 I write about it in the book we- I believe in \"forever families.\" I believe families can be formed by adoption as much as by natural birth, and- but we wanted to find out if the second family on the list was clinically infertile. And when we did we stepped aside not wanting to prevent them from having the joy of a little one in their home. But I fully support fertility treatments and I think they deserve the protection of the law. They gave us great comfort in those long and challenging years that we struggled with infertility in our marriage and I- I do believe as we work our way forward, we- we can protect the unborn. We can come alongside women in crisis pregnancies, and we can support the newborn with equal vigor. And that's the challenge that I'll be articulating all across this country, to leaders in cities large and small, that if we come up with principle and compassion for- for the unborn, for newborns, for mothers with unexpected pregnancies, we can win the cause of life in America. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about same-sex marriage? A number of Republicans are getting on board federal protections for it. Do you believe that you need to consider that when you talk about compassion? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well as a- as a Bible-believing Christian, I'll always hold the view that marriage is between one man and one woman. I think it was ordained by God. And that'll always be my values. But the Supreme Court of the United States has ruled on this - in the Obergefell case. And um \u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think a federal law is needed? A number of Republicans are now \u2013 FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE:\u00a0 We can- we can disagree with Supreme Court decisions, but we can't disobey them. I respect the pronouncements of the Court. And I actually think it's just as important as we go forward as a nation, that we make it clear that we don't believe in discrimination against anyone because of who they are, who they love, or what they believe. But at the same time, I think we need to make sure that we protect the religious freedom of every American that's enshrined in the Constitution: the ability to live, to work, to worship, in a manner according to the dictates of your conscience. And- and I think we're getting there. I think we're moving forward as a nation and I look forward to continuing to express my values, but express them with compassion for every American whether they share my values or not. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I have to let you go. But sir, I have to ask, why would you want to be president of the United States? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Margaret, many years ago, a mentor of mine said there's two kinds of people in Washington, D.C. There's people that are called and people that are driven. And if you read my book, \"So Help Me God,\" you'll see that I've been both. Early in my career, I let my ambition get ahead of what I thought my Christian faith required of me. And I wrote about my disappointment in the campaigns that I'd run. But when the opportunity came back around 10 years later, with three little kids, having just built our dream home, Karen and I went to prayer and reflected on what our calling might be. And when we stepped forward to run for Congress, the year we were elected in 2000, it was not so much out of a sense of ambition or entitlement, but it was out of a sense of calling. We felt called to be a part of new leadership coming to Washington, D.C., in the Congress and in the White House. We felt called to go home and run for governor of Indiana. When the call came in 2016, we reflected, we prayed. We believed that we could make a difference and we said yes to Donald Trump and joined the national ticket, and I'll always be proud of the work that we did during the Trump-Pence administration. But, what I can tell you is that for me and for my house, as we consider however we might contribute to the life of the nation in the years ahead, we'll be trying to discern that through prayerful reflection, consideration, speaking to family and friends and listening to the American people what our calling might be. Ronald Reagan said one time 'the American people have a funny way of letting you know if they want you to run for president.' So we'll be listening, we'll be praying and we'll be deciding what our role might be in the days ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Days ahead? I thought we had to wait till January. You have news you want to make with us, sir? FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Not today. MARGARET BRENNAN: Not today, OK. Thank you for your time, Mr. Vice President. FORMER VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Appreciate it.",

            "article_content": "Republicans hoping to hold on to the Massachusetts governor's office are choosing between a Donald Trump-backed candidate and a more moderate businessman in Tuesday's primary election. Massachusetts is just the latest blue state to feature a top-of-the-ticket contest between a conservative candidate endorsed by Trump and a more centrist opponent. In recent primaries in Maryland and Connecticut, GOP voters have opted for the Trump loyalists, potentially worsening their chances of winning a general election. The winner of Tuesday's Massachusetts primary will take on Democratic Attorney General Maura Healey in November. If elected, she would be the state's first openly gay governor and the first woman elected governor of Massachusetts. Republican Jane Swift served as acting governor after Gov. Paul Cellucci stepped down in 2001 to become U.S. ambassador to Canada. The governor's office is open this year because popular GOP Gov. Charlie Baker opted against running for a third term. Former state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who has Trump's endorsement, is going up against businessman Chris Doughty, a political newcomer, in the Republican primary for governor. Diehl, who launched a failed campaign for U.S. Senate against Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren in 2018, is popular among Republican activists. He won the party's endorsement with 71% of delegates at the state party convention in May, but he could face a tougher climb in a general election in a state in which Trump won only 32% of votes in 2020. Diehl has opposed  mandates, falsely claimed the 2020 presidential race was rigged, fought against the extension of mail-in voting and said he supports the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Trump \u2014 a critic of Baker, who publicly refused to vote for Trump in 2016 and 2020 \u2014 endorsed Diehl last October, saying in a statement that he is \"strong on Crime, Election Integrity, our now under siege Southern Border, loves our Military, and has a big focus on taking care of our Vets.\" Diehl had a phone call with Trump planned for Monday. Doughty has argued he will be more electable in the general election against Healey in the blue state.\u00a0 Doughty described himself as moderate when he entered the race but has since embraced the label of conservative as he tries to appeal to Republican primary voters. Doughty has said his experience running a manufacturing company gives him the know-how to be a successful chief executive. He has said he wants to make Massachusetts more affordable for residents and businesses. He has described himself as \"pro-life,\" but acknowledges the state's highest court has recognized a right to abortion and said he doesn't have an interest in changing that. Baker hasn't endorsed either candidate. Matt Murphy of State House News told CBS Boston that Doughty's chances will come down to independent voters. \"How many of those independents decide to participate in the Republican primary?\" Murphy said. \"For Doughty to have a chance, he has to draw in a lot of those independents, maybe even the ones who would typically vote Democrat to maybe thwart that Trumpian messaging that's coming from the Republican Party. If a lot of them participate, maybe he can close the gap with Diehl.\" Healey, who's won two statewide races for attorney general, is running virtually unopposed, with her sole rival dropping out of the race in June, though she remains on the ballot. Healey is hoping to break a political \"curse\" in Massachusetts, referring to a string of unsuccessful campaigns by attorneys general for governor. Despite being considered a Democratic stronghold, Massachusetts has a history of electing Republican governors as a check on a Legislature in which Democrats hold overwhelming majorities. Those Republican governors, including Mitt Romney, have typically been fiscally conservative but more socially moderate. Baker said in December that he opted not to seek reelection so he could focus on helping the state emerge from the pandemic. He credited his administration's focus on issues over personality as a big reason for his success with voters, which he said stands \"apart from a lot of the bipartisan noise that's created in politics generally these days.\" The election also features several statewide contested Democratic primaries, including for attorney general and secretary of the commonwealth. Two Democrats are jockeying for the top law enforcement office: former Boston city councilor Andrea Campbell and workers' rights attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan. A week before the election, a former assistant attorney general, Quentin Palfrey, announced he was suspending his campaign and endorsed Campbell. The winner will face Republican Jay McMahon, a trial attorney who previously ran against Healey and lost, in November. If elected, Campbell would be the first Black woman to hold the office in Massachusetts. She's won the endorsement of several high-profile elected officials, including Healey, Sen. Edward Markey and half the state's congressional delegation. Liss-Riordan has the backing of Warren, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and former acting Boston Mayor Kim Janey. In the race for secretary of the commonwealth, Democratic incumbent William Galvin is hoping to win an eighth term in office. He's fielding a primary challenge from fellow Democrat Tanisha Sullivan, a lawyer and president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. Sullivan would be the first Black person to serve in the post in the state. There are also contested races in the Democratic primary for auditor and for the Democratic and Republican races for lieutenant governor. None of the state's nine incumbent Democratic U.S. House members is facing primary challengers. There are two contested Republican primaries, in the 8th and 9th congressional districts. The Massachusetts primary lands on the day after Labor Day, raising concerns about a potentially low turnout, although early voting began on Aug. 27. A new state law makes \"no excuse\" mail-in ballots and early voting permanent fixtures in Massachusetts elections. Many of the voting options included in the new law were implemented during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and proved popular. The law also increases ballot access for voters with disabilities, service members overseas and incarcerated individuals.",

This week on Face the Nation: As the legal troubles for former President Trump and some of his key allies mount, his grip on the Republican Party types leading up to the midterm elections. In the newest installment of this late summer drama, the judge who authorized that search warrant giving the FBI permission to seize classified materials for Mr. Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago now says he's inclined to make public some of the information in the affidavit justifying it. Despite the Justice Department's objection to releasing any of it, they're working on redactions. We will talk with the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Mike Turner. He's one of many lawmakers who want to know more about those documents. Then we will try to decipher the legal challenges in at least 13 federal, state and congressional investigations and lawsuits involving the former president. And it's back-to-school time. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will talk about the challenges facing our nation's schoolchildren, including teacher shortages across the country and learning setbacks due to COVID. Plus, former White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx returns to weigh in on the proposed changes at the CDC. Moving on to the midterm elections, as President Biden signs that bill that fights climate change, cuts health care costs, and raises taxes on corporations, Democrats hope to run with that victory towards the finish line in November. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): We have not wavered. We have not flinched. And we have not given in. Instead, we're delivering results for the American people. (End VT) ED O'KEEFE: Will voters see it that way? Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has a reality check. (Begin VT) SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-Kentucky): There's probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different. They're statewide. Candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome. (End VT) ED O'KEEFE: We will take a look at why he's saying that with our political panel. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. I'm Ed O'Keefe. We will see Margaret in a moment, but I'm helping her out today, as she's dealing with a situation that's all too familiar for every parent, caring for a sick child. On this late summer morning, Americans are looking ahead to the fall. Kids are going back to school. And the politics leading into the midterm elections are heating up. We will get to that in a moment. But we begin with Margaret's interview with Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. She spoke to him earlier. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary. MIGUEL CARDONA (U.S. Education Secretary): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a busy time of year for you, no doubt. President Biden said America's students are, on average, two to four months behind in reading and in math because of the pandemic. Now we also have this teacher shortage. And, in some states, like Missouri, a number of districts are shortening the school week to just four days. How much additional learning loss will happen because of the shortage? SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: Well, first of all, I'm excited about the beginning of the school year. This is a year full of promise and opportunities for students who have, for the last two years, put up with too much. And thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the dollars are there to make sure that we can open up our schools with sufficient educators. Our students need more, not less. So, when I hear reports of districts shortening up their week, it concerns me. Our students need additional support. They need smaller class sizes. They need tutors. They need after- school programs. So let's use the American Rescue Plan dollars to bring back retired teachers to work with universities to make sure that our student teachers are starting a little bit earlier into their profession, using the dollars that were put forward by the federal government. We think it's important that our students get more this year, not less. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Americans have pumped billions of taxpayer dollars over the past three years into schools through emergency programs. You mentioned one of them. SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Can the federal government force governors to reallocate those funds? I mean, how do you actually get governors to do what you're asking them to do? SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: Right. It's not really about forcing. It's about working with them. But let's face it. This teacher shortage is a symptom of something that's been going on for longer than the pandemic, and that's a teacher respect issue, unless we're serious about providing competitive salaries for our educators, better working conditions, so that they can continue to grow. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it really just about salaries? SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: It's definitely not just about salaries. But let's think back the last couple years. Our educators have bent over backwards. We went from totally in person learning to remote learning overnight. Yet the pandemic really pushed many of these educators out of the profession, because, in many cases, educators were not being respected. When schools had to close, it created some tensions in our schools. We need to make sure we're supporting our educators, giving them the working conditions where they feel connected to the community and feel supported in the work that they're doing, critically important work. MARGARET BRENNAN: But in the meantime, it's a matter of what's best for students. And I want to ask you. We are seeing districts change the qualifications so that instructors can be there in class. Oklahoma eliminated a general education test certification requirement. Arizona now allows people without a college degree to begin teaching before they graduate. In Illinois, people can teach in a classroom with just 90 hours of college education. SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: This looks, Mr. Secretary, like the standards and quality of American education are being lowered. SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: Right. And it's unfortunate. Our students need more now, not less. And while I understand that there are issues getting qualified educators into the classroom, we've been working really closely with our states to give them not only the resources, but the ideas on how to help address the short-term issue, incentivizing bringing retired teachers back in. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you support these ideas? SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: I do not support lowering any standards for qualifications with teachers. I think we need to be creative in how we get the teachers in. For example, student teaching is four months of teaching without pay. I think we should use the American Rescue Plan dollars to get student teachers and give them a salary. Many people are leaving the profession or training the -- training programs for the profession because they cannot afford four months of teaching without salary. I think we need to raise the bar on making sure teachers are getting paid what they're due. You know, the teaching profession, college graduates earn, on average, 33 percent less than other college-educated programs or other college-educated jobs. That's unacceptable. In the last 25 years, when you adjust for inflation, teachers have made only $29 more than they did 25 years ago. We need to do better there. And that will address some of these shortage issues. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you looking at targeted debt relief, student debt relief, for those teachers who are in programs like you just mentioned? SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: Certainly. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program is up and running. We provided a waiver for one year to widen the net of people that can take advantage of that. So, for those of you who are listening, studentaid.gov, check out to see if you're eligible now for student loan relief. If you're a public servant, and you've worked for 10 years, you should have your loans forgiven. We want to make the process simpler. But we're also focusing on making sure the loan forgiveness that we're providing goes to those folks who have been taken advantage of by their institutions, all total, Margaret, $32 billion since day one of this administration in loan cancellation for those who either have total and permanent disability, those who have been taken advantage of by their institutions of higher education. We're not slowing down. We want to make sure that college is more accessible and more affordable for Americans across the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a decision for us then on what's going to happen at the end of this month for families budgeting, in terms of whether there will be a suspension of some of those student debt programs? SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: Sure. I don't have a decision for you today. But what I will tell you that, daily, we're having conversations about this, and the American folks will hear it before the end of the month. MARGARET BRENNAN: We spoke to the superintendent of Los Angeles School District just last Sunday. And he told us that there are roughly 10,000 to 20,000 children who are just simply missing. No idea where they went. SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: How widespread is this problem of lost children in American school systems? SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: You know, it's a concern, not only in Los Angeles, but in other parts of our country, in particular, oururban centers, where we know the pandemic impacted urban centers, where their density is higher. Many families moved out of cities. So the work that I have seen happening across the country that I'm really proud of is the work where districts are now hiring folks to work as community liaisons, family liaisons, where they're knocking on doors, finding students, bringing them back into the classroom, reengaging them. It is an issue. Oftentimes, it's not just education, the families falling on hard times, or they've had loss in their family. So providing the support that they need is something that we're encouraging our schools to do. And we look forward to getting those students back and getting those families back into the classroom. MARGARET BRENNAN: When I spoke to you a few months ago, you pointed out the drop in enrollment specifically of the youngest Americans, kindergartners, preschoolers. SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know that the CDC has loosened some of the guidelines for schools when it comes to COVID health guidance. Each district decides its own policies. But, right now, we are seeing COVID spread. We are seeing monkeypox spread among children. Why isn't the Biden administration hosting town halls, informing people more directly, instead of having these very confusing and changing CDC guidelines? SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: As a father myself, my children's safety is my priority. And it's the priority for me that all students are safe and can go to school healthy. That's why we've been fighting from day one to increase vaccination efforts, to make sure that the schools have the tools for the mitigation strategies that they need, that we have information. Last week, I spoke to Dr. Walensky and Dr. Jha from the White House, about this upcoming school year. And we feel very optimistic that it's going to be a great year, that families shouldn't be worried right now about monkeypox, and that we have the tools that we need to give students vaccination, to keep them safe in our schools. I want our families thinking about how this year is going to be a better year than last year. We have better tools, better resources, and we should expect a better school year for our students and our families. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I think we all hope for that. Thank you for your time. SECRETARY MIGUEL CARDONA: Yes. Thank you. (End VT) ED O'KEEFE: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) ED O'KEEFE: Last week, the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, announced a complete, systemic overhaul of the agency, citing its botched COVID response. For more on those proposals and other ongoing viral outbreaks, Margaret spoke earlier with Dr. Deborah Birx, a former CDC official who served as coronavirus response coordinator under former President Trump. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, Dr. Birx. DR. DEBORAH BIRX (Former White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator): Good morning, Margaret. Great to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, this was an incredible acknowledgement by the CDC Director just a few days ago about the agency that she runs. And Dr. Walensky said to CDC employees: \"To be frank, we are responsible for some pretty dramatic, pretty public mistakes, from testing to data to communications. This is our watershed moment.\" And she outlined these proposed changes to institutional culture, accountability, communication, timeliness. Do you agree, Doctor, with her diagnosis? DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Well, I'm thrilled that she had Jim Macrae and did this work, because a lot of directors would have just tried to tweak. And tweaking the agency at this point was not going to be successful. This is an inflection point. MARGARET BRENNAN: And they have to be approved still by the HHS secretary. I mean, do you think that it is enough for a bureaucracy to try to fix itself, or does Congress need to step in and legislate here? DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Well, there's certain things that Congress needs to do. And the number one thing is to stop trying to create a parallel data system. In many countries, the public health system and the clinical system are one. In our country, they have been separate. And it has failed us. MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in January of 2021, when we spoke, I remember you saying you didn't trust the CDC data that you were getting during the Trump administration. So, if Dr. Walensky is saying that this is a problem, how does she actually fix it? Are you saying that the government can't do it alone, that it needs private industry to step in? DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. And that was the way we were able to get the data. First and foremost, in March of 2020, all of our data that I used to warn Americans of who was at risk for severe disease, hospitalization, and deaths came from our European colleagues. That, in itself, should be an indictment of our system. Secondly, reporting was coming in extraordinarily slow from hospitals through a system that CDC had created. And I know this created controversy, but, for three months, I asked the CDC to fix its system and develop a partnership with clinics and hospitals and laboratories, and they wouldn't. And so that's why I asked all the hospitals to start reporting. And they did. And so I think, sometimes, we hold ourselves back. The private sector is willing to help us. Another issue I have had with the CDC, I have asked them over and over again, if you're going to issue guidance, like the five days and return to work in a mask, show the data transparently that you utilized to come to that decision, because I think when Americans saw, that it was a very small number, that they would have really reconsidered those guidelines. And so you really need the information. Americans are smart. They can process the information. Give them all of the data. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry. To pick up on what you just said, you are saying that the current CDC guidance of being able to return to work after five days if you wear a mask is based on flawed data? DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Well, it's based on what we call in medicine a convenience data set, rather than all Americans. We've had millions and millions of infections, and we could have tracked Americans over that time period. We could have said to people, test on day three, test on day six, test on day nine. They would have seen that the antigen test was still positive in most cases out to nine, 10 and 11. And we have to assume, until we have better data, that you're infectious if your antigen test is positive. And so we had -- and I think this is the problem. I have studied -- I have worked on... (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Why -- why -- but why would the CDC -- why would the CDC do that? Are you suggesting that there is a concern here due to the worker shortage or political interference? Why would they tell people to work if there's no way they'd actually have cleared the virus within then a short period of time? DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Well, there definitely was a worker shortage. But I think, when we have that happen, we have to be very clear. We can say to people, we think you're still shedding some virus, and that's why we're telling you to wear a mask. And a crude indication that you're still shedding virus is your antigen test. And so we're really not using the tools that we have to ensure Americans can both survive and then thrive. And we do have tools. We have so many better tools now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I raise political interference, because, as you know, during the Trump administration -- and you felt some of this. That was one of the criticisms. But when it comes to the CDC advice, I mean, if you go through it, people may forget we had field hospitals in the middle of Central Park and refrigerator trucks moving dead bodies. We've come a long way here. But the CDC guidelines on masks was wrong. It was wrong when it came to the tests they were trying to create and deploy. They were telling people to take their temperature, not realizing there was asymptomatic community spread. Are we at the point where you cannot rebuild public trust? I mean, is the agency worth reforming? DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Well, the way you rebuild public trust is be transparent. And I think that's in the report, better data, better accountability, better transparency. But they also have to believe -- and this gets to the culture piece. People can understand complicated issues. It's your job as a public health official. That's what public and public health means. Your job is to take complex situations and data and create graphs, so that people can understand why you are making those recommendations. Recommendations that are created out of lack of transparency and out of a black box, where you can't really follow the logic, is what leads to fracturing in trust. And you really have to work to reestablish that. It can be done, but they have to change how they collect data, how they present data, and how they communicate to the American people. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about monkeypox. It was first detected in May in this country. Now it's a public health emergency. And there are reports of it spreading among children, particularly in the state of New York, right now. As parents send their kids back to school, what do they need to know? DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Well, I think what just was so disturbing to me about monkeypox is a lot of the issues that got us into the ditch with COVID were repeated. Those mistakes were repeated with monkeypox, not adequate testing early on, not making tests available in every community that you knew was at risk. I mean, we had the road map of who was at risk. We should have immediately made it -- tests available through the gay and bisexual network. They are very responsible people. They're very knowledgeable about prophylactics and preventing disease, because they've been doing it for decades. This is a highly informed group. If they had communicated to that group, if they had provided testing, if they had provided vaccines to all of them in May, we wouldn't have this problem in August. And so five months have gone by, just like what happened with COVID, lack of preparation, lack of engagement, lack of utilization of the tools that we had in real time to prevent this 14,000, and probably it's well over 20,000 now. And, remember, it can be spread, yes, skin-to-skin, but it can also be spread through clothing and linen. And so that's -- we just have to tell people, if you have any kind of lesion, please get tested, because you can spread it unknowingly to your household. You can spread it unknowingly to your family members. You can spread it unknowingly to your friends and to your children. And I'm worried about long-term care facilities, because it could -- excuse me -- also spread in long-term care facilities because of laundering. We should know right now, is monkeypox killed in cold water, or do you need to wash the clothing and everything in hot water? I mean, these are practical solutions that the American people need. MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Birx, thank you for your time this morning. DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Thank you, Margaret. Always good to see you. (End VT) ED O'KEEFE: And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) ED O'KEEFE: Fears of nuclear catastrophe are mounting in Eastern Europe, as Moscow and Kyiv accuse each other of shelling a nuclear power plant in Southeastern Ukraine, the largest such plant on the continent. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata is in Ukraine with more. (Begin VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice-over): Black smoke rises above the Russian Navy headquarters in Crimea. The apparent drone strike is the latest in a string of high-profile attacks penetrating air defenses deep within Russian-held territory. More fighting has been reported near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as Russia and Ukraine allow inspectors from the nuclear watchdog IAEA access to the complex. Nearly six months since the Russian invasion began, we revisited the scenes of some of the worst fighting in the early days of the war, the airfield at Hostomel on the outskirts of Kyiv, where outnumbered Ukrainian forces fought off elite Russian paratroopers intent on taking it over. The extraordinary amount of damage here tells the story of the ferocious firefight that took place at this airfield, a battle that would prove critical in the fight for the capital itself. Back in early March, the children's summer camp near Bucha, where we found terrified deputy camp director Tatiana sheltering elderly residents. TATIANA (Deputy Camp Director): Please help us, I ask you. (EXPLOSION) TATIANA: Next could be here. I ask you, go down. Go down. CHARLIE D'AGATA: We did go down, where we found the elderly and young children hiding out, even as thunderous explosions rang out. Tatiana. We found Tatiana again, alive and well, this week. How are you? TATIANA: Fine. Thank you. CHARLIE D'AGATA: I'm so happy to see you. TATIANA: I'm trying... (LAUGHTER) TATIANA: I'm glad to see you too. And thank you. Every day, I remind you, and... CHARLIE D'AGATA: You look so different. TATIANA: Really? A little bit. CHARLIE D'AGATA: In a good way. TATIANA: We understand that we survived. (CROSSTALK) CHARLIE D'AGATA: That night, when I saw you? TATIANA: Yes. That morning, I decided that it is -- need to take people out from the downstairs. CHARLIE D'AGATA: OK. TATIANA: And you helped us. Thank you. CHARLIE D'AGATA: Well, I tried to help you. I didn't do much. TATIANA: No, you do. You saved their life. CHARLIE D'AGATA: She said they were rescued the very next morning, as Russian forces closed in. But other residential neighborhoods just like this are still getting flattened in the path of Russia's grinding military offensive and Ukraine's fight-back, where territory gained and lost is measured not in miles, but feet. And there aren't many happy endings for those caught in the middle. (End VT) ED O'KEEFE: Charlie D'Agata reporting from Ukraine. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) ED O'KEEFE: We will be right back with much more Face the Nation. If you can't watch the full broadcast, you can set your DVR or watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) ED O'KEEFE: Welcome back to Face the Nation. I'm Ed O'Keefe, in this warning from Margaret Brennan. We turn now to the FBI's search at former President Trump's Florida resort. Ohio Congressman Mike Turner is the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee. And he joins us this morning from Dayton, Ohio. Congressman, great to have you with us. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Good morning. ED O'KEEFE: Thank you for being here. This past week, a Florida federal judge asked the Justice Department to prepare a redacted version of the -- of the affidavit that set off the FBI operation at the former president's home, signaling he may be willing to release it as early as this coming week. But affidavits aren't usually made public during an investigation, so as to not impede the investigation. I'm curious, what level of disclosure would satisfy the demand for the release of the affidavit, in your view? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, this is very revealing, because the court has already made a ruling that they believe -- and, remember, the court knows what's in the affidavit -- that portions of the affidavit can be released to the public. Now, what's important about this affidavit is, it will give us the information to understand, how did the FBI justify raiding Mar-a-Lago and spending nine hours in the president's house, when we know the former president's home, they had other options besides just raiding the house? They could have gone in and asked for the subpoena to be enforced. And the mystery sort of here deepens, because we know Attorney General Garland himself has taken responsibility, said he approved it. And the American public want the attorney general focused on issues like human and drug smuggling at the border. They -- Chinese espionage, out-of- control crime in our cities. But if it's -- if you're going to turn to this, if you're going to turn to the former president and Mar-a-Lago, they want to make certain that this is to the highest level, there's an imminent national security threat. And this affidavit will tell us, did they even allege so? Because, in their document trying to keep the affidavit sealed, they didn't even allege that there was a national security threat. ED O'KEEFE: We should point out there's a poll out this morning at another news organization that finds almost six in 10 Americans actually support continuing this investigation. So, while there may be other big issues, there's certainly wide public interest in this one. You're an attorney, though. Why would releasing any information in this affidavit make sense and assure the former president not only a fair investigation by the Justice Department, but, potentially, if it gets to that, a fair trial? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think -- and you're citing polls. And there are lots of polls out there, by the way. The polls also indicate that people want to make certain that -- that, if this is an imminent national security threat, that it's pursued. But, also, they want to make certain that you don't have abuse of discretion here. And what our concern is from our committee is, there's an allegation of classified documents. That falls within our jurisdiction. And show us what you found, because the affidavit is going to have them tell publicly now what they told the court they were going to go find. Show us what you found. It certainly won't affect the investigation. We deal with classified documents and information all the time. Show us what it is that you went into the president's residence, spent nine hours at former President Trump's residence. What is it that was an imminent national security threat, that you didn't just go to court and ask the court to order that the documents be delivered to them? Why did they spend nine -- and just think of the resources of 30 agents that spent nine hours and the preparation for that, when we have real imminent national security threats, like Chinese espionage, the border, issues that -- things that are going on in Ukraine. To take these resources and apply them here, certainly, the American public wants to make certain this is not an abuse of discretion. ED O'KEEFE: Well, I'm curious. Since you're a member of the Intelligence Committee, what use could a former president have for classified or top secret information once he's left office? Why -- why bring it home with him to Florida? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I don't know. I mean, you would have to ask him. But, certainly, we all know that every former president has access to their documents. It's how they write their memoirs. They don't have great recall of everything that's occurred in their administration. And we don't know that they were -- that they were classified. We know, according to the FBI documents, that they were -- they were identified as marked classified. You have, of course, the former president saying that he declassified them himself. But I think what's important here about this abuse of discretion, we have evidence of the FBI abusing that discretion and of misconduct on behalf of the FBI. The FBI -- we had an attorney for the FBI that actually was convicted of doctoring an e-mail to obtain a warrant against -- against Trump. There's -- Trump's organization. You have the FBI using the Russia dossier, which has been proven to be debunked, as evidence under a warrant that they submitted, both -- all of which CBS has reported -- and I have them up on my Web site your own stories of these abuses of discretion. And the other question that we have is, is, just recently, there was a raid on Project Veritas, which is a news organization, to supposedly retrieve President Biden's daughter's diary. Now, that's not certainly an imminent national security threat. It might be embarrassing to the president, but it's not something you'd see them do for ordinary citizens. There are real questions as, what is the FBI doing here? It's the -- it's - - the rank and file FBI agents, everybody agrees we support them. We have great faith in them. But the leadership of the FBI, when they undertake a raid against the current president's political rival, you have to ask these questions. ED O'KEEFE: Real quick, are you aware of any standing order from President Trump that he might have had to -- a standing order to declassify documents he took from the Oval Office to the White House residence while he was in office? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I have never served in the White House. I would never have any knowledge of anything that occurred at the White House. ED O'KEEFE: OK. So the Intelligence Committee wouldn't know whether the president had a standing order? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Whether Biden does, whether anybody does, what they're declassifying. In fact, we weren't even notified when President Biden declassified all the documents... ED O'KEEFE: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: The information concerning the hunt for Zawahiri. And I was very surprised the detail that they made public there. Very concerning as to how it might inform al Qaeda and future people that we're trying to target. ED O'KEEFE: Two quick... REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I had no -- no advanced knowledge or notice when they did that. ED O'KEEFE: OK, two quick questions for you on the future. You want to be the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee next year? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I think that, certainly, my work on the Intelligence Committee is about national security and focusing on national security, and that's going to continue to be my focus. ED O'KEEFE: Give us a sense, then, of what you would investigate if you were head of the Intelligence Committee and Republicans take control of the House. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, as I said from the beginning is, what I think we want Attorney General Garland to be focusing on, instead of Mar-a- Lago, is Chinese espionage, certainly furthering how do we assist Ukraine in fighting Russia aggression, looking at ways that we look at what's going on at the border with human and drug smuggling and how it's affecting our families. And, of course, there's always the issue of the spiraling crime that's occurring in our cities, and how can we impact that? How can we ensure that we have the right tools and information about any foreign influence that might be impacting that? ED O'KEEFE: And, as a Republican in Ohio, what does J.D. Vance, who in some polls is trailing right now, have to do to win that Senate race and hold the seat for Republicans? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes, he has to make the case. And I think he's doing that. He's campaigning very hard. And you should have him on. ED O'KEEFE: We'd love to. In fact, we've asked. And, so far, we haven't heard back. But if he's listening, J.D. Vance, we'd love to have you. Mike Turner, we loved having you. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thanks. ED O'KEEFE: We'll see you soon here in Washington. And we'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) ED O'KEEFE: Now, for a more detailed look at all of the legal problems swirling around former President Donald Trump, we're joined by Rikki Klieman, criminal defense lawyer and a CBS News legal analyst, and, here in Washington, David Laufman, former chief of the Justice Department's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section. Great to have both of you with us. David, I want to begin with you. You're the former head of the division of the Justice Department that's now led by a guy named Jay Bratt, who argued in court this week regarding the potential release of this affidavit that it may -- quote -- \"chill future cooperation by witnesses whose assistance may be sought as this investigation progresses, as well as in other high- profile investigations.\" Do you agree with his assessment? DAVID LAUFMAN (Former Justice Department Chief of Counterintelligence): Based on my experience at the Department of Justice, that's absolutely correct, especially in the early stages of an investigation. The Justice Department and the FBI want to do everything they can to protect the integrity and confidential law enforcement actions that are being taken. ED O'KEEFE: Do you have any sense, then, do you expect he's going to release at least part of this or a redacted version? DAVID LAUFMAN: I think the Justice Department knows it has to come back to the court with a reasonable proposal. The judge signaled pretty clearly that he wants to release some facets of this affidavit. And I think the Department and the FBI are now trying to come to grips with what they can live with, with regard to public disclosures. And there are some portions of the affidavit that I think they'll be willing to make public. ED O'KEEFE: You just heard Congressman Turner of Ohio talking about the possibility of the Intelligence Committee getting read into the details of this at some point. There is bipartisan agreement that they've got to hear something from the Justice Department. It's just a question of when and what exactly and how much. But, in your view, is there a requirement for the Justice Department and FBI to do that at all? DAVID LAUFMAN: I mean, there's no requirement. Look, I mean, there's -- this -- there are sometimes classic collisions between two coordinate branches of government. It does seem to be premature for Congress to be sticking its nose into an ongoing criminal investigation. That's what this is. And just because it implicates classified information, to me, doesn't seem to give a platform for the House Intelligence Committee to intrude at this time. ED O'KEEFE: Because it could unspool in a way where the information you share with them is leaked. And then the investigation's compromised. Its ability to have a fair trial would be compromised, right? DAVID LAUFMAN: I think they're trying to create a kind of a carnival atmosphere, under the patina of the exercise of Congress' constitutional authority to conduct investigations. ED O'KEEFE: Rikki, to you. Allen Weisselberg, the former longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, this past week pleaded guilty to 15 counts of fraud and tax evasion as part of the scheme to receive more than $1.7 million in off-the- books perks and compensation from the Trump Organization. Important to point out the former president hasn't been charged as part of this civil case. But, based on what you know about this case, what we've seen so far, is there any legal risk at this point to a member of the Trump family? RIKKI KLIEMAN: there is hardly any legal risk because of the fact that the plea of Alan Weisselberg is against the Trump Organization, which really means the Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation. It had to do with the fact that he received perks to, as you say, $1.7 million over a period of years. The plea bargain seems abundantly clear. He is testifying against entities, not people. ED O'KEEFE: And there's been so much focus in the past two weeks on the Mar-a-Lago operation, this Weisselberg guilty plea this past week, but I know you believe that it's what's going down in Georgia that is potentially most legally risky for the former president, correct? RIKKI KLIEMAN: There is no doubt in my mind that the most risk to the former president is, in fact, the Georgia investigation. And one of the reasons I say that is because it has intensified in terms of the number of witnesses that the district attorney is calling before this special, investigative grand jury. But, also, the fact that should not be overlooked is that Donald Trump has hired one of the best criminal defense lawyers in the country in the person of Drew Findling. Drew Findling was a past president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. He is based in Atlanta. He knows how to work within the system ethically and properly. And he's fierce. So, when we look at this particular situation, Rudy Giuliani called to testify last week. We have no idea, nor should we have any idea in a secret proceeding, what he said or if he took the Fifth Amendment at any point in time. This week, Lindsey Graham is set to testify on Tuesday, unless the 11th Circuit issues a stay and buys into his argument that his phone calls involving this election in 2020 and the results, when he wanted, allegedly, to say that they should look into the mail-in ballots and perhaps there were many of the mail-in ballots that had faulty signatures and his communications with Donald Trump would be the focus of this particular special grand jury, and that he wants to say, well, no, that was within my duties within the Speech and Debate Clause. We're going to see what the 11th Circuit has to say about that. But I expect Lindsey Graham is going to have to testify. This grand jury is investigative only. They can issue a report that would tell the district attorney at a later point in time whether or not she does have reason to indict, probable cause to indict any of the players, including Donald Trump. ED O'KEEFE: And, David Laufman, in terms of the operation at Mar-a-Lago, at this point, how concerned should any current or former staff of the former president there be concerned about legal exposure? DAVID LAUFMAN: Well, I think any individuals who were involved in removing classified information from the White House in the waning moments of the Trump administration, taking them to Mar-a-Lago, knowingly keeping them there in a place they're not authorized to be, has potential criminal jeopardy, depending on all the facts and circumstances that the investigation uncovers. One of the statutes referenced in the search warrant is the Espionage Act. And at issue, in principle, is a provision that makes it a crime to willfully retain national defense information. And the fact that these were highly classified documents, as high as top secret code word, makes it pretty clear to me the president has potential jeopardy here, compounded by what appear to be deliberate misrepresentations by the president or his team to the government about whether classified information remained at Mar-a-Lago and, hence, the obstruction statute referenced in the search warrant. ED O'KEEFE: Rikki, you've been at this for a long time tracking legal cases of all sorts all across the country. Have you ever seen anyone facing more than a dozen legal, civil, congressional investigations at one time? And what is it like being an attorney for someone like that, when they have competing, compounding legal concerns and interests? RIKKI KLIEMAN: I have never seen this many investigations happening all at the same time, some in greater stages, some in lesser stages. But if you are an attorney for Donald Trump, you are well advised to separate each one and decide where you're going to devote your energies. Donald Trump, it appears, has been hiring lawyers from different places, so one lawyer does not have all of the responsibility. But this is not a good time for Donald Trump, at least if he thinks that everything is coming in upon him. However, we also know that Donald Trump enjoys the chaos. And we will see what happens, in terms of his decision if he is going to run or not in 2024. ED O'KEEFE: We sure will. Rikki Klieman, CBS News legal analyst, David Laufman, former Justice Department official, thank you both for being here. And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) ED O'KEEFE: We want to turn now to campaign '22. Our Robert Costa is on the campaign trail in Atlanta this morning. And the editor in chief of The Cook Political Report, Amy Walter, good friend of Face the Nation, is also here with us. Good morning to both of you. Amy, I want to start with you and something that the White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, said this week about the current state of the presidency and the Democratic Party. Take a listen. (Begin VT) RON KLAIN (White House Chief of Staff): We now have a presidency where the president has delivered the largest economic recovery plan since Roosevelt, the largest infrastructure plan since Eisenhower, the most judges confirmed since Kennedy, the second largest health care bill since Johnson, and the largest climate change bill in history. (End VT) ED O'KEEFE: According to Politico, he went on to say -- quote -- \"the first time we have done gun control since President Clinton was here, the first time ever an African-American woman's been put on the Supreme Court. I think it's a record to take to the American people,\" he says. Are Democrats right now sitting in a pretty good position, because of the issues and the environment, or does it have something to do with the candidates that they're running in these key races across the country? AMY WALTER (Editor in Chief, The Cook Political Report): Right. So, Democrats are clearly in a much better place they were than when we were talking about things in August of last year, right? ED O'KEEFE: Yes. AMY WALTER: So, certainly, beyond just the accomplishments for the White House, we also have lower gas prices. And so we're getting a little bit of relief, at least, when it comes to cost of living issues, which is going to be important for the midterms. To me, the big change as well has been that the focus, instead of being on problems that were happening, whether it was Democrats unable to get big pieces of legislation done, or on the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which obviously was chaotic, or on the fact that inflation was biting a lot of folks, instead, what are -- what has the focus been on? It's been on January 6. It's been on what's happening at Mar-a-Lago. It's been on competitive Republican primaries that have talked a lot about Donald Trump and election denial. And so the camera, so to speak, the media focus has been on -- oh, and on abortion as well -- all the things that are not great for Republicans. Now let's translate that into the campaign to come. Republicans say, that's OK. We had difficult primaries. The focus has not been on the issues we want to talk about. It's been on things Democrats want to talk about. ED O'KEEFE: Yes. AMY WALTER: We're going to refocus back on to inflation, the economy and Biden. Those things will help us win, but pivoting to those issues as candidates who have taken position -- or candidates who've taken positions on election denial, on Donald Trump, on abortion that are outside the mainstream. So, Republicans now have to pivot to the center. Democrats are going to do everything they can to make that hard for them to do. ED O'KEEFE: And, to that point, Bob, let's listen to something that Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had to say about the state of Senate races back in April. (Begin VT) SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: It's a perfect storm of problems for the Democrats. How could you screw this up? It's actually possible. (LAUGHTER) SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: And we have had some experience with that in the past. (End VT) ED O'KEEFE: And, to Amy's point, Bob, they may be having it right now with these candidates that are struggling to get back to the center and talk about other issues of bigger concern. What are you hearing from Republican sources regarding the state of these campaigns and the worry they may have about whether they can land the plane in November? ROBERT COSTA: When I was up at Capitol Hill in recent weeks talking to Republican aides, Republican senators, they kept talking about 2010 and the ghosts of 2010. That was the year there was a Tea Party wave, conservatives on the march in many parts of the country. But Republicans disappointed in the Senate race. You might remember some names like Christine O'Donnell, who failed in her Senate bid in Delaware. Ken Buck failed in his Senate bid in Colorado, though he later got elected to the House. Republicans worry that, though they have a pretty good shot, they feel, in the House, the Senate, because of candidates like Dr. Oz in Pennsylvania, J.D. Vance in Ohio, who are not necessarily catching fire, that that could not bode well for the midterms this fall, especially with the Senate. ED O'KEEFE: There's another round of primary contests, Amy, Tuesday night in New York and in Florida that may give us a sense of the scope and the size of the majority Republicans could enjoy in the House going forward. But what else should we be watching for in those contests? AMY WALTER: We should was looking at -- actually, there's a special election also taking place in New York. Hudson Valley, this is an open seat Democrats hold. Biden won it by just two points. These are the kinds of seats that Republicans are going to need to win if they want to have a big wave, if we're looking at a big wave. And the two issues that we're hearing about, abortion and inflation. ED O'KEEFE: Hudson Valley is in the 518 area code, where I'm from, so I call that God's country, from -- by the way. (LAUGHTER) AMY WALTER: OK. Very good. Very good. ED O'KEEFE: Bob, real quick. We noticed this past week, former Vice President Mike Pence did something that usually a presidential candidate does. They went to Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. They went to the Iowa State Fair with Chuck Grassley. And I think we have a picture of this. He even sent flowers to Chuck Grassley's wife. What is up with the former president? What would be his path forward? And does he really have a theory of the case to make at this point? ROBERT COSTA: Whether it's former Vice President Mike Pence, or Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, there's a galaxy of Republican contenders, possible contenders, who are looking at 2024 and calculating, what does it look like if Trump runs, what does it look like if Trump doesn't run? And, at this point, no one's entirely sure. They believe the former president, based on their own conversations -- and our reporting backs us up -- is looking hard at a race, possibly an announcement later this summer, this fall, toward the winter. But if he doesn't get in for some reason, they want to be ready. That's why Pence is in Iowa, in New Hampshire. He wants to have the relationships with people like Grassley, so if the dynamics change in any way, he can jump in and have a foundation, having tried to rehabilitate himself with the Trump voter, with his book coming out this fall, and some of these visits. But, at this point, there's a lot of uncertainty too. When I talk to top Republicans in this country, they don't know where these investigations are going. I'm heading to Palm Beach this week. You have the affidavit battle down there between the government and the Trump lawyers. Because of that uncertainty over the Trump investigations, so many Republicans are saying: We at least need to start laying an informal groundwork for a possible run. ED O'KEEFE: And we will see. Robert Costa down in Atlanta, headed to Florida, thank you. Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report, we thank you, as always. Great to see you. We will have coverage of the Florida, New York primaries on the CBS News Streaming Network Tuesday night. And we will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) ED O'KEEFE: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Margaret will be back next Sunday. For Margaret and all the hardworking folks at Face the Nation, I'm Ed O'Keefe.",

            "article_content": "A grand jury has subpoenaed several associates of former President Donald Trump in connection with the Department of Justice's investigation into the origins of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, multiple people familiar with the case told CBS News. It is not yet clear how many subpoenas were issued. The Justice Department is looking into the Trump team's fundraising between the 2020 presidential election and Jan. 6, 2021, and how that money was used. That investigation is separate from the inquiry into the former president's handling of classified documents, which resulted in the FBI seizing materials from his Mar-a-Lago residence\u00a0last month. The department's probe of the attack on the Capitol has accelerated over the last week. William Russell, a close adviser to Trump, received a subpoena Wednesday related to the investigation. Russell, 31, was often seen by Trump's side, serving as White House deputy director of advance and trip director. He was with the former president for part of the day of the riot and moved to Florida to continue working for Trump after his presidency. FBI personnel visited Russell's Florida home for questioning Wednesday morning but he was out, according to a person familiar with the matter. Investigators later reached him by phone and served a subpoena via email.\u00a0 A lawyer for Russell, Derek Ross, did not reply to a request for comment. Russell, a Mississippi native, started working at the White House in 2017. A spokesperson for Trump criticized the investigation, claiming the Justice Department was attempting to \"intimidate\" the former president's supporters. \"It will not work. Save America is more committed than ever to working for liberty, free and fair elections, equal justice under the law, strong borders, safe streets, energy independence, great education, and more,\" said Liz Harrington, the spokesperson.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence, who is considering a run for the White House in 2024, is now slated to give a policy speech in Washington, D.C., on the day before the president he served, Donald Trump, will be addressing the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute's two-day summit, also in Washington. Pence will be addressing the Heritage Foundation on July 25, according to a person directly familiar with the event, and the former vice president will focus on his \"Freedom agenda\" policy initiatives and the future of the party, according to the source. Pence has been talking about his agenda as a framework to help Republicans win back Congress in the midterm elections, but it also outlines the themes for his own potential presidential bid.\u00a0 It espouses traditional conservative policies, like cutting taxes and reducing regulations, securing the border and energy independence, as well as standing \"strong against Russia\" and \"confronting communist China.\" The platform makes little mention of Trump, who has excoriated his former vice president because he affirmed President Biden's victory over Trump in the 2020 election, rather than trying to overturn the results the on Jan. 6, 2021.\u00a0 Pence, according to an adviser, will not make a decision on whether to run for president until after the midterms, unlike Trump, who is seriously considering entering the presidential fray before the midterms, according to sources close to him. The former president has hinted he could make an announcement this summer or fall.\u00a0 Trump's speech, which will take place on July 26, marks his first trip back to the nation's capital since he left office on Jan. 21, 2021, and since the Jan. 6 House select committee hearings began. The hearings, which began last month and are continuing in July, are presenting to the public a picture of the extent of Trump's efforts to cling to the presidency, through lawsuits, the machinery of government, far-right groups, intervention in state election certification and the mobs of his supporters who overran the Capitol on Jan. 6. Trump will headline a speech at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, which will be convening a two-day policy conference. At least eight former cabinet members, and over 20 current Republican lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, NRSC chairman Sen. Rick Scott, Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Lindsey Graham, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich will also be addressing the conference. Pence, who was a Trump stalwart throughout his presidency, openly disagrees with the former president's contention that his vice president could change the results of the election. \"I heard this week that President Trump said I had the right to overturn the election. President Trump is wrong,\" Pence said during a speech in Florida in February. In a recent New York Times/Sienna College poll, Pence placed fourth, behind Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz among registered GOP voters, although he also placed second among Black and Latino GOP voters in the same survey.

And this week on Face the Nation, finally, some good news for President Biden and the Democrats on the economic front. But will it be enough to help them in the November midterm elections? Finally freed from COVID isolation, President Biden's last week has been filled with surprises, including a July jobs report with double the number of expected jobs. Unemployment is now at a half-century low, equal to what it was pre-pandemic. And the smile on his face this morning, at long last, there is unity among Senate Democrats when it comes to supporting a long-stalled bill designed to help fight climate change, cut health care costs, and raise taxes on corporations. But there are more challenges ahead for Mr. Biden, including a national public health crisis with rapidly spreading monkeypox cases and new backlash from the Chinese following Speaker Pelosi's trip to Taiwan. Finally, campaign '22 is shaping up as a highly unusual one. We will look at the Trump impact that's influencing Republican primary candidates and the tactics Democrats are using to try and defeat them. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. As we come on the air, the Senate is poised to make the biggest investment to fight global warming in history, with the hopes of reducing carbon emissions 40 percent by 2030. This long-stalled bill will now expand credits for the manufacture and purchase of electric vehicles, fund rebates for energy-efficient appliances, allocate money to fight drought in Western states, and help vulnerable communities impacted by climate change. The bill also cuts health care costs by lowering premiums and extending subsidies. And it caps out-of-pocket Medicare drug costs for seniors at $2,000 a year. To pay for all of that spending, the bill calls for a 15 percent corporate minimum tax on companies that book income of more than a billion dollars a year and will provide money for the IRS to crack down on tax enforcement. With the Senate split 50/50 between the parties, Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to break the tie, which would give Democrats a much- needed boost headed in to the November midterm elections. And we go now to Capitol Hill and Florida Senator Rick Scott, who is in between votes on the Senate floor. He's also the head of the Republican Senate Campaign Committee working to retake control of the Senate. Senator Scott, good morning. I know you have been up all night, so I appreciate you joining me this morning. SENATOR RICK SCOTT (R-Florida): I hope I'm -- I hope I'm coherent. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I -- no matter what, it does not look like there is any way to stop what is expected to be a very big win here for Democrats. And I know you're opposed to it, but I want to press you on that, because isn't expanding Medicare access good for a state like yours, which has more residents reliant on the Affordable Care Act than any other state? And Republicans like reducing the deficit. The CBO says this will reduce it for -- by $100 billion over the next decade. Isn't there some good stuff in here for you too? SENATOR RICK SCOTT: So, Margaret, here's the way I look at it. Right now, this bill actually ought to be called the war on seniors act. I mean, this is a war on Medicare. If you look at this, this is a $280 billion cut in Medicare. So, what's going to happen is, Medicare is going to get caught, and there's going to be seniors that don't get lifesaving drugs because the pharmaceutical industry will not be able to have to -- will be... MARGARET BRENNAN: Reducing Medicare cost is not the same as reducing benefits though. You know that. SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Margaret, it's $280 billion that would have been spent. It was anticipated to be spent. It's not going to be spent now. And the drug companies that would be doing more research are not going to be able to spend the money on research. There will be lifesaving drugs that seniors will not get. On top of that, I mean, they're going to raise taxes by over $700 billion. And let's remember, companies don't end up paying the taxes. Shareholders pay the taxes. Lower income for the employees paid the taxes. Less investment pays the taxes. So, this $700 billion is actually going to hurt the economy. And then, while gas prices are $2 more than they were when Joe Biden took office, there's an excise tax on gas. So, why would you -- you know, we're in a recession. Why would you be increasing the cost of government, increasing taxes? MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget called your claim there that you just reiterated in terms of Medicare spending completely misleading. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that just about 1 percent of new drugs would be affected by the changes there on drug development. So, how do you respond to that? SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Margaret, 1 percent. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What -- it's your grandmother is not 1 percent important? If there's, if -- if it impacts -- if it impacts a life-saving drug that we could do now, we shouldn't be -- we shouldn't be cutting Medicare like this. I don't believe it. And, by the way, we shouldn't be raising taxes ever, but especially in a recession, and why would we be raising the taxes on gas right now when it's $2 above what it was when Joe Biden took office? This is going to continue to drive us into a further -- a bigger recession than we are. Look at where we are right now. Labor participation rate's low, wages not saying with inflation, two-quarters of negative GDP. I mean, we -- this is -- Joe Biden has pushed us and these plans are pushing us into a recession. So, I think we've got to -- we have got to stop raising taxes. We have got to make it easier for businesses to build their businesses, compete, and we'll get more jobs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. Well, you know we just had that stellar July jobs number. But we're going to dig into the specifics of that ahead with economist Mary Daly. Let me talk to you about the politics of all of this. Republicans had been hoping to ride the high inflation we are at -- and it is a historic high -- and President Biden's low approval ratings to a win in November. But the president and Democrats just had a really good streak here. Gas prices are down. You have this massive spending bill going through. These are a lot of big wins for Democrats. The president just authorized that strike to take out the leader of al Qaeda. Isn't this going to get harder for Republicans to get the edge that you are trying to manufacture here? SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Well, that sounds good, right? But that's -- that's White House talking points. But let's think about this; 72 percent of Americans believe we're headed in the wrong track. Biden's numbers are in the tank. And if you look at all the Democrats -- all the Democrats running, and they have to -- basically, they're a surrogate for Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer. I mean, they have to defend inflation, high gas prices, the Afghan withdrawal, an open border, Critical Race Theory, defund the police. That's what they have to defend, because that's what the -- that's what -- that's what Biden is known for, and that's what -- that's basically what Democrats are known for. Now, it's going to be -- look, it's an election year. It's going to be a hard year. We have 21 Republicans up, only 14 Democrats. The Democrats are outraising us. But we have good candidates. And I believe Joe Biden is going to be our key here. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said it'll be a hard year. I want to play for you what Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told FOX last week. (Begin VT) SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-Kentucky): I think it's going to be a very tight -- we have a 50/50 Senate now. We have a 50/50 nation. And I think, when the Senate race smoke clears, we're likely to have a very, very close Senate still, with either us up slightly or the Democrats up slightly. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: If things are so bad, then why is it going to be so tight for Republicans? SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Well, first of all, we have -- we have very good candidates. I mean, the Democrats are raising good money. So we've got to be able to get our message out. So, you know, we -- we have to raise our money. We have to work, work hard. We went through a lot of primaries, so -- but I believe we're going to -- I believe we're going to win. But it's going to be -- it's going to be hard. We have got to raise our money. We got to work really hard, or candidates have to work really hard. Everybody is going to help our candidates. But I'm optimistic. MARGARET BRENNAN: So -- but you do agree it's going to be tight, that Republicans have at best a slight edge? SENATOR RICK SCOTT: I'm very optimistic. I would -- but I -- but I'm -- I'm realistic that you have to raise your money. Democrats are raising good money. Joe Biden is our key here. And, by the way, this bill is not going to help Democrats. It's going to help Republicans, raising taxes $700 billion, cutting Medicare $280 billion, raising gas taxes, having 87,000 more IRS agents. Do you know how much -- how happy people are to have more IRS agents out there? I mean, this is not -- this is not going to be popular around the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: In a local radio interview in July, you talked a lot about your business as an executive, and you said: \"We should start electing people that we would hire.\" In Georgia, Herschel Walker, Republican Senate candidate, has lied about the number of children he has, about his business dealings. His ex-wife said he held a gun to her head and said: \"I'm going to blow your effing brains out.\" In Arizona, the candidate Blake Masters called the Unabomber an underrated thinker. He said that al Qaeda doesn't actually pose substantial threat to Americans. I mean, I have got a list of candidates here who've had some and said some pretty troubling things. Would you hire these people to work for you? SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Well, you'd go through each person, and -- but I'm not the one doing it. It's the voters of those states who are doing it. The voters of those states are going to make a choice, do they want... MARGARET BRENNAN: You're trying to help Senate Republicans and lead them to victory. These are your candidates. SENATOR RICK SCOTT: So, you know, Margaret, as you remember, the voters in Arizona choose who they're going to -- they're going to vote. And what they're going to choose is, they're going to choose between Blake Masters and Mark Kelly. Mark Kelly has voted to keep the border open. He has never voted for border security. He's voted for the tax increases. He's voted for cutting Medicare. You know, he's -- he's voted with Chuck Schumer and with Joe Biden basically 100 percent of time. Warnock has got the same problem. This election is going to be about Joe Biden. And so this election is going to be about all the bad things that have happened, this -- the fact that we're going into recession, the fact that inflation is at 9 percent, the fact that gas prices are up $2, all these things, that's what people are looking at. They're -- they're at home and saying, this is not... MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are -- these are your Senate Republican candidates. These are your candidates. Would you hire them? SENATOR RICK SCOTT: And the voters of these states -- the voters of these states are going to decide if they're going to hire. Now, I get to vote -- I get to vote in Florida. And that's how I think about it. But the voters in those states would choose in those states who they want. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR RICK SCOTT: And it's a choice between two people. But they're -- look, the Biden -- all the -- all the Democrat nominees are basically President Biden clones. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR RICK SCOTT: And, by the way, they won't campaign with Biden. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, if you are -- I mean, you would acknowledge, you would acknowledge... SENATOR RICK SCOTT: None of them -- Margaret, wait a minute. None of them are asking Biden to come down. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... that if somebody went in for an interview for a private corporation, these things would come up as red flags to H.R.? So, it's just... SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Margaret, Biden is not campaigning with anybody because he is -- he is -- he's toxic. That's how the voters think. That's why they say -- 72 percent of Americans say the economy is on the wrong track. When that happens, people say, I'm going to take a serious look at somebody else, right? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR RICK SCOTT: And our candidates have to go tell them what they're going to do. And we're going to make sure that everybody knows exactly who are -- who the Democrats are. That's what -- that's what's going to happen all across the country. And we're going to have races, and we'll see what happens. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you advising all of your candidates in these races to accept the outcome of their elections, since so many of them are questioning still the outcome of the 2020 race? SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Well, Margaret, let's remember, that's exactly what happened to me with Bill Nelson and Marc Elias. They didn't accept the outcome of the election, and they tried to illegally cast -- count ballots after election day after I won by 57,000 votes. So, election security is very important to me. And I want to make sure we make sure we do everything we can to make sure people know that the election is fair. We're already putting together teams, which I had to do in Florida in, in '18, teams of lawyers and volunteers, to make sure these elections are fair. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you accept the elections are -- you know, that the integrity of these races that all your candidates are in? Or you're only going to have a problem with them if they lose? SENATOR RICK SCOTT: Well, I'm -- I -- I want free and fair elections, so I'm going to work my -- work hard to make sure these elections are fair, and then everybody will get to decide at the time. So, I'm still frustrated with what happened in my race... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes. SENATOR RICK SCOTT: ... when we had -- we spent millions of dollars to make sure we won. And we won election night. And they tried to count illegal ballots after election night. And that's wrong. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, before I let you go, do you think that the U.S. military should be deployed to defend Taiwan if Taiwan makes -- China makes a move on it? SENATOR RICK SCOTT: I think we've got to be very clear that we will defend Taiwan. We've got to be very clear exactly what's going to happen to China, with exactly what sanctions are -- is going to happen to China if they invade Taiwan. I think all American businesses need to understand that they're at risk right now if they're doing business there. And I think every American, whenever they see a box that says made in China, they ought to send it back to whoever sent it to them and say, I will never buy another product made in China. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's a whole story about inflation there, Senator, but that's for another day. We got to leave it there. Thank you for your time. And I will let you get back to work there. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who is also a board member at Pfizer. And he joins us this morning from San Francisco. Dr. Gottlieb, good to have you back. You have been on this program warning for some time now that monkeypox was past the point of containment. This week, the Biden administration acknowledged it is a national public health emergency. They added two senior advisers to the White House to run point. What difference does it make now? Can they catch up? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Well, look, I think they can still catch up. I think there's a potential to get this back in the box, but it's going to be very difficult at this point. We're continuing to look for cases in the community of men who have sex with men. It's primarily spreading in that community. But there's no question that it's spread outside that community at this point. And I think we need to start looking for cases more broadly. We're looking for cases in that community, so we're finding them there. But we need to start looking for cases in the broader community. And that means probably testing anyone who presents with an atypical case of shingles or an atypical case of herpes for monkeypox as well. I think we need to broaden testing. And, so far, CDC has been reluctant to make that recommendation. I think, if we're going to contain this and make sure that it doesn't spread more broadly in the population, we need to start testing more broadly. We have the capacity to do it. Right now, CDC has the capacity to conduct about 80,000 tests a week. They're doing about 8,000. So, they can broaden this substantially by changing the case definition and recommending that more doctors be testing more patients, looking for this infection in the community. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, to your point about broader spread, in Illinois, a day care worker tested positive for monkeypox and exposed children. The FDA are allowing those kids to be vaccinated. Parents about to send their kids back to school, should they be worried about this now? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I don't think this is something that people need to be generally worried about. I think that probably the incidence of this infection in the broader community is still very low. So, your risk of coming into contact with monkeypox is exceedingly low, outside of certain social networks where you see a higher case rate. But if we want to contain this, if we want to prevent this from becoming an endemic virus, we need to be looking more widely for it. And the worst-case scenario is that we start testing more broadly and we don't find it. And that would be reassuring. But we should be doing that. We should also be testing wastewater for monkeypox. That's something that CDC can turn on instantly, starting to look for monkeypox in wastewater to see if it's spreading in communities and locations, geographic locations, where right now we don't think it's spreading, but it could be. MARGARET BRENNAN: We don't know what we don't know. On vaccines, we know there is a national shortage. There are two doses of this vaccine that are required. HHS and the FDA said on Thursday that they're looking at a dose-sparing approach to stretch out existing supply. How does that work? What does that mean? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. So, this decision could come as early as this week. And the emergency use authorization that they could issue is, it flows from the public health emergency that they declared. So, this would be the first practical effect of that public health emergency. What they would do is cut the dose by a fifth, so they only give one-fifth of the dose. And instead of injecting it subcutaneously, so below the skin, they'd inject intradermally into the skin, so into the top layer of the skin. So think about a test that you get, for example, for tuberculosis, where you used to get an injection under the skin and you'd get a small welt as they injected fluid under the skin. That's an intradermal infection. We know that we inject certain things into the skin in that way. It's very immunogenic. You get a strong immune response. And there's a lot of data that FDA has looked at that was actually collected in the context of trying to prepare for smallpox, a potential outcome with smallpox, where smallpox might be used as a bioterrorist weapon, in how we would extend doses of the smallpox vaccine. What they learned from those studies is transferable to this vaccine for monkeypox. And so they feel very assured that they can -- they can generate a strong immunological response by delivering this intradermally. And that would allow them to stretch out the doses of the monkeypox vaccine they have by fivefold. So, instead of having about 800,000 doses, they would have somewhere between four and five million doses immediately. MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is essentially an experiment in real time. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, we've done it before. I mean, we did it for yellow fever. We've done it for Ebola. We've done these dose-sparing strategies in public health emergencies. It's unfortunate we find ourselves in this position. There's decisions that could have been made earlier where we'd have more doses available. But this is a practical solution to a very immediate public health challenge. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about COVID now. President Biden has tested negative twice now. He's out of isolation. Pfizer makes Paxlovid, the drug that the president took. I know you're on the board of Pfizer, as we say. The White House says just 5 to 10 percent of cases have these rebounds. But this is a pretty high-profile case. Dr. Fauci had a rebound too. Does this indicate anything about how someone fares long term from COVID? How do we understand this? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes. Well, look, the good news is that the president's feeling well. My understanding is that he didn't experience any new symptoms during this second bout of infectivity. So, he was testing positive, but didn't in fact mount new symptoms. And that's a good sign. I don't think that he's going to have any long-term implications because he had this second course of illness from COVID. We don't know, but I think the president's going to do quite well, given what we know about his case. And the White House has been very transparent. You are seeing these cases of rebound. You're right. So far, the data seems to suggest it's about 5 percent of cases. You also see rebound with the other drugs. And you see it in the setting of natural infection. It's being studied. Pfizer right now, which, as you mentioned, I'm on the board of, is talking to FDA about doing some additional studies on how to approach these cases, whether or not you recourse the therapy or extend the dose, the length of treatment in certain patients. So we don't know how to approach this fully right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: But it's a small percentage of cases where you're seeing this phenomena. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Quickly. CDC is expected to loosen COVID guidelines for schools. Do you favor this? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think it reflects the reality that more kids are -- have been exposed to this virus, they're not immunologically naive - - we want to do more to keep kids in the classroom -- and changing attitudes about COVID. I think there are still ways we can keep kids safe in the classrooms, remain vigilant, and lift some of these restrictions that have caused a lot of kids to have to miss school days. So, the test-to-stay strategies, where you have turned over a lot of infections that were asymptomatic and forced kids out of the classroom, quarantining kids who are exposed to COVID, I think they can lift those things at this point. And that seems to be where CDC is heading, but still remain vigilant, for example, notifying parents when there's a close contact.. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: ... so parents can keep an eye on their children and get them tested. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Dr. Gottlieb, we'll be watching that. Thank you. We'll be back in a moment. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the state of the economy and the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, Mary Daly. Good morning to you. MARY DALY (President and CEO, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: The San Francisco Fed said fiscal spending during the entirety of the pandemic, all the congressional funding, contributed 3 percent -- a 3 percent hike in inflation. Do you expect the congressional bill that's about to pass to add to inflation as well? MARY DALY: Well, let's remember that, during the time that there was this fiscal relief during the pandemic, there was also monetary policy relief. And those were things necessary to get us through the pandemic. So that's why that was such an important component. And history will be the judge whether it was too much or too little. But, right now, that's where that was. And my staff have evaluated that. When I look forward, there are so many things going on in the economy right now, both domestically and globally. And we are struggling with high inflation. But the Fed is committed to bringing that down. And we're looking at not only things that Congress passes, but also what happens across the entire world. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you think this bill will add to inflation? Has inflation peaked? Can you say that? MARY DALY: You know, I really can't comment on pending legislation. And it's really hard to tell, because all the details haven't been worked out yet, and -- or the time frame in which those things will take place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MARY DALY: So, right now, I think the most important thing, Margaret, is that inflation is too high, and the labor market is strong. The global economy is struggling with ongoing high inflation. And that's what I'm focused on. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are a labor economist. We had this surprisingly strong jobs number on Friday. Why was it so surprising? What was it that economists missed here? What was your takeaway? MARY DALY: You know, it's super interesting. You know, it did surprise everyone who tries to figure out exactly what the number will be. And we were -- you know, a number of projections were well off. But, frankly, if you're out in the communities, if you're traveling anywhere, you're just going in your own community, I don't think consumers or workers or businesses were that surprised. There's help wanted signs all over the place. People can find multiple jobs if they want them. Search times for jobs aren't that long. So I think the labor market is continuing to deliver. It just tells me that people want to work and that people want to hire. MARGARET BRENNAN: But... MARY DALY: The universal truth is that inflation's too high. MARGARET BRENNAN: But does it still -- or does it indicate that recession is not where we are or where we're going? MARY DALY: If you're out in the economy, you don't feel like you're in a recession. That's the bottom line. The most important risk out there is inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. MARY DALY: And I think the job market just confirms that. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. We're going to take a break and come right back with you. Mary Daly, stay with us. We have more questions. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back a lot more Face the Nation, including more with Mary Daly. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation now with the head of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, Mary Daly. In that jobs number on Friday, we also saw that wages rose, but they're not rising as quickly as inflation is. How concerned are you that that shows inflation is really becoming embedded in the economy in a way that is really going to force your - your colleagues at the Fed to continue to have to hike rates? MARY DALY: You know, I don't see inflation as embedded in the economy. The kinds of things that we would worry about just not being able to correct easily. What I see is supply and demand are just unbalanced. About 50 percent, by my own staff's estimates, of the excess inflation we see is related to demand. The other 50 percent is supply. The Fed is really well-positioned to bring demand down. And we already see the cooling forming in the housing market, in investments. So, I do see signs that the economy's cooling. It just is going to take some time for the interest rate adjustments we've made to work their way through. And we are far from done yet. That's the promise to the American people. We are far from done. We're committed to bringing inflation down. And we'll continue to work until that job is fully done. MARGARET BRENNAN: So it would still be appropriate to raise rates in September by half a percent? MARY DALY: Absolutely. And, you know, we need to be data dependent. It could -- we need to leave our minds open. We have two more inflation reports coming out. Another jobs report. We continue to collect all the information from the contacts we talk to, to see how this is working its way through the economy. But you mentioned, you know, wage growth a little bit above 5 percent. Inflation, last print, at 9.1 percent. Americans are losing ground every day, so the focus has to be on bringing inflation down. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things the Fed can't control is geopolitical risk. How concerned are you about what is happening in the Taiwan Strait right now? MARY DALY: Well, there's so much going on globally. And I think that's really something that we need to think about. It's just getting through Covid, making sure the new variants don't derail economic activity. We have central banks across the globe raising interest rates to try to bridle their own inflation. And we have ongoing developments that take place, you know, geopolitically or just more generally among countries. And all of those things, the war in Ukraine, all of those things create headwinds, if you will, for the U.S. economy. And we're going to have to lean against those headwinds for growth while we bridle inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed has its work cut out. And I know we'll be talking again. Thank you very much, Mary Daly. MARY DALY: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: China launched its most dramatic show of military force in decades with four days of war games off the coast of Taiwan. All in response to Speaker Pelosi leading a congressional delegation to the self- governed island last week. Congressman Gregory Meeks, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was on that trip. Good morning. REPRESENTATIVE GREGORY MEEKS (D-New York): Good morning. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have been globe-trotting. But I imagine you'll soon be back in Washington to vote on this big spending bill. It is a big win, potentially, but it's a tenth of the size of the president's original ask. Is what's about to pass and this reduction in gas prices enough to help Democrats win in November? REPRESENTATIVE GREGORY MEEKS: There's no question this is a big and important bill. It reduces inflation. It makes sure that we can now reduce drug prices. It helps with fighting climate change. And we will be moving forward. That goes on top of wins already made in a bipartisan manner during this Congress, like bipartisan wins in infrastructure, gun control, chips and science act, PACT Act for the veterans, the select committee, the first black woman elected -- appointed to the Supreme Court. So, yes, this is an icing on the cake of moving forward, of Democratic achievements in a bipartisan way in this election year. MARGARET BRENNAN: But despite all of what you just laid out, I know you know that many polls, including those from CBS, project that Republicans will win the majority in the House. Can you reverse that? REPRESENTATIVE GREGORY MEEKS: Oh, absolutely. I think that the conversations as we're interesting the crucial months of September and October. Look, we had an all-time low unemployment rate. And we see a court that is regressive and trying to take away a woman's right to choose. We're fighting and standing for that. MARGARET BRENNAN: To your trip to Taiwan. We have seen these dramatic Chinese war games in response to this visit. China cut off some of the diplomatic ties with the United States to protest the fact that you went there to Taipei with Speaker Pelosi. Did this trip backfire by undermining some of the Biden administration priorities? REPRESENTATIVE GREGORY MEEKS: Not at all. You know, clearly the Biden administration, by his presence there, and by increasing economic ties there, is something that shows that the region is very important. And President Biden understands, being a prior member of the Senate, you know, the difference between the executive branch and the legislative branch. And so what we have to do at this time, because there's very clearly -- it's very clearly a tense moment in the Taiwan Strait, and that's why it's very important that all sides respect the status quo, which we did when we were there, and don't resort to force or to change things, and it's just as important that the United States redouble our economic, cultural, and security cooperation with Taiwan in the face of Beijing's aggression. So, this was a very appropriate trip at the time for the region. And I think that when we talked to the Taiwanese, they were appreciative of us being there. You should have seen, over 250,000 Taiwanese tracked our flight flying in. On the largest building in Taiwan, big signs saying, \"we love you, Nancy Pelosi.\" People lining the streets when we were driving to our hotel. So, clearly, the Taiwanese were very happy. MARGARET BRENNAN: No doubt. REPRESENTATIVE GREGORY MEEKS: And let me tell you, we were -- all of our allies, all of our partners and friends in the region, and the other nations that we visited, was very happy that we were there. And I think that's very -- MARGARET BRENNAN: But Beijing was furious. Beijing was furious. They cut off climate change talks with the United States. They've cut other cooperation. And, in fact, Beijing said this is the one issue that the U.S. and China, the two most powerful countries in the world, could come into conflict with. Beijing said a visit by the third highest ranking official in the U.S. government on a military aircraft was provocative and sends a strong signal the U.S. is on Taiwan's side. Is the U.S. on Taiwan's side? REPRESENTATIVE GREGORY MEEKS: We did not thing that was -- if you look at provocative, the ones that were sending missiles over Taiwan and China encircled the island was in fact Beijing. This was nothing unusual. Members of Congress this year have traveled to Taiwan previously. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE GREGORY MEEKS: I've traveled to Taiwan a number of times. I've traveled to China. But we're not going to allow -- and Speaker Pelosi is absolutely right about this -- that to have President Xi dictate to us where we should or should not go. We are going to stand by our friends, our partners, and our allies. And, clearly, Taiwan is one of those. And so the -- being provocative is not us, it's the Beijing government and we're just not going to allow that to happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of this policy, for decades it's been one of strategic ambiguity. The U.S. sells arms to Taiwan but doesn't promise to actually defend it. Do you need to change that? Does Congress need to prepare for a Chinese invasion of Taiwan? REPRESENTATIVE GREGORY MEEKS: Look, what we have done, and I think that what we have showed we will do, is to give -- and we have given in that policy defensive weapons to Taiwan. Ultimately, this should be decided by people sitting down, and not China, and not Beijing, and not Xi, continue his provocative actions. It is his provocative actions that is trying to change the status quo. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE GREGORY MEEKS: What we need at this time is the status quo to remain as is. And that is the best way to reduce tensions, not the provocations that are being put on by Beijing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Meeks, thank you for your time this morning. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday I sat down with Taiwan's representative to the U.S., Hsiao Bi-Khim, for the \"CBS EVENING NEWS.\" Here is more of our interview. (BEGIN VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden indicated the military wasn't enthusiastic about Speaker Pelosi visiting. Xi spoke openly about the risk of her plane being shot down. Did Taiwan ever have that level of concern that there was a risk here? HSIAO BI-KHIM (Taiwan's Representative to the United States): We have been living under the threat from China for decades. And we cannot let their ongoing threats define our desire to make friends internationally. If you have a kid being bullied at school, you don't say you don't go to school. You try to find a way to deal with the bully. And that's exactly what Taiwan is doing, working on making our society stronger and more resilient, fortifying our defenses so that we have means of managing risks. The risks are not posed by Taiwan, nor are they posed by the United States. The risks are posed by Beijing. MARGARET BRENNAN: What specifically is that risk? Is it a full-scale invasion? HSIAO BI-KHIM: Well, the Chinese have not renounced the use of force. They have been intensifying threats towards Taiwan. That is not only on a military level. It has involved a hybrid toolkit of public disinformation, cyberattacks, economic coercion. They have a broad toolkit that we have become more and more accustomed to. But, again, that is not going to change our determination to defend our freedom. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what's happening right now is unprecedented. Beijing has sent 68 war planes, 13 warships right off your coast. Do you believe that this is just a drill? HSIAO BI-KHIM: Well, indeed, China's behavior is unprecedented. And from the scope and the actions, it appears that they have been preparing for this for some time, way before Speaker Pelosi decided to visit Taiwan. MARGARET BRENNAN: China is seemingly showing that it can blockade Taiwan, that it can cut you off from the rest of the world. What is the cost of doing something like that? HSIAO BI-KHIM: Well, China has been building up their military capacities rapidly over recent years. And what they are doing through these exercises has the potential of jeopardizing some of the most important air and sea commercial routes. I believe they will also jeopardize China's interest in a stable environment under which trade and commerce can function. Such risky and dangerous behavior has implications for the world. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any assurances from the Biden White House that they would defend you, not just sell you weapons, as presidents have for the past 40 years, but actually come to your defense? HSIAO BI-KHIM: We have a very strong security partnership that ensures the protection of our hared interest in the regional peace and stability. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe the timeline for an invasion is moving up. The criticism of what Speaker Pelosi did by visiting is that she is provoking China. HSIAO BI-KHIM: Well, I think the word \"provocation\" has only one place, and that's with China right now. They are the ones that are provoking regional instability. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you do not think that this was a mistake and that this visit has backfired? HSIAO BI-KHIM: Well, the visit has been welcomed by the Taiwanese people. Sometimes it's hard for other countries from afar to fully understand the feelings and perspectives of the Taiwanese people. And that is, for too long, you know, we have been bullied, isolated, and suppressed and banned from international organizations. So, when friends come from afar and wish to lend their support to Taiwan, we generally take that with gratitude. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you talk to Biden administration officials, they will say Xi Jinping, the president of China, is taking notes. He is watching what Vladimir Putin is doing right now in Ukraine as a test case to see what he can get away with in Taiwan. What lesson do you think he's learning right now? HSIAO BI-KHIM: I think we are all learning lessons. And the Taiwanese people are also learning lessons. And we are learning that we have to be better prepared. We have to be stronger in our own self defenses. We have to work hard to galvanize international support in working to deter that tragic scenario from ever happening. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you concerned that the west won't stand by Taiwan the way it has stood by Ukraine? China is financially so powerful. It would be hard for the west to cut it off. HSIAO BI-KHIM: Well, I think that was one of the messages that Speaker Pelosi was trying to convey. And that is, you know, despite all challenges, we have friends in the international community who will stand with us. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, lastly, China has also flexed its diplomatic muscles. It cut off a number of agreements, it says, with the United States because of this visit, including collaboration on climate change. Are you concerned that the west will look at this and say, it's not worth it? Not just on climate change but on other priorities that outrank Taiwan. HSIAO BI-KHIM: Well, are we concerned, yes, we are concerned about the disruption of these very important discussions on global issues that are matters of interest to not only the United States but to China and everyone in the world. But the fact is, again, visits, congressional visits to Taiwan have been ongoing for decades. And for decades it hasn't prevented the United States and China from having constructive discussions on matters of mutual interest. And I agree with, you know, some of the U.S., White House and other statements and the analyses that, you know, the Beijing government is currently trying to manufacture a crisis over a practice that has been ongoing for decades. And they are using this as a pretext. And I think we have to make that clear. If China is to evolve as a responsible stakeholder in the global community, it's really up to Beijing to decide if their rejuvenation, if China's rejuvenation will evolve with international respect or with international condemnation. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Our full conversation is on our website and YouTube channel. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Michigan Congressman Peter Meijer is one of ten House Republicans who voted to impeach former President Trump following the attack on the Capitol. Last Tuesday he lost his primary race against a Trump-endorsed challenger. Congressman Meijer is with us this morning from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Good morning to you, Congressman. The person who won that primary is an election denier named John Gibbs, and he is backed by former President Trump. Why do you think Michigan Republicans favored him? REP. PETER MEIJER (R-Michigan): Well, good morning, Margaret. And as you said, I lost my primary and that is on me. I take responsibility for that. But it's important to note that it wasn't just former President Trump who was in this race. There was about a half million dollars that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, in their first expenditures of the 2022 midterms, dumped in to help boost him. So, we had a scenario where not only did I have the former president aligned against me, but in a rare showing of bipartisan unity, Nancy Pelosi and the House Democratic Campaign Committee also united to try to knock me off the ballot. Now, this just highlights the cynicism and hypocrisy of our politics today. And, frankly, it will be unknowable what that ultimate impact was. But the fact that we have the establishment left and the extreme right locking arms in common cause paints a very telling picture of where our politics are in 2022. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. What you're talking about there is an ad that the Democratic congressional committee campaign spent, $325,000 on to boost Mr. Gibbs, which was almost as much as Gibbs spent on his entire campaign. That's what you're referring to. That's what our viewers are looking at right there. But do you think that ad really made a difference? I mean Democrats aren't voting in this primary, it's Republicans. Why did Michigan Republicans fall for this ad? PETER MEIJER: Well, you know, I think there is a clear question of agency here, of course. And at the end of the day, Republican voters are going to cast their votes as they see fit. I should note that this add was not aimed at -- was not playing on MSNBC. It was not playing in places where Democratic voters might see it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PETER MEIJER: It was targeted in places to try to sway and convince Republican primary voters to try to give my primary challenger a boost up and over. And I should add that my defeat was by roughly 3 percent. Out of over 100,000 votes cast, we lost by less than 4,000 votes. And I think that's important to remember when you have very close elections like this, and obviously competing against very strong headwinds, having a Trump- endorsed challenger, and a party where President Trump still holds over 75 percent approval, that a message of focusing on the substance of what I've been able to accomplish in office, I'm proud that our office is on track to set a record for the most number of bills signed into law by a freshman, that those type of accomplishments get lost in our current personality politics, get lost in a broader sense. And I think that is one of the fundamental challenges that we have as a country, and that is frankly frustrating Michigan families that we are dealing with the politics that does not reward substance, that does not reward, you know, reality, but that focuses on rhetoric and personality above all else. MARGARET BRENNAN: But does that mean -- do you think Democrats are going to get what they paid for here, right? I mean they're betting that it would be easier to defeat Mr. Gibbs than you. Is your district going to go to a Democrat? PETER MEIJER: Yes, it's important to note, this is a district that President Biden won in 2020 by roughly 9 points. I was one of five Republicans running for re-election in seats where the - where President Biden won in the 2020 elections by eight or more points. And so while I think there is certainly a cynical calculus at play with the Democrats' meddling, this is a risky strategy, it's a dangerous strategy. Where President Biden is in his approval is so in the gutter that it is hard to see that strategy - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PETER MEIJER: It is easy to see that strategy backfiring in a spectacular way, which is all the more reason why we should not be embracing this zero sum idea of politics. We should not be embracing this notion that if we can keep a problem alive, keep it festering, but be able to gain a marginal advantage in the process, that that that somehow equates to a victory. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PETER MEIJER: I think it's a dark and cynical way of viewing our politics that, frankly, 48 percent of the electorate in the primary here rejected. That they stood against that cynicism. That They were focused on somebody who is working to deliver results. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Your Republican colleague, Liz Cheney, is about to face a primary August the 16th in her state. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, her father, released this video. (BEGIN VC) DICK CHENEY, (Former U.S. Vice President and Rep. Liz Cheney's Father): In our nation's 246-year history there has never been an individual who was a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump. He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He is a coward. A real man wouldn't lie to his supporters. He lost his election and he lost big. I know it, he knows it, and deep down, I think most Republicans know it. (END VC) MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Mr. Cheney right there? Because 57 percent of Republicans told CBS News they're more likely to vote for a candidate who gets an endorsement from the former president. Is the former president the leader of the Republican Party or the biggest threat to our nation's republic? PETER MEIJER: Well, I certainly think that, you know, President Trump wants to keep those numbers up. He wants that degree of influence. And I mentioned earlier, the common cause between the extremes on the right and the establishment left, you know, Nancy Pelosi, I think she's waking up every day crossing her fingers that Donald Trump runs in 2024, that he announces well ahead of the midterms because right now the midterms are set to be a referendum on President Biden's leadership. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. PETER MEIJER: And Speaker Pelosi and many of my House Democratic colleagues do not want that. They want it to be a referendum on former President Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. PETER MEIJER: And I think former President Trump wants that as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be watching that primary. And, Congressman, thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week. (ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

            "article_content": "Tuesday's primaries are among the busiest in the 2022 midterm primaries. Five states in total are holding primaries (Arizona, Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and Washington).\u00a0 From more ways to gauge how much sway an endorsement from former President Donald Trump has, to direct ballot measures about abortion access, to the last remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. Here are some of the races to watch: The Arizona GOP primary for senate, governor, and secretary of state on Tuesday are a major test of Trump's influence over the Republican Party. Republican Voters will be picking their nominees but the future direction of the GOP is also at stake. And Tuesday's results from Arizona could be a preview of the conservative brand that may take center stage in the 2024 presidential election.\u00a0 In the Senate, Trump has backed 35-year-old Blake Masters, a venture capitalist who was\u00a0 the chief operating officer of Thiel's investment firm, Thiel Capital, and the president of Thiel's foundation. Thiel has spent at least $15 million to support Masters, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. \u00a0 Masters' primary opponents include businessman Jim Lamon, retired U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael McGuire and Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich.\u00a0 Two polls this week indicate Masters has a comfortable lead going into Tuesday's primary. That lead has continued to grow since Trump endorsed Masters in late June. A poll of likely Republican voters from OH Predictive on Sunday morning showed Masters at 36% with businessman Jim Lamon at 21% and Brnovich at 12%. That mirrors Sunday's Emerson poll, which also had Masters leading the pack with 40% of the support followed by 22% for Lamon and 14% for Brnovich. \u00a0\u00a0 Lamon told CBS News on Monday that \"Democrats are paying\" for Masters to win the primary. \"Democrats would love to run against Masters, they'll beat him like a drum,\" Lamon said. The businessman aligns with Trump on conservative issues but said the former president \"absolutely\" made a mistake endorsing Masters over him.\u00a0 The winner of Tuesday's Senate primary will take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a former astronaut whose seat is a top target for Republicans. Kelly has raised over $55.8 million this cycle and has about $25 million cash on hand.\u00a0 In the GOP race for governor, former TV news anchor Kari Lake and lawyer Karrin Taylor Robson are in a tight contest that repeats a dynamic between Trump and former Vice President MIke Pence.\u00a0 Trump has backed Lake, while Pence, along with term-limited sitting Governor Doug Ducey, have backed Taylor Robson. Last month, Trump and Pence held dueling rallies for Lake and Robson on the same day.\u00a0 While Lake has led in a majority of the polls, an Emerson College poll on Sunday showed a \"dead heat\" between the two, with Lake just up by one percentage point.\u00a0 Trump backed Lake early and visited the state twice to support her. Some Republican voters in Arizona say they are only backing Trump-endorsed candidates this cycle. Fred Warden, a fire pilot from Tucson, told CBS News that Trump's endorsement of statewide candidates is a \"big factor\" for him. \"I wouldn't vote for anybody that he hasn't endorsed,\" Warden said before a joint Lake and Masters rally on Sunday. Donna Hale, a dietician from southern Arizona, said the former president \"started a populist movement that helped to wake up the average American,\" and she added that she hopes Trump runs again in 2024. Democrats will choose between Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and Marco Lopez, a businessman and former chief of staff at Customs and Border Protection. Whether Missouri Republicans elect former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned after a sex scandal in 2018 and has faced claims of domestic abuse by his ex-wife, in Tuesday's primary or another GOP candidate could determine how competitive this reliably Republican state is in November. Greitens is part of a crowded field of 21 GOP nominees looking to replace retiring Republican Sen. Roy Blunt. Attorney General Eric Schmitt has recently been leading in polls, with Rep. Vicky Hartzler at second, Greitens behind her and Rep. Billy Long at fourth. Schmitt and Hartzler have highlighted the domestic abuse allegations against Greitens, and called on him to drop out of the race. Greitens has denied the allegations.\u00a0 The former governor led in polls as recent as June. But over $11 million on advertisements has been spent by anti-Greitens groups, such as the \"Show Me Values PAC\" or the \"Save Missouri Values PAC,\" whose donors include Theil.\u00a0 \"I wanted to protect our children because I was afraid of what Eric [Greitens] would do,\" one ad, which uses a vocal reenactment of the affidavit by Greiten's ex-wife.\u00a0 Greitens' campaign has called the ad blitz a \"smear\" campaign and characterized it as a battle between \"MAGA\" and Senate Minority\u00a0Leader Mitch McConnell in a post last week. His campaign has also referred to his wife as a \"deranged individual.\" \"Anti-Trump establishment insiders are spending to the tune of $11 million to smear the undoubted MAGA champion in the Missouri Senate race: Navy SEAL Eric Greitens,\" the post reads. On Monday, the eve of the primary, Trump finally weighed in on the race, tipping the scale for \"ERIC.\"\u00a0 \"I trust the Great People of Missouri, on this one, to make up their own minds, much as they did when they gave me landslide victories in the 2016 and 2020 Elections, and I am therefore proud to announce that ERIC has my Complete and Total Endorsement,\" Trump wrote in a statement Monday night, apparently rejecting anyone not named Eric. Two of the three Erics seized on the tweet to claim the Trump endorsement: Eric Schmitt and\u00a0Eric Greitens. On the Democratic side, former Marine Lucas Kunce and Trudy Busch Valentine, a philanthropist with ties to the Anheuser-Busch brewery, are in a tighter-than-expected primary. A late July poll by Emerson College and The Hill has Busch Valentine ahead of Kunce by four points. One other candidate to watch in November is John Wood, who was the senior investigative counsel for the Jan. 6 committee. He submitted over 22,000 signatures on Monday to get his name on the ballot as an independent candidate, according to the Kansas City Star. A dysfunctional Republican primary to take on Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has been seen as vulnerable in November, will come to an end on Tuesday. In May, a court threw out multiple leading candidates due to petition signature fraud, including former Detroit Police Chief James Craig. Five Republicans made it to the final ballot.\u00a0 Trump made a splash last Friday when he backed former actress and conservative activist/anchor Tudor Dixon, who had been holding a lead in recent polls and has been seen by Republican strategists as a strong candidate to take on Whitmer in November.\u00a0 But Kevin Rinke, whose fortune from his family's automotive group has allowed him to spend $6.5 million on ads, has hammered Dixon for not being Trumpy enough and for having the support of former Trump-era Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. On Sunday, his campaign hit Dixon for being noncommittal on a question about whether she believes the 2020 election was stolen.\u00a0 Ryan Kelley, a Jan. 6 attendee who was arrested by the FBI in June, has often placed third or fourth in the polls behind Dixon and Rinke. He and Garrett Soldano, a chiropractor who started an anti-Whitmer Facebook group during the pandemic, are seen as the \"grassroots\" candidates by local Republicans.\u00a0 Facebook shut the group down after repeated violent threats to Whitmer. But all the candidates oppose Whitmer's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, often bringing it up during debates and in advertisements.\u00a0 The Supreme Court's Dobbs decision on abortion access could also play a huge role in this race in November. Whitmer is currently engulfed in court battles to prevent a 1930-era abortion ban from taking effct. It allows no exceptions except to save the life of the child bearer.\u00a0 Planned Parenthood's Michigan chapter lost a case in the state's Court of Appeals on Monday morning over the ban. The court's ruling allows county prosecutors to begin enforcing the 1931 ban. All of the GOP candidates support the ban. Whitmer, a prolific fundraiser in her first term, has already spent $9.7 million on ads attacking Republicans in the primary. \"Put Michigan First,\" an organization propped up by the Democratic Governors Association, has been the top spender with $23.3 million spent on ads supporting Whitmer, or in a continuation of their strategy in other hostile GOP primaries, hitting a specific GOP candidate (Dixon) to create more space for their preferred general election challengers to win the primary.\u00a0 In two of the battleground states that flipped from Trump to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, the race for secretary of state, the top election official, is on the minds of Trump and other who believe that election was \"stolen.\" In Arizona, State Rep. Mark Finchem, a member of the far right Oath Keepers who helped organize the \"#StopTheSteal\" movement in Arizona, is running on a platform of outlawing early voting. Finchem was endorsed by Trump in Sept. 2021. Both he and another primary candidate, state Rep. Shawnna Bolick, believe the Arizona legislature should be empowered to overturn the will of the voters and choose its own presidential electors and revoke election certifications. They are facing down two other Republican candidates, state Rep. Michelle Ugenti-Rita and businessman Beau Lane, who don't believe in election conspiracies but still support stricter voting requirements. Democrats have two candidates: Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes, a controversial figure who went against Hobbs' office's counsel and sent Democratic primary ballots to registered partisans who didn't request them, and Arizona House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding, who has more buy-in from the state party. In Michigan, there is no primary to choose the position; instead the state's respective parties vote for their preferred candidate.\u00a0 Kristina Karamo, the likely GOP nominee in November, was a poll watcher in 2020 who signed an affidavit claiming she had witnessed voter fraud during the ballot counting in Detroit. Her claim has been debunked. She signed onto a lawsuit to overturn Biden's 154,188 vote win in 2020 and called for a \"forensic audit\" of the election.\u00a0 She will face Democratic incumbent Jocelyn Benson, who helped institute dropping the state's requirement that voters have an excuse in order to obtain a mail ballot, the result of a 2018 ballot measure. In 2020, Benson sent all registered voters an absentee ballot application, which prompted the criticism of Trump and Republicans.\u00a0 Arizona state Senate's 10th District: GOP House Speaker Rusty Bowers faces party revolt in his bid for state Senate Arizona GOP House Speaker Rusty Bowers, following his decision to testify before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, is facing a revolt from his party. He's term-limited out of his House seat, and is instead running for state Senate. While typically such a prominent Republican leader might easily win a primary contest, Bowers' case is different.\u00a0 Days away from the primary election, the Arizona GOP voted to formally censure the leader for his testimony, a culmination of the frustrations many far-right members have with Bowers' past refusals to support Trump-backed attempts to overturn the 2020 election. This year, for instance, Bowers helped block a bill, introduced by now-Secretary of State candidate Rep. Shawnna Bolick, that empowered the legislature to choose its own electors, regardless of how the people voted. For his actions, the former president lashed out against him, calling the Speaker a \"RINO coward,\" and endorsed his opponent, former state Sen. David Farnsworth. Sharing the ballot with the GOP gubernatorial primary on Tuesday is Kansas' \"Value Them Both Amendment,\" where a \"yes\" vote would affirm the lack of a constitutional right to abortion in Kansas and enable the GOP-led legislature to pass new laws restricting or banning abortion access. A \"no\" vote against the amendment upholds the right to an abortion in the state. As of the morning of Saturday, 244,990 ballots have been cast early, including 111,400 Republicans, 96,871 Democrats and 35,450 independents both with returned mail in voting and early in person voting, according to Kansas' Secretary of State office. In 2018, 70,575 voters cast a ballot early. Tuesday's primary will finalize the matchup between incumbent Democratic Governor Laura Kelly and Republican Attorney General Derek Schmidt. Republicans are eager to oust Kelly, a former state senator who\u00a0 won her race in 2018 by focusing on education and riding on a wave of economic animosity towards outgoing Republican Governor Sam Brownback and his failed economic policies. Three of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump are on the ballot Tuesday: Peter Meijer of Michigan's 3rd District, Dan Newhouse of Washington's 4th District and Jamie Herrera-Beutler of Washington's 3rd District.\u00a0 A majority of those 10 House Republicans are out\u2013 four retired before their primaries and one, Rep. Tom Rice of South Carolina, lost his primary against a Trump-backed challenger.\u00a0 Meijer, a freshman Republican in a swing district centered around Grand Rapids, Mich., is in a tough race against John Gibbs, a former Trump-era Housing and Urban Development official. An internal poll from Gibbs campaign from mid-July showed him with an 18-point lead over Meijer. That number grows after voters are told of Trump's endorsement of Gibbs. But, Meijer has easily led in fundraising, $2.7 million raised this cycle compared to Gibbs' $484,000. Meijer and allies argued that Gibbs would be a terrible GOP nominee who would put the seat at risk, due to his extreme stances on abortion and the 2020 election, particularly since\u00a0 redistricting has pushed the district west, making it slightly more Democratic. Hillary Scholten, an attorney who lost to Meijer by 6 points in 2020, is running unopposed in the primary this year.\u00a0 Outside involvement from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee suggests Meijer is right, and Democrats agree with him that Gibbs is the weaker candidate. The DCCC, in a similar trend to other Democratic groups advertising in GOP primaries, spent at least $410,000 on an ad calling Gibbs \"too conservative\" for the district at the same time it touts his policies likely to be popular with Republican primary voters.\u00a0 The approach has been panned already by a notable number of House Democrats and Meijer, who called Democrats hypocritical in an op-ed Monday and noted that the DCCC's buy is more than what Gibbs has raised throughout the campaign.\u00a0 Meijer has received some outside help on his end too: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy donated $10,000 to Meijer's campaign through an affiliated PAC.\u00a0 In Washington, Newhouse and Herrera-Beutler are navigating the state's primary system, where the top two vote getters, regardless of party affiliation, move on to the general election in November.\u00a0 Both are facing Trump-backed challengers and face a risk of being shut out due to Trump-backed challengers. For Newhouse, he has to beat 2020 gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp. Herrera-Beutler has three Trump-like challengers, with former U.S. Army Green Beret Joe Kent as Trump's pick.\u00a0 \"Others are trying to say they have my endorsement and they absolutely don't. I don't even know them,\" Trump said in a telerally for Kent.\u00a0 Multiple candidates could split the Trump base, which could\u00a0 help Herrera-Beutler in the 3rd District, where the Democratic candidate has earned enough of the vote to make it to the November election in the last five primaries.\u00a0 Michigan's 11th District's Democratic primary: Two Democratic incumbents are in a primary for this seat northwest of Detroit in Oakland County. Rep. Haley Stevens has the familiarity edge over Rep. Andy Levin, since close to half of her old district remains the same under the new lines. Stevens has also been supported on the airwaves by pro-Israel PACs with ties to Republicans, a frequent complaint this Democratic primary cycle by more progressive candidates and organizations.\u00a0 Arizona's 2nd District Republican primary: The open GOP primary has a continuum of election deniers making their case for the seat: On one end, Ron Watkins, a Qanon conspiracy theorist and the developer behind 8kun, argued during a recent debate that Congress should have decertified the results and must investigate the 2020 election. On the other small business owner Andy Yates said he doesn't believe the 2020 election was stolen and wants to \"move on\" from the two-year-old contest. Between them, Arizona state Rep. Walt Blackman believes the results to have been stolen, yet rejects the idea that election results may be decertified . Any one of the three could move on to face incumbent Democratic Rep. Tom O'Halleran.\u00a0 Washington's 8th District: Democrat Rep. Kim Schrier's seat is a top target for House Republicans. But the party still has to pick their nominee in November: either councilman Reagan Dunn, 2020 GOP nominee Jesse Jensen or former George W. Bush aide Matt Larkin.\u00a0 Kansas' 3rd District: Republican-led redistricting in Kansas has made Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids' more vulnerable to flip in November. 2020 nominee Amanda Adkins will first have to get past veteran John McCaughrean. On the primary ballot in Kansas is a vote on restricting abortion access, which Adkins has backed.\u00a0 Sarah Ewall-Wice contributed to this article. Editor's note: An earlier version of this report said that Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson had sent absentee ballots to every voter in the state. In 2020, Benson sent all registered voters an absentee ballot application. This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Four states are holding primary elections on Tuesday: Nevada, South Carolina, Maine and North Dakota. From GOP primaries in battleground states to another test for a House Republican incumbent who voted for impeachment, here's a preview of the races to watch.\u00a0 South Texas also has a special election for a congressional seat \u2013 but only to fill the seat until January 2023.\u00a0 Nevada's Senate and gubernatorial GOP primaries on Tuesday will showcase Trump-endorsed candidates, political newcomers, and former statewide office holders looking to challenge Democratic incumbents in November's general election.\u00a0 The Senate race in November is shaping up to be one of the costliest campaigns in the country and could determine the balance in an evenly divided Senate.\u00a0 Incumbent\u00a0 Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat, isn't facing a competitive challenger on Tuesday, but she has raised nearly $20 million in the last year and goes into primary day with more than $9 million cash on hand.\u00a0 Republican Adam Laxalt, who succeeded Cortez Masto as the state's attorney general from 2015 to 2019, has been leading in the polls among GOP challengers vying to be the Republican nominee for Senate. Laxalt ran a failed gubernatorial campaign in 2018, but he has the backing of former President Donald Trump. Laxalt has raised nearly $6 million and has more than $2 million cash on hand. He also has the support of national GOP figures like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. In the final days before the primary, Laxalt campaigned with Donald Trump Jr., Trump ally Richard Grenell and former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker.\u00a0 Laxalt served as Trump's Nevada campaign co-chair in 2020. After the 2020 election, he falsely claimed thousands of illegal ballots had been cast in the state. He provided no proof, and a subsequent investigation from the secretary of state's office found no evidence of widespread voter fraud. But Laxalt has continued to campaign on the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.\u00a0 His popularity with Trump supporters has also helped him maintain a lead in the polls. A recent poll from the Nevada Independent showed Laxalt leading political newcomer Sam Brown by 14 points. However, Brown, a retired Army captain, has been closing the gap after trailing Laxalt by nearly 40 points in March and 23 points in early May.\u00a0 Sources familiar with Brown's campaign say the race is closer than it may appear. \"Our own internal tracking shows it to be a dead heat,\" a senior adviser to Brown's campaign said. \"I think we're looking at another situation where the polls aren't necessarily reflective of the sentiment on the ground.\" The senior adviser suggested the campaign's heavy advertising spending is now paying off and could help close the gap on primary day.\u00a0 Brown has spent the majority of the $4 million he has raised during his campaign on advertising to raise his name ID. Most of the money has come from over 40,000 individual donors, but he only has a little over $350,000 cash on hand. While Brown has closed the gap in the polls, defeating Laxalt on Tuesday night would be considered a huge upset.\u00a0 While the Nevada GOP Senate primary is essentially a two-man race, the gubernatorial primary features a historically crowded field of more than a dozen candidates vying to take out incumbent Democrat Gov. Steve Sisolak.\u00a0 Only the top five polling candidates qualified for the May 25 primary debate, where the frontrunner, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo declared that \"for all practical purposes, this primary is over.\" Lombardo leads former U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, boxer and lawyer Joey Gilbert, and North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee in the polls. Lee is a former Democrat turned Republican. Lombardo has Trump's endorsement and on primary day, he'll have the most cash on hand. Lombardo is also longtime friends with Gov. Steve Sisolak. He donated to Sisolak's campaign in 2018 and sat on the transition committee.\u00a0 Lombardo's candidacy gives some longtime Republican operatives in Nevada hope that the GOP can take back the governor's seat after Sisolak became the first Democrat to win in more than 20 years. Lombardo's high name ID, experience winning a statewide campaign, and ties to Clark County could help him take down Sisolak.\u00a0 \"If a Republican wins Clark County, it would be a blowout,\" a Republican operative in Nevada said. Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, accounts for nearly 70% of the state's population.\u00a0 Additionally, Democrats have run up the margins in Clark County so high in recent elections that Republicans have almost no shot at winning the state's biggest county. \"If you can lose it by less than 10 points, you're probably going to win statewide and that's kind of the goal,\" the GOP operative explained.\u00a0 Recent polls show Lombardo has a commanding lead with 35% support over Gilbert's 15%. More than 100,000 Nevadans have already voted, taking advantage of the early voting period that ran between May 28 and June 10. \u00a0 According to data from the Nevada secretary of state's office, more than 71,000 chose to vote by mail in the first week of early voting while 40,000 voted in person. Not surprisingly, Republican voters chose to vote in person at a higher rate than Democrats. According to the state's data, during the first week of early voting, 57% of Republicans voted in person, compared to 34% of Democrats.\u00a0 Nevada Republican Secretary of State Barbara Cegavske, who has been criticized by Trump supporters for not overturning the 2020 election results, is term-limited. She was censured by the Nevada GOP in April 2021 for, as she put it, refusing to \"put my thumb on the scale of democracy.\" There is a crowded Republican primary to be the party's nominee in November, including some candidates who have spread false claims or raised questions about the 2020 election. There has been no credible evidence of widespread fraud that could have changed Nevada's results.\u00a0 \"While the NVGOP raises policy concerns about the integrity of mail-in voting, automatic voter registration, and same-day voter registration, these concerns do not amount to evidentiary support for the contention that the 2020 general election was plagued by widespread voter fraud,\" Cegavske said in a letter to the Nevada GOP in April 2021, in response to allegations of fraud. Former state lawmaker Jim Marchant, one of the Republicans running in the primary, told The Wall Street Journal last year that he didn't know whether President Biden won the state in 2020 and \"would not have certified\" the election.\u00a0 Marchant also told The Guardian that he would be open to sending an alternate slate of electors to Congress in 2024. He also falsely claimed that the 2020 election was \"stolen\" from him and Trump. Marchant lost to Rep. Steven Horsford and unsuccessfully challenged the results.\u00a0 Marchant and former Clark County District Court Judge Richard Scotti, another candidate in the race, have said they would push to decertify Dominion voting machines, which are used by nearly all of Nevada's counties. The machines were at the center of some election conspiracies and the company has filed lawsuits against some high-profile figures who spread those claims.\u00a0 Kris Dahir, a Sparks city councilman, has distinguished himself from some of his opponents by not embracing the claims of widespread fraud during the 2020 election. Like other candidates, he supports voter ID laws and wants to add restrictions about who can return absentee ballots for someone.\u00a0 \"I've looked through it all, I don't see the mass fraud they speak of,\" Dahir told the Nevada Independent. \"I do see all the questions and things that should not have been put in place because it causes confusion. But I have not seen mass voter fraud.\"\u00a0 Dahir also told the Nevada Globe that \"Biden is the rightfully elected President.\" Jesse Haw, a former state senator, told the Nevada Independent that the 2020 election \"had a lot of shenanigans and potential fraud\" when asked if he thought the election was legitimate. Gerard Ramalho, a former television news anchor, told the news outlet that \"our trust was stolen\" by a \"single-party-rule Legislature\" during the 2020 election.\u00a0 Republican Socorro Keenan in a debate compared American voting systems to \"third-world country voting\u2026where they know how to cheat.\" She also told the Las Vegas Sun that she doesn't think that the 2020 election in Nevada was free and fair.\u00a0 The winner is expected to face Democratic candidate Cisco Aguilar, an attorney.\u00a0 Democratic Governor Janet Mills is up for reelection and is running unopposed in her primary. She is cruising toward a matchup against former Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who served from 2011-2019 and is also running unopposed.\u00a0 Republican Sen. John Hoeven is running with Trump's endorsement. In April, Hoeven won the North Dakota GOP's endorsement for a third term, defeating state Rep. Rick Becker, who was running to Hoeven's right. Becker said he wouldn't run for the seat without the party's endorsement.\u00a0 Hoeven does have one candidate in the primary, oil worker Riley Kuntz. Hoeven is expected to easily win that race and be reelected in November.\u00a0 Republican Sen. Tim Scott isn't facing a competitive primary and likely won't have a difficult time in the general election, but he's raising money like an endangered incumbent. Scott has raised $39.5 million from individual contributions this cycle, more than any other Republican up for reelection in 2022 and second only to Georgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock's $46.3 million in individual contributions, based on the most recent FEC data. Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly has raised similar amounts of money, but has not had to report his fundraising as recently as Scott or Warnock.\u00a0 It remains to be seen what Scott will do with any money he has leftover from his 2022 race, but he was in Iowa for a fundraiser last week, one of several trips he has made to Iowa and other early primary states.\u00a0 The Democrats competing to challenge Scott are author Catherine Fleming Bruce, veteran Angela Geter and state Rep. Krystle Matthews.\u00a0 Former Democratic Congressman Joe Cunningham and State Sen. Mia McLeod are the top two Democratic candidates for South Carolina governor. Cunningham flipped South Carolina's 1st District from red to blue in 2018, but lost to Republican Nancy Mace in 2020. \u00a0 Cunningham has dialed into his bipartisan credentials during his campaign, pointing to his win in 2018 as proof he can have a fighting chance in a state that Trump won by 12 points. If elected, McLeod would be the first Black woman governor in South Carolina history.\u00a0 Whichever candidate prevails will likely face Republican Gov. Henry McMaster. McMaster was endorsed by Trump in March 2021 and is expected to defeat primary challenger Harrison Musselwhite, whose campaign site notes that his friends call him \"Trucker Bob.\" Republican incumbents Tom Rice and Nancy Mace are both facing Trump-backed challengers on Tuesday. For Rice, the effort to dethrone him has been in place since he voted in January of 2021 to impeach Trump due to the attacks on the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0 After endorsing another candidate in right-wing personality Graham Allen, Trump switched gears and backed State Representative Russell Fry. Allen dropped out of the race and also backed Fry, whose state house district overlaps with the 7th Congressional District. Fry has made Rice's impeachment vote a core part of his campaign. His first TV ad of the campaign compared Rice as a villain for voting to impeach Trump. \"Let's kick another villain out of D.C. and vote for President Trump's choice,\" the ad says.\u00a0 He has also made some of the more staple arguments against an incumbent: that Rice hasn't been responsive to the district and that Rice looked to personally increase his wealth during his time in Congress and the pandemic. Rice has vehemently defended his impeachment vote as the right choice, while also pointing out he did vote with Trump more than 90% of the time during his term. He holds a seat on the influential Ways & Means committee, and was a key player in crafting Trump's signature tax cuts in the House. He is one of the six House Republicans who voted for Trump's impeachment and is still running for re-election. \"I don't know if the President's speech last Wednesday morning amounted to incitement of a riot, but any reasonable person could see the potential for violence,\" Rice wrote in his statement after his impeachment vote.\u00a0 Rice has been backed by former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan, who came to the district to campaign for him in May and told CBS13 Rice would be a \"very influential\" member for the district if Republicans take back the House, given his role on Ways & Means, the tax-writing committee.\u00a0 Trump held a rally in Rice's district in March and said Rice was \"an atrocious RINO\" (Republican in name only) and pointed out that the state Republican party had censured him. Five other Republicans are running in this primary which could hold both Rice and Fry under the 50% mark to avoid a runoff. Internal polls for Rice and Fry both show neither candidate reaches a majority of the vote. Mace, a freshman Republican that flipped her seat from Democratic control in 2020, is facing off against former State Representative Katie Arrington, who was the 2018 GOP nominee for this district that lost to Cunningham. Mace had voted to certify Mr. Biden's win in the 2020 election and to hold Trump-ally Steven Bannon in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with the January 6 select committee. She was also initially outspoken against Trump about the January 6 attacks in the immediate aftermath. \"Nancy fights Republicans all the time and is not at all nice about it.\u00a0 Frankly, she is despised by almost everyone, and who needs that in Congress, or in the Republican Party?\" Trump said in a statement on Sunday. She has the backing of former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, a potential 2024 presidential candidate that appeared in an ad for her. Mace has outraised Arrington nearly 4-to-1 throughout the campaign, bringing in more than $4 million dollars according to the latest campaign finance report.  Arrington's relationship with Trump stems from his 2018 endorsement of her and her work at the Department of Defense during the pandemic. She has gone after Mace for not voting to object to the electoral college results as well as for being too moderate, particularly on issues like legalizing marijuana.\u00a0 Mace and her campaign have highlighted how Arrington lost the historically Republican seat in 2018 against Cunningham. They are also tying her vote as a state representative to raise the gas tax in 2017 to Mr. Biden and the rise in gas prices.\u00a0 During a tele-rally for Arrington, Trump told supporters to give him \"two presents\" for his birthday on Tuesday, June 14.\u00a0 \"Give me a really nice birthday present please. Two birthday presidents,\" he said.\u00a0 A special election in Texas' 34th District to fill Democrat Filemon Vela's seat could give House Republicans a symbolic win ahead of this November. Two Republicans and two Democrats are running in the nonpartisan primary, which would go into a runoff if no candidate clears 50%.\u00a0 Vela resigned in March, so Tuesday's race will be to fill the remainder of his term. The candidates for the general election in November are already set: Republican Mayra Flores and Democratic Congressman Vicente Gonzalez. Flores, the wife of a border patrol agent, has been backed by many national Republicans and has benefitted from outside money flowing into this south Texas district. Over $1 million has been spent by Flores and allies on TV.\u00a0 The House Majority PAC, backed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee began running ads against Flores last week. Dan Sanchez, a lawyer, is the leading Democrat in the race. The district will lean more Democratic in November's elections, when the newly redistricted version of the state map is used. But Flores is hoping the boost to her campaign and the ongoing effort by Republicans to court Latino voters in south Texas, is enough to give Democrats an electoral scare ahead of November.\u00a0 Another House primary to watch is in Nevada, where Democratic incumbent Congresswoman Dina Titus is facing a challenger to the left of her in progressive Amy Vilela. She was backed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont last week. Also in Nevada, national Republican groups have gotten involved to support Congressman Mark Amodei in his primary. Amodei is being challenged by Danny Tarkanian, a Douglas County Commissioner that has had unsuccessful runs for Congress in the past decade. CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "The Department of Homeland Security's announcement of a \"Disinformation Governance Board\" to standardize the treatment of disinformation by the agencies it oversees has been met with an overwhelmingly negative response since it was first unveiled in April.\u00a0 \"It's an awful idea, and you ought to disband it,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, told Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas at a Senate hearing on Wednesday. The new board is intended to standardize the department's efforts to respond to disinformation that could be connected with violent threats to the U.S. So, if an agency under DHS \u2014 like Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or Cybersecurity and Information Security Agency (CISA) \u2014 identifies disinformation under its purview, it's the new disinformation board that would come up with the best practices for any DHS agency handling the disinformation. But DHS has yet to release a charter for the board, and there's still some confusion about the parameters for the group. Officials released a fact sheet, Monday, which promises to \"release comprehensive quarterly reports about the working group's activities to Congress, including its oversight committees.\"\u00a0 \"We don't have definitions of what [the Disinformation Governance Board] is. We don't have boundaries on what it does,\" Senator James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma, complained to Mayorkas at the same hearing. \"Why should we not have suspicions on this?\"\u00a0 Mayorkas conceded that the rollout of the board has been \"suboptimal,\" but he's defending its mission to provide guardrails and write standards to guide DHS' work to address disinformation within agencies it oversees. In addition to FEMA, CBP and CISA, that includes the Science and Technology Directorate (S & T) and the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I & A).\u00a0 Even Democratic lawmakers were skeptical. \"There has been a lot of misinformation about your department's work to combat misinformation,\" said Senator Chris Murphy, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Homeland Security panel, told Mayorkas. The Connecticut lawmaker agreed it's important to protect the homeland from dangerous propaganda, but added, \"You should probably set the record straight about what the goals of your efforts in this area are.\" Here's what we know about DHS' Disinformation Governance Board: The board is tasked with standardizing and streamlining DHS' efforts to respond to disinformation that could be connected with violent threats to the U.S. homeland. Disinformation is defined as \"false information that is deliberately spread with the intent to deceive or mislead.\"\u00a0 Previously, efforts to curb disinformation were carried out independently by agencies and offices operating under DHS' purview.\u00a0 For instance, according to DHS, some of those projects include CISA's accounting of Russian cyber attacks and election interference, CBP's efforts to undermine false narratives peddled by human traffickers operating near the U.S.-Mexico border, DHS' guidance to the U.S. telecom industry to debunk false claims suggesting 5G cell towers spread COVID-19, and FEMA's fraud alerts, warning of criminals who take advantage of disaster survivors in the wake of super storms.\u00a0 \"This is not the truth police,\" Mayorkas declared to the Senate panel, Wednesday, responding to accusations of censorship. \"Our work in addressing disinformation that threatens the security of the homeland has been going on for almost 10 years. I asked the question \u2013 and we asked the question within the [Department of Homeland Security] \u2013 what efforts do we have underway? What policies, procedures and standards of conduct do we have in place to ensure that that vitally important homeland security work\u2026 does not infringe on fundamental rights?\" Mayorkas has repeatedly stated that the board will not censor and will not have \"operational authority.\"\u00a0 A mix of career and political appointees will staff the board, according to a senior DHS official who briefed CBS News and was granted anonymity to speak freely on the department's internal deliberations. While one official from each of the relevant components \u2013 CISA, FEMA, CBP, S & T, and I & A \u2013 will sit on the advisory committee, members of DHS' Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and Privacy Office will also work with the group. It's co-chaired by DHS' Office of Policy and Office of the General Counsel, a highly unusual move intended to safeguard \"privacy, civil rights, civil liberties and free speech,\" according to the official, in adherence with DHS' existing legal authorities. \"There will also be working level groups that will vary depending on the issue at hand,\" the senior DHS official said. \"So to the extent that we're looking at privacy policies across different components, obviously, the Privacy Office will have a much heavier role. And if we're looking at civil rights compliance, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties will have a much heavier role. It'll depend on the specific thing that we're engaged in.\" DHS selected author and disinformation expert Nina Jankowicz to lead the board. The former Fulbright-Clinton Public Policy Fellow previously oversaw programs for Russia and Belarus for the National Democratic Institute and has written two books: \"How to Be a Woman Online: Surviving Abuse and Harassment,\" and \"How to Fight Back; and How to Lose the Information War: Russia, Fake News, and the Future of Conflict.\"\u00a0 Her first book documents the hatred she and other women have experienced from malicious actors and online trolls, as a precursor to violence.\u00a0 \"Every time I am online, I am thinking about whether I am going to tweet or pitch this article, today. Do I have the emotional capacity to deal with what might come?\" she told NPR in an interview in April. \"I now carry a personal safety alarm with me because I am worried about if one of the people who has threatened me online shows up in real life.\" But Jankowicz, 33, is now finding that Republican lawmakers are scrutinizing her previous comments and social media posts for signs of partisanship.\u00a0 They have pointed to her previous assertion that Hunter Biden's laptop should be viewed as a \"Trump campaign product,\" her endorsement of a podcast appearance by Christopher Steele, the author of the so-called Steele Dossier and her take on Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter.\u00a0 \"I shudder to think about, if free speech absolutists were taking over more platforms, what that would be like for the marginalized communities around the world, which are already shouldering so much of this abuse, disproportionate amounts of this abuse,\" Jankowicz told NPR.\u00a0 Jankowicz's comments have sparked concerns of political bias and the policing of online content. \"Why on earth would you nominate someone who is a human geyser of misinformation,\" Missouri Senator Josh Hawley asked Mayorkas Wednesday.\u00a0 \"[Ms. Jancowicz] has an obligation to be non-partisan and neutral in her execution of her responsibilities in her current position in the Department of Homeland Security,\" Mayorkas replied. \"She has an obligation to be that, and if she fails in that obligation, there will be consequences.\" As for social media, DHS' Office of Intelligence Analysis currently conducts open source analysis of social media threats that pose a risk to the homeland. But DHS officials tell CBS News that engagement with social media threats will remain exclusively within I & A. \"The board is not itself playing any role. It is not doing any sort of [social media] monitoring. Nor would the board have any authority that would augment pre-existing work and authorities of any given department.\" DHS has not made any specific congressional funding requests for the new board, according to a DHS senior official. \"It's all authorized and appropriated work. It's just making sure that the work is coordinated across the different components of the department,\" the official told CBS News. But Republican lawmakers are already trying to derail the group's financing. Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee suggested this week in a letter to Mayorkas that the group violates the Anti-deficiency Act, which states that Congress must authorize executive branch spending. And Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton has introduced a bill to \"prohibit the use of federal funds for the Disinformation Governance Board of the Department of Homeland Security.\" While DHS has vowed to \"renew its commitment to transparency and openness with the public and Congress\" when it comes to sharing information about the board, the panel was not created to issue guidance to the public, DHS officials said. Unlike DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis or Office of the Inspector General, the group will not issue routine reports, bulletins or guidance to the American public, but will instead advise the DHS agencies in their disinformation work.\u00a0 \"What this working group seeks to actually do is develop guidelines, standards, and guardrails to ensure that the work that has been ongoing for nearly 10 years does not infringe on people's free speech rights, rights of privacy, civil rights and civil liberties,\" Mayorkas said. \"It was quite disconcerting, frankly, that the disinformation work that was well underway for many years, across different independent administrations was not guided by guardrails.\" DHS officials concede the use of the word \"governance\" may have prompted \"some misperceptions\" about the board's role. \"This board and the department itself is not going around trying to label things as information, misinformation or disinformation,\" a senior DHS official said. \"I think the name has certainly caused some misperceptions,\" the official later added, when probed on whether the group might change its title. \"And so it's, you know, as we try to figure out how to course correct, that is one of the things that's on our mind.\" The first meeting of the board is slated for Friday, May 6. GOP lawmakers, including Hawley, have demanded to see meeting minutes and communications related to the creation of the board.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

President Biden vows swift and severe consequences should Vladimir Putin defy him; plus, dramatic new developments in the January 6 investigation.\u00a0 Tensions in Eastern Europe are at their highest point in years, with Russia's military buildup along Ukraine's borders proceeding, despite U.S.- led diplomatic negotiations.\u00a0 We will get the latest from Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Texas Congressman Michael McCaul will be with us too. He's leading the House Republicans' push for new sanctions to try and halt Russian President Vladimir Putin's aggression.\u00a0 We will talk with the chairman of the congressional committee investigating the January 6 attack, Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson. Late last week, the Supreme Court ordered the release of 700 pages of White House documents detailing President Trump and his allies'; communications leading up to and including the day of the attack.\u00a0 The Omicron wave in the East is subsiding, but the daily death toll from COVID reaches a new high. We will hear from former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Plus, Americans weigh in on the pandemic and the economy, as President Biden kicks off his second year in office.\u00a0 It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin with the tense standoff along the Ukraine border. More than one hundred thousand Russian troops are now poised to potentially invade from the north, east and south of Ukraine. Russian fighter jets and missiles arrived in neighboring Belarus, where war games are set to begin. Meanwhile, NATO naval exercises are taking place south of Crimea in the Mediterranean, and 90 tons of military aid just arrived in Kiev from the United States. President Biden is monitoring the situation from Camp David, and he met with his national security team yesterday. Late Saturday, Britain accused Russia of a plot to install a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine as it considers some form of attack. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is just back from consultations with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and he joins us this morning from the State Department. Good morning. Mr. Secretary, these all look like signs of escalation. SECRETARY OF STATE ANTONY BLINKEN: Well, we've been seeing this throughout Russia's been engaged in an ongoing escalation, and it has to pass before it, that we put before it. There is a path of diplomacy and dialogue, which is clearly the preferable one, the most responsible thing to do. There's also the path of Russian aggression and massive consequences for Russia if it engages in that aggression. And so I tried to make clear both paths in my meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov in Geneva this week, and we'll see if we can advance the diplomacy. But even as we're doing that, we're preparing, building up defenses, building up deterrence if Russia chooses the other path. MARGARET BRENNAN: But if Russia's demands are non-starters, what exactly are you negotiating? Because Russia is creating these facts on the ground, they are setting the terms here, it seems. Are they just using you to buy time or to build a predicate for invasion? SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, that's exactly why, even as we engage in the diplomacy, to explore whether there are ways on a reciprocal basis of building up collective security, answering some of the concerns that Russia may have, Russia answering the many concerns that we have. Even as we're doing that, we are building up defense and deterrence. We have rallied allies and partners across Europe in a very intense way over the last weeks to make very clear that there would be massive consequences for renewed Russian aggression. We provided more military assistance to Ukraine last year than in any previous year. We've been going after agents of Russia in- in Ukraine seeking to destabilize the government. I just approved the- the transfer of U.S. origin military technology in other countries to Ukraine. So we are proceeding on both paths at the same time, we'll be ready either way. The choice is Vladimir Putin's. MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but what are you negotiating if Russia's demands are non-starters? I mean, President Biden has already said Ukraine is not going to join NATO any time soon. You've made this offer of reciprocal military exercises. What's left to talk about? SECRETARY BLINKEN: MARGARET, we started this- this effort of diplomacy and dialogue about 10 days ago, we had meetings between the United States and Russia through the so-called Strategic Stability Dialogue. We had a meeting of the NATO-Russia Council. We had a meeting at the OSCE. And in the course of that, Russia has put some ideas on the table in writing to both the United States and NATO. We've been in very close consultation with allies and partners on what they put forward. We are now sharing our own ideas as well as our own deep concerns. And we'll see if in the mix there, there are things that we can do again on a reciprocal basis that would actually advance collective security in a way that answers some of what we're hearing and Russia answering a lot of what they're hearing from us. And as Russia looks at that and as it considers the massive consequences that would befall it if it pursues aggression, it will have to make a decision. It will have to put those things in the balance and decide what the best path forward is. I know what the most responsible path forward is. Whether President Putin agrees remains to be seen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he hasn't de-escalated it appears to date, despite all of what you just laid out. If you are focused on deterrence, why not do what Ukraine is asking you to do and sanction now, take action now? Why keep it as a punitive matter after the fact? SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, first, we are, as I said, taking action now we built up across these many weeks a very strong coalition of countries that has made it very clear it will take very significant action if Russia commits renewed acts of aggression. You've heard that not just from us, you've heard it from the G7, the leading democratic economies in the world, from the European Union and from NATO\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right and Ukraine is saying you could go harder, you could be stronger. SECRETARY BLINKEN: We provided- we've provided very significant military assistance to Ukraine. We've been taking action against Russian agents in Ukraine. But as to the sanctions, the most important thing we can do is to use them as a deterrent, as a means of dissuading Russia from engaging in further aggression. Once sanctions are triggered, you lose the deterrent effect. So what we're doing is putting together a whole series of actions that would figure into President Putin's calculus. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But I mean, even President Biden said at his press conference this week, he's spent a lot of time trying to get NATO's allies to actually be on the same page when it comes to anything short of invasion. I mean, it seems like Putin's easiest strategy would be to hit on that weakness, that's how you divide NATO's allies. I mean, just yesterday, the head of the German Navy had to resign because of pro-Putin statements. This doesn't look like the alliance is completely together here. SECRETARY BLINKEN: First, we've been very clear that if there is any further Russian aggression in terms of sending Russian forces into Ukraine, there will be a swift, there will be a severe and there will be a united response from the United States and Europe. Second, we've been equally clear that Russia engages in other tactics short of sending forces into- into Ukraine or other countries: hybrid actions, cyberattacks, efforts to bring a government down. And there are too. I'm very confident based on the many consultations I've had with European allies and partners that there will be a swift calibrated and also united response. Look, I sat with Chancellor Schulz in Germany last week, as well as with my German counterpart, my French counterpart, my British counterpart and I am very convinced there will be a united response to whatever Russia does. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the fact that you need Iran- need Russia to help you with the Iran negotiations tying your hands? SECRETARY BLINKEN: Not in the least. And again, it's important to put this in perspective, too, Margaret. This is about more even than Ukraine and Russia, more even than Europe, Russia, the United States, Russia. It really is and should be a global concern because there are some basic principles of international relations at stake that have helped keep the peace and security\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right\u2013 SECRETARY BLINKEN: in Europe for- for the last of the last decades. And the- and it goes to very basic principles one nation can't change the\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly but Vladimir Putin\u2013 Vladimir Putin obviously has no regard for those principles and hasn't, I mean, in the past eight years that he's been invading and taking parts of Ukraine. When you get to that bigger, \"What is this all about?\" question, the State Department said this week they were concerned about the possibility of Russia moving nuclear weapons back into Belarus. I mean, you have high precision equipment being moved towards Ukraine. Is this about something more than just that country? SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, this is exactly why, even as we're engaged in diplomacy, we are very much focused on building up defense. Building up deterrence, both for Ukraine, NATO itself, NATO itself will continue to be reinforced in a significant way if Russia commits renewed acts of aggression. All of that is- is on the table. But again, when it comes to these principles, MARGARET, the principle that one nation can't simply change the borders of another by force, that it can't decide for another country its choices, its decisions\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia already has. SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, that's what we're- that's what we're standing resolutely against. And it hasn't. It's tried to say that NATO's door should be shut on Ukraine. It's not. It remains open. We stand by that principle. MARGARET BRENNAN: How significant is the insider threat to President Zelensky and his government? SECRETARY BLINKEN: This is again, part of the Russian playbook. It's something we are very focused on, and that's why we've been speaking about it. We've raised this publicly in recent weeks. We want to put people on notice and on guard that this is something Russia could do. Just as we talked about the possibility of a so-called false flag operation where Russia creates a provocation inside of Ukraine, use that as justification to take aggressive action. All of those things are part of the playbook. All of those things we're on guard against. All of those things we're talking to allies and partners about to make sure that against any of these scenarios, we are fully prepared. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, does the timing of the Olympics have any effect on Putin's calculus? Russia invaded Georgia during the Olympics back in 2008. Any impact here? SECRETARY BLINKEN: You'd have to ask him. I don't think so. I think that Russia will make its decisions based on President Putin's calculus of what's what's in their interest. We are working very hard to affect that calculus, both in terms of offering a diplomatic path forward that could enhance collective security for all of us and equally a path of defense and deterrence. That makes very clear that if there's aggression, there'll be massive consequences. So the choice is his. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, we'll be watching. Thank you for your time today. And in one minute, we'll take a look at the new developments in the January 6th attack investigation with Congressman Bennie Thompson. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We are back now with the Chairman of the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. Good morning to you, chairman. REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS): Good morning, how are you? MARGARET BRENNAN: Good. This was a very big week, as we said, 700 pages of Trump administration documents were handed over to your committee at the order of the Supreme Court. What changes now that you have these in your possession? REP. THOMPSON: Well, we are in the process of reviewing the documents. As you know, this was one of the first requests that we made as a committee to the National Archives. We think it's important to our investigation to have this information and we are glad that the Supreme Court agreed with us today. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the last piece of the puzzle here? I mean, how does this affect your timeline for holding public hearings? As you said, you want to begin those in the spring. REP. THOMPSON: Well, to be honest, where he will review the documents, we'll see what those documents present to us in terms of direction. We'll see if that information leads us to additional individuals to make requests. But it's so significant to our investigation to have the documents and executive privilege and other things obviously had no bearing, and we're just happy for the Supreme Court decision. We'll look forward to reviewing it and based on the review, we'll take next steps.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And the spring is still the plan for public hearings? REP. THOMPSON: Absolutely. To be honest with you, as you know, we are reviewing thousands of pages of documents, hundreds of witnesses. It's taken a good bit of time for the committee to put together. And hearings at this point, we expect to be sometime in the spring. MARGARET BRENNAN: In recent days, your committee also took aim at Rudy Giuliani, the former president's attorney. You subpoenaed him. You asked the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, to appear by Feb 3. You also subpoenaed two white nationalists. This seems like a pretty wide net. What is your strategy? REP. THOMPSON: Well, our strategy is to get to all the facts and circumstances that brought about Jan 6. We identified the players, Rudy Giuliani is clearly one of those individuals, the right-wing individual organizations that participated, providing security and other things very important. And obviously, Ivanka Trump was a major adviser to the president all along, a number of items attributed to what she's been saying and so we asked her to come in voluntarily and give us the benefit of what she knows.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Will she?\u00a0 REP. THOMPSON: Well, we'll wait and see February 3rd, and we'll go after that. MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of Rudy Giuliani, who we just mentioned, you subpoenaed. There was another news development in terms of public reporting. Republican electors in at least five states put together essentially fake slates of the electors. In states that Joe Biden won, they handed over these slates, saying instead that Donald Trump won them. And according to Marc Short, the former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, he was presented with letters by Rudy Giuliani on behalf of state legislators to this- to this end, trying to persuade the former vice president not to certify the election. Do you know who was orchestrating this effort? I mean, this is a pretty significant claim. REP. THOMPSON: Well, we do know that some of the information we've received from National Archives include proposed plans for doing certain things if we are after review of those plans determined specifically individuals who did this. We will make the referral to the Justice Department. We're not a criminal entity, that's the Department of Justice, but we are concerned that documents have been filed saying they were individuals responsible for conducting and certifying elections, and they are not. And when you falsify documents, in most instances, that's a criminal act.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: There was also another story, significant. POLITICO published the text of a draft executive order that had been presented to President Trump in Dec of 2020 to have the defense secretary seize voting machines in battleground states. And multiple news organizations have now reported this. Do you intend to go to the Attorney General, Bill Barr, to ask him about this? I mean, how do you follow up on- on this kind of allegation and the paperwork to back it up? REP. THOMPSON: Well, yes, we do. To be honest with you, we've had conversations with the former attorney general already. We have talked to Department of Defense individuals. We are concerned that our military was part of this big lie on promoting that the election was false. So, if you are using the military to potentially seize voting machines, even though it's a discussion, the public needs to know, we've never had that before. And so any of these individuals who are participating and trying to stop the election, the duly election of a president, and if we can document it, we will share it with the public. MARGARET BRENNAN: I just want to follow up on something you said. Do you have proof that there was someone inside the United States military working on this premise? Of actually seizing voting machines. REP. THOMPSON: Well, we have information that between the Department of Justice, a plan was put forward to potentially seize voting machines in the country and utilize Department of Defense assets to make that happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Something beyond this draft executive order, there was actually an operational plan? REP. THOMPSON: Well, no, not an operational plan, but just the draft itself is- MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REP. THOMPSON: \u2013Is reason enough to believe that it was being proposed. Our job is to get to the facts and circumstances of how far did they go? We do know that a potential person was identified to become the attorney general of the United States, who would communicate with certain states that election on their situation had been fraudulent and not to produce certified documents. Well, we understand that. So, we will move forward on that investigation, and we will look and see specifically how far that plan went. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's incredible. Will the former attorney general, Bill Barr, testify to you? Will you seek out other members of the military to clarify some of what you just laid out here? REP. THOMPSON: Well, part of our plan is to continue to engage all those individuals that we deem necessary and important to our investigation. Some will talk to some we will do in deposition under oath. Others we will offer hearing opportunities. But I can assure you, as we develop this information, we will clearly present it to the public. We plan at this point to have a series of public hearings showing the use of federal assets, Department of Justice, Department of Defense and other agencies to actually stop the duly election of a president. So, we'll do it in-in due time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, Stewart Rhodes, the head of the far-right group the Oath Keepers, was charged with seditious conspiracy by the Department of Justice this week. As part of that, it became public that he was apparently stashing weapons waiting for the White House to invoke the Insurrection Act. Is any part of that connected to what you just laid out? REP. THOMPSON: Well, Stewart Rhodes is one of the persons that we identify as a committee we wanted to talk to. We'll see what happens. We're not part of the criminal indictment. That's a separate investigation. MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand. Chairman, thank you for your time this morning. And next up, we'll have more on the situation in Ukraine and what can be done to stop Russia. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House, Congressman Michael McCaul of Texas. Good morning to you. REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX): Good morning. Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lots to decipher with you. But first, I want to start on what we just heard from the chairman. Has that seemed fairly extraordinary what he just laid out? He says that there is reason to believe, and the committee has possession of documents about this plot, essentially to seize voting machines that involve members of the military that they have already been in touch with the former attorney general. What is your reaction to this? REP. MCCAUL: Well, you know my reaction, it was a dark day, Jan.6, I want the truth to come out. I think this committee has been somewhat politicized. But the truth should come out, and I think the Department of Justice has been conducting an investigation. I worked at the DOJ for almost 15 years, and I trust their trust investigation- I in fact called upon them to investigate this, so I'm hopeful that the truth will come out on this. The allegations are very serious. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I do know that you are endorsed by the former President Trump. So, this has to be a little uncomfortable to hear these kinds of allegations. REP. MCCAUL: I've- of course, I mean, when the executive- commander in chief and these are allegations, I don't think the executive order was ever followed through with\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Right, It was a draft, but it was discussed in the Oval Office. REP. MCCAUL: \u2013 Right. I think it should come out the truth, obviously. I always say it. The truth should come out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will continue to watch the committee on that point on Russia. You heard the secretary say that if he uses the leverage of sanctions now, he gives up an important bit of deterrence. Do you disagree? REP. MCCAUL: I completely disagree. I think this has been a passive deterrence, right? I don't. I don't see Putin changing his course of action. It's getting very aggressive. The noose is tightening around Ukraine. President Zelensky, as you mentioned, said he wants the sanctions now. We can always remove the sanctions if it deters Putin's bad behavior, but if you reward that and there are no consequences, it's going to continue. And I think all along, there are so many things we can be doing to provide deterrence if we don't do this, MARGARET. The plan of action that I've seen in the classified space, as well as very specific, very aggressive, is timetable. If we don't do something strong right now, I'm afraid that he's going to invade Ukraine, which will have, as- as the secretary talked about, he's right and I think you and I did. It will have global ramifications here. MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed the secretary on that, he twice said that the US is going after Russian agents in Ukraine. Is the US doing something now that the rest of us just don't know about? Or is he just talking about sanctions? REP. MCCAUL: Well, we know that the Brits released this intelligence report that the Russians are trying to depose Zelensky and put their own leader. We know that they're right on the border with Belarus, they're going to do joint exercises with precision weapons and aircraft. We know that Kiev is right- Kiev is right there. I think there are three forces one Kiev, one on the Donbass and the other one Black Sea Crimea. This is a buildup we've never seen before. And if with no deterrence, it's going to happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's take a break and continue to talk about this on the other side of it. So, congressman, please stay here. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION, we continue our conversation now with Congressman Michael McCaul, the lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Let's pick back up on the issue of Russia. We're talking about immediate action, potentially. Congress is going away for a week. There are bills before the Senate. I know you're working on one in the House. I mean, do you have that kind of time to play with legislation or do you need something in terms of a tool set to hand the president more quickly? REP. MCCAUL: Well, time is of the essence. I'm working on a bill I've introduced to get- we're getting key Democrats on board. It would be a-a-a assistance package of lethal aid to Ukraine. That's important. But what's also important is the message of deterrence. We need joint exercises in Poland, the Baltic states, Romania, Bulgaria to show Putin that we're serious. Right now. He doesn't see we're serious and that's why the buildup is taking place. I think this all started, MARGARET, with Afghanistan and the unconditional surrender to the Taliban when he saw weakness, weakness invites aggression. We saw that with Chamberlain and Hitler. You know, Reagan talked about peace through strength. And right now, whether- and-and the thing is, this is not just about Ukraine. It's about China. It's about President Xi and Taiwan. It's about the Ayatollah and the bomb. It's about North Korea that just fired off two missiles, they said, were, you know, these, you know, these hypersonic weapons. I think this has broader global ramifications. We're seen as weak right now be-because of President Biden, his-his comments about a limited- a limited invasion was somehow acceptable, and that NATO was divided. I think one thing he said was true is that NATO is divided, and that's- Putin's goal is to divide and weaken NATO. He's accomplished some of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as you know, I mean, this has been going on since 2014 and during the Trump administration, there was some accommodation, at least in language from the former president on- on whether or not there were hard lines. So, Vladimir Putin has been getting kind of a mixed message for some time here. How do you change that when President Biden and you just heard Sec. Blinken send that message that they're willing to have reciprocal restrictions on military exercises or on placement of missiles? Is that kind of accommodation weakness to you? REP. MCCAUL: Well, you know, like let's talk about Nord Stream 2, biggest concession ever. You know\u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the potential gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. REP. MCCAUL: It's, you know, Putin's pipeline into Europe. Congress passed bipartisan mandatory sanctions to stop that from happening. We have a presidential waiver, that's very normal. We never dreamed that the President of the United States would waive that in the national interest of the United States. How is that in the interest of the United States to allow Putin to dominate Europe's energy supply? and then at the same time, shutting down Keystone and not allowing the United States to be the leader in energy. LNG, which is cleaner than Putin's dirty energy from getting into the region. I think this president has made so many concessions with nothing in return. That's why Putin smells weakness. He's wanted this, as you and I talked about for a long time. It's his legacy issue. And if we don't provide that deterrence, he will go in. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the Germans have sort of been uncomfortable with the idea of moving on Nord Stream and the administration is saying they're just- they are waiting on that. On the other risk here, we have midterm races coming up. In 2018, the United States took offensive action against Russia to stop them from meddling in those races. Do we need to see something like that in 2022? REP. MCCAUL: You know, I don't want to see Russia overturning Ukraine's government. You know, I don't want to see any foreign nation adversary getting involved in our elections. But again, pointing from Afghanistan forward, we have sent a message to our adversaries that we are projecting weakness, not strength. One thing Reagan talked to us- peace through strength, going back to Chamberlain and Hitler. If we're projecting weakness, it only invites aggression. Historically, you know that. And this is exactly- I mean, I talked to the administration. I want to stop this from happening, but I'm very concerned about the aggression I'm seeing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you very much for your perspective. You're right back with Dr. Scott Gottlieb. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the COVID pandemic, now entering its third year. Dr. Scott Gottlieb is a former FDA commissioner and sits on the board of Pfizer. Good morning to you doctor. The CDC says case numbers are coming down. You said we'd be back in person in the office in February. Do you stick by that timeline? DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I think that's timeline still intact, you're seeing a lot of businesses make decisions to do, return to work March 1st because I think they want to give themselves a cushion, especially having been surprised before. You're seeing cases come down very rapidly in the East Coast, the states that were the early outbreak states Florida, the mid-Atlantic, New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles. This virus is spreading to the Midwest. You're seeing cases pick up in states like Montana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Wyoming, Idaho, so it's not done yet. Across the United States, there's still states that are probably in the thick of this. They have another week, maybe two weeks to go until they peak and start to come down. But in places like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Washington, D.C., you're seeing cases decline very rapidly. And I think that thesis around a February return is intact. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nearly a million children were infected with COVID in the last week, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. A million. Is it too soon for mask mandates to be lifted in schools, as the governor of Virginia just ordered? DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, I think it is too soon to do that because a lot of schools have built their preparations around the use of masks and whatever we want to say about the benefit that masks are providing, it's providing some benefit. And a lot of schools that couldn't implement social distancing couldn't implement testing of relying on masks as their only tool. So, to withdraw it right at the peak of the epidemic. I think it's imprudent we should wait. I think within two weeks we'll be able make that decision. But this whole COVID epidemic, I think, has been colored by the fact that policymakers have not prescribed clear endpoints to when they are going to withdraw these measures. I think parents are willing to tolerate masks in schools, recognizing it's very disruptive to children if there is an end date to it, if it's clearly prescribed, when we're going to use these masks and when we're going to withdraw them, so they don't disrupt two years of a child's socialization and school activities. So, I think policymakers stepping in and saying, look, we're going to put an end point on this when prevalence declines to a certain level and in sticking to it is very prudent. But to do it in a setting of the peak of this epidemic, I think puts a difficulty on schools that have based their mitigation around the use of masks. MARGARET BRENNAN: What's that benchmark in your mind? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, the benchmark we prescribed last summer was around 10 cases per 100,000 people per day when we withdraw all mitigation. I think you can lean in and prescribe a higher benchmark when it comes to children in schools because the first thing that we should do is try to withdraw these measures in the school setting. If you're going to implement masks among adults in congregate settings in a township, you want to lean in and try to withdraw it in the schools first and try to preserve as much of that environment for learning as you can. MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Fauci raised a lot of hopes this week for parents of young children like me, whose kids aren't yet eligible for vaccines. He said for children under five, you may see a vaccine available in the next month or so you've been saying sometime between April and June. Which is it? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, I think a month is probably premature to remember the reason why this was extended was because the vaccines in the clinical trial that Pfizer did \u2013 I'm on the board of Pfizer as you know. Pfizer tested a low dose in the children. They tested a number of different doses and chose the lowest possible dose because at a lower dose, you're going to have less reactogenicity, less vaccine related side effects like fevers at injection site reaction. You want to make sure the vaccine is very tolerable in young kids, but probably because of that low dose, we saw less vaccine effectiveness. There were more infections in the children who were vaccinated than what we saw in a comparable group of 16 to 25 year olds. So, the decision was made by regulators working with Pfizer to extend that trial to look at a third dose to see if that third dose restored the efficacy in the setting of Omicron, where the vaccines are providing some protection against infection about 50 percent a year. You're 50 percent less likely to get infected with Omicron if you're fully vaccinated with a booster. The primary utility of the vaccines, nonetheless, is the protection against severe disease hospitalization. And in that regard, getting any vaccine into young kids probably is going to afford them a measure of protection by getting baseline immunity to them. So, any reconsideration of the vaccine timeline right now by regulators is probably based on that. But I think even if the FDA were to reconsider the approval of the vaccine, you're looking at a timeline when this would get pushed at best, perhaps to into late March, because you'd have to re-adjudicate the data having to add comp to get the vaccine out into the supply chain. By the time that happens, I think you're looking at a March date, maybe late March. So I don't think this is something that's going to happen in the next month. Right now, Pfizer and the FDA looking very closely at the data that's accrued to see if they can make a decision around this. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll still have to wait know doctor, because this is so highly transmissible. This Omicron variant, there are a lot of people who are coming back from infection. How vulnerable or protected are they? Because I'm getting the sense that people think they're bulletproof. DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, what we've seen from the data is that if you get infected with any one of these variants, you probably have a period of immunity that's quite robust. We don't know how long it is, but you have a period of immunity that's quite robust and you probably have as good, if not better immunity against that subsequent variant as if you were just vaccinated and never infected. So, people who are infected with Delta probably have a pretty robust immunity against Delta, and perhaps it's as good, if not better than if they were just vaccinated, never infected with Delta. But what we notice is the vaccines provide the broadest possible immunity, so people with Omicron might have good protection against Omicron. They probably don't have as good protection against Delta.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, which is why these mutations in these new variants are something to watch. Thank you very much, doctor. Coming up next, a closer look at what some Americans are thinking about COVID and the economy. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: During the course of the pandemic, we've been listening to Americans through Zoom to get their thoughts on COVID, the economy, and how the government is handling it all. On Friday, we checked back in with six of them. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARGARET BRENNAN: Who feels like we are in a better place now than we were a year ago? Show of hands. No one believes we're in a better spot now? BETH, 202 TRUMP VOTER (INDEPENDENT): Unfortunately, I don't think that our public servants are actually -- they're kind of on a lag with the science. I was not vaxxed. Had COVID. I didn't even know I had it. I had the sniffles for two days and body aches. And if I hadn't lost my sense of smell, I wouldn't have known the difference. It's clearly not as horrible as perhaps it was described. For some it has been, and I'm very sorry for that. But for a lot of us who do take care of ourselves and everything and are younger, we need to go on and live our lives. And public science has not caught up with that yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: How many people know someone who has died from COVID or been hospitalized with COVID? So, Mildred, you raised your hand there. Do you have a different perspective when you hear the descriptions of saying it -- it's not that bad?\u00a0 MILDRED, 2020 BIDEN VOTER: I can't really say that it's not that bad. I think it is bad. I think this whole country is suffering from COVID fatigue at this point.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-huh. MILDRED: It has become confusing and depressing. I'm an elderly person myself, and, um, a cancer survivor, and that's one of the reasons why I went ahead and took the vaccine and the booster. MARGARET BRENNAN: You originally told us, a year or so ago, that you -- you didn't want to be a guinea pig. You had concern about taking the vaccine. What changed your mind? MILDRED: Um, a lot of my friends who had gone ahead and taken the vaccine, and I saw where they had done well. And I want to be around. You know, there's never any guarantee, but I want to be around to see my grandkids. MARGARET BRENNAN: So why don't you think, now that you have that tool in your disposal, why don't you think we're in a better place? MILDRED: Well, I don't know if we are in a better place as a country. We're still very divided on this whole COVID thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead, Jill.\u00a0 JILL, 2020 BIDEN VOTER: I was of the opinion that when people got vaccinated, they would let their guard down. They would go out and congregate. And I'm a football fan. And it makes me skin crawl when I watch the games and I see so many people together, because that's exactly what it did. They got vaccinated, they thought, we're fine, we can go out and do all the things we'd normally do. And that's the dangerous part. Now, I am vaccinated, but I wouldn't dream of not wearing a mask. The things that I see going on in America, it makes my skin crawl because people think we're out of the woods, and we're not.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you hear President Biden say this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, Jill, do you feel like he's talking about you? JILL: Not at all. Not at all. Because I work with someone who's vaccinated and has had the booster, and they've had COVID three times. So, I'm not buying that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Jorge, you -- you are nodding your head in full agreement with Jill?\u00a0 JORGE, 2020 TRUMP VOTER: Oh, a hundred percent. And I think that's part of the problem that we've had is the misinformation. Actually, studies have already shown that cloth masks are not effective at all. (INAUDIBLE) not -- not at all\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's right, the quality of your mask -- the quality of your mask matters a lot. JORGE: The quality of the mask. And they didn't say that at first. They said, oh, just wear a mask and you'll be fine. So I think when -- when you're leader is saying one thing and -- and -- and then it's not true, that begins -- you begin to question that. People that don't want to get vaccinated have their own reasons, and I don't think it has anything to do with President Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, to your point, former President Trump has gotten vaccinated and boosted, he says. So, he has now endorsed it. But, Chelsea, jump in here. How are you feeling? Are you feeling more confident these days?\u00a0 CHELSEA, 2020 BIDEN VOTER: No, not really. I'm still worried about getting sick. You know, I'm fully vaxxed. I got my booster. I wear my mask. But I agree, like, the messaging has been really confusing. And I don't blame people at all who haven't gotten vaccinated because the story was the pandemic will be over. But the truth of the matter is, people do still get sick even though they're vaccinated. So, I think that things are just as bad as they were when the pandemic started. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Jorge, walking into the classroom you were concerned as a teacher about getting exposed. I mean, do you feel like the safety guidelines for classrooms are clearly communicated JORGE: In Texas we are. We don't wear masks. We don't -- you don't have to get a vaccine. You can get a vaccine if you want. It's -- you take care of yourself. And that's how it should be. You have got to have your own personal convictions, and you follow them. If you choose not to get vaccinated, then you're choosing to live with those consequences.\u00a0 JILL: The things that I've done thus far, it's protected me, and I've not gotten sick. And if I do, that's something I have to live with. But just, right now, I just feel like I have a choice, and my choice is just to not do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: We are a year into unified Democratic control of the House, of the Senate, of the executive branch. Do you feel any differently? Do you feel that Washington understands what all of you are experiencing out there? Beth is shaking her head no. I mean so many of you are. But have you always felt that way, or is there a new level of sort of skepticism about Washington?\u00a0 BETH: Yes, I think so. I -- I really had such high hopes for this administration when they came in. And it's just been one disaster after another. Afghanistan, inflation, take your pick, I just don't understand. I thought this was going to be a president for the people, of the people, and I just feel like it's one, you know, hurtle after another that we all have to climb. MARGARET BRENNAN: Chelsea, I saw you raise your hand. CHELSEA: I do agree that fundamentally for me nothing has changed. I think that I am more skeptical now. My life has not improved. COVID has not improved. Biden has not, you know, stuck to any of his promises. I don't think anyone in Washington is really for working people. And that has been so clear this year.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That point on working people, there has been at least $2 trillion pumped into the economy. There have been childcare tax credits. When President Biden took office, he sent out those $1,400 checks. There's been all this money pumped in with the intention of helping working people. Are you saying it just hasn't made a difference in your life? CHELSEA: Certainly not in my life, personally. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sandy, do you feel that way? I mean I'm looking at a $300 tax credit per month for each child. The $1,400 checks that President Biden handed out. I'm looking at all these lists of things that were pumped out there with the intention of helping everyday people. Do you agree with Chelsea that it just hasn't made a difference in your life? SANDY, 2020 TRUMP VOTER: It really hasn't made a difference at all, at least in my life. Sure, it may have helped some people temporarily, but ultimately what everything costs, with all this money pumped into the economy, it caused inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, economists would tell you a lot of that has to do with just the shocks from the pandemic. If you got a shot, if you went out and got the vaccine because it would help the economy, you know, is that an effective selling point for you, versus telling you you're going to get sick or not? SANDY: It doesn't help the price of bacon right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Can I see a show of hands, do any of you feel like the economy has gotten better in the past year? All of you are saying no. Even though the job picture is brighter? Even though the direction of the economy and recovering is happening? Are you all concerned about rising prices and inflation MILDRED: I go to the grocery store now and I'm paying double the amount that I was paying, you know, even a few months ago. Everything's gone up. My granddaughter loves bacon, by the way, and I can barely afford bacon.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And whose fault do you think that is? I mean it's the Federal Reserve that controls interest rates. It's their job to control inflation. Do you blame the president? Do you blame the central bankers? Or do you blame, what, just Congress? MILDRED: I know the Federal Reserve is talking about -- they're talking about increasing the interest rate, but I think it's a combination. Congress is worthless. I don't -- you don't even want me to start on Congress. MARGARET BRENNAN: I actually do because this is one of the things. In President Biden's first year, one of the things they say they are most proud of is this historic investment in infrastructure, and the fact they got Republicans and Democrats to sign on to it. Even with that, you still say they're worthless? MILDRED: I do, because there's so much more that needs to be done. MARGARET BRENNAN: Like what? What do you need? MILDRED: I need for the price of bacon to go down. How about that? I need for the government to stop spending so much money on things that are worthless, that are not going to --\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Like what?\u00a0 MILDRED: That are not going to benefit the people. I mean they're sending out N-95 masks, you know, to cover people's faces. Somebody is making them, and somebody's making money off of that. You know, I -- you know, that -- to me that's crazy. They're also sending out COVID tests. MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-huh. MILDRED: For people to do COVID testing at home. Waste of money. MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration would say these are the things that will help keep the economy going because then you won't have to stay home if you don't catch COVID. BETH: It takes 12 days to get the test in the mail, another 12 days to get your results. That's 24 days.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these at-home tests are supposed to be quick, just a few minutes. JORGE: Here's what's wrong with our administration. They -- like she was saying, here you are sending all of these tests, sending the masks. So, I'm going to pump more money into this economy. I'm going to keep spending more money. And it's going to fix everything. No, inflation is going to hit 8 percent, 9 percent. We're going to be back to Jimmy Carter. And we know what happened to Jimmy Carter. You can't keep doing that. I almost feel like the administration came in and said, you know what, we're going to do everything opposite of what Trump did.

            "article_content": "Centrist Rep. Henry Cuellar has won the Democratic nomination for Texas' 28th District, after a recount requested by challenger Jessica Cisneros determined Cuellar prevailed by 289 votes. His original lead had been tabulated at 281 votes, but during the recount he picked up more votes in Jim Hogg and Starr County, the more rural and Cuellar-friendly parts of the sprawling southern Texas district. The win is Cuellar's narrowest victory over Cisneros, who unsuccessfully challenged Cuellar for his seat in the 2020 primary as well. Cuellar's victory came amid several controversies, including an FBI investigation that led to raids of Cuellar's Laredo, Texas, home and campaign office. Cuellar's attorney has said the congressman is not the target of the FBI investigations. The FBI has neither confirmed or denied Cuellar's involvement to CBS News.\u00a0   Cuellar's stance on abortion also became a clear point of contrast between him and Cisneros after a draft opinion from U.S. Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v. Wade was leaked.\u00a0 In a statement Tuesday, Cuellar said he was always confident his election night lead would hold and that he will work to reach out to the more progressive voters in his district, which recently was redrawn to include more of San Antonio. \"While we may differ on certain positions, we share a common ground on many issues to improve our communities and strengthen families. It is now time to come together and win the General Election in November,\" he said. \"I am an American, Texan then a Democrat \u2014 in that order \u2014  and I will continue to fight for Texas values and not let coastal elites bring their failed agenda to our communities,\" he added.\u00a0 Cisneros conceded shortly after the official recount results were released. In a statement, she said she was \"up against a corrupt political machine,\" and pointed to spending by outside groups such as the United Democracy Project, a group affiliated with the pro-Israel American Israel Public Affairs Committee, which spent at\u00a0least $1.8 million\u00a0in independent expenditures in the race. \"With this close of a margin, it's clear that without their aggressive interference in the lives of South Texas families, we would have won,\" Cisneros said in her statement. \"We're going to keep fighting to create a more progressive and accountable Democratic Party this year and work to turn Texas blue in November.\" Progressive groups backing Cisneros such as Justice Democrats also criticized the outside spending, as well as the House Democratic leadership's support for Cuellar, who received endorsements from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Jim Clyburn, both of whom appeared at a campaign event with Cuellar in the closing weeks of the contest. \"The party establishment would rather protect one of their own than deliver results for Democratic voters and South Texas families,\" said Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas. \"They would rather discourage more young, working-class women of color like Jessica from running for office. It's disgraceful and I am deeply worried about November.\" Cuellar will now face Republican nominee Cassy Garcia in the November general election, as Republicans turn their eye towards unseating the longtime border district incumbent. Republicans are optimistic about their chances, pointing to Republican Mayra Flores' special election win in Texas' nearby 34th District earlier in June.\u00a0 The House GOP-backed Congressional Leadership Fund has reserved at least $3.5 million in advertising for the district in the fall. The National Republican Congressional Committee has also reserved a similar amount in T.V. ads that would air in the 28th District, as well as the neighboring 15th District.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

And this week on Face the Nation: America remembers the lives lost 21 years ago in the attacks of 9/11, as one of our oldest allies mourns their own loss and enters an uncertain age. On this somber morning, Americans pay tribute to the nearly 3,000 lives lost on that tragic September day. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): What was destroyed, we have repaired. What was threatened, we have fortified. What was attacked, the indomitable spirit has never, ever wavered. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: What is the state now of America's national security? We will hear from Frank McKenzie, the recently retired four-star Marine general who oversaw the U.S. departure from Afghanistan as head of U.S. Central Command. And we will talk with the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Virginia Democrat Mark Warner, about the current threats to the homeland and the escalating legal fight between the Justice Department and former President Trump over his handling of classified documents. (Begin VT) MAN: Three cheers for His Majesty the King. Hip hip! MEN: Hooray! (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom ushers in the reign of King Charles III, while it grieves the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, a towering figure who held the throne for generations. We will get the latest on the historic transition from CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell, who is in London. And we will hear from the British ambassador to the U.S., Dame Karen Pierce, about what's next for the special relationship between our two countries. And a stunning advance this weekend by Ukrainian forces, as they reclaim more territory from Russian troops. Ukraine's Ambassador to the United States Oksana Markarova will join us for an update. Finally, a growing outcry over a crisis at home. How is it possible that the capital city of a U.S. state in the richest country in the world doesn't have clean running water? We will get an update from the mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, Chokwe Lumumba, on his city's struggles. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Twenty-one years ago today, Americans united in their grief and in their opposition to extremist forces who attacked the country on September 11. It is a somber Sunday morning here in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom. We are witnessing a solemn tribute there, with crowds lining the streets to pay their respects to Queen Elizabeth II, as her coffin makes its way from Balmoral Castle, where she passed away on Thursday, to her official home in Edinburgh, Scotland. We will have a report from London on an extraordinary period of change in the United Kingdom in just a moment, but we want to begin here in the U.S. From Ground Zero in New York to Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and here at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, Americans remember the nearly 3,000 lives lost on this day 21 years ago. As has become tradition, moments of silence marked each of the devastations of that morning in 2001. Two planes crashed into the World Trade Center towers. The towers collapsed shortly thereafter, a third plane crashing into the Pentagon, and a fourth brought down in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. In a sobering and now familiar ritual, the names of the fallen were read aloud. President Biden laid a wreath at the Pentagon and made remarks a short time ago. (Begin VT) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Our intelligence, defense and counterterrorism professionals in the building behind me and across the government continue their vigilance against terrorist threats that has evolved and spread to new regions of the world. We will continue to monitor and disrupt those terrorist activities wherever we find them, wherever they exist. And we will never hesitate to do what's necessary to defend the American people. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: For a closer look now at the evolving threats to the homeland, we begin this morning with the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, 9/11 introduced to many Americans for the very first time this sense of vulnerability at home, and it launched the global war on terror. I wonder how vulnerable you think America is now. Are we paying enough attention to the Middle East and to Afghanistan? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, Margaret, I remember, as most Americans do, where they were on 9/11. I was in the middle of a political campaign. And, suddenly, the differences with my opponent seemed very small in comparison. And our country came together. And, in many ways, we defeated the terrorists because of the resilience of the American public, because of our intelligence community. And we are safer, better prepared. The stunning thing to me is, here we are 20 years later, and the attack on the symbol of our democracy was not coming from terrorists, but it came from literally insurgents attacking the Capitol on January 6. So I believe we are stronger. I believe our intelligence community has performed remarkably. I think the threat of terror has diminished. I think we still have new challenges in terms of nation-state challenges, Russia and, longer term, a technology competition with China. But I do worry about some of the activity in this country, where the election deniers, the insurgency that took place on January 6, that is something I hope we could see that same kind of unity of spirit. MARGARET BRENNAN: As you're pointing out, America came together after 9/11. And we are incredibly divided right now. One thing that is potentially quite explosive is this ongoing investigation of the Justice -- by the Justice Department of the former president and his handling of classified information. You've asked for a briefing from the intelligence community. Given how sensitive this is, why should anything be shared with Congress, given that this is an ongoing investigation? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Because, as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee -- and I'm very proud of our committee. We're the last functioning bipartisan committee. I believe, in -- in the whole Congress. The vice chairman and I have asked for a briefing of the damages that could have arisen from mishandling of this information. And I believe it's our congressional duty to have that oversight. Remember, what's at stake here is the fact that, if some of these documents involve human intelligence, and that information got out, people will die. MARGARET BRENNAN: We don't know that yet. SENATOR MARK WARNER: If there are penetration of signals intelligence, literally years of work could be destroyed. We talk about the enormous advances our intelligence community has made helping our Ukrainian friends. That comes about because we share intelligence. If there's intelligence that has been shared with us by allies, and that is mishandled, all of that could be in jeopardy. Now, we don't know what's in those documents. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But I think it is incumbent, as soon as we get approval -- let me be clear, as soon as we get approval. My understanding is, there is some question, because of the special master appointment by the judge in Florida, whether they can brief at this point. We need clarification on that from that judge as quickly as possible, because it is essential that the Intelligence Committee leadership, at least, gets a briefing of the damage assessment. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that damage assessment, it has been paused, as has the classification review, and it will take some time. So, A, I am assuming in your answer there you're saying there have been no promises of a briefing to be scheduled. Is that right? SENATOR MARK WARNER: I believe we will get a briefing as soon as there is clarification whether this can be performed or not... MARGARET BRENNAN: But why should that... SENATOR MARK WARNER: ... in light of the ruling of the judge in Florida. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why should that happen? Because I want to get to something you said,which was the last bipartisan committee. You and Marco Rubio, your partner in this request for a briefing, put forth this letter asking for the damage assessment. But, lately, your colleague has been making some comments that don't sound quite as bipartisan. He's compared the Justice Department to corrupt regimes in Latin America when it comes to this investigation. He's accused DOJ of leaking sensitive details. And he said the only reason to leak it is to create a narrative for political purpose. When information gets shared with Congress, as you know, the accusation is, it will get leaked. So, A, it looks like you're losing that bipartisanship. And, B, If you brief Congress, isn't it going to leak further and worsen? SENATOR MARK WARNER: The record of our Intelligence Committee of keeping secrets secret, that's why the intelligence community shares information with us. Remember, this was the committee, bipartisan, that did the Russia investigation. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know that your oversight capability, many would argue, including former heads of counterintelligence, FBI, that the line is drawn when it's an active investigation. They don't owe a briefing. SENATOR MARK WARNER: We don't -- we do not, I do not want any kind of insight into an active investigation by the Justice Department. I do want the damage assessment of what would happen to our ability to protect the nation, and here we are 21 years after 9/11, if classified secrets, top secret secrets are somehow mishandled. I pointed out earlier, people could die. Sources of intelligence could disappear. The willingness of our allies to share intelligence could be undermined. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: And I think we need that assessment to make sure if, on an ongoing... MARGARET BRENNAN: Which you will get. SENATOR MARK WARNER: But I think we need it sooner than later. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's going to take some time. SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think we need it sooner than later. MARGARET BRENNAN: But -- so -- but, to that point, because it's so sensitive, because the country is so divided, because you already have in many ways a target being put on the back of law enforcement, isn't it more important to get it right, to be deliberate, and not to be fast here? I want the details just as much as you do. (CROSSTALK) SENATOR MARK WARNER: I do not think we should have, as the Intelligence Committee, a briefing on the ongoing investigation. What our responsibility is, is to assess whether there has been damage done to our intelligence collection and maintenance of secrets capacity. MARGARET BRENNAN: But just... SENATOR MARK WARNER: That is a damage assessment that, frankly, even the judge in Florida has said can continue. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before November? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, the -- once we get clarification from the judge in Florida -- and, again, I don't think we can cherry-pick what part of the legal system we like or dislike. I have trust in our legal system. I may not agree with the decision of the judge in Florida, but I respect our Department of Justice. I respect the FBI. I think they are trying, under extraordinarily difficult circumstances, to get it right. And we owe them the benefit of the doubt. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for coming on. And I know we're going to continue to track this and any potential impact to national security. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to retired Marine General Frank McKenzie, who was most recently commander of U.S. Central Command, which is in charge of defending U.S. interests in the Middle East, Central and South Asia. Last August, he led the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. And we welcome him now. Good morning to you, General. GEN. FRANK MCKENZIE (RET.) (Former Commander, U.S. Central Command): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you were at the Pentagon when it was attacked on 9/11. And, as we just laid out, that really came full circle as you executed this withdrawal. I wonder how you make peace and make sense of all that was lost, not just the 2,400 service people who lost their lives in that conflict, but those who survived, who continued to deal with loss and look at an Afghanistan that is once again under the control of the Taliban. GEN. FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, Margaret, over the 21-year arc from 9/11 -- and I was in the Pentagon -- to when we came out of Afghanistan last August, we prevented a major attack from occurring on the United States. The cost was not cheap, as you noted. It -- we lost a lot of brave young Americans. Our coalition partners lost a lot of their -- their soldiers. And, of course, the Afghan people paid a steep price for that. So, it wasn't a cost-free proposition. But we did manage to prevent another major attack from occurring against the United States during that period of time. I'm still processing what it means here at the end, and it would be presumptuous of me to say that it bothers me more than those who lost a loved one at some time in Afghanistan or one of the other theaters where we carried on this battle against a relentless, violent foe. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you have, since leaving your position, shared that you advised President Biden not to draw down to zero, to leave a residual force of 2,500 troops in Afghanistan. It's the right, as the commander in chief, to keep his own counsel and reject the advice of his military commanders. If you felt so strongly, why didn't you resign? GEN. FRANK MCKENZIE: I had the opportunity to give advice -- advice to the president. He heard my advice. It was heard thoughtfully. And that's really all a commander should expect to be able to do under our system. Once the president makes a decision, for a combatant commander like me, the chain of command is very short. It is the secretary of defense and it is the president of the United States. And once civilian leadership makes a decision, even though I might disagree with that decision, it is my moral responsibility to execute that order. To resign is not -- and is not in the -- in the history is not -- it is not something that U.S. officers have typically done. And it sends a very bad signal. It is a political act by an officer who must need -- and must be and remain apolitical. So, even if you disagree with the order, as long as the order is legal, you need to follow that order. If we do anything different, it would be very dangerous to the republic. So, while I gave advice, my advice was not followed. I executed that order as well as we were able to do. And I will just note that the president makes decisions based on many factors. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GEN. FRANK MCKENZIE: My recommendation in the Central Command AOR certainly one of the factors he had to weigh. There were other factors that the president had to weigh as well. And I'm very much aware of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, do you think, given your assessment of the threat, that the United States is paying enough attention now to the Middle East and to Afghanistan? GEN. FRANK MCKENZIE: Well, I hope that we are. I think that we have very, very limited ability to see into Afghanistan right now. I have said I think we've got certainly less than two or three percent of the intelligence capability that we had before we withdrew. Our interest in Afghanistan is preventing al Qaeda or ISIS from regenerating and being able to conduct an attack on our homeland or the homelands of our friends and partners. And our ability to do that has certainly been gravely reduced. Now, the fact that we took a strike against Zawahiri, and that was a very good and proper action, that's good news. I would note that's one strike in a year. And I will just come back. I would be careful about drawing conclusions about our ability to operate effectively in Afghanistan, in a counterterrorism sense, based on that single operation. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the CIA drone strike that took out the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in July. But the administration would point to that and say, look, we can counter the terror threat without a military footprint. So, are we at the right balance right now of keeping the homeland safe? Do you agree with their assessment that ISIS and al Qaeda do not presently pose a threat of being able to carry out an attack here? GEN. FRANK MCKENZIE: When I -- when I left -- when I left active duty, it was our assessment that, if we left Afghanistan, if the Afghan government fell, if the Taliban took over, then, over a period of time, both al Qaeda and ISIS would be able to regenerate. That is still my opinion today. You know, it is going to take a little time for them to do that. But I think what's most concerning about the CIA strike that you mentioned was the fact that he was living in very good accommodations in downtown Kabul. And that should give us all pause and also speak directly to the ill intent of the Taliban in negotiating with us as we worked with the Doha Agreement, which was the attempt to find an end to the war in Afghanistan. I think it is a manifest example of their of their inability to keep their word. MARGARET BRENNAN: What I hear you saying there is that the Trump administration bears responsibility for the deal it brokered with the Taliban, the Doha agreement? GEN. FRANK MCKENZIE: So, I think the reason that we left Afghanistan and the reason the Afghan government fell was that two presidents, President Trump and President Biden, both had as a very high objective to leave Afghanistan. So you had continuity of purpose across two administrations. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GEN. FRANK MCKENZIE: Now, the Doha Agreement, had we -- had we held the Taliban to the conditionality that was a critical part of it, it could have been a useful vehicle for moving forward. But we did not hold the Taliban to the conditions that they -- that they said they would observe. And that's -- that... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GEN. FRANK MCKENZIE: Because of that, no agreement is going to be good. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration has not released any public version of an after-action report of what went wrong. This was a big black eye, I don't have to tell you that, how this withdrawal happened. Do you think this assessment should be made public? And does the fact it is not public now suggest to you that any politics is at play? GEN. FRANK MCKENZIE: I don't know, Margaret. I would tell you that I participated before I left active duty in that after-action review. We did a number of those inside CENTCOM. And then I was also interviewed several times for the review that I believe is still working within inside the Department of Defense. I think it's probably a good thing to release as much of that review as you can. Obviously, there are going to be -- there are going to be sensitive intelligence components to that. And -- but I think you could probably excise some of those and still -- I think the American people want to know what happened. And I think it's a reasonable thing to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will continue to press for that. And thank you for your insights today, retired General Frank McKenzie. We want to be back in a moment with more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Today, the United Kingdom is in mourning for Queen Elizabeth, its longest-serving monarch, who will be laid to rest next Monday. World leaders are preparing to travel there in the coming days to pay their respects to her memory and to her son King Charles III. Today, he will be formally proclaimed king of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell is there in London -- Norah. NORAH O'DONNELL: Good morning, Margaret. Yes, it has been an incredibly moving morning here for many in England, as Queen Elizabeth II begins her long journey home. This morning, we saw her oak coffin covered with the royal standard of Scotland beginning its slow six-hour journey from Balmoral Castle to the country's capital of Edinburgh. There were tens of thousands of people lining the roads in tribute to the queen. The coffin will then rest in the throne room of the Palace of Holyrood. That is Holyroodhouse. That's actually the official residence of the British monarch in Scotland -- until Monday afternoon. Then King Charles III and the queen consort will arrive Monday as the coffin moves to St. Giles Cathedral, where she will lie in state. And then the new sovereign will then make a tour of the countries that make up the United Kingdom, including Ireland, before the funeral next Monday on September 19. And, you know, Margaret, there has been much said about the people's sentimental attachment to the monarch, the commonwealth's matriarch, but her reign marked not just for its constancy, but its length of 70 years. And some said, of course, it's like a living link to World War II. So, it's perhaps fitting that the queen state funeral will be the first in Britain since Winston Churchill in 1965. MARGARET BRENNAN: And, Norah, I can see behind you there at Buckingham Palace the memorials and the outpouring of sympathy. I wonder what it's like for you being on the ground in what is truly a historic moment. NORAH O'DONNELL: It is. And you're right, so many people here. Actually, the king is holding meetings here today. And, also, people were touched to see the now prince and princess of Wales spend nearly an hour meeting with people outside Windsor Castle. A royal source says that Prince William invited his brother, the duke and duchess of Sussex, Harry and Meghan, to join them. And it is the first time we have seen the four together in two years. And the academics here in the papers this morning are saying, this is a moment that in some ways will never be replicated, a woman whose reign was historic in length, revered for her grace and strength, was also known for her soft power, meeting 13 U.S. presidents, countless world leaders, giving advice and guidance to 15 prime ministers here, and, as you know quite well, Margaret, being the first British sovereign to visit Ireland in a century and helping calm tensions there. So, many people noting this passing of an era, and, of course, the world leaders expected to be here next week, the following week, to mourn her at Westminster Abbey -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Norah, thank you for your reporting there. And we will continue to cover that throughout CBS News programs. We're joined now by Dame Karen Pierce, the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States. And, Madam Ambassador, welcome to Face the Nation. And our condolences to you and your country. KAREN PIERCE (British Ambassador to the United States): Thank you very much. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden reminded the country that Queen Elizabeth said grief is the price we pay for love, and she said it after the attacks of 9/11. I wonder, as you look around this town and you see Union Jacks down Pennsylvania Avenue, you have this outpouring of sympathy, has it surprised you how strong the reaction has been? AMBASSADOR KAREN PIERCE: Well, could I start, Margaret, by also expressing my condolences to the American people on the anniversary of 9/11? As you say, that is what the Queen said. She also asked that the British institutions fly the American flag after 9/11 and on the 10th and 20th anniversaries. So, I think it's very good that the mayor and others have put up the British flags. It's very kind of them. We appreciate it very much. And, yes, I think we were a little bit surprised by quite how many Americans have rallied, have come to the embassy to pay their respects, have sent us messages. We were honored by the president coming to the embassy, the vice president and Secretary Blinken. This is what close allies do. They support each other. Nevertheless, it's a very moving thing to see. MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Biden, other world leaders have said they will come to the United Kingdom for the funeral next Monday. I want to take a quick break here and come back, because we have a lot to talk about. You have a lot of change ahead and under way in the United Kingdom. And we will have more from the ambassador in just a moment, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR, or we are available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. And we're replayed on our CBS News Streaming Network at noon and 4:00 p.m. Eastern. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more with the British ambassador to the United States on the queen's passing and a new era for the United Kingdom. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation now with the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States, Dame Karen Pierce. It's so good to have you here at such a key moment. And I wonder, as King Charles III, and we start to see him in this role on the throne, what will change about the contours of the kingdom? And I ask that because, as I'm sure you've seen, there's been a lot written in recent days. In \"The New York Times\" there was a columnist, Maya Jasanoff, who's a British historian, writes about the empire. And she said that the commonwealth really kind of glosses over some of the more bloody forms of British colonialism. She said, in her role as queen, Elizabeth helped obscure a bloody history of decolonization whose proportions and legacies have yet to be adequately acknowledged. It sort of kicked off the debate here. And I wonder how you think King Charles will deal with that. Is he mindful of things like this? DAME KAREN PIERCE (U.K. Ambassador to the United States): He's very politically aware and astute and very much aware of the world around him. I think his first task will be to go around the constituent parts of the U.K., promoting a message of unity, one of respect for the late queen, but also one of renewal. He'll want to show stability and unity and continuity. But he has made no secret of the fact there are things he'd like to modernize. So, we'll wait and see what those are. He's a huge supporter of the commonwealth. He becomes head of the commonwealth. And that was decided a few years ago. He has gone on record as saying it doesn't matter what sort of government you have in the commonwealth, whether you have monarchy, whether you have a republic, whether you have some other form, you are very welcome in the commonwealth. And he wants to do what he can to strengthen that partnership of equal - equal nations. And I want to stress the equal. We can't pretend we have a different history. There are good things and bad. And we need to talk about them. But I think that assessment is too negative. I would say that one of the overwhelmingly positive things that came out of the queen's 70 years was the transition from empire to commonwealth, was the transition to having a fellowship of sovereign equal nations who will come together every two years, head of government and head of state level, and who do an awful lot (INAUDIBLE) on trade in between. So, I think that's a positive legacy. And I think most countries in the commonwealth would feel that. MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.K.'s had such tremendous change. Four prime ministers in the past six years. A new prime minister just in recent days as well, Liz Truss. I want to ask you about the U.S./U.K. relationship because President Biden has made clear, when it comes to relations, for him, protecting the peace in northern Ireland is of utmost importance. And this looks like it could be a point of difference because the U.S. has warned the U.K. not to hold a vote on this legislation that could affect the creation or not of a hard border between north and south Ireland. Do you believe that vote will happen? And what happens to U.S. relations if that goes ahead? KAREN PIERCE: So, I think the first thing to say is that the president had a very warm discussion with the prime minister when she was first appointed. They talked about the special relationship. They talked about what Britain and the U.S. can do together, promoting democracy and open societies around the world and the need to push back on authoritarianism. So, as the queen herself said, what brings us together is far stronger than any individual issue that may divide us. We, too, in Britain, the prime minister wants to preserve the Good Friday Peace Agreement in northern Ireland. She and the president and the Irish government absolutely share that aim. MARGARET BRENNAN: But she's also talked about scrapping parts of that agreement with the EU, that -- specifically that deal with that border. KAREN PIERCE: Well, that is a particular agreement about trade so that northern Ireland can trade with Ireland, which remains in the European Union. And the mainland of Great Britain can also trade with northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom. And the difficulty arises precisely because we are determined to avoid a hard border between northern Ireland and Ireland. We accept that's an enormous gain of the Good Friday Agreement. It is hard to introduce trading arrangements that protect the integrity of the EU single market and protect the integrity of the United Kingdom single market when you haven't got a border. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. KAREN PIERCE: But we don't want to introduce a border. The legislation going through parliament is not about a border, it's about contingency measures that the government could take if it needed to if we cannot reach a negotiated settlement with the EU to make the passage of goods between northern Ireland and Ireland smoother than it is now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. KAREN PIERCE: There's lots of disruption to communities. They can't get the goods and medicine in northern Ireland that they need. The government needs to sort this out. MARGARET BRENNAN: There are a lot of challenges the prime minister faces, including economic ones. in large part because of Russia's war on Ukraine. Do you see political risk to the alliance in the months ahead? KAREN PIERCE: No, I think the alliance -- the NATO alliance has shown that it is stronger than ever. There has been a remarkably united response to President Putin's invasion. The same is true as the transatlantic relationship between Europe as a whole and the United States more broadly. Leaders will be able to get together in the forthcoming U.N. general assembly, where I think you'll see more outpourings of support for Ukraine. There's no doubt there is a cost of living crisis. That's not unique to Britain. We have introduced measures around energy bills and energy prices to try and help ordinary households. And the chance of the exchequer, our treasury secretary was here recently talking to Secretary Yellen. We're looking together at how we can share best practice in what to do to help households. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will continue to follow closely in the coming days and weeks. Thank you so much, Ambassador. KAREN PIERCE: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: A stunning retreat by Russia overnight as Ukrainian forces claw back parts of the south and east of their country. And as the war enters its 200th day, there is another significant development. This morning, engineers at Europe's largest nuclear power plant are shutting down the last operational reactor in an attempt to lessen the chance of catastrophe. CBS News foreign correspondent Debora Patta reports from Kyiv. (BEGIN VT) DEBORA PATTA (voice over): It's happening with lightning speed. Advancing Ukrainian troops in the northeast Kharkiv region are taking back lost territory. Despite casualties along the way, the gains have been rapid and dramatic. And it's taken everyone by surprise. Ukraine kept the operation a tightly guarded secret. For now, journalists have been banned from reporting from the front line. But across the region, the blue and yellow flag has been raised in towns and villages occupied for more than half a year. Victory in Kubiansk (sp?), a crucial logistics hub for Russia as Ukraine rips down all traces of the invading forces. In liberated Balakia (sp?), jubilation and tears. And the words these residents have waited so long to hear, everything's going to be OK says this soldier. For six months we prayed you would save us, sobs this woman. It's a humiliating defeat for Vladimir Putin's men who have been forced to beat a hasty retreat. And it comes the attempt to save face from Moscow, who says it's withdrawing to reinforce troops in Donetsk. Ukraine has been emboldened by the steady supply of western military aid, but it needs more to keep the momentum going, says the mayor of the now occupied Melitopol Ivan Fedrov. IVAN FEDROV (Mayor of Melitopol): But it depends on how quickly our partners will give us weapons, how quickly our partners will give us heavy equipment military. DEBORA PATTA: Right now, Russia still holds around a fifth of this country. (END VT) DEBORA PATTA: Nobody expects this to be over quickly, but Ukrainians are daring to hope today that the war could be starting to swing their way. These are the most significant battlefield successes since they crushed Russia's attempt to seize Kyiv at the start of this nearly seven-month long war. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Debora Patta in Kyiv, thank you. And we are joined now, once again, by Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Madam Ambassador, good morning to you. An incredible past few days for your country. I wonder, as you have this progress, if concern is growing that Russia will resort to more brutality to respond to the success Ukraine has had. OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S.): Well, our 200 days fall on the September 11th. And we know this pain and we feel this pain in Ukraine. We know how is it when terrorists attack you at home. So, we always have to keep in mind that Russia still can do a lot of damage. But we don't have any other choice. We will advance. As we said before, we will not surrender. And we will liberate all Ukraine because this is what we have to do, not only to restore our territory integrity, but to save all of our people who are under occupation. And we see from the footage, from more than 1,200 square miles, which have been liberated during the past, literally, eight days, the most fast counter offense since the World War II. We see how they are meeting and greeting our armed forces. And we also, unfortunately, see already the signs of the brutal war crimes that have been committed there. No different from what we saw after we liberated the Kyiv (INAUDIBLE). So, we have to win. And this counteroffensive shows that we can win. And we are repeating the success that we had in the Kyiv (INAUDIBLE). MARGARET BRENNAN: Retired General Ben Hodges (sp?) told our David Martin that Ukraine's military could push Russia back to the borders that existed pre-February 24th, when the invasion happened. And that could happen before the end of the year. Do you agree with that timeline? OKSANA MARKAROVA: Again, this operation was possible because of the resolve of the armed forces, because our commanders from the president, to every commander in the battlefield, so devoted to the victory. But also because 14 million of Ukrainians are supporting this effort and fighting for our country. But, more importantly, because our partners have increased all the support and we are getting more and more of the weapons and equipment that is so needed for that. So of course we would like to liberate all Ukraine as soon as possible to stop the suffering of the people and to restore our sovereignty. But whether it will be possible before the end of the year, we -- we are ready to do it before the end of the year. And hopefully we will have everything we need to do so. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration made some announcements of further support. $2.2 billion in long term military financing for Ukraine and its neighbors. This was just in the past week. $675 million package of heavy weapons. Your foreign minister tweeted this morning that now it's about schedule, schedule and schedule. So, you're getting these pledges. Is there a complaint it's not arriving fast enough? OKSANA MARKAROVA: We don't have any complaints. If you look at August and September, we see that the announcements are very regular and we're getting a lot of announcements on a weekly basis. We also see, and it's is very important, and it has been a highlight of this Secretary Blinken's visit to Kyiv, that we're not only talking about what is necessary right now, for us to win today, but we are increasingly discussing the long-term support. And everything that we need in order to build what we call the endurance trans (sp?). So, the USA aid (sp?) package that was announced, (INAUDIBLE) that was announced in -- on the independence day, and this $2.2 billion, out of which about $1 billion will go to Ukraine in foreign financing is not only what we need now but also what we will need in the coming months and years in order to be able to defend ourselves. MARGARET BRENNAN: How much longer does this war last? OKSANA MARKAROVA: It will last until we win. And we definitely would like it to be shorter because the Russians are not only attacking us, they're attacking Europe, the energy crisis, the food crisis, everything they're trying to create in order to not only attack Ukraine but every democracy that is together with us fighting for the democracy now. So, the faster we do it, the faster we will return to rebuilding and renovating our country, but also to some kind of normal life in Europe and globally. Now -- MARGARET BRENNAN: How -- how should people understand what is happening now with the nuclear reactor in Ukraine? OKSANA MARKAROVA: The situation is totally unacceptable from any type of international standpoint. The Russian armed forces, that shouldn't be in Ukraine in the first place, and definitely shouldn't be at the nuclear plant, which is the largest nuclear plant in Europe, are putting in danger the lives not only of Ukrainians but also the whole region by being there and doing the things that -- MARGARET BRENNAN: But shutting down the reactor, does that avert catastrophe? OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, this is - this is -- we're trying everything possible. And Ukrainians who are there at the station, despite of the fact that they are there under the gun all the time, trying to do everything possible to minimize the risks. So, we are forced to do it, we are forced to shut it down. It's not a complete resolution. The complete resolution is for Russians to get out, to implement the recommendations of the UAIA (sp?) and to demilitarize the plant, which means that Russians should leave. That will bring the safety. But, in the meantime, again, the Ukrainian personnel there is doing everything possible in order to avert any type of catastrophes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The last time you were here in April you told us that there were roughly 91,000 Ukrainian children who had been taken from their families and brought into Russia. Has there been any progress in bringing them home? You asked for the U.S. to help with this. OKSANA MARKAROVA: We are asking everyone. And, unfortunately, with this -- fortunately with the counteroffensive, but we see already that during the counteroffensives, Russians are trying to move more kids from the territories, which we liberate prior to the liberations to Russia. So this issue of identifying and finding every children that Russian stolen from us and return them back safely is still one of the top priorities. And hopefully, after we win, we will be able to get them all back. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, should we expect your president to come to the United Nations in the coming days in person? Can he leave? OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, it all depends on the situation on the ground. So, we cannot say anything right now, but hopefully we will be able to have more good news from Ukraine and more territories to return home. MARGARET BRENNAN: That would be significant. Thank you, Madame Ambassador. OKSANA MARKAROVA: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the continued efforts to restore clean water to the roughly 150,000 residents of Jackson, Mississippi. The city's mayor, Chokwe Lumumba, joins us now live from Jackson. And, Mr. Mayor, we welcome you to the program. You don't get more basic governance than running water. When can your residents turn on the faucet and not have to worry? CHOKWE LUMUMBA (Mayor of Jackson, Mississippi): Well, first and foremost, Margaret, thank you for having me and thank you for lifting this circumstance up. Fortunately, we have some level of good news to report, that all residents have had water pressure restored to them. They have yet to have the boil water notice lifted, and so there are still concerns around the consumption of that water. Right now, as many repairs and adjustments are taking place in the triage period of where we are at the water treatment facility. There's also investigatory sampling taking place. And so we believe that it's a matter of days, not weeks, before that boil water notice can be lifted. But I would note this, that we have been here before, where we've been ail to restore pressure. We've been able to lift boil water notices. But without the significant capital improvements to take place, it still is a matter of if, not when, these things will happen again. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about that. CHOKWE LUMUMBA: When, not if. I apologize. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about that capital in a moment. But we also have learned that there is now a federal probe of the drinking water crisis. The spokesperson for the EPA's inspector general told our Avery Miller (sp?) that the investigators are already on the ground in your city to speak to local officials. Do you know the scope of this? Are your actions, as mayor, being investigated? CHOKWE LUMUMBA: Well, first and foremost, I think that any time you have an event of this severity take place, then you should expect more questions and more investigation. And I think we should be open to that. No, no one has talked to me. I do not know the scope nor the timeline in which they're investigating. But I can share that to the extent that they will be speaking to city employees, I will direct them to cooperate with any investigation. We look forward to more information so that we can get beyond this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there was a similar investigation in Flint, Michigan, as you know, years ago. It ultimately led to nine indictments. Do you expect similar action in your city? CHOKWE LUMUMBA: Well, I can't speak to the analogous nature of the Flint, Michigan, circumstance in Jackson. I can share with you that I am unaware of any criminal activity on behalf of individuals here in the city of Jackson. However, what we do is -- what we do want is a greater understanding of where failures have been taking place. We know that our administration and, in fact, administrations past have been pushing for corrective action to take place for a long time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. You mentioned the need for capital. In March 2021, federal government sent $42 million directly to the city as part of the American Rescue Plan. In August 2021, President Biden said this when he signed off on the bipartisan infrastructure bill. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Never again can we allow what happened in Flint, Michigan, in Jackson, Mississippi, can never let it happen again. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: It's happening again. In fact, it's getting worse. Where's the money? Why isn't it -- CHOKWE LUMUMBA: Well -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. CHOKWE LUMUMBA: Well, first and foremost, I've had very extensive discussions with the president and the vice president concerning the federal government's desire to help. And we look forward to that. We have committed the grand majority of our ARPA funds towards our infrastructure. Not only at the water treatment facility, but distribution lines. We've spent $8 million on one pipe alone in south Jackson, which is disproportionately affected. It is also critical for people to know that the city of Jackson didn't get $42 million at one time. Merely a little over a month ago we got our second tranche of the funds. We have made a commitment to spend all of that -- the remaining dollars. There was some choice to spend some towards public safety issues. And so we are committing the lion's share, the overwhelming majority of our funds towards this challenge. However, it is insufficient to meet the great need of 30 years of deferred maintenance and accumulated challenges. And so it will take a coordinated effort on not only the local/state but federal levels as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: And what does that mean? Federal taxpayer dollars have been allocated here. Why can't the White House get that to you faster? CHOKWE LUMUMBA: Well, I believe that there is a full intent to do so. I think that there is a process by which you identify the different pockets in which the money lies and creativity needing to take place. I can share you with that there has been a full cooperation and communication at the highest levels. Whether it's the administrator of the EPA, Michael Regan, who speaks to me consistently about their effort and desire to help, whether we're talking about the czar of the infrastructure bill himself, Mitch Landrieu, we've all been in communication. And about the timeline in which certain portals open, I think a major portal that is necessary to fund Jackson opens in October. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that, as you've said in the past, state lawmakers have been racist in their treatment of your city? CHOKWE LUMUMBA: Yes. Well, I'll say this, I'm not backing down from any, you know, characterizations that I've made. I think that they - they were made in honesty. However, I think that this is a time to focus on the solutions for our residents. When people go long -- prolonged periods of time without water pressure and even longer periods of time without an ability to consume it, they really aren't trying to be bogged down in the political disputes that ensue. MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. CHOKWE LUMUMBA: They just want solutions. And that's - that's where we're focused. MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. And we will continue to track what is happening in Jackson. Good luck to you, Mr. Mayor. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan.",

And this week on Face the Nation: President Biden is battling a COVID infection, as the world prepares for another health crisis. Nearly two-and-a-half years into the COVID pandemic, President Biden is experiencing what millions of Americans have gone through, a bout of what may be the latest mutation of COVID. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): I'm doing well, getting a lot of work done. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But the country is facing another health crisis as the rapid spread of monkeypox prompts the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency. (Begin VT) TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS (Director General, World Health Organization): This is an outbreak that can be stopped with the right strategies. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will discuss the strategy for containing monkeypox, the evolving threat of COVID, and the president's own prognosis with White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha. Meanwhile, a dangerous heat wave rolls through the U.S., bringing with it intensifying drought and raging wildfires. We will hear from the mayor of Miami Republican, Francis Suarez, about how his front-line city is preparing for rising sea levels and extreme weather. And with the president's environmental agenda stalled in Congress, we will ask Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo about what's next for climate and competition with China. Then: The committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol reveals new details about former President Trump's conduct during and after the assault. (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States): I don't want to say the election is over. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Will the revelations have any legal or political impact on Mr. Trump's future? (Begin VT) FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I announced that I was not going to run for office, the persecution of Donald Trump would immediately stop. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will check in with California Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff, a member of the Select Committee. And just hours after a U.N.-brokered deal was signed to release vital Ukrainian grain exports, Russia bombs the very ports where they're stored. As the war continues to roil the global economy, we will talk with Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.S. Oksana Markarova. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have a lot of news to get through this morning. But we want to begin on the medical beat with the latest on President Biden's condition and the fight to contain both COVID and monkeypox. We're joined now by White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha. Welcome to Face the Nation. DR. ASHISH JHA (White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator): Good Morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House physician has said that it's the BA.5 variant that likely infected the president. That's the dominant variant across the country right now. It's highly transmissible. How is the president's health? And do you know where he got it? DR. ASHISH JHA: Yes, so it is the BA.5 variant, which is, as you said, is about 80 percent of infections. The president's doing well. I checked in with his team late last night. He was feeling well. He had a good day yesterday. He's got a viral syndrome, an upper respiratory infection that is -- and he's doing just fine. MARGARET BRENNAN: There is so little known about long COVID, but given the president's age, do you expect that the White House will continue to make disclosures if he has long-term symptoms from this infection? DR. ASHISH JHA: Yes, absolutely. You know, we think it's really important for the American people to know how well the president's doing, which is why we have been so transparent, giving updates several times a day, having people hear from me directly, hear directly from his physician. And, obviously, if he has persistent symptoms, obviously, if any of them interfere with his ability to carry out his duties, we will -- we will disclose that early and often with the American people. MARGARET BRENNAN: About six out of 10 Americans, according to CDC, live in areas of high transmission right now. That includes major cities like New York, Phoenix, Miami. There are no indoor mask mandates there. Does that concern you? DR. ASHISH JHA: In areas of high transmission, I think it's very prudent for people to be wearing masks indoors, especially if they're in crowded, poorly ventilated spaces. That's what the CDC recommends. MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about this other health challenge with monkeypox. The World Health Organization yesterday declared it a public health emergency of international concern. That's the highest level of alert. The Biden administration, specifically HHS, has stopped short of doing that. Should you declare it a pandemic? Should you declare it a public health emergency? DR. ASHISH JHA: We are seeing outbreaks that are out of control in many, many parts of the world. It's very important that we get our arms around this thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it an emergency here? DR. ASHISH JHA: In the United States -- well, in the -- in the U.S., right now, we're looking at public health emergency as a -- as something that HHS might deliver, but -- I mean, might invoke, but it really depends on, what does that allow us to do? Right now, we have over 2,000 cases, but we have ramped up vaccinations, ramped up treatments, ramped up testing, and we're going to continue to look at all sort of policy options. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said back in May that you think we can get our arms around this. You said monkeypox is a virus that we understand. Are you saying today, just like then, you think monkeypox can be contained? DR. ASHISH JHA: I do think monkeypox can be contained, absolutely. The way we contain monkeypox is, we have a very simple, straightforward strategy on this, right, which is make testing widely available. We have done that. And now testing is far more frequent and common. MARGARET BRENNAN: It was slow. DR. ASHISH JHA: Get vaccines out. Yes, but we have right now the capacity to do 90,000 tests a week -- I'm sorry -- 80,000 tests a week. That's an extraordinary number. We're going to be releasing hundreds of thousands of more vaccines in the next days and weeks. So, there is a very substantial ramping up of response that is happening right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: But I asked you about containment because you could have shifted allocation earlier, surged it differently, sooner switching from at-risk individuals to areas where there are active high case counts and an outbreak. The CDC director said just a few days ago her agency has no data on who has been vaccinated. She said there's one key important similarity with COVID and with monkeypox, and that is the CDC's inability to see data in real time. So this seems to be still an issue for our health agencies to act quickly to contain an outbreak. This is a problem. DR. ASHISH JHA: Yes, so what I would -- I would remind us is that public health in America has always been led by states. It is important for states to be sharing data with CDC. We've been working with states across the country. Lots of states have been forthcoming. And my expectation is that, in the days and weeks ahead, we're going to be able to get more and more data from states. And that will help us understand the national picture a bit more -- in a bit more detail. But we do have a pretty good feel right now for how widespread monkeypox is, as I said, about 2,000 or so cases across the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: A fellow Democrat, Congressman Adam Schiff, who will be on this program today, sent a letter to HHS, saying: \"The federal government is falling short of the response that is needed. Skyrocketing cases, limited vaccination supply worldwide suggests that the monkeypox virus will continue to spread for years to come, if not indefinitely.\" Is monkeypox now endemic? Will it continue to spread indefinitely? DR. ASHISH JHA: Well, it is endemic in certain parts of the world. It is not endemic here in the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking about here. DR. ASHISH JHA: And the plan here is very straightforward. We -- the plan is to eliminate this virus from the United States. I think we can do that. We've got the vaccines and we've got the diagnostic tests. MARGARET BRENNAN: There are now two children with it that the CDC knows of, at least, and the CDC said both of these children are traced back to individuals who come from the men-who-have-sex-with-men community. How actively is this being spread? And are you still only talking about the gay community because you're only looking there? DR. ASHISH JHA: Yes, so we obviously know that this virus is spreading largely in the -- in the gay community, among men who have sex with men. But, obviously, there are other people who are at risk as well, people they interact with, people -- anybody who has monkeypox can spread it to others. It is through skin-to-skin contact, direct and prolonged contact. We're doing a very broad surveillance. This is why not only have we ramped up testing capacity. We're -- we're encouraging physicians, working with physician groups to do more broad-scale testing. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about one other issue right now. We heard in the state of New York, the first case of polio in nearly a decade was confirmed in an unvaccinated 20-year-old man in Rockland County, New York. He was hospitalized back in June. Are there other cases? And if he was infected back in June, why are we only now hearing about it? DR. ASHISH JHA: Yes, so this is a place where the CDC is working very closely with the Department of Health. It is in an unvaccinated individual. Thankfully, most Americans are vaccinated against polio. Most of the world is vaccinated against polio. If -- obviously, if you're not vaccinated against polio, critically important. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, I have a small child. It takes time to get fully vaccinated. Should I be concerned that there are polio cases spreading in New York and in the United States? DR. ASHISH JHA: There is a lot of surveillance that we do for polio. There's wastewater surveillance that goes on. We are not seeing outbreaks of polio elsewhere. But I do not expect polio to become more widespread in the country, again, because so many Americans are vaccinated against this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Jha, thank you for your time this morning. Face the Nation will be back in a moment. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We now turn to the January 6 investigation and the latest findings from the House Select Committee investigating the attack on the Capitol. On Thursday, the committee detailed hours of inaction by President Trump during the assault as he sat in his dining room, watched the violence unfold on television and chose to do nothing to stop the siege of Congress, despite pleas by advisers, Republican lawmakers and allies. (Begin VT) GEN. MARK MILLEY (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff): You know, you're the commander in chief. You've got an assault going on, on the Capitol of the United States of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We learned that Secret Service agents protecting Vice President Mike Pence feared for their lives. (Begin VT) WHITE HOUSE SECURITY OFFICIAL: There were calls to say goodbye to family members, so on and so forth. The V.P. detail thought that this was about to get very ugly. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we saw for the first time top congressional leaders working with the acting secretary of defense to get back to certifying the electoral votes. (Begin VT) SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D-New York): The earliest we could safely resume? CHRISTOPHER MILLER (Former Acting U.S. Secretary of Defense): I -- here's my assessment. I would say, best case, we're looking at four to five hours. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: The hearings to date have featured a wide range of witnesses, but the through line of nearly all the testimony has been former President Trump and his relentless efforts to overturn his loss in the 2020 election. Committee members say the investigation is far from over, with more hearings planned for September 20. Joining us now is a member of that panel, Congressman Adam Schiff of California, who is also the chair of the House Intelligence Committee. Good to have you here with us. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF (D-California): Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I go further on January 6, I do want to quickly just button up what Dr. Jha addressed in regard to that letter you wrote this week in regard to monkeypox. You said the federal response falls short in terms of supply and timeliness regarding a vaccine. The current supply accounts for only 3.5 half million residents. Some shipments are not even expected to arrive until 2023. Why do you think the federal response is failing, when Dr. Jha says it's contained and under control? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: I don't know why there aren't more vaccines available. I'm hearing from health care providers in my district that there are people lining up to get vaccinated and they don't have the vaccines for them, and that is a real problem. As I think you indicated, we really don't know the future course of this virus. But what we do now, early on, just as was the case with the pandemic, will determine just how bad this may get. And so I want to light a fire under the administration and get them to make sure that we up production, that we up distribution and that people that are ready and willing and able to get vaccinated have the ability to protect themselves. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll continue tracking that on this program. But let me get back to January 6. When you were last on this program, you said you believed that it would be more dangerous for the Justice Department to decide against prosecuting the former president than it would be to go ahead with a prosecution. Here's how Attorney General Merrick Garland responded when my colleague Jeff Pegues asked him about potential prosecution. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND (U.S. Attorney General): Look, no person is above the law in this country. Nothing stops us. JEFF PEGUES: Even a former president? ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND: No -- I don't know how to -- maybe I will say that again. No person is above the law in this country. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of those remarks? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, the attorney general is committed to following the evidence to wherever it may lead. And it has led to Donald Trump. And so I think the president should be investigated. Whether they'll ultimately conclude they have proved beyond reasonable doubt to charge him and to convict him, that's -- that will it be up to the department. But what we have demonstrated just in the last couple of hearings is that, when all else failed, when all these other lines of effort to overturn the election failed, he made the decision to bring a mob to the Capitol. When he learned they were armed, his response was, then take the magnetometers down. He wanted to march with that mob, that armed and dangerous mob, to the Capitol. And when he was refused and brought to the safety of the cafeteria or the Dining Room of the White House, he wouldn't lift a finger as he watched on TV police officers being beaten and gouged and sprayed with chemicals, in the most supreme dereliction of duty ever. But, also, those multiple lines of effort, I think, invoke various criminal laws. And his conduct ought to be the subject of investigation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll see if the Justice Department starts one. On the things that the committee has laid out in this congressional forum, we still haven't seen a direct link substantiated between the White House officials and the militias like the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers who were part of the violence that day. Are you still trying to substantiate that? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: That remains an ongoing part of our investigation. We have certainly shown some links between the president, the key advisers like Roger Stone and Mike Flynn, and elements of these white nationalist groups. But that component of our investigation continues. And, as is the case more broadly, witnesses continue to come forward. We'll be presenting new information in the fall. But, as we continue to ask about additional evidence, I think we really need to think about what we've demonstrated already about the president's knowledge that the election wasn't stolen and his response and his intent. And, to me, that is most graphically demonstrated when he told top Justice Department officials basically to say -- just say the election was stolen or just say it was corrupt, and that he would take care of the rest. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Those kind of pieces of testimony, they're directly on the president's knowledge and intent. And this gets back to your previous question about the Justice Department. I hope they're watching. I hope they're watching carefully, and I hope they understand the implications of what we're presenting. MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to implications, your colleague Liz Cheney was on two other networks this morning, and she said that you all are discussing a potential subpoena for Ginni Thomas, who is married to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Are there lines that shouldn't be crossed here when it comes to the Supreme Court? Because one of the objections to the premise of a subpoena here is that it -- it sets a dangerous precedent by putting the spouse of a justice in this political forum. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: There are lines that shouldn't be crossed, but those lines involve sitting Supreme Court justices not presiding or appearing or taking action in cases in which their spouse may be implicated. And, in this case, for Clarence Thomas to issue a decision in a case, a dissent in a case where Congress is trying to get documents, and those documents might involve his own wife, that's the line that's been crossed. And I think, for Congress to be looking into these issues, looking into conflict of interest issues, but, here, looking into issues, whether it involves the wife of a Supreme Court justice or anyone else, if they have information or role in an effort to overturn an election, yes, they're not excluded from examination. MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're saying you favor that subpoena? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I -- if she has relevant information or investigation, we hope she comes in voluntarily. But if she doesn't, then we should give that serious consideration. And, yes, I think those that we decide have important enough information should be subpoenaed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Cheney also said the committee expects to hear again from Tony Ornato, that lead Secret Service agent, and that both he and another have hired private criminal defense counsel. What does that suggest to you? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think, if they're hiring criminal defense counsel, then they probably have a concern about their potential criminal liability. We want to hear from these witnesses. Some, we want to hear from again. We want to put them under oath, if they weren't previously under oath, so that we can understand exactly what was happening on January 5 and January 6. And we have profound concerns about what's going on at the Secret Service. We are now, for the first time, getting documents that we had requested long, long ago. There's one issue about why they weren't provided earlier, but they're also showing us some new things. And, furthermore, we want to obtain those text messages, if there's any way to retrieve them. But, either way, we want to get answers as to why those were destroyed. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we will continue to watch what the committee does when you reconvene in the fall. Thank you very much, Congressman. And for a closer look at what the hearings have revealed about the former president, we're joined now by CBS News chief political analyst John Dickerson. John, it's good to talk to you. We were side by side just on Thursday night during these prime-time broadcasts of the hearings; 17 million Americans watched them. But this is a political process before Congress. It's not a legal one, as we just discussed. How do we start to assess the impact? JOHN DICKERSON: Well, it's good to be with you, Margaret. I think the impact of this Thursday's hearing was different than all the other hearings. When Donald Trump sometimes boasted about refusing to act as president, the consequences seemed far off. What Thursday showed was the most direct connection between Donald Trump choosing not to act as president and the dire consequences of doing so. So, as Americans watched January 6, most of them were heartsick. They thought -- they wished something could be done. What could be done? Donald Trump watched also. And he could do something. It was his duty as president to preserve, to protect and defend. He did nothing. His family called him and said, because of your special connection to the rioters flying your flag, you should do something. He did nothing. So, for three hours, while he watched what everybody else was watching, he did not respond. And that is the most clear representation of his refusal to do the job and actually doing the job. So what was amazing about Thursday was not the specific testimony, which was amazing, but that no one can testify that he took actions consistent with his job, not the witnesses who talked about what he didn't do, but that no one can bear witness to him doing the job as commander in chief. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And that was -- that inaction was something Congressman Kinzinger put his finger on. And he was on another network this morning saying that, when it comes to the hearings, for Republicans in general, this doesn't appear to be having a ton of impact. And I thought that was interesting because, when you open \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page, \"The New York Post,\" it drew a lot of attention that they both were unusually harsh in their criticism of the former president in the past few days. \"The Journal\" wrote: \"Character is revealed in a crisis. Mr. Pence passed his January 6 trial. Mr. Trump utterly failed his.\" How do we assess where the conservative movement is on this? JOHN DICKERSON: Well, we will -- we will have to see. Donald Trump's reputation is in flux. When we think about the Republican Party, it's got kind of two challenges. And there are a lot of tensions in an election year, two challenges and one thing that's going well for it. If you think of Donald Trump, the challenge is, he has been judged by the leaders of his party, Mitch McConnell in the Senate, Kevin McCarthy in the House, Mike Pence, as having failed in a fundamental duty of the job. So, how does a party go forward, when its most popular leader has failed at a core job in a democracy? The other challenge is in the movement of people who look at what happened on January 6 and think that the rioters didn't go far enough, who have an apocalyptic sense of politics and think that anything goes if you demonize the other side sufficiently. Those are two problems and challenges for the Republican Party. The upside for Republicans at the moment, which will cause them to push that beach ball under the water, is that they have got a very favorable political environment, with Joe Biden's weakness, Democratic lack of enthusiasm, and the general historical trend that the party out of power does well in the midterms. All of those things will encourage Republicans to leave their problems to the side for the hopes of winning power back. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think that legacy of Trumpism is? Is it blow up the system? JOHN DICKERSON: Well, the legacy as it's come through these hearings, let's think about what these hearings have lifted and what it means. It kind of goes beyond Donald Trump, but it goes to the two challenges of a -- in a democracy. One of the things we have seen in these hearings is that people who were challenged and under pressure of the Trump administration and Donald Trump, they did the right thing under pressure. And we have seen that for weeks. The other challenge, though, is the people who knew better and didn't act. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: Which of those two wins out? MARGARET BRENNAN: John Dickerson, always good to chat with you. We will be right back in a moment with more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, be sure to set your DVR. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: A brutal and sweltering heatwave is impacting large swaths of the country this weekend. Temperatures are expected to break records today in states across the northeast and the middle of the country as cities brace for heat indices of 100 degrees or more. CBS News senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann is in Tampa Bay with this report. (BEGIN VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): There's this southern expression, even Satan's sweating today. WOMAN: It's too hot - it's too hot right now. MAN: This is hot. This is brutal. Brutal. MARK STRASSMANN: Better get used to brutal. Today's blowtorch forecast, lots of triple digit highs. Heat alerts again for more than 80 million Americans. For many of them, that heat is considered dangerous. Places like Texas, where this heatwave feels like a siege of standing right next to one of the wildfires burning near Fort Worth or California near Yosemite. More than five dozen communities in 20 states this past week hit record highs. MARK STRASSMANN (on camera): Take Tampa Bay, hit for most of the last week by hot, humid winds off the Gulf of Mexico. The daily high for the feels- like temperature between 102 and 107. MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): Texas and California have had highs of 115. Overheated people in Dallas hunted for air conditioning anywhere. Libraries seemed cool again. Geoscientist blamed inaction on climate change and warned hot house summers are here to stay. JOELLEN L. RUSSELL, PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA: These are spectacularly tough things and they're only going to get worse unless we tackle the problem with everything we've got. MARK STRASSMANN: Europe's week of heat was historic and deadly. Thousands died. Most of them, elderly. Wildfires in Spain. In the U.K., where central air is rare, temperatures reached 36 degrees above normal. Portugal's high, 117. On both sides of the Atlantic, people have shared triple digit misery, and talking about the weather has meant more than making small talk. WOMAN: They should take it seriously because heat-related illnesses can be life-threatening. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: That was Mark Strassmann reporting. We turn now to Miami Mayor Francis Suarez. He is a Republican and the current chairman of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. He joins us from Miami. Mr. Mayor, good to have you with us. You just heard our reporting there. You know, in this 2,000-page report, the U.N. put out earlier in the year, it refers to Florida as an example of a place where the impacts of climate change are already being felt. And it mentions people are likely going to have to move away if they live on the coastline. You and your city have had to come up with a strategy and the one released would spend 4 billion, 3.8 billion, over the next few decades to build seawalls, take other measures. That's quadruple your annual operating budget. Can you afford what's coming? MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ (R-Miami): Well, first of all, Margaret, it's not theoretical for us in the city of Miami. It's real. We deal with it day in and day out, year after year. We've been dedicating a tremendous amount of resources, updating our building codes over decades since 1992 when we had a 200 mile per hour event called Hurricane Andrew. Now, our latest challenge, of course, is the water and the heat, as you've said in the prior segment, and we -- our citizens approved right after Hurricane Irma in 2017, which created a four to six foot storm surge in our central business district, a plan called Miami Forever. And the basis of the plan is to spend hundreds of millions of dollars what were voter approved, there was actually a voter approved tax, and combine them with other funding sources, like the state and federal government, to be able to upgrade our infrastructure to deal with all the things that are being thrown our way from mother nature. MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you said you can't afford not to take it seriously, I wonder if you think the national Republican Party takes the problem of climate change seriously. FRANCIS SUAREZ: Well, what we're seeing at the national level is that the only action that is occurring is action that's taken in a bipartisan basis. The Democrats, unfortunately, have failed to be able to pass bills to address climate at any sort of scale. So, the infrastructure bill, which was recently passed -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they don't have any Republican votes. They also don't have all Democrats onboard, but it would help if they had Republican votes. FRANCIS SUAREZ: Right. Yes, exactly. Well, but - I think what it means is that it has to be bipartisan in terms of their outreach, in terms of their messaging, in terms of, you know, which is how they passed the, you know, the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill with Republican votes. And we still haven't seen any funding from that bill, by the way. Like I said, we dedicated $200 million in funding from our city residents. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why not? FRANCIS SUAREZ: We're -- that's a great question. You know, they have a great infrastructure czar, which is a former mayor of New Orleans, who was a president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, who we work with, but we still have not seen a penny of that money trickle down, peculate down to the cities, and we need it because, as I've said, we've dedicated a couple of hundred million dollars. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. FRANCIS SUAREZ: We've gotten about 30 or 40 million from the state. But we need significantly more than that as you've indicated in your initial comments. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there was this $2 trillion American Rescue Plan that passed back in the spring with zero Republican votes. Florida did benefit. Republican Governor DeSantis allocated over 400 million to help coastal communities in Florida. So, have you gotten that money in your hand? And how much more do you need exactly? FRANCIS SUAREZ: Yes, we have, actually. The American Rescue Plan, our budget (ph), as you describe it, it's coming in two tranches, 950 billion last year, 950 billion this year. And we have allocated it effectively. And we are trying to leverage the money that we have to do things like, you know, increasing our seawalls, tidal valves that prevent the black flow of water into our city during storm events, pump stations, which we have built more and more and are planning to build significantly more. So we are addressing the issue head on. And certainly the funding that we're going to be receiving from the state and from the federal government, hopefully, eventually, from the infrastructure bill, is critically needed for us to be able to tackle this problem and make sure that we have Miami Forever. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we mentioned you are a registered Republican. Mayor of the second largest city in Florida. When you were on this program last, back in January, you told me that you had repeatedly reached out to your governor, fellow Republican, to talk to him about health precautions you wanted to take in Miami, but you had no contact, no outreach. And I wonder what you think that says about Ron DeSantis' executive leadership in a time of crisis? FRANCIS SUAREZ: You know, we are - we're different. We have different perspectives and different personalities and different philosophies in terms of our leadership style. You know, we - you know, I - we -- I lead, like you said, the largest -- arguably the largest urban city in the state. And his mandate is significantly greater in terms of number, but it's also very different in terms of cities in rural areas. You know, so, you know, he -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Does he talk to you now? Does he talk to the mayor of the second largest city in the state? FRANCIS SUAREZ: We do. We have spoken on a variety of occasions. In fact, one of the ones that we spoke about recently happened to be about resiliency. We actually -- the state did give us about $40 million that we combined with the $200 million and we did a press conference together in Broward County. So, on the environment, I have to say, his record, over the last four years, including the legislature's record, has been very much pro-environment and something that he and I share. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about on issues of health? I mean when it comes to Covid, Florida's response has been heavily scrutinized. Monkeypox, right now, Florida has the third highest case count of any state in the country. Are you, in Miami, getting the vaccines you need? Are you getting the testing you need? Has that part of the health rollout working with the state been smooth? FRANCIS SUAREZ: You know, we're monitoring this outbreak, as you mentioned. I am not aware of any shortages in vaccines or testing at this particular juncture. None of it has been -- you know, come to my attention. But certainly we'll work with the state and certainly we'll work with the federal government to make sure that our city is protected and that those here get the necessary testing and vaccination to protect themselves against the monkeypox virus. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Mayor Suarez, thank you for your time today. And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Today marks five months since Russia launched a full- scale war on Ukraine. The invasion has cost tens of thousands of lives and it has roiled the global economy. For a look at where the fight stands now, we are joined by Ukraine' ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Madam Ambassador, it's good to have you back on the program. OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the U.S.): Good morning and thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what happened in the past 24 to 48 hours. There's an estimated 20 million metric tons of grain stuck in Ukraine, can't get out. This is contributing to food inflation and food shortages around the world. So less than 24 hours after signing this U.N. brokered deal to allow Ukraine's grain to export, Russia sent missiles into the Odessa port city where that grain would be transiting. This is what the State Department says. Your government said it's like spit in the face of the U.N. and Turkey. But you're sticking with the deal? Why? OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, what happened in the port is so Russian and it's very telling about what has been happening for the past eight years. For the past eight years, Ukraine always acted in good faith and tried everything possible and sometimes impossible to end the war and to return our sovereignty. Similar was this 151 days. We are defending. We are standing strong in defending our country. And, at the same time, we will find any options in order to resolve the crisis. It's like this food crisis that Russia has created for other countries, not only for Ukraine. So, we will do everything in order to perform and fulfill our part of the deal. Now, when Russia is violating it, they are clearly showing who they are and that they need to be stopped. MARGARET BRENNAN: So is Russia technically violating it? Because unnamed U.N. officials are quoted as saying they may not have --because Russia never pledged to avoid attacking the parts of the Ukrainian ports that are not directly used for grain exports. Really? That seems like a pretty big oversight. OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, let's call it what it is. Everything Russia is doing in Ukraine is a violation of pretty much every international law. Attacking a sovereign country is a violation. It's a war crime. So, we have the deal with U.N. and with our colleagues from Turkey. We are fulfilling the deal. They agreed also with Russia and they have to first stop the war, you know, and they have to do everything without even any initiative signs. But, with this, I think they're just showing their true face again. So, the good response to that should be more weapons to Ukraine so that we can defend ourselves, we can get them out from our country, and we can unblock our ports and unblock all Ukraine in order not only to ship the grain, but the sunflower and everything else that is being stuck in Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That impact your baby formula. OKSANA MARKAROVA: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: That impacts food stops (ph) for everything. But - but does this attack make it - make that food crisis worse? Will this hurt your ability to export what little is getting out? OKSANA MARKAROVA: We will do everything possible. And we are exporting even now, through the western border, of course, the capacity - MARGARET BRENNAN: Through land. OKSANA MARKAROVA: Through land, through railroads, through all possible ways. And we will continue doing so. Our farmers are even planting and harvesting under the fire. So, we will, as we defend the country, we will continue also to rebuild at the same time and plant and do everything possible to feed us and feed the world. Hopefully, and we see already good results of the new HIMARS and artillery being provided to us, that will allow us to go on to - on the counter offensive and free our territory, which we need to do not only for grain, but also to save our people. MARGARET BRENNAN: So your first lady was here in Washington and addressed Congress and specifically asked for air defense systems. We know the U.S. has pledged to send national advance surface-to-air missile systems, but they haven't actually arrived in Ukraine yet. Is that what she was referring to and what specifically are you asking for? OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes, very effective visit of the first lady and her message that -- while Russia kills, America saves, I think have been heard by everyone here. And, yes, we are talking about the (INAUDIBLE) and other air defense systems. We're also talking about more firepower, more artillery, more HIMARS, which just last Friday we heard the announcement of more coming. MARGARET BRENNAN: These are precision guided rockets? OKSANA MARKAROVA: Exactly. And we already see that with that equipment, that is very effectively used by our defenders, we are able to destroy the ammo dumps that Russia is creating on the uncontrolled territories and that we actually are moving into free and more territories in the south and, hopefully, with sufficient number of weapons, we can do the same in the east. But the situation remains very, very difficult still. MARGARET BRENNAN: It is. And we know now - U.S. intelligence says Russia controls about 20 percent of Ukraine. OKSANA MARKAROVA: That is correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to make sure that I bring this up with you because it was so deeply disturbing when I heard it. A State Department official, Ambassador Victoria Nuland, said, Russia makes orphans and then it steals orphans. She said up to 1,000 Ukrainian children have been stolen and given to Russian families. What exactly is happening? What can the U.S. government or the American people do about it? OKSANA MARKAROVA: It has been one of the key pleas of the first lady here on all uncontrolled territories, from Mariupol to other places, Russia is forcefully deporting not only adults and families, but specifically children. And Russians themselves already admitted that 350,000 children have been evacuated, as they say, but kidnapped. Let's call it the way -- what it is, to Russia. They have relaxed their own legislation in order to allow them to be adopted quickly into Russian families. This is a brutal violation, not only of international law, but of common decency. How can you steal our children and try to hide them somewhere in Russia? Only 47 children were able to return to Ukraine right now. And as of August 1st, Ukraine will be starting a platform, Children at War, which will allow people throughout the globe, including Russia, to add information they -- about all the children. It's our first priority to locate, find them and return them. And it's very difficult because we don't have control over this territories. MARGARET BRENNAN: And do you have any hope that you can actually return these children without the United States or other countries getting involved? OKSANA MARKAROVA: We need everyone who can to get involved. And I can assure you that everyone in Ukraine will not rest until all of them are located and returned. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you very much for your time. We'll be back in a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: We now want to turn to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. Thank you for joining us. GINA RAIMONDO (Secretary of Commerce): Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have been making this big push for this chips bill that would direct about 50 billion towards the semiconductor industry. Those are those computer chips and phones and dishwashers, weapons and basically everything. GINA RAIMONDO: In everything. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: The bill now also has about $200 billion in additional spending, which I understand you would play a role in helping to dole out in some way. For people at home, why should U.S. taxpayers subsidize a profitable industry? GINA RAIMONDO: Right now we are dangerously dependent on other countries, mostly in Asia, for our supply of semiconductor. We don't make any leading- edge semiconductors in the United States. And those are the sophisticated chips that you need for military equipment and high-end computing. We buy almost all of them from Taiwan. So, the reality is, we need companies to expand in America. And other countries around the world are providing incentives. MARGARET BRENNAN: But doesn't rolling out state subsidies of private industry create a dangerous precedent, or are you arguing we're just in a scenario where we need to start thinking of vital industries as partially state funded or subsidized? GINA RAIMONDO: Yes. What I'm saying is, this is a matter of national security and I don't think we can put a price tag on it because we are in a very vulnerable spot. So, if you talk to the military experts or the national defense contractors, you know, they'll tell you they need chips. There's 250 chips in a javelin launching system, and that's not as sophisticated as some of the new equipment. MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a long list of things Congress needs to get done in a very short period of time. GINA RAIMONDO: I understand that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you confident that the votes are actually there to get this passed? GINA RAIMONDO: Yes, I am. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sixteen Republicans voted to move along with this. GINA RAIMONDO: Yes. Sixteen Republicans. MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is still not done. And - and it's being tweaked here. So I want to ask you about some of the things that have been proposed. You have skeptics on both the right and the left for this, right? Bernie Sanders has said he doesn't like it. It's a blank check to profitable companies. Rick Scott of Florida, Republican, has compared it to corporate welfare. A former labor secretary from the Clinton administration called it pure extortion. That doesn't sound like this is truly bipartisan, as you called it. This sounds like this is fairly controversial. GINA RAIMONDO: No, I don't think so. I mean it's clearly bipartisan. You don't get 64 votes in the Senate every day, right? And -- MARGARET BRENNAN: On this final bill, you think, despite these detractors, it's going to pass? GINA RAIMONDO: This will be a big bipartisan vote in the House and the Senate. Yes, I believe so. Now, also I fully dispute Senator Sanders' characterization of this. It isn't a blank check. There are many strings attached. Strings attached, companies can't use this money to build facilities in other countries. Companies who accept this money can't then turn around and be building facilities in China for leading-edge technology. There's a lot of strings attached around, you know, the quality of jobs that have to be created, working with small contractors and minority-owned contractors. There are labor protections. So, to say it's a blank check is just dead wrong. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are those sufficient though? GINA RAIMONDO: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you have Marco Rubio of Florida coming out and arguing high-tech chip production should be further sort of restricted here on the national security portion. He says that corporations that receive the funding cannot expand chip production in China, but there are some things grandfathered in that are loopholes here. I mean are there other places you need to tighten up stricter export restrictions, for example? GINA RAIMONDO: Yes. We always have to be looking at our export controls. So, I would say, I feel very comfortable about this bill. It protects national security and protects taxpayers. Also - MARGARET BRENNAN: As written? GINA RAIMONDO: As written. As written. There are - there are taxpayer protections. It will be a competitive transparent process. And - and there's claw back provision. If we give the money to companies and they do what they're not supposed to, we're going to take the money back. I feel very confident around the taxpayer protections and the China guardrails. MARGARET BRENNAN: For other industries as well? GINA RAIMONDO For all technology. We have to do everything we can to make sure that our leading-edge technology, whether it's in chips or artificial intelligence or other areas, can't get into the hands of the Chinese. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're open to further export restrictions? GINA RAIMONDO: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: On Taiwan, because, you know, embedded in this is the assumption that Taiwan is at risk potentially of annexation by China. How confident are you when you get briefed by U.S. intelligence that this is an immediate threat? GINA RAIMONDO: I feel confident in saying it's not immediate and I feel also confident in saying that there's no crystal ball. But we need to be prepared. That's our job, to protect the American people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Has inflation peaked? GINA RAIMONDO: I think probably. But, look, if I had said that a year ago, you know, assuming another war doesn't break out, assuming we don't have another Covid, assuming - you know, there's so much out of our control. What -- inflation is being -- inflation is a global problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about climate. NOAA is under your purview. The climate agenda for the administration is completely stalled. Is the fact that you've been unable to unstick that climate agenda but you've moved this far with chips, does it signal to you that you need to make private industry a partner in this? GINA RAIMONDO: I would say yes, but business -- much of business is onboard. Like, let's be honest with ourselves. Climate-related events are more frequent, more dangerous, and more expensive than they've ever been. So, do we need to do more to get business onboard? Maybe. And it's, you know, something we are always wondering, how do we get things done in this divided political environment. But make no mistake about it. The climate investments that the president proposed are good for the economy and good for business. And business knows that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam secretary, thank you very much for coming in and talking to us today. GINA RAIMONDO: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Tune in next Sunday for our first CBS News battleground tracker poll on the upcoming midterm elections.

As we come on the air, the Russian war strategy appears to have undergone a major shift. Two weeks ago, the Russians were focused on surrounding the capital city of Kyiv. Now they have upped their assault in the eastern and southern parts of the country. Just this morning, Russian missiles have struck an oil refinery in the Ukrainian port city of Odessa. And there are reports of new explosions in the Russian border town of Belgorod, site of two other Ukrainian strikes last week. It's been a horrific scene since day one, but the atrocities of war are escalating. We warn you, some of the images you're about to see are disturbing. We begin today with Holly Williams reporting from Dnipro, Ukraine. (Begin VT) HOLLY WILLIAMS (voice-over): Russian forces have pulled back from around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and Ukraine says it's retaken more than 30 towns and villages. But what the Russian troops have left behind is sheer horror. In the town of Bucha, the streets are littered with bodies. Some, with their hands tied behind their back, appear to have been executed. Others are buried in a mass grave. More than 300 residents were killed, according to the mayor. (VASILI SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) HOLLY WILLIAMS: Vasili (sp?) survived it, but the trauma of what he witnessed is written on his face. (VASILI SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) HOLLY WILLIAMS: He calls the Russian soldiers dogs and says he took cover in his cellar for two weeks. Ukrainian soldiers are removing the dead with caution, fearful they could be booby-trapped with explosives. Ukrainian officials say these images show the naked corpses of at least four women on a highway outside Kyiv. They claim the Russians tried to burn the bodies. Despite the devastation, it seems Vladimir Putin's original battle plan has failed in the face of Ukraine's resistance, and Russian forces are shifting their attention to the east of this country. Gostomel Airport, just north of Kyiv, where Russian paratroopers landed on the first day of the invasion, is also back in Ukrainian hands. A visiting Ukrainian politician was upbeat. OLEKSIY GONCHARENKO (Ukrainian Parliament Member): We will rebuild our country. We will rebuild our dream. Our country will be beautiful, prosperous, and Russia will pay for everything they did. HOLLY WILLIAMS: But many parts of this country are still occupied. (EXPLOSION) HOLLY WILLIAMS: Ukraine says Russian forces opened fire yesterday on civilian protesters in the city of Enerhodar. And in the besieged city of Mariupol, bombarded for weeks by the Russians, around 100,000 people are thought to be trapped. Evacuation efforts are ongoing. The United Nations believes thousands may have died in Mariupol, but the true number can't be counted while the city is cut off and under Russian assault. (End VT) HOLLY WILLIAMS: A Ukrainian official said yesterday that a meeting between President Putin and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was likely to happen soon. But, today, Russia's chief negotiator shot that idea down -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Holly Williams, thank you. We go now to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He joins us from Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Good afternoon, sir. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (Ukrainian President) (through translator): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. President, Russian forces appear to be withdrawing from the north of Ukraine. Do you think this means Putin's calculus is changing? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): Thank you for this question. You know, Margaret, we -- they have pulled out from some localities. In others, they are redoing the redeployment, because the conflict, the situation is difficult. There were some communities that they were trying to take several times. And this is a tragedy, because our army had to take back as well, So the city of Chornobaivka, nine times, they attempted to take it over. But we think this is the redeployment, in our opinion. They're changing the tactics now. They were trying to take Kyiv and some cities in Kyiv region. Some of them have been occupied, and then they destroyed everything. The civilians, the houses, they were stealing washing machines and equipment. So, there were torturers as well. I think the clips that we shared with you, you have seen for yourself. It's important for the free people of the United States to have a look at it and understand and see for themselves. Before the war, when there was a lot of free time, we were watching different films, and also war movies, but we couldn't have imagined anything like this, because this is a maniac type of decision to just -- to destroy the whole nation. Well, in terms of the tactics and them pulling out and what the strategy of the -- of Putin is, they are now focusing in the east of Ukraine. So, this corridor, which is going from the Crimea to the east of Ukraine, this is in the south of Ukraine. And this is where they are trying to focus in terms of armament, in terms of deploying their personnel, the Chechen troops occupying the cities. They were bringing people in from different parts of the world, because they were in deficit of their personnel. And now they are grouping all of these troops in the south and east of our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: The images you're talking about have been described by leaders around the world as horrific. The mayor of Kyiv used the term genocide. Your vice prime minister is asking if this is fascism or genocide, in terms of what has been left around Kyiv. Do you feel that the world will actually make good on this promise to hold Vladimir Putin to account for war crimes? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): Everything has to be fair and according to justice, as the civilized world will decide. We believe in justice, in the justice of the Western world, of -- and, therefore, the question is not only about the leader of Russian Federation. We wouldn't think that it would be fair to take only him. I think all the military commanders, everyone who gave instructions and orders should be punished adequately. The adequate punishment to these people is difficult to be achieved. It has to be done according to the law and what they have done. And I want to apologize to you and to those people who are watching us now, but, for some things that they have done, when we find people with -- with hands tied behind their back and decapitated, such things, I don't understand, I don't comprehend, the kids who were killed and tortured. So it wasn't enough just to kill for those criminals. Maybe they wanted to take gold or washing machines. And they were killing them, but they were also torturing them as they did this. And your question is absolutely fair, but I don't have the answer. I don't know what law or what imprisonment term would be adequate for this. As the father of two children, and as a president, I think that these people, if they are put behind the bars, this is one too little for what they have done. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this genocide? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): Indeed, this is genocide, the elimination of the whole nation and the people. We are the citizens of Ukraine. We have more than 100 nationalities. This is about the destruction and extermination of all these nationalities. We are the citizens of Ukraine. And we don't want to be subdued to the policy of Russian Federation. This is the reason we are being destroyed and exterminated, and this is happening in the Europe of the 21st century. So this is the torture of the whole nation. MARGARET BRENNAN: In the Donbass southeast area of your country, the city of Mariupol, are you having any success getting civilians out? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): Many people, many thousands of people have been evacuated. In certain cities, 35,000, 30,000, 40,000 have been evacuated, so altogether, hundreds of thousands. But, nevertheless, there are -- still hundreds of thousand remain blocked. Some of them are blocked or behind the bars. To answer to your question about Mariupol, before the beginning of this full-fledged war and the occupation of Mariupol, there have been lots of people. And all the corridors have been blocked, including humanitarian corridors, the supply of food and water. So, in this city now, there is 150,000, lots of dead bodies in the street, lots of wounded people among the military and civilians. The evacuation happens only when the Russian side agrees to a Ukrainian proposal to open a corridor. So, the corridor for the food or water simply do not exist in those cities that are occupied by Russia. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. President, your team shared with us a video, images that your government has gathered of what has been left behind outside of Kyiv that I do want to share with our viewers. And I want to ask you about it. Looking and listening to what Vladimir Putin has said, he's called Ukraine not a real country. He said it's controlled by little Nazis. He's called you a drug-addled thug. Is he someone you can negotiate with? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): As the president of Ukraine, there cannot be just my personal view about President Putin and a dialogue with the Russian Federation. I have to stand for the interests of my country. So, it's difficult to say how, after all, what has been done, we can have any kind of negotiations with Russia. That's on the personal level. But, as a president, I have to do it. Any war has to end, just end. I'm not talking about ending this with peace, because peace in this situation, when there are thousands of people killed, is something that I'm not fine with. But there is no any other way. This, I'm saying as a president. There's no any other way, but the dialogue, if we don't want hundreds of thousands, millions to die. But it's important to have the agreement between the two sides and understanding or at least the desire to understand that we need to have a dialogue, because we're going to stand until the end. And they have to understand this. So, I'm -- keep talking about this dialogue, something that I have been repeating throughout my term as a president. MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of security guarantees, the United States has given security assurances to Ukraine in the past, and that did not stop this invasion. When you recently spoke with President Biden, did he make you any kind of concrete promise that the U.S. and NATO wouldn't let this happen to Ukraine again? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): So, we don't believe in papers any longer. So, we are very grateful for the support of the United States, indeed, and it's a very powerful support. But in terms of security guarantees, we have not received them yet from anyone. And we have to get them. For us, it is important also what the circle of countries who will be providing the security guarantees is going to be and how specifically this will be enforced. So I'm not, as a president, satisfied with just assurance, because then I don't know what the agreement is going to be about and whether we will have an agreement with Russia. What are we going to agree about? Who are going to be the guarantors? Because if, tomorrow, the war starts again, and only sanctions will have been introduced, well, that's about nothing, because sanctions are important. But if they cannot stop the aggression, then we don't need such guarantees. MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia seems very interested in this resource-rich part of Eastern Ukraine. I wonder, will you settle for anything less than a full withdrawal of Russian troops from every inch of Ukrainian soil? PRESIDENT VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY (through translator): This is the bare minimum that we have to start the deoccupation with. It should be 100 percent withdrawal of troops to the borders that existed prior to the 24th of February at least. This would make us to at least to start discussing other questions about the deoccupation, about how do we live -- live on after this. We have our dialogue with them. So, I can't even have a meeting when the shelling is going on, so, first, the cease-fire. Then we can have a meeting with the Russian president. If they have the -- an approach that they -- he's making these authoritarian decisions, why do we need this bloodshed, drama performance for? Let's simply sit down together, the two of us. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You can watch the full interview on our Web site, FacetheNation.com. We will be back in one minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to former National Security Council Senior Director for European and Russian affairs, Fiona Hill. She's also the author of \"There Is Nothing For You Here.\" Glad to have you back with us. FIONA HILL (Former National Security Council Official): Thanks, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: It was extraordinary to have this conversation with President Zelenskyy, particularly at this moment, as these images emerge of what has happened, the devastation in and around Kiev. He's talking about looting. There are reports of mass rape, mass graves. Is this how the Russian military always behaves? FIONA HILL: Well, this is clearly not a special military operation, is it, when we see all of these images. And, unfortunately, it's following a pattern that goes back historically. I mean, look, a lot of this wasn't talked about so much after World War II, but when the Red Army moved into Berlin, there was mass rape of German women in the city. And, obviously, in the wake of World War II, people didn't really want to talk about that so much, given all the atrocities that were committed by German forces and the Nazis. We've got these reports of looting in other settings as well, in Chechnya. Also, in Georgia, when the Russian military moved in, in 2008, there was a lot of wanton destruction of Georgian equipment, reports of, like, deliberate defecation on the equipment, for example, I mean, almost like stupid stuff that was basically meant to show unbelievable disrespect. But, look, we see in many wartime scenarios all the way through history, these kinds of reports. But if this was genuinely a special military operation to liberate a fraternal country from what Putin was describing as Nazis, you would not expect this kind of conduct. So, either this is a complete breakdown of command and control, or it's actually being sanctioned in some way to teach Ukrainians a lesson. Either way, this is actually pretty disastrous and obviously requires some kind of serious response in the international community. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the United States expected Russia to launch an entire electronic warfare blackout in Ukraine when they did this. They haven't. And, in fact, one of President Zelenskyy's most powerful tools is his ability to continue to communicate in the middle of this and to show these images to the world. Was this a big strategic failure by Vladimir Putin? I mean, why is he allowing this? FIONA HILL: Well, it's a really good question, isn't it? I mean, is it because they actually proved not to have the capacity? Is it that the Ukrainians are pushing back? Because there's a lot of very technically savvy Ukrainians, a lot of companies. There's obviously a lot of assistance that they're getting from the outside world. I mean, we've heard assistance from Elon Musk, for example. A lot of it's coming from individuals, not just from governments. But there's been a lot of strategic blunders by the Russian government in this campaign. Clearly, there's lots of things that they didn't expect, first of all, that the campaign has gone on much longer. Second, they haven't been able to decapitate the Ukrainian government. They haven't taken Kiev. We've seen instead that they've just basically wreaked havoc and carnage all over the place, that they're engaging in acts not just of what appear to be war crimes, which we're now in the process of documenting, but of wanton destruction and this crazy looting that you're seeing taking place. I mean, this is really, I think, raising a lot of questions about this much vaunted Russian military that we all actually expected to perform in a much better fashion across the board. And, clearly, if the information has not been filtering up to Vladimir Putin, as we've been hearing, from his commanders, this must be something of a shock to the system for him as well, which actually then raises a lot of questions about, what is he going to do next? MARGARET BRENNAN: Why is Vladimir Putin so concerned with the Donbass region, the eastern region? FIONA HILL: Well, this is the place that he first got a grip on in 2014 after annexing Crimea. I mean, we know that, in 2014 that the Russian government, Putin in particular, had bigger ambitions. He talked about this region of Novorossiya, which extends from the Donbass region all the way through all of these port cities on the Sea of Azov that we've seen completely devastated, Melitopol, Mariupol, Berdyansk, for example, to Kherson, another of the cities that they've seized, and then all the way down to Odessa, where we're getting reports now that they're fighting -- or, rather, starting to shell Odessa and raising the question of fighting. This is a whole area that was seized by the Russian empire under Catherine the Great. Putin's talked about it repeatedly. And, for him, this zone now of Southern Ukraine along the Black Sea, across the top of the Crimean Peninsula, the Sea of Azov, extending to Donbass, seems to be the area that he's wanting to make sure that he has a hold of, no matter what. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to put up a map here, because we keep hearing that much of the world is picking a side in this conflict against Russia. But, actually, it's really just Europe. It's the Americas. It's the West, Japan. Is the world actually really lining up against him, or does he have quite a lifeline still? FIONA HILL: Well, he does still have a lifeline. This is what's really problematic. I mean, the one thing that we have to be very careful about now, I mean, I know that President Zelenskyy is really making a massive appeal for more help from the United States, from the West, from NATO, and from other allies, the European Union. But we really need to get other international actors to step up. We've had Japan and South Korea, for example. There's been protestations about the conflict in the United Nations General Assembly from countries like Ghana and Kenya. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. FIONA HILL: But there needs to be more, because Russia wants to portray this as a proxy war between the United States and Russia for Ukraine. That is not what this is. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about that on the other side of this break. Stay with us, Fiona Hill. We'll have to take this quick break. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR, or we're available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. And we're replayed on our CBS News Streaming Network at 12:00 noon Eastern. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with Russia expert and former top White House adviser Fiona Hill, as well as former National Security Adviser to President Trump H.R. McMaster, plus Congressman Jamie Raskin with the latest on January 6. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to continue our conversation with Fiona Hill, former top adviser on Russia at the National Security Council during the Trump administration. You know, Fiona, this is really these two personalities, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin. And it's all about trying to change Putin's mind. At this point, is there any succession plan if he is no longer running Russia? HILL: Well, there's always a succession plan, at least in theory, which is, you know, something happens to him normally, then either the prime minister or the speaker of the Russian parliament would step in and they would elections. Now, under this current circumstances, there is just absolutely no way that Vladimir Putin wants to loosen his grip on power. 2024 he's supposed to have the presidential election. In theory, as we know, he's got two more presidential terms that he can contest. And that would take him out till 2036. And Putin has, if anything, some staying power. He's pretty much determined to stay in place. And there is absolutely no way that he would want to go out on the back -- in any way on the back of a disaster in Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is, in some ways, solidifying his hold on power rather than weakening it? FIONA HILL: Absolutely. From his perspective. Now, it doesn't mean to say, of course, that that hold is fully consolidated. It's very brittle, the situation right now. So many things can go wrong. So many things could be happening behind the scenes that we actually don't know about. But for Putin himself, the absolute last thing he wants to do is go out in the backdrop of protests, backdrop of a failed war, as other previous leaders in Russian history have. And there's no way that he's going to entertain any kind of idea of a palace coup. He knows the history. He knows how these things work. And the immediate group of people around him who helped plot this war are also going to rise and fall with him. So you can be sure that they're trying to root out any kind of descent, any kind of opposition at the moment. And also on the popular level. I mean we're hearing in public opinion polls that there's a lot of support for Putin. I mean it's hard to, you know, kind of really gauge again how deep that support is. People are rallying around the flag, rallying around him, rallying around the Kremlin. And he's going to make sure, of course, that any kind of alternate views are completely and utterly suppressed at this moment. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've written extensively about Putin. I know President Biden has read your book on him. One of the things you write about is what's happened in the past with cease-fire agreements in Chechnya. And that's why I asked about security guarantees with President Zelenskyy. In the past, Russia has torn up peace agreements, just reinvaded. Is that what Volodymyr Zelenskyy is looking at now, the risk of that? FIONA HILL: Yes. I mean he has to be very serious about this. And as he said, they're fed up now on the Ukrainian side with paper agreements. They have to have something real and concrete. And that's going to be what's going to be difficult because you can't just be from the United States either. The previous agreement, the Budapest Agreement, was with the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia. And obviously that was in 1994 when Ukraine gave up a strategic nuclear weapons. That became pretty meaningless. And so what Zelenskyy is looking for, obviously, as he said, is some pretty concrete guarantees from a range of countries. He talked about the circle of countries that might be involved. And it has to be outside of Europe as well. This is part of the problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. FIONA HILL: As Putin is making this a proxy war, he's saying to everyone else, this is like the Cold War, this is like Korea or Vietnam. This is not the case. Putin has decided to invade a neighboring country. It's a post- imperial land grab. It's based on history, his grievances, his view of Russia's place in Europe. And basically it has to be addressed in an international content. So they need wide-ranging international security guarantees. MARGARET BRENNAN: It is a global problem now. FIONA HILL: It is. MARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, thank you for your analysis. I want to get more from former National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster. He's also CBS News foreign policy national security contributor and host of the podcast \"Battlegrounds.\" Good morning to you, H.R. Tactically and strategically speaking, why would Russian forces move to the east? H.R. MCMASTER: Well, to try to get something out of this, right, and to try to -- to try to compensate for the utter failure of the offensive initially. It's quite clear that Russia has failed from the very beginning in connection with its original object, to subjugate all of Ukraine and to effect this kudumaine (ph) oriented -- on these four axis but mainly on Kyiv and Odessa. And what you see is a concentration now in the Donbas region and in the south. It's interesting, Margaret, we haven't heard too much talk about this, but this is about 10 percent of the Ukrainian land mass, but about -- the land mass that holds about 90 percent of Ukraine's energy resources. And I think what you see Russia as having a strategic design in mind, as Fiona mentioned, this is about an (INAUDIBLE) and so forth, but it's also making the Sea of Azov clearly a Russian lake, and the Black -- the Black Sea as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, I thought it was interesting that President Zelenskyy said, when I asked him, does this mean, you know, 100 percent withdrawal from all of Ukrainian territory, and he said, Russia needs to withdraw to the borders pre-February 24th. So that would mean potentially those eastern Donetsk and Luhansk areas and Crimea. Is that significant to you the way he phrased that? H.R. MCMASTER: It is significant. It means that, you know, he's willing to compromise to a certain extent. But I think that's got to be up to him and the Ukrainian people. You've seen the horrors, the devastation, the -- I've heard your conversation, which is just -- it was just terrible, with Zelenskyy and the horrors that they're confronting now in the wake of the - - of the Russian withdrawal. You know, I think that it's going to be up to the Ukrainian people, obviously, if they're willing to compromise at all after that. And it's hard to imagine that they will want to, to give up any of their territory. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, well -- H.R. MCMASTER: And, of course, Margaret, hey, I think the other point about this is, you know, of course Zelenskyy knows that wouldn't be the end, right? MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. H.R. MCMASTER: If Vladimir Putin says I'll, you know, return back to the pre-February borders, of course what he'll do is try to keep Ukraine under his thumb and under continuous duress, just as he has since at least 2003 and especially after 2014. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and it's exactly what you just put your finger on there that has the surrounding European countries so concerned, that he could continue to de-stabilize the area. But I want to ask you about that. Why would Putin risk bringing a NATO country into a war that is being described as one where his military is failing? Is the U.S. and Europe making him ten feet tall when he's not? H.R. MCMASTER: Yes, I think so. I think -- I think -- I think Putin is really on the ropes here. And, of course, the all -- what does he have left, Margaret? He only -- he only has left are threats. Cyber-threats? Well, that's not working out for some reason. I think we'll -- we'll learn more about that later. But then the only thing he can do is rattle his nuclear saber, which is what he's done. And, of course, that's a cause for concern. But I think we have to -- to not forget the don't part of don't take council of our fears. And I think at this stage what we're seeing, where we confront the horrors and the mass murder that is -- that occur -- has occurred and the horrible abuses, I think we feel now compelled to do more. Well, I think what we shouldn't do is wait any longer to do what it takes to give Ukraine all the tools necessary to fully beat back this offensive, and to make it clear to the Russians that they're going to be unable to renew an offensive in the future. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to be really clear with our viewers, since you -- you served in the military for so long. What we are describing and what is being documented as having happened outside Kyiv is very far beyond the acceptable code of conduct for U.S. military forces. Can you just put that in context for anyone who would say war is always bloody, how do you see what happened? H.R. MCMASTER: Well, this is the -- that's a -- this is an unprofessional force. This is a force that is not adhering to the basic military ethic or the law of war or just war theory. Just (ph) in bellow (ph) theory requires you to apply force with discipline and discrimination, and to protect non- combatants. Of course, Russia actually -- its tactic was to commit mass murder against non-combatants because it didn't have the military competence to accomplish its objectives through fire and maneuver and the defeat of the opposing military force and then the -- then the control of that territory. So this is -- this is against the law of war. It's against -- it's against the military ethic. And it's against what we have in our armed forces. The -- you know, the professional warrior ethos, which is based on principles, such as honor and self-sacrifice. And that also includes taking on more risk ourselves to protect innocents, even -- even in an activity that involves killing and the prospect of death. MARGARET BRENNAN: H.R. McMaster, thank you for your analysis today. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week CBS News and \"The Washington Post\" revealed that internal White House records from January the 6th showed a seven-hour gap in President Trump's call logs during the violence at the Capitol that day. Maryland Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin is on the House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol and joins us here now. Welcome to FACE THE NATION. REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: This seven-hour gap, you have subpoenaed the president's -- the former president's assistance, Molly Michael. I know you've been trying to figure out from staff what happened. Do you have any insight? JAMIE RASKIN: Well, it's a very unusual thing for us to find, that suddenly everything goes dark for a seven-hour period in terms of tracking the movements and the conversations of the president. And some things we've been able to piece together from other people's interviews and depositions that we know took place during that time. We are aware of other phone calls that took place during that time that included the president. But we have no comprehensive fine grain, the portrait of what was going on during that period. And that's, obviously, of intense interest to us. MARGARET BRENNAN: You still don't have that after debriefing some of these assistants? I mean his office, the former president's office was known for being sloppy. He used cell phones. She wasn't -- the personal assistant wasn't in the office that day. Is there a chance here that this was just sort of large-scale incompetence rather than conspiracy? JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we're taking that possibility into account. It does seem like the gaps are suspiciously tailored to the heart of the events. But we're checking that out. And, you know, our mandate under HR-503 is to get a complete picture of everything that took place on January 6th, the causes leading up to it, and then what we need to do as a country to fortify democratic institutions and processes against future insurrections and coups and attempts to destabilize and overthrow our elections. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean that's just an incredible phrase, potential future coups. JAMIE RASKIN: Well, -- MARGARET BRENNAN: It's breathtaking to hear you say it that way. JAMIE RASKIN: Congressman Mo Brooks said just a week or two ago that president -- former President Trump continues to try to get him and other Republicans to rescind the election. In other words, he continues to look for a way to nullify an election that he considers fraudulent. Last night, you know, I was at the Gridiron Club dinner and I saw the governor, the Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, who I thought was a huge breath of fresh air. He said publicly -- he broke tradition apparently in the Gridiron Club, he said, Donald Trump is f-ing crazy. And he didn't say f-ing. So I don't want to make any history on your show. But he also seemed to announce that he was going to run for president in 2024, laying down the gauntlet essentially against the Trump/Putin axis within the Republican Party. MARGARET BRENNAN: So -- you're ear piece just dropped out there. But you can hear me. JAMIE RASKIN: So -- yes, even though I didn't say the word. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you can hear me. I mean, are you concerned that at the end of this investigation you're not going to find what it sounds like you're looking for, which is substantiation of a -- of a link between a pressure campaign to change the election results and the events of January 6th itself? I mean are you confident you'll get that and you will be able to make a criminal referral to the Justice Department? JAMIE RASKIN: Well, no, I think you've put your finger on it. I mean we know there were two things going on. And one was a violent insurrection that included a mob riot which injured 150 of our officers with broken jaws and broken necks and broken vertebrae and so on, and then -- that was led by domestic violent extremist groups, like the Proud Boys, who, you know, then President Trump had told to stand back and stand by, the Oath Keepers, the three percenters, people who have been charged with seditious conspiracy, which means conspiracy to overthrow the government. They shut down the counting of electoral college votes for the first time in American history. It didn't even happen when Lincoln took -- took the presidency in 1861. OK, so there was that violent insurrection. But then there was an attempt at an inside coup, what the political scientists call a self-coup, not a coup against a president, but a coup that's orchestrated by the president against the constitutional system. And what we're looking for is the connections between the inside political coup and the violent insurrection. And I do feel confident we're going to be able to tell that story. MARGARET BRENNAN: But -- tell that story is different in the political context from making a criminal recommendation or a legal proceeding at the Justice Department. JAMIE RASKIN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you confident that will happen? JAMIE RASKIN: Well, we will lay out the evidence that we see. Now, understand, the role of the January 6th select committee is to deliver a report to the American people and to the Congress. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. JAMIE RASKIN: And so individual criminal accountability is something that comes within the domain of the Department of Justice. MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. That's why I wanted to make that clear. JAMIE RASKIN: Yes. And one of the traditions we want to rebuild that was torn down during the last administration was of not having members of Congress and the president trying to dictate policy to the Department of Justice. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well -- JAMIE RASKIN: And that's what the last president did. And I'm glad this president's not doing it. And we don't want to be part of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: How long is too long? Because we keep hearing that the public hearings are getting pushed off. Is it May? Is it June? When do you cut this off? JAMIE RASKIN: I think we're -- I think that the hearings should be in early May. That's what I'm hoping for. Obviously we're up against a lot of obstruction. Now, this week we voted to bring contempt citations against Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right. JAMIE RASKIN: The social media guy for him, and Peter Navarro was the trade adviser who, for some reason, was off involving himself in insurrectionary coup plotting activities. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that -- JAMIE RASKIN: Those guys are claiming executive privilege, which is absurd. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that vote is going to be happening this week, as we understand it. JAMIE RASKIN: We hope so, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back with more FACE THE NATION in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the stunning increase in violent crime. And fighting that increase is one of the top priorities for New York City's new mayor, Eric Adams. Good morning to you, Mr. Mayor. Good to have you in studio. ERIC ADAMS, NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: Thank you. Good to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: New York City has, what, the highest number of shootings in a decade, more than 40 percent spike in homicides over the last two years. You have some of the toughest gun laws in the country. Where are all these weapons coming from? ERIC ADAMS: That's a great question. And in my conversation with the president and the chief of staff yesterday, we talked about just a flow of guns through our inner cities. A few days ago I was in Chicago with Mayor Lightfoot, who took several -- thousands of guns off her street last year. And here in New York we're doing the same. We really have to have a combination. We have to stop the flow of guns, but we must also do the job of getting the guns off the streets that's on there now. And my anti-gun unit, they're doing that. Just a few weeks out, they removed over 20 something guns off the street. But here's the interesting number, 70 percent of those who were carrying the guns had prior violent offenses. So, we need to combine with that small number of people who are carrying guns with the large number of guns on our street and get both off our streets. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know that acknowledging that and having some of the toughest gun laws in the country will have critics say, well, look, it makes no difference if you have tight gun laws. ERIC ADAMS: Well, I tell those critics, go visit that 13-year-old boy that was shot yesterday while sitting in the back of a car. We need to stop criticizing good, proper law enforcement with the proper proactive things to keep guns out of the hands of young people. And that's the combination that we're going to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: So why aren't the laws working? ERIC ADAMS: For a number of reasons. We have a small number of gun dealers that are just skating the law. We're dealing with a problem with ghost guns. It's imperative that we come up with clear messages about ghost guns, and the kits that assemble them. And I believe Washington is going to do that. Then we need to put money into the ATF so they can do the proper information sharing so we can identify the flow of guns in the inner cities. And that is what we're doing in New York with our combined efforts of all law enforcement agencies. MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're expecting more executive actions or orders from the president to do this, because none of it's going to get through Congress. ERIC ADAMS: Well, it's the combination. I think executive orders are crucial. But while we're waiting for the president and the White House to continue to do the good things they're doing, I have to do the things we must do on the grounds in New York City. And that's what we're doing. My officers are stepping up with quality of life issues, and we're zeroing in on dangerous gangs and zeroing in on those who are trigger pullers and carrying guns. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that. You called it quality of life. It's quality of life enforcement. You, yourself, have been quite critical of past mayors when they have used tactics known as like broken windows, right, going after these sort of smaller-scale crimes. Quality of life includes offenses that are precursors to violence, marijuana sales, public urination, things like that. Aren't these the same zero tolerance policies that in the past have been exploited and caused civil rights violations? ERIC ADAMS: Oh, and I'm glad that you -- you know, you pointed out the history, because this is my history of fighting against heavy-handed and abusive policing. You can have the justice that we deserve with the safety we need. Here's what we talk about when we say quality of life. Not allowing someone to go into a store, steal what they want, and then walk out. Jump in the turn styles, not paying your fares in the subway system. Many of the criminal element, they are actually going into the subway system without paying their fare and committing crimes. We learned that during the mid-'90s, in the early '90s. But also looking at just open drug use. Inject yourself with heroin in our parks, in front of our children. Loud noise, just being disorderly. Some of the things we're doing around encampment. You don't have to use police to remove the encampments in our city, like we're doing. We're doing a combination of social services, giving people the dignity they deserve. That is what we talk about. Cleaning our streets and making sure that we don't have a state of disorder. MARGARET BRENNAN: But all of what you're lying out, no one's for those things, but they're concerned that this is just dressing back up the broken windows theory, that you're doing the same thing but relabeling it. ERIC ADAMS: Well, I think that is important for people to say, well, let's look at who's implementing the proper use of dealing with quality of life. Eric Adams, I was the leading voice that testified in federal court about the overuse of police tactics. Now I'm in charge of that police department, and I know how we can run a police department with a great police commissioner, Commissioner Sule (ph), where we're going to make sure we don't have disorder in our city, but we're going to lawfully show people that this is a city where the quality of life is important. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have said things like you won't tolerate bystanders being on top of police officers to film their activities. Isn't the public reporting, eyewitness accounts like this, exactly what has stopped or at least laid bare violations such as the killing of George Floyd? Isn't that kind of public reporting important? MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And let me tell you what I've done throughout the -- my years. I've done something called what to do when stopped by the police, how to film police, how to do it properly. Nothing is more dangerous than if a police officer is fighting with someone that has a gun, and you have a person standing over him taping that interaction. That is extremely dangerous. That officer is not aware of who's behind him. May days that I've fought with individuals who were carrying weapons or knives and I've had people stand over me with a camera, that is extremely dangerous because you don't know what you have. So what we're saying to New Yorkers, film. And regarding the case, the young man filmed a safe distance away. He did not interrupt or interfere. That is how you film. You don't do that. That endangers yourself or that police officer who's taking action. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Mayor, thank you for your time today. ERIC ADAMS: Thank you. Good seeing you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Today we say a fond farewell to Greg \"Scooter\" Shaffir, who is retiring from CBS News after almost 40 years.

A court earlier unanimously dismissed the No. 1-ranked tennis player's challenge to cancel his visa. Djokovic, a 34-year-old from Serbia, said he was \"extremely disappointed\" by the ruling but respected it. A masked Djokovic was photographed in an Melbourne airport lounge with two government officials in black uniforms. He left on an Emirates flight to Dubai, the same United Arab Emirates city he flew to Australia from. He has won a record nine Australian Open titles, including three in a row, but this time won't even get the chance to try. \"I respect the Court's ruling and I will cooperate with the relevant authorities in relation to my departure from the country,\" he said in a statement. Djokovic said he was \"uncomfortable\" that the focus had been on him since his visa was first canceled on arrival at Melbourne airport on January 6. \"I hope that we can all now focus on the game and tournament I love,\" he said. The national federation that runs the tournament, Tennis Australia, said it respects the decision of the Federal Court. \"We look forward to a competitive and exciting Australian Open 2022 and wish all players the best of luck,\" it said in a statement. A deportation order also usually includes a three-year ban on returning to Australia. In Serbia, President Aleksandar Vucic said the hearing was \"a farce with a lot of lies.\" \"They think that they humiliated Djokovic with this 10-day harassment, and they actually humiliated themselves. If you said that the one who was not vaccinated has no right to enter, Novak would not come or would be vaccinated,\" Vucic told reporters. He said he told Djokovic after talking to him \"that we can't wait to see him in Serbia, to return to his country, to come where he is always welcome.\" He did not say whether Djokovic said he would first go to Serbia after his deportation. Chief Justice James Allsop said the ruling came down to whether the minister's decision was \"irrational or legally unreasonable.\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison welcomed what he described as the \"decision to keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe.\" But opposition spokesperson on the home affairs portfolio, Kristina Keneally, said Djokovic was being deported for what he said and did publicly overseas before the government gave him a visa in November. \"This mess isn't a failure of our laws. It's a failure of Morrison's competence & leadership,\" Keneally tweeted. The pandemic response has become politically charged with Morrison's conservative coalition seeking a fourth three-year term at elections due by May. Infection rates have soared across much of Australian since December when Morrison's government relaxed what had been some of the democratic world's toughest restrictions on international travel. The court process that Djokovic had hoped would keep his aspirations alive for a 21st Grand Slam title was extraordinarily fast by Australian standards. Within three hours of Hawke's announcement on Friday afternoon that Djokovic's visa was canceled, his lawyers went before a Federal Circuit and Family Court judge to initiate their challenge to the decision. The case was elevated to the Federal Court on Saturday and submissions were filed by both sides that same day. The three judges heard the case over five hours on Sunday and announced their verdict two hours later. There was evidence that Djokovic was to be deported based on Hawke's assessment that he was considered a \"talisman of a community of anti-vaccination sentiment.\" Hawke's lawyer Stephen Lloyd took aim at Djokovic's anti-vaccination stance and his \"history of ignoring COVID safety measures.\" Lloyd raised the example of Djokovic giving a French newspaper journalist an interview last month while he was infected with COVID-19 and taking off his mask during a photo shoot. Djokovic has acknowledged the interview was an error of judgment. The minister canceled the visa on the grounds that Djokovic's presence in Australia may be a risk to the health and \"good order\" of the Australian public and \"may be counterproductive to efforts at vaccination by others in Australia.\" Djokovic's visa was initially canceled on January 6 by a border official who decided he didn't qualify for a medical exemption from Australia's rules for unvaccinated visitors. He was exempted from the tournament's vaccine rules because he had been infected with the virus within the previous six months. Vasek Pospisil, a Canadian who won the 2014 Wimbledon men's doubles title and has worked with Djokovic to form an association to represent players,\u00a0tweeted: \"There was a political agenda at play here with the (Australian) elections coming up which couldn't be more obvious. This is not his fault. He did not force his way into the country and did not 'make his own rules'; he was ready to stay home.\" Pospisil wrote that Djokovic wouldn't have tried to go to Australia at all and \"been home with his family\" had he not received the medical exemption. Djokovic has won nine Australian Open titles, including three in a row, and a total of 20 Grand Slam singles trophies, tied with rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most in the history of men's tennis. Djokovic's dominance of late has been particularly impressive, winning four of the last seven major tournaments and finishing as the runner-up at two others. The only time he did not get at least to the final in that span was at the 2020 U.S. Open, where he was disqualified in the fourth round for hitting a ball that inadvertently hit a line judge in the throat after a game. Because Djokovic has withdrawn from the tournament after Monday's schedule was released, he has been replaced in the field by what's known as a \"lucky loser\" \u2014 a player who loses in the qualifying tournament but gets into the main draw because of another player's exit before competition has started. That player is Italian Salvatore Caruso, who is ranked 150th in the world.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence rolled out a Republican policy platform on Thursday ahead of the midterm elections \u2014 and possibly his own 2024 presidential bid.\u00a0 Pence's \"Freedom Agenda\" platform, released through his nonprofit group Advancing American Freedom, entails rolling back taxes and regulations, securing the border, and energy independence, as well as standing \"strong against Russia\" and \"confronting communist China.\" The platform makes little mention of former President Trump, who has lambasted Pence over the 2020 presidential election certification and said voters wouldn't \"accept\" Pence as a 2024 vice presidential candidate.\u00a0 The platform has a heavy cultural element to it as well, what Pence calls the \"American culture pillar,\" and includes a pledge to \"save women and protect women's sports\" by \"ensuring that sports competitions are between those who share their God-given gender.\" The platform also aims to reform big tech, and prevent censorship by social media platforms, a key conservative cause in recent years.\u00a0 \"The Freedom Agenda presents a bold agenda focused on the future and offers a clear and compelling choice to the American people,\" Pence said in a statement. \"Conservatives across the country can unite around this plan to keep America from further decline and decay brought on by President Biden and progressive policies. America can be as free and prosperous as ever, if we stand firm on our principles and hew to what has always made America the greatest nation in the history of the world.\" Republicans who helped develop the platform include former top Trump aide Kellyanne Conway and former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.\u00a0 Republicans are projected to perform well in the midterm elections, as President Biden's poll numbers sag, and historically, the party in the White House struggles in the midterm election of a president's first term. Pence's own political path remains unclear, and he hasn't said whether he's ruled out a presidential bid. \"All my focus right now is on 2022,\" Pence told Fox Business Network's Maria Bartiromo earlier this month. \"I think we have a historic opportunity to reclaim majorities in the House and Senate, to elect great Republican governors around America and, in 2023, I'm confident the Republican Party will nominate a candidate who will be the next president of the United States of America and at the right time, my family and I will reflect and consider how we might participate in that process.\"\u00a0 In February, Pence resoundingly rejected the claim by Trump that he had the ability to overturn the 2020 election, saying little could be more un-American.\u00a0 \"There are those in our party who believe that as the presiding officer of the joint session of Congress that I possessed unilateral authority to reject Electoral College Votes. And\u00a0I heard this week that President Trump said I had the right to overturn the election. President Trump is wrong,\" Pence said during a speech in Florida to the Federalist Society. \"I had no right to overturn the election.\" A February CBS News\u00a0poll found about seven in 10 Republicans say Trump should run again for president in 2024, with common reasons being they say he's the best candidate Republicans have and he would win.\u00a0 The former president easily won a straw poll vote at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February this year, with the second contender, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, 30 points behind. Pence won 1% of the vote.\u00a0 Fin G\u00f3mez is CBS News' political director.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida that aired Sunday, Aug. 7, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to Capitol Hill and Florida Senator Rick Scott who is in between votes on the Senate floor. He's also the head of the Republican Senate Campaign Committee working to retake control of the Senate. Senator Scott, good morning. I know you have been up all night. So appreciate you joining this morning. SENATOR RICK SCOTT: I hope I'm coherent.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I- you know, no matter what it does not look like there is any way to stop what is expected to be a very big win here for Democrats. And I know you're opposed to it, but I want to press you on that because isn't expanding Medicare access good for a state like yours, which has more residents reliant on the Affordable Care Act than any other state, and Republicans like reducing the deficit. The CBO says this will reduce it by $100 billion over the next decade. Isn't there some good stuff in here for you, too? SEN. SCOTT: So, Margaret, here's the way I look at it. Right now, this bill actually ought to be called the war on seniors act. I mean, this is a war on Medicare. If you look at this. This is a $280 billion cut in Medicare. So, what's going to happen is Medicare is gonna get caught and there's gonna be seniors that don't get life-saving drugs because the\u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013reducing Medicare cost is not the same as benefits though, you- you know that. SEN. SCOTT: Margaret, it's $280 billion that would have been spent. It was anticipated to be spent. It's not going to be spent now. And the drug companies that would be doing more research are not going to be able to spend the money on research. There will be life-saving drugs that seniors will not get. On top of that, I mean, they're going to raise taxes by over $700 billion. And let's remember, companies don't end up paying the taxes. Shareholders pay the taxes, lower income for the employees paid the taxes, less investment pays the taxes. So, this $700 billion is actually going to hurt the economy. And then while gas prices are $2 more than they were when Joe Biden took office, there's an excise tax on gas. So why would you- you know, we're in a recession. Why would you be increasing the cost of government? We're increasing taxes. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget called your claim there, that you just reiterated in terms of Medicare spending, completely misleading. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that just about 1% of new drugs would be affected by the changes there on drug development. So how do you respond to that? SEN. SCOTT: Margaret, 1 percent. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If your grandmother is not 1% important, if there's if- if it impacts- impacts a life-saving drug that we could do now, we shouldn't be- we shouldn't be cutting Medicare like this. I don't believe it and by the way, we shouldn't be raising taxes ever but especially in a recession. And why would we be raising the taxes on gas right now when it's $2 above what it was when Joe Biden took office. This is going to continue to drive us into a further- a bigger recession than we are. Look at where we are right now. Labor participation rate's low, wages not saying with inflation, two-quarters of negative GDP. I mean- we- this is- Joe Biden has pushed us and these plans are pushing us into a recession. So, I think we've got to- we got to stop raising taxes. We got to make it easier for businesses to build their businesses, compete and we'll get more jobs. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, we just had that stellar July jobs number, but we're gonna dig into the specifics of that ahead with economist Mary Daly. Let me talk to you about the politics of all of this. Republicans had been hoping to ride the high inflation we are at and it is historic high, and President Biden's low approval ratings to a win in November. But the President and Democrats just had a really good streak here. Gas prices are down. You have this massive spending bill going through. These are a lot of big wins for Democrats. The President just authorized that strike to take out the leader of al-Qaeda. Isn't this going to get harder for Republicans to get the edge that you are trying to manufacture here?\u00a0 SEN. SCOTT: Well, you know, that sounds good, right? But that's- that's White House talking points. But let's think about this, 72% of Americans believe we're headed in the wrong track. Biden's numbers are in the tank. And if you look at all the Democrats- all the Democrats running, and they have to- basically they're a surrogate for Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer. I mean, they have to defend inflation, high gas prices, you know, the Afghan withdrawal, an open border, Critical Race Theory, defund the police, that's what they have to defend because that's what the- that's what-, that's what Biden is known for, and that's what that's basically what Democrats are known for. Now, it's going to be- look it's an election year. It's going to be a hard year. We have 21 Republicans up, only 14 Democrats. The Democrats are outracing us, but we have good candidates. And, I believe Joe Biden is going to be our key here. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said it'll be a hard year. I want to play for you what Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told Fox last week.\u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: I think it's gonna be a very tight- we have a 50/50 shot, and now we have a 50/50 nation. And I think when this Senate race smoke clears, we're likely to have a very, very close Senate still, with either us up slightly or the Democrats up slightly. (END VIDEO CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: If things are so bad, then why is it going to be so tight for Republicans? SEN. SCOTT: Well, first of all, we have- we have very good candidates. I mean, the Democrats are raising good money. So we've got to be able to get our message out, so you know, we have to raise our money. We have to work- work hard, you know, we went through a lot of primaries, so- but I believe we're gonna I believe we're gonna win but it's gonna be- it's gonna be hard. We got to raise your money, we got to work really hard for candidates- have to work really hard. Everybody is gonna to help our candidates, but I'm optimistic.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So that you do agree it's going to be tight that Republicans have at best a slight edge. SEN. SCOTT: I'm very optimistic. I would- I- but I'm- I'm realistic that you know, you have to raise your money. Democrats. are raising good money. Joe Biden is our key here. And by the way, this bill is not going to help Democrats. It's going to help Republicans. Raising taxes $700 billion, cutting Medicare $280 billion, raising gas taxes, I having 87,000 more IRS agents. Do you know how much- how happy people are to have more IRS agents out there? I mean, this is not- this is not going to be popular around the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: In a local radio interview in July, you talked a lot about your business as an executive and you said, \"we should start electing people that we would hire.\" In Georgia, Herschel Walker, Republican Senate candidate has lied about the number of children he has, about his business dealings. His ex-wife said he held a gun to her head and said, 'I'm going to blow your effing brains out.' In Arizona, the candidate Blake Master called the Unabomber an underrated thinker. He said that al Qaeda doesn't actually pose substantial threat to Americans. I mean, I've got a list of candidates here who've had some and said some pretty troubling things. Would you hire these people to work for you? SEN. SCOTT: Well, you'd go through each person and- but I'm not the one doing it. It's the voters of those states who are doing it. The voters of those states are going to make a choice.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You're trying to help Senate Republicans and lead them to victory. These are your candidates. SEN. SCOTT: So, you know Margaret, as you remember, the voters in Arizona choose who they're gonna, they're gonna vote and what they're gonna choose, they're gonna choose between Blake Master and Mr. Kelly. Mark Kelly has voted to keep the border open. He has never voted for border security. He's voted for the tax increases. He's voted for cutting Medicare. You know, he's- he's voted with Chuck Schumer, and with Joe Biden basically 100% of time. Warnock has the same problem, and this election is going to be about Joe Biden. And so, this election is going to be about all the bad things that have happened- this- the fact that we're going into recession, the fact that, you know, inflation is 9%, the fact that gas prices are up $2. All these things, that's what people are looking at. There- there\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013These are- these are your Senate Republican candidates. These are your candidates. Would you hire them? SEN. SCOTT: And the voters of these states, the voters of these states are going to decide if they're going to hire. Now I get to vote- I get to vote in Florida and that's how I think about it. But the voters in those states would choose in those states who they want. It's a choice between two people. But to there-look- all the Democratic nominees are, President Biden clones\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Yeah.-- SEN. SCOTT: \u2013Oh, and by the way, they will\u2013 (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: But if you are, I mean, you would acknowledge. You would acknowledge that if somebody went in for an interview for a private corporation, these things would come up as red flags to HR. So, it's just\u2013 SEN. SCOTT: Biden is not campaigning with anybody because he is- he is- he's toxic. That's how the voters think. That's why they say 72% of Americans say the economy is on the wrong track. When that happens, people will say, I'm going to take a serious look at somebody else. And our candidates have to go tell them what they're going to do and we're going to make sure that everybody knows exactly who are- who the Democrats are. That's what- that's what's gonna happen all across the country and we're gonna have races, and we'll see what happens. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you advising all of your candidates in these races to accept the outcome of their elections since so many of them are questioning still the outcome of the 2020 race?\u00a0 SEN. SCOTT: Well, Margaret's, remember, that's exactly what happened to me with Bill Nelson and Mark Elias. They didn't accept the outcome of the election, and they tried to illegally cast- count ballots after election day after I won by 57,000 votes. So, election security is very important to me. And I want to make sure we make sure- make sure we do everything we can to make sure people know that the election is fair. We're already putting together teams, which I had to do in Florida in '18, teams of lawyers and volunteers to make sure these elections are fair.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you accept the elections are- you know, that the integrity of these races that all your candidates are in or you're only going to have a problem with them if they lose? SEN. SCOTT: Well, I'm- I- I want free and fair elections, so I'm going to work my- work hard to make sure these elections are fair because everybody gets to decide at the time. So, I'm still frustrated with what happened to my race. We had- we spent millions of dollars to make sure we won and we won election night and they tried to count illegal ballots after election night and that's wrong. MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, before I let you go, do you think that the US military should be deployed to defend Taiwan if Taiwan makes- China makes a move on it? SEN. SCOTT: I think we've got to be very clear that we will defend Taiwan. We've got to be very clear exactly what's going to happen to China, with exactly what sanctions are- is going to happen to China if they invade Taiwan. I think all American businesses need to understand that their risk right now if they're doing business there. And I think every American whenever they see a box that says, 'Made in China,' they ought to send it back to whoever sent it to them and say I'll never buy another product made in China. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there's a whole story about inflation there, Senator, but that's for another day. We got to leave it there. Thank you for your time, and I'll let you get back to work there. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

            "article_content": "Israeli airstrikes flattened homes in Gaza on Saturday and rocket barrages into southern Israel persisted, raising fears of an escalation in a conflict that has killed at least 24 people in the coastal strip.  The fighting began with Israel's killing of a senior commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad militant group in a wave of strikes Friday that Israel said were meant to prevent an imminent attack. A 5-year-old girl and two women are among those killed in the strikes.  So far, Hamas, the larger militant group that rules Gaza, appeared to stay on the sidelines of the conflict, keeping its intensity somewhat contained. Israel and Hamas fought a war barely a year ago, one of four major conflicts and several smaller battles over the last 15 years that wreaked a staggering cost to the impoverished territory's 2 million Palestinian residents. Whether Hamas continues to stay out of the fight likely depends in part on how much punishment Israel inflicts in Gaza as rocket fire steadily continues. The Israeli military said an errant rocket fired by Palestinian militants killed civilians late Saturday, including children, in the town of Jabaliya, in northern Gaza. The military said it investigated the incident and concluded \"without a doubt\" that it was caused by a misfire on the part of Islamic Jihad. There was no official Palestinian comment on the incident. A Palestinian medical worker, who was not authorized to brief media and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said the blast killed at least six people, including three children. An airstrike in the southern city of Rafah destroyed a home and heavily damaged surrounding buildings. The Health Ministry said at least two people were killed and 32 wounded, including children. A teenage boy was recovered from the rubble, and the other slain individual was identified by his family as Ziad al-Mudalal, the son of an Islamic Jihad official. The military said it targeted Khaled Mansour, Islamic Jihad's commander for southern Gaza. Neither Israel nor the militant group said whether he was hit. The Civil Defense said responders were still sifting through the rubble and that a digger was being sent from Gaza City. Another strike Saturday hit a car, killing a 75-year-old woman and wounding six other people.  In one of the strikes, after the warnings, fighter jets dropped two bombs on the house of an Islamic Jihad member. The blast flattened the two-story structure, leaving a large rubble-filled crater, and badly damaged surrounding homes. Women and children rushed out of the area. \"Warned us? They warned us with rockets and we fled without taking anything,\" said Huda Shamalakh, who lived next door. She said 15 people lived in the targeted home. Among the 24 Palestinians killed were six children and two women, as well as the senior Islamic Jihad commander. The Gaza Health Ministry said more than 200 people have been wounded. It does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. The Israeli military said Friday that early estimates were that around 15 fighters were killed. The lone power plant in Gaza ground to a halt at noon Saturday for lack of fuel as Israel has kept its crossing points into Gaza closed since Tuesday. With the new disruption, Gazans can get only 4 hours of electricity a day, increasing their reliance on private generators and deepening the territory's chronic power crisis amid peak summer heat. Throughout the day, Gaza militants regularly launched rounds of rockets into Israel. The Israeli military said Saturday evening that nearly 450 rockets had been fired, 350 of which made it into Israel, but almost all were intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile-defense system. Two people suffered minor shrapnel wounds. One rocket barrage was fired toward Tel Aviv, setting off sirens that sent residents to shelters, but the rockets were either intercepted or fell into the sea, the military said. Sunday could be a critical day in the flare-up, as Jews mark Tisha B'av, a somber day of fasting that commemorates the destruction of the biblical temples. Thousands are expected at Jerusalem's Western Wall, and Israeli media reported that the Israeli leadership was expected to allow lawmakers to visit a key hilltop holy site in the city that is a flashpoint for violence between Israelis and Palestinians. On Friday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said in a televised speech that \"Israel isn't interested in a broader conflict in Gaza but will not shy away from one either.\" \"This government has a zero-tolerance policy for any attempted attacks \u2014 of any kind \u2014 from Gaza towards Israeli territory,\" he said. \"Israel will not sit idly by when there are those who are trying to harm its civilians.\" The violence poses an early test for Lapid, who assumed the role of caretaker prime minister ahead of elections in November, when he hopes to keep the position. Lapid, a centrist former TV host and author, has experience in diplomacy having served as foreign minister in the outgoing government, but has thin security credentials. A conflict with Gaza could burnish his standing and give him a boost as he faces off against former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a security hawk who led the country during three of its four wars with Hamas. Hamas also faces a dilemma in deciding whether to join a new battle barely a year after the last war caused widespread devastation. There has been almost no reconstruction since then, and the isolated coastal territory is mired in poverty, with unemployment hovering around 50%. Israel and Egypt have maintained a tight blockade over the territory since the Hamas takeover in 2007.  Egypt on Saturday intensified efforts to prevent escalation, communicating with Israel, the Palestinians and the United States to keep Hamas from joining the fighting, an Egyptian intelligence official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. The Palestinian Health Ministry put the toll at 15 killed and said more than 80 were wounded. The ministry did not differentiate between civilians and militants. The Israeli military said early estimates were that around 15 fighters were killed. The latest round of Israel-Gaza violence was rooted in the arrest earlier this week of a senior Islamic Jihad leader in the West Bank, part of a monthlong Israeli military operation in the territory. A teen Islamic Jihad member was also killed in a gunbattle. Israel then closed roads around Gaza and sent reinforcements to the border, warning of retaliation. On Friday, it killed Islamic Jihad's commander for northern Gaza, Taiseer al-Jabari, in a strike on a Gaza City apartment building. An Israeli military spokesman said the strikes were in response to an \"imminent threat\" from two militant squads armed with anti-tank missiles. Other Israeli strikes overnight largely hit on the outskirts of Gaza City or in rural areas, targeting what Israel said were rocket launchers, rocket building sites and Islamic Jihad camps.  Defense Minister Benny Gantz approved an order to call up 25,000 reserve soldiers if needed while the military announced a \"special situation\" on the home front, with schools closed and limits placed on activities in communities within 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the border. Hamas seized power in Gaza from rival Palestinian forces in 2007, two years after Israel withdrew from the coastal strip. Its most recent war with Israel was in May 2021. Tensions soared again earlier this year following a wave of attacks inside Israel, near-daily military operations in the West Bank and tensions at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site.  Iran-backed Islamic Jihad is smaller than Hamas but largely shares its ideology. Both groups oppose Israel's existence and have carried out scores of deadly attacks over the years, including the firing of rockets into Israel. ",

Terry and Morell discuss the stances struck by Russia and China to Pyongyang's newly aggressive behavior, as well as the prospects for changes in the Kim regime's behavior. Terry also identifies some burgeoning fissures in North Korean society and discusses growing concerns about leader Kim Jong Un's health.\u00a0 Highlights Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. \u00a0INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - SUE MI TERRY PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS MICHAEL MORELL: Sue, welcome back to Intelligence Matters. It's great to have you with us again. SUE MI TERRY: Thank you for having me on. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Sue, a relatively quiet 2021 from North Korea. No nuclear tests. Only a few missile tests. Now, just in January of this year, we've had seven missile tests of varying types. I think we set a record for missile tests in one month, including the last one, which was an intermediate range ballistic missile test. What explains the relative quiet of last year and the sharp turn we're seeing this year? SUE MI TERRY: First, you're right, this is a sort of record-setting. Kim has now carried out more missile tests this month than in any month since coming to power a decade ago. I think in the past year, it's the first year of the Biden administration, and perhaps North Koreans were sort of seeing where the Biden administration would go.  So now it's been a year into it, and they, Kim Jong Un, has made a calculation that by just sitting around the Biden administration is not going to really offer them anything that they were looking for, like sanctions relief or anything else. I also think last year was a unique year in the sense that North Koreans are still very paranoid about COVID. The borders still remain closed. They were the first country to close the border with China in January 2020, so it was an unusual year. As you know, they normally greet a new U.S. administration with a barrage of missile tests. They did so with Obama. They did so with Trump. They didn't with Biden - again, special year with COVID. And I think they were just trying to see where the Biden administration was going to go. MICHAEL MORELL: And do you know if there was any outreach from the Biden administration to North Korea during that first year, if there were any talks going on of any kind? SUE MI TERRY: I don't think there were any talks. I know that the Biden administration tried. They also said that they were going to be happy to sit down with the North Koreans at any time without preconditions. But the North Koreans were not interested, and I don't think they were interested because they knew just by sitting, just meeting them in that way, they're not going to really get anything from the Biden administration that is different, like significant sanctions relief. Also, I think the COVID issue does matter. They are very, very paranoid about COVID, and it probably was not an ideal time to also have meetings. MICHAEL MORELL: So I wonder what you think they're trying to accomplish now with this barrage of tests? Both diplomatically, politically and militarily. SUE MI TERRY: Right, so there is, I think, multiple aims, goals. First, I do think they are genuinely trying to modernize their weapons system, right? So you just mentioned that they tested intermediate range ballistic missile Hwasong-12. This test follows a barrage of other tests, right, there were three hypersonic missile tests really showing that North Korea is developing missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads that would be easier to hide, harder to intercept.  And those hypersonic missile tests follow other tests like we've seen in the recent months, like the new train-mounted ballistic missiles, submarine launched ballistic missiles, short-range missiles, long-range cruise missiles. And they're all in line with North Korea's broader attempts to diversify its missile arsenal, evade missile defense systems, so they're on track of doing that. Mounted ballistic missiles, for example, makes sense for North Korea because North Korea is very mountainous. They have thousands of underground bunkers. They can hide these missiles before rolling them out. And Kim Jong Un has told us he's going to do this, right. He said in January of last year - if you remember the Party Congress - that he was going to double-down on nuclear program, that he's going to strengthen their nuclear deterrence. He listed a whole lot of other weapons that he has not yet tested, which concerns me.  So there is a genuine reason in terms of, they want to modernize and expand and diversify and so on. And then I think, you know, obviously there's also showcasing strength and showing defiance to us and internally - because they have a lot of challenges internally. They have food shortages, ongoing food shortages, economic issues. And so this also works domestically. And then when they do ever sit down with Americans, you know, they get more leverage, right, because they have expanded and modernized their program. So there are multiple reasons. I think it's hard to say exactly one reason is behind the recent testing. But I'm concerned that they're going to do more. That we're just seeing the beginning. MICHAEL MORELL: So Sue, the U.S. has responded to these tests in January by trying to get the United Nations Security Council to pass additional sanctions, but those have been blocked by Russia and China. In fact, the Russian and Chinese have argued that we should actually roll back some of the sanctions on North Korea. What's going on on that front and how does Kim Jong Un read all of that? SUE MI TERRY: Well, Kim Jong Un, first of all, with the way he reads it, is that this is very good for Kim Jong Un, right? He knows that there's not going to be any kind of real, coordinated international response, any kind of response from the international community. You know, China and Russia have moved on. We saw China and Russia actually implementing sanctions, more importantly, China, in the fall of 2017. But since then, since the whole shift to summitry and diplomacy and Trump meeting with Kim, Xi Jinping met with Kim Jong Un five times. There is no interest on implementing sanctions or even coming up with new sanctions. And the North Koreans know that. So there is no there's going to be no real repercussion for the North Koreans as they continue on this testing campaign. You can you can be critical of the Trump administration and its North Korea policy on a whole lot of levels. But one thing that was working, you could say, is that he did pursue maximum pressure and in the fall of 2017, we saw China actually implementing sanctions, and they're not going to do that anymore. And the North Koreans know that. MICHAEL MORELL: You said you think we're going to see more here. And I actually wonder to what extent we might be on track for this year, 2022, to be another 2017, right, where a series of shorter-range missile tests culminated in nuclear weapons tests and ICBM tests? Is that something you're concerned about? SUE MI TERRY: Yeah, no, I'm very concerned about that. We all saw in 2017, when they tested Hwasong-14 and 15 ICBMs, intercontinental ballistic missiles. And then later, a couple of years later, it was the October parade in 2020, they displayed this new untested ICBM new strategic weapon they called the Hwasong-16. That's the largest, liquid-propellant, road mobile ICBM, not only in North Korea, but anywhere in the world, right, with capacity to hold as much as triple payload. So there are these kinds of missiles that they would certainly want to test. And I think that's where they are headed. And right now we have the Beijing Olympics and there will be - I don't think they will test anytime soon, until the Olympics is over. South Korea's presidential election is not as big of a factor, but maybe they wait. And after the presidential election in South Korea on March 9th, then we will have Kim Il Sung's 110th birthday coming up in April. So I'm very worried that on that timeline they are going to go for something that's much more provocative than intermediate range missile tests. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Sue, do you think nuclear tests and ICBM tests would change the dynamic for the Russians and Chinese, or not? SUE MI TERRY: You know, they may get on board with some sort of resolution condemning the, you know, saying, 'This is very provocative and destabilizing for the region.' And perhaps they would begrudgingly sign on to a few more sanctions. But I just don't think the level of -- they're just not going to implement sanctions like they did in 2017; 2022 is not 2017, it is a very different year and a lot has happened. And I think it will be very, very difficult for us to get that kind of support that we got from China and Russia. You know, by late 2017, we had, like, 90 percent of North Korean exports were illegal, right? We had nine UNSC resolutions, and they had already been, you know, most of North Korea's exports - coal, seafood, textiles and everything else. But they're only effective if they are enforced. And again, this is what I'm saying. I think 2017 was a very different period and China, to everybody's surprise, was actually doing its part after years of dragging its feet. And now I just don't think China is going to do that. So sanctions are not going to be as effective because they're not going to be implemented properly. MICHAEL MORELL: And would nuclear tests and ICBM tests - you know, certainly a military purpose to them and possibly a domestic political purpose to them. But would they also be designed to try to get us back to the negotiating table? Or not? SUE MI TERRY: Yeah, no, I mean, they are designed because, ultimately, they do want to have some sort of a deal with the United States. The reason they're not sitting down with Americans right now, besides COVID and all that, is because they know that they're not going to get anything from the Biden administration. But with another nuclear test, an ICBM test, the situation, the crisis is more heightened, there's a more heightened sense of crisis, and right now the Biden administration is just completely distracted with a whole host of issues. And that way, you can sort of get the attention back to North Korea and sit down properly for yet another round of negotiation and some sort of deal. It's not going to be a denuclearization deal, but some sort of a deal that perhaps they would be willing to freeze their program. MICHAEL MORELL: I know this is a hard question. What do you think Kim's script is, right? His realistic script. How would how would he like this to play out over the next several years?\u00a0 SUE MI TERRY: I don't think Kim Jong Un's goal has changed, which is: ultimately get the international community to accept North Korea as nuclear weapons power and just live with it. And more and more we are doing that. Even just recently with this intermediate range ballistic missile test, even the media doesn't care. The Americans don't care. The South Koreans don't care. We are now sort of living with it. So the more they do this, the more they condition the international community to accepting North Korea, like we did with Pakistan. So I think that's the goal, and that's the play: They test. We sit down with the North Koreans, have some sort of a freeze deal, and then we lift the majority of sanctions and accept North Korea's nuclear weapons power. And they, in return, they promise not to make more. MICHAEL MORELL: And you mentioned this a little bit, but how do you think he sees President Biden as a person, as a counterpart? How do you think they read this administration and its foreign policy? How do you think they read the withdrawal from Afghanistan? How closely are they following the Ukraine crisis? How do you think they think about all that? SUE MI TERRY: Well, I think first of all, they realize that the Biden administration, they're not going to have any kind of real big breakthrough as currently is. The Biden administration is distracted. And even though the folks that are in the Biden administration, a lot of these people were in the Obama administration, the North Koreans know who these people are, there's not anybody that's going to come in and have any kind of different North Korea policy. Under Trump, at least, there was just the extremes that were more outside of the box, you could say, right? Whether it's 'fire and fury,' 'Rocket man on a suicide mission,' to love affairs and beautiful letters, there was this at least true maximum pressure and sort of true engagement. And the North Koreans know that that's not happening with the Biden administration. In terms of a lot of other issues, I don't know what they make of the withdrawal from Afghanistan - I don't think they're necessarily saying that this then means that the Biden administration can make the same kind of play with South Korea. Afghanistan is a very different story and issue. So I don't I don't know if they are drawing any kind of clear conclusion from that. They could also say, you know, the Biden administration is trying to focus in Asia and focus on China by withdrawing from Afghanistan. So it's hard to know because, obviously, North Korea is such a reclusive place and we don't have any kind of information coming out of North Korea. The only thing I can say is that probably they know that Biden administration is extremely distracted by other issues, and they need to sort of make this kind of big splash. Otherwise, you know, nobody cares about North Korea, so they have to resort to provocations. And if I'm Kim, I would draw the same conclusion: that by sitting around and not doing anything, there goes the entire the rest of the Biden administration, just another other several years. MICHAEL MORELL: So, it's interesting, right, that the Obama administration basically tried to ignore North Korea; didn't work. They pushed their strategic weapons programs forward. The Trump administration, you know, maximum pressure and then actually did exactly what the North Koreans have said for years, which is, 'Sit down and talk to us, leader TO leader and we can work this out.' That didn't work. They moved their programs forward. With Biden, they seem to think, you're saying, that they have Obama 2 here, and they're going to have to wait this out. So to get to what Kim wants, right, which is this negotiation with freeze, sanctions go away. That's going to take a little time, it sounds like, from their perspective. SUE MI TERRY: Yes, but in a way, it's working out for them, right? So in the past decade, under Kim Jong Un, he conducted four out of six nuclear test, 130 missile launches and three ICBM tests later. And he's right now making impressive progress on the nuclear missile program, and this is since the Hanoi summit. They've got nuclear warheads and nuclear weapons power. The number, I think, ranges from 30 to 40, some say, possibly up to 60. They are producing enough fissile material to make another half dozen bombs a year.  All indications are they are they're moving forward. In the last round of testing, as we just talked about earlier in the show, with this hypersonic missiles and everything else, they are headed in that direction. And so now if the test of Hwasong-16 or even tactical nuclear weapons, which which Kim Jong Un himself said he's developing - and there is no response. I mean, we can't even get UNSC to come up with a condemnation of these missile tests. So there is no response and the North Koreans know that there's no military response that's feasible for North Korea. So we are kind of paralyzed. And meanwhile, they're making progress. So in a way, if they just stay on course, they'll get what they want, which is international acceptance of North Korea's nuclear weapons power. MICHAEL MORELL: And maybe the sanctions get negotiated away. Maybe they just get slowly eroded away. Right? Maybe he can get to what he wants either way. SUE MI TERRY: Right, so if China does not implement sanctions - because that's the key - then they've been living with it for how many years? So it's really China that has to implement sanctions. But again, you know, I go back to the same point that China today is very different. And even 2017, there was one exception. We've seen China not implement sanctions for decades. So I think they will get there. MICHAEL MORELL: So Sue, I think this is kind of a key question, which is, do you think that Kim Jong Un believes that he can actually use his nuclear weapons in some way, someday? Or are these just the ultimate deterrent against a U.S. invasion and U.S.-led regime change. How do you think he thinks about these weapons, particularly when we start talking about tactical nuclear weapons? SUE MI TERRY: I don't think Kim Jong Un thinks that he's going to use these weapons. I don't believe that because I think what's established is Kim Jong Un is a rational actor, and he knows if you use the weapons, that's the end of the regime. And ultimately, that's the whole purpose, right? That's the goal. That's the strategic game, is regime survival. But the concern for us is that once we get to that stage where we accept North Korea as a truly nuclear weapons power, even though they already are, then it has complications. The implications of that is, you know, we have potential regional proliferation. South Korea is already making -some conservatives are already making noises about bringing tactical nuclear weapons back, to South Korea pursuing nuclear weapons and so on. And if South Korea goes nuclear, Japan, at least the Japanese are saying, you know, that's the one reason that they would have to revise our constitution and go nuclear, too - so regional proliferation. And then, you know, there's always a global proliferation risk, too, because that's how they make money. They sold ballistic missiles and so on. So we are concerned about that. I don't think the concern is actually over North Korea using nuclear weapons. I don't believe that personally. MICHAEL MORELL: Do you think there's a chance he could sell weapons? SUE MI TERRY: I think they know that's a true, true red line, but yes, I mean, why not? I mean, when you look at past behavior, North Korea has sold everything under the sun except nuclear weapons. But they have, and they built their nuclear reactor in Syria that the Israelis bombed. That's how they make money. It's a serious risk, and I think that no one can deny that's a serious risk, right? They also said they would mass produce nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles and so on. So how can you say this is not a serious concern? They have a lot of stockpiled weapons, materials and everything else, and they have a relationship, they have a long relationship with Syria, with Iran, Myanmar. It's a very concerning issue. MICHAEL MORELL: And how do you think the Chinese think about the risks associated with North Korea having nuclear weapons? SUE MI TERRY: I don't think they want nuclear weapons, I think that much is clear, but that whole phrase, 'no war, no instability, no nukes and in that order.' So they don't want North Korea to have nuclear weapons because they don't want missile defense. They made a huge deal out of South Korea, bringing THAAD missile defense to South Korea. And they worry about regional proliferation, too. But do they worry about nuclear weapons to such a degree that they don't mind causing instability in North Korea? No, they want more of a status quo, more stability. They want the regime to be intact. They want North Korea to exist. So they're not going to do anything to cause regime instability, which means we can't get China to really act on cutting off North Korea, which might bring North Korea to the table. That's the one thing that might make North Korea reconsider some of these just-developing weapons, but China is not going to do that, so there is the problem. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, and China certainly doesn't want a united Korea aligned with the United States on its border. SUE MI TERRY: Certainly not, and so if you're going a little bit more into why China does not want unstable North Korea or the regime to fall is because they are worried about unification, there will be, you know, a united Korea, that's going to look like a giant South Korea, basically - even though China is South Korea's number one trading partner and they have a strong economic relationship, they do not want a pro, unified Korea that still has U.S. forces in Korea. So yes, I do think keeping North Korea as a buffer is still very much important for China. So stability, keeping North Korea as a buffer, these are more important for China than seeing North Korea give up nuclear weapons. MICHAEL MORELL: So Sue, maybe the most difficult question here is, if you were calling the shots with regard to U.S. government policy toward North Korea, what would you do about this problem, which seems so intractable? SUE MI TERRY: It's so hard, because I think you talked about this a little bit earlier, of what happened under Obama and Trump, but this goes back to the Clinton years, right, in the early 1990s. And we have now tried bilateral negotiation and we had an agreement with North Korea in 1994, an agreed framework. We had multilateral negotiations with Six Party talks process. Well, we had another agreement with North Korea. So I think it's easy for people to forget that it's not that we didn't try to have diplomacy and engagement. We did, for many, many years, and we have had agreements with North Korea. And even after having agreements with North Korea, they all fell apart over verification. So it's now 2022. North Korea is a different country than in the early 1990s. They have these nuclear weapons. So I don't think we have a whole lot of other options except to do what we continue to do. And it's very, very dissatisfying for us to say that. If we want to sort of criticize, for example, this Biden administration to say, 'You're not doing enough, you're not doing more.' But when you really think about what you would do, that's so different, it's really hard to come up with what that is. I, personally, I'm a believer that we should have stayed on with maximum pressure, minus the whole talk about preemptive strike, necessarily. So I am one of those people who believe that just there's no other option but to continue pressuring the Kim regime like we did in 2017, again, even though it's now harder to do that because China is not quite on board. You know, Iran, it took three years of very tough sanctions for Iran to come to the negotiating table. So even for us to have any kind of leverage when we do sit down with the North Koreans, we do have to continue with sanctions and shore up defenses and deterrence. And you know, I've talked to you several times about this before. Really, we need a long-term plan and I'm a very huge proponent of aiding an information penetration campaign, trying to get information into North Korea because I think ultimately the only solution is when the North Koreans bring up the change, they need to. I mean, the country has to change. So, you know, we had many conversations about this. MICHAEL MORELL: So Sue, a great transition because I wanted to talk a little bit about domestic issues in North Korea. What's happening there as it relates to COVID, as it relates to food availability? What's the domestic situation like? SUE MI TERRY: The domestic situation is pretty horrible, because, you know, North Koreans closed the border with China. As I said, it was the first country to do so. Very paranoid about COVID and it remains closed.  So in fact, you know, this closure has achieved more than what the sanctions could have in terms of really shutting down North Korea's economy. So they continue to face food shortages. They have nothing really coming in. And you know, when you have China providing 80 percent of North Korea's consumer goods and 45 percent of its food and 90 percent of its energy, and so on. But so there's Sino-North Korean trade, it's almost like 90 percent of North Korea's global trade, but nothing is really coming in. So the food situation is bad. The internal situation is bad. In terms of the leadership, there's continuing concerns about Kim Jong Un's health. In fact, the North has recently just had some sort of - they're making some statements sort of showing that they're concerned about Kim Jong Un's health. So there's its own admission that something is going on with his health, right? He lost a lot of weight. We still don't have any explanation of what happened and what's happening there. So there are some challenges, and then they continue to go and spend all their money building their nuclear and missile programs, so it's not a good situation for North Korea. MICHAEL MORELL: Any any sign of any leadership challenges? Any sign of discontent among the elite? SUE MI TERRY: No. I mean, by the time if we know that, then something would have already happened. By the time we think a coup happened, then -  I mean, just he got rid of everybody he could potentially get rid of this way, you know, from his uncle Chang Song-thaek, to his half brother, Kim Jong Nam to, you know, a hundred defense ministers, right? So he got rid of everybody that could potentially pose a challenge to him. I'm sure there is some disgruntlement, but it's impossible for us to know. And you know, it's still ruling by terror, right? So Kim Jong Un has really cracked down even more so than his father. There are less defectors leaving North Korea not only because of COVID and the border closure, but even before that, the whole ideological campaign, he has upped it. I read some article that says that Kim Jong Un, now in high schools, there is an eighty-one hour long course devoted to Kim Jong Un's own life, and so on. So I just recently wrote a piece calling North Korea a completely failed state. Except with nuclear missile weapons, it is a failed state. It ranks the board at the bottom of the world's GDP. Johns Hopkins had a report that said, in terms of global health, it ranked 293 out of 295. It was tied to Yemen. Only Somalia did worse than North Korea. I mean, it has a hard time feeding its own people. How can you not call this country a failed state, except again, its nuclear weapons and missile program? MICHAEL MORELL: So Sue, you talked earlier about how, probably the only way this strategic weapons program evolves in a way that the world would like to see, is if the regime changes, if politics in North Korea changes significantly. How would that happen? What would it look like? What would have to happen? SUE MI TERRY: I don't think we can force regime change. Meaning, except - if we had, in an ideal world, we were able to truly implement sanctions and pressure the Kim regime and the elites get absolutely nothing, too, then maybe the elites will finally do something about it. But I don't think that's likely because we just talked about how China is not going to implement sanctions and not going to cause instability. So then - this is my whole point about the people have to bring about that change. And of course they can't, because it's a closed society. And this is where my whole point of why we need to continually help bring information into North Korea because that's the only way that the country will change, right? I know a lot of people think that's going to be still impossible because Kim is going to continue to terrorize his people, and of course he will. But I think it's important to remember, things happen that we couldn't have predicted, right? Like the fall of the Berlin Wall, the demise of Soviet Union. You know, like these dictators do, dictatorships do collapse and sometimes these moments do happen. But I do think we are seeing changes on the ground that are very subtle that a lot of people are not seeing. Like there are private markets, like people are surreptitiously watching South Korean soap operas and DVDs. And you know, there are a lot of defectors, they all testified to the fact they've all listened to foreign broadcasts, even though the regime cracks down on it. So if we can somehow take steps to loosen the regime's grip on its people by presenting an information campaign that aims to get information into North Korea and then also allow North Koreans to safely communicate with one another - that's another important factor, because they can't. There's no internet, there's no nothing. So they can't really even safely communicate with each other. So if somehow we can do something about the information blockade - but this is a long term solution. It's not anything that's near-term, of course. MICHAEL MORELL: So what do you think that the average North Korean thinks about North Korea, in relation to the rest of the world? SUE MI TERRY: So they were taught and indoctrinated to think that, you know, North Korea is sort of the paradise on the planet, right? And for some time, for a period of time that worked under Kim Il Song; less and less under Kim Jong Il. I think more North Koreans now know the reality, right, that North Korea is not the paradise on Earth. They are watching South Korean soap operas and whatnot, so they are more aware of of their situation. But this is why Kim Jong Un has to blame the United States and have this kind of, 'US is a hostile power that's causing all kinds of problems in North Korea,' because Kim Jong Un needs the United States, to point to a country that he can blame all his problems on, why his people are not being fed. You can blame the sanctions and U.S.'s hostile policy and so on. This is why I think it's really hard. It's going to be hard for North Koreans to truly make peace, the North Korean regime to make to make peace with the U.S.. Because how can they then justify the deprivations in all of those of these people, right? Why are they the 198th ranked economy in the world, if there is peace with the United States and you can no longer blame the U.S. for their problems? MICHAEL MORELL: Sue, you're terrific. I could talk to you all day. My takeaway from this discussion, as pessimistic as it sounds, is that, 10, 15, 20 years from now, we're going to have a North Korea that has nuclear weapons and ICBMs. You know, most of the sanctions will have eroded away. And South Korea and Japan will have nuclear weapons as well. Am I right about that or not? SUE MI TERRY: I think that's the worst case scenario, but it's possible; it's certainly plausible. But I do think this is why it's very important for us to still not give the North Koreans what they seek, which is the international acceptance of North Korea's nuclear weapons power. So it does so it does not lead to South Korea and Japan trying to get nuclear weapons and so on. It's important for us to also maintain sanctions, even with China not necessarily doing its part, it's still important for us to, I think, maintain pressure and maintain sanctions. MICHAEL MORELL: The maximum pressure campaign you talked about. SUE MI TERRY: Yes, the maximum pressure. I'm not one for a preemptive strike, but something that we saw in 2017. Until of course, the North Koreans are willing to, you know - you still have to give an exit ramp to the North Koreans. And again, there's a lot going on internally in North Korea, a lot on the ground, private markets, information seeping into North Korea that's really chipping away at regime myths and bringing about some change. So if we stay the course and aid that effort, you just never know, right? And also, Kim Jong Un is not healthy. And if something were to happen to him, to Kim, that's a real wild card. Because he doesn't have a successor lined up. His kids are, you know, at elementary school level. He has his sister, but it's uncertain what's going to happen. So there is a lot going on internally in North Korea, there are still very much wildcards. So, stay the course. MICHAEL MORELL: So, other scenarios to the pessimistic one I laid out there. SUE MI TERRY: Yes. MICHAEL MORELL: Sue, thank you so much for joining us. It's always great to have you on the show. SUE MI TERRY: Thank you. It's always good to have this conversation with you, even though not much changes, and I can't really offer any brilliant solution. MICHAEL MORELL: Thank you so much.",

And this week on Face the Nation: Nearly two weeks after the Uvalde massacre, our nation, divided by politics, struggles to cope with the epidemic of mass shootings. This weekend, the gut-wrenching grief in Uvalde persists, as the mourning for the 19 elementary school children and two teachers shot by an 18-year-old with a legally purchased AR-15 semiautomatic rifle continues. Across the country, so does the gun violence. We will try to understand what the country wants to see happen when it comes to new gun controls and just how devastating mass shootings in Uvalde and Buffalo have been to the national psyche. (Begin VT) KAMALA HARRIS (Vice President of the United States): No 86-year-old should fear for her safety to go to the grocery store. No 9-year-old should be afraid to go to school. And no 18-year-olds should be able to buy a weapon of war. REPRESENTATIVE GREG STEUBE (R-Florida): Here's a gun I carry every single day to protect myself, my family, my wife, my home. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: For Democrats, it's guns. For Republicans, it's rights. But, in our divided America, can these politics be reconciled to protect our children? (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): I've been in this fight for a long time. I know how hard it is, but I will never give up. This time, a majority of the American people won't give up either. I believe the majority of you will act to turn your outrage into making this issue central to your vote. Enough. Enough. Enough. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: The issue has become a rallying cry for the midterm elections. (Begin VT) SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-Kentucky): I, like most of you, believe this needs to be done. It must be done consistent with the Constitution and the culture of most of our country. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with Pennsylvania Senator Pat Toomey and Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas. Plus, we will preview the January 6 congressional hearings with committee member Adam Schiff. And we will take a look at the economy. With inflation high and gas prices rising, are we headed into a recession? It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. This morning, more than three-quarters of Americans say things in this country are going badly. That's higher than it has been since the early days of the COVID pandemic, according to our new CBS poll. In particular, Americans are reeling from the impact of gun violence in the wake of several deadly mass shootings. For more insight, we're joined by CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto, who joins us from New York this morning. Anthony, always good to have you. How do you quantify the emotional toll that these mass shootings are having on kids and their parents? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret. It is a measure of how shaken the nation is, when you talk to parents and they report that their kids are expressing emotions like not just sadness, but being scared, being nervous when they talk about what happened in Texas. And then you ask parents what their kids are worried about in school, and you get a list that's very reminiscent of things that kids have dealt with for generations, like bullying and social pressures. But worries about gun violence are a majority, and they're not far behind. And so that is a measure of just the emotional toll that all of this has taken on the nation and the nation's kids, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And so do they feel powerless? Or do people believe they can do something about it? ANTHONY SALVANTO: The good news is, people think this is preventable. You get big majorities that say it can be stopped, it can be prevented, and it's not something that we have to accept. Now, there is a quarter who says that, unfortunately, this may be something that we have to accept in a free society. And I do want to point out some partisan difference here. There is bipartisan view that it can be prevented. But there are four in 10 Republicans who do say that it may be something we have to accept. And that partisan differences is going to cut through a lot of this, Margaret. Now, I do want to say that, when we ask people why they think that the U.S. has so many unfortunate mass shootings, the availability of guns comes out as a top answer, but not the only answer. People point to things like mental health issues, the influence of violence in the culture. So, it is a range. And that is important. But I do want to look at this idea of the availability of guns, because the numbers who say that gun laws should generally become more strict is up in recent weeks. It's up since the tragedy in Buffalo to 60 percent now. And then, when you look again at what people think is causing this and what might be a way forward, well, the number who think that the U.S. would be safer if fewer people had guns does outweigh the number who say that they think things would be safer if everyone or more people had guns. But this is a mix. And it comes back to this larger idea that, to solve a problem and prevent a problem, you first have to come to agreement on its causes, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: So Congress is debating some specific proposals. What are the policies that people favor? ANTHONY SALVANTO: So you do see big majorities in favor of things like background checks on potential gun buyers. Federal red flag laws get three- quarters majority support, a smaller majority, but a majority, a nationwide ban on semiautomatic weapons. But, here, Margaret, I want to show you the way the partisan breaks fall on this. For measures that would generally address people, background checks, federal red flag laws, you see more bipartisan support. But when you get to measures that address specifically guns, then partisan support breaks, and you see smaller numbers among Republicans. So it's that difference that's important to understand, measures that address people vs. measures that address guns specifically. And so, in all, there is not a wide public view that it's likely Congress will do something. Maybe they will surprise the public here. But what we do see across the data is that many people feel that something can be done, that a lot of things would help, even if there's not only one solution -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you. We turn now to the Pennsylvania Republican senator, Pat Toomey. He is one of the senators involved in bipartisan efforts to reduce gun violence. And he joins us this morning from the Keystone State. Senator, welcome. SENATOR PAT TOOMEY (R-Pennsylvania): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: The numbers are pretty staggering here. There have been 239 mass shootings in 2022, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which is a nonprofit that tracks these. Overnight, there was one in Philadelphia, three people killed, 14 injured, using a semiautomatic weapon. What has happened to the American people that has taken violence to this level? SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Yes. Well, it's a complex and multifaceted problem, as you know, Margaret. In -- in some cases, criminality in our big cities has escalated enormously. There's a lot of factors contributing to that. In some cases, it's district attorneys who think their job is to make sure no one goes to jail. That's a problem. And then, of course, we have these -- these horrific sensational massacres, where a young man clearly has just gone completely off the rails and is deranged. And that's a very different set of circumstances. So it's -- it's a big, complicated problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's a big, complicated problem. And most attempts to try to create any kind of solution have stopped. But Democrats and Republicans, we just mentioned, are negotiating right now to get something. Democrats need 10 Republican votes. You're one of six Republicans working with Senator Chris Murphy. He said today that you all are writing this legislation right now. It will not ban assault weapons. It will not have comprehensive background checks as part of it. Is your proposal to expand background checks still in it? SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Well, I certainly hope we're going to have an expansion of background checks. You know, Senator Manchin and I have been working on this for a long time. And we've tried to establish that, at least for commercial sales of firearms, there ought to be a background check, so, sales at gun shows, sales that are advertised over the Internet. I don't know that we'll get exactly what Senator Manchin and I developed some years ago. It will probably be something different than that. And that's fine. There are a number of mechanisms you could use to expand background checks. But I just think it makes sense. We all agree that violent criminals and deranged, dangerously mentally ill people shouldn't have firearms. So we need a mechanism to increase the likelihood that we will identify such a person and prevent them from buying a gun, legally anyway. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, to... SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: And so that's the idea behind expanding background checks. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, to be clear, because you had proposed the Manchin- Toomey background check expansion in 2013, 2015, 2019. SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying what's surviving right now is essentially a watered-down version of that? How is it different? SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Well, this is a moving target, if you will. We're still in discussions, and we are still trying to figure out exactly what mechanism is going to enable us to get the votes that we would need. So, I can't be precise about that, Margaret. It hasn't been finally resolved. But something in the space of expanding background checks, I think, is very -- well, certainly is on the table, and I hope will be part of a final package. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we see overwhelming support in our CBS polling for background checks, which is why it's interesting that it's difficult. There was a Republican congressman in the state of New York. I'm sure you heard about this. Chris Jacobs, he represents a district around Buffalo where there was an awful mass shooting just a few weeks ago. He dropped out of his reelection race after -- seven days after he publicly endorsed a federal assault weapons ban and limits on high-capacity magazines. This is what he had to say. (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE CHRIS JACOBS (R-New York): We have a problem in our country, in terms of both our major parties. If you stray from a party position, you are annihilated. For the Republicans, it came -- it became pretty apparent to me over the last week that that issue is gun control, any gun control. (END VIDEO CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree with him? SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: No, I don't. I think there's a wide range of opinions among elected Republicans just as there are among Republican voters across the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well... SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: In my case, I wrote a bill with Senator Manchin and advocated for expanding background checks in 2013, as you pointed out, again in 2015. We voted on it in 2016. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you couldn't get enough Republicans to vote with you to get it passed. SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: I was reelected -- I was reelected without a primary challenge. So I think that that tells you something also. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well -- excuse me -- I'm sorry. My voice. The president himself has campaigned on this idea that he can be a deal broker. Does he need to get involved? Or does the involvement of the president lessen the chances of success here? SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Yes, the problem is, I think the president might have been a president who would reach across the aisle try to bring people together. But he's chosen not to take that approach since day one. He has sided with the far left of his party and really not reached out to Republicans. He gave a speech on this topic where he advocated policies that he knows for sure have no chance of passing the Senate, probably couldn't even get 50 votes, and hold the Democrats, much less get the 60 we would need. So, once again, the president is not being very helpful. I think, at the end of the day, this is going to come down to whether we can reach a consensus in the United States Senate. There are intensive discussions underway. It includes people who have not been engaged on this issue in the past. I can't -- certainly can't guarantee any outcome. But it feels to me like we are closer than we've been since I have been in the Senate. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you can get four other Republicans to stand with you, the six who are negotiating? SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: My hope is, we'll get a lot more than that. My hope is, we'll get at least half the Republican Conference. You know, that's -- that should be the goal here. We're going to have to be realistic about what can do that. Senator Murphy alluded to the idea that it's not going to be everything certainly that Democrats would like. We'll -- we'll see where it ends up. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a risk that the Republican Party becomes associated with gun violence, if you can't get those votes? SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: You know, look, I think the Republicans have been very consistently supporters of Second Amendment rights. Republican voters expect Republicans to defend the Second Amendment. I think there is a place to land that's consistent with the Second Amendment, as I have been advocating for expanding background checks. By the way, I think encouraging states to have some kind of red flag laws could make sense, as long as there's adequate due process. I think there are school safety provisions, there are mental health issues that we could address. So there are things we could do that would be constructive that are consistent with Republican values, and I'm hoping we'll get there. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time today. We will watch for the outcome of those talks. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Kansas City, Missouri, mayor, Quinton Lucas. He attended the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting last week and joins us today from San Francisco. Mayor Lucas, good morning. Welcome back. QUINTON LUCAS (D-Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Senator Toomey. He made no promises there. You're in a city that is a blue dot in a red state. Are mayors like you just completely hamstrung by state legislatures and the Congress here in Washington? Is there anything you can actually do to control gun violence? MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS: Well, while I believe there are things we can do, I'm incredibly disappointed to hear this big set of ideas that they have and then basically just throwing up their hands and blaming it on prosecutors, fathers not being in the home, any number of issues, other than gun violence in our cities. In the senator's own city, Philadelphia, we see a mass shooting last night. We see them every day around America. And so mayors have agreed to do a number of different things. You've seen my city file lawsuits against gun manufacturers. We'll continue to clamor for more authorities to be able to help prevent gun violence. But more than anything, we need stronger and tougher laws that protect our children, protect our grocery stores, protect our police officers. If you back the blue, you back commonsense gun reform. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in your city, Kansas City, according the FBI's latest data, you rank eighth deadliest in terms of city murder rates. I know you were recently at the White House and told reporters it's important to have locally driven solutions to local problems. So, what is the locally driven solution to gun violence in Kansas City? MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS: Well, prevention is probably the most important step, not just to local gun violence that we see every day, but also mass shootings. If you just have people showing up after a scene, as we've seen tragically in Uvalde and around America, then we will never get in front of this problem. Some of our locally driven solutions has been making sure that we're getting guns out of the hands of domestic violence offenders. But we need the support of ATF. We need more investigations. We need an actual permanent ATF director, very reasonable things that I think the President has proposed, and that we continue not to get through the United States Senate. We need permitting and background checks to make sure our police officers can actually stop suspected violent offenders before they're shooting up grocery stores, clubs, or anything in Kansas City. That's the support we need. And that's what mayors have been clamoring for. What we do not need are solutions that have already been tried and done. I visit schools every day in Kansas City. Almost all of them are fortified. Most of them have armed guards these days, at least one. So these types of solutions they keep saying have been done. And I think, if the Republican Party wants to actually be about solutions, they will say, can't we agree on things that at least will stop gun massacres of our young people? MARGARET BRENNAN: Missouri is one of the, I think, 10 states that allow school districts to have staff carry weapons into the classroom to defend the schools. Is that a practical solution? Does it work in Missouri? MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS: No. No, it does not. You know, sometimes I get asked, is your city ready for a massacre like we saw in Uvalde. And I like to say, while we have great law enforcement, great collaboration with our schools, we are all concerned that someone can still show up with an AR-15, which I have shot before. I'm not against the existence of these firearms. But I think that those are the sorts of things where we will be outmatched almost immediately. And so, no, just having someone in a classroom with a firearm is not a simple solution. And what's more -- and I say this as a parent -- I don't want a first grade teacher necessarily worrying about a classroom of 20 students and also worrying about how she can get the faster draw on a mass shooter with this amazing high-capacity firearm. That is wholly unreasonable. Red flag laws, permitting, background checks are very clear solutions. And I think the United States Congress has an opportunity to act and make us all safer, so we're not reading about a new mass shooting every few days, which has been the story of the past month in the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, gun deaths are at the highest number ever recorded. I mean, there are just incredible numbers. What is the largest source of weapons in Kansas City? Where are the guns coming from? MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS: Well, we've already measured that, often, they're coming across our state line. I talked to Mayor Lori Lightfoot in Chicago the other day after U.S. Conference of Mayors. That's what's happening for many of us. Even in states with responsible gun legislation, at least some, we are seeing that illegal gun trafficking is a huge source of the violent crime incidents in our city. That's why we ask for better enforcement. That's why we ask for better tools. You know, when I was growing up in Missouri, which has always been a state that has supported the Second Amendment, we had requirements that you had to have a license to carry a concealed weapon. We got rid of that. We have constitutional carry like Texas. So folks are walking around every day with lots of firearms and, importantly, without law enforcement solutions to be able to ask people, hey, is your gun licensed? Should you have it? And that leads to tremendous numbers of gun violence in our city. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some outcry this week in your city. There were -- there was video that emerged a 26-year-old woman who was fleeing arrest. She was shot. It got international attention because a witness claimed she was unarmed and pregnant. You said that was false. Can you explain what's happening? MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS: You know, I can explain. Unfortunately, there was a carjacking. The police catch up with the suspect. A woman comes out of the vehicle. She refuses to get down with instructions. And then she runs off with a firearm in her hand. There was an eyewitness who claimed something that was just not factual. Unfortunately, it takes us a few days to get at least a photo out that showed she had a gun in her hand. I think what we continue to deal with -- and this has been discussed nationally -- is that there are concerns with trust of American law enforcement and that's also in my city. That's why I think the step the president took about week ago on making sure we have more police accountability is a good thing. But, in this situation, the police acted within the law and responsibly, and I'm glad that the woman is out of the hospital. But, unfortunately, she's now facing charges. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Lucas, thank you so much for joining us. MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be back in a moment with more Face the Nation. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Thursday evening the congressional committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol will begin laying out its findings in public hearings. Our Scott MacFarlane reports on what's been uncovered up to this point. (Begin VT) SCOTT MACFARLANE (voice-over): An unparalleled moment in American history has given rise to an unprecedented investigation. The January 6 Select Committee is unlike any before it, seven Democrats and two Republicans, both of whom became fierce critics of former President Trump after the Capitol attack. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY (R-Wyoming): I will do everything I can to ensure that the former president never again gets anywhere near the Oval Office. SCOTT MACFARLANE: The committee has completed more than 1,000 depositions and interviews, including with several members of former President Donald Trump's inner circle. And they have collected nearly 140,000 documents. In recent court filings in its battle for e-mails from key witnesses, the committee said it has a good-faith belief former President Trump engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States. And they revealed text messages sent by their own colleagues to Trump's Chief of Staff Mark Meadows strategizing how to overturn the results of the election and the January 6 counting of the electoral votes. Some key figures have defied the committee's subpoenas, including Meadows and five Republican members of the House, including Leader Kevin McCarthy. Two others, former White House aide Steve Bannon and trade adviser Peter Navarro, stand charged by the Justice Department with criminal contempt of Congress for doing so. Late Friday, the committee said they'd been notified that the Justice Department will not be prosecuting Meadows or former White House staffer Dan Scavino for contempt of Congress. The committee is also focused on the roles played by the far right extremist groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, who are accused of conspiracy ahead of the 6th. And the committee has tried to drill into what they call the 187 minutes, what Trump and key White House officials were saying doing and not doing during the roughly three hours as rioters attacked police, swarmed the Capitol, erected a gallows, chanted \"Hang Mike Pence,\" and sought to overturn the election. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: And Scott MacFarlane is here with us. When we come back from this break, we will talk about what we can expect in those hearings. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with House Intelligence Chair and member of the January 6 Committee Adam Schiff. So, stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION\" We're joined now by congressional correspondent Scott MacFarlane. Scott, it's good to have you here at the table. These will be prime time programming hearings on Thursday. What do we expect to hear? SCOTT MACFARLANE: The committee has promised what they call previously unseen material. And we have seen a lot, like a lot, of Capitol riot videos. So it raises the prospect they're going to show us some of their material. According to our reporting, recordings were made - or recordings were requested of some of the top-level witnesses who met with this January 6th committee. We may hear or see some of that. And it's worth reminding people of the range of interviews. Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Rudy Giuliani, and some of the rank-and-file rioters. Watch out for this. We know some of the defendants in the criminal case have gone before this committee, mentioned they have gone before the committee to seek leniency, they have voices that could be heard during these hearings either on tape or live in person. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, some of this will be produced on tape. You know, we've heard from members, like Congressman Jamie Raskin, promises to blow the roof off the House. Are expectations being set too high here? SCOTT MACFARLANE: It's unclear who's going to be in the House looking at the roof. The committee has a series of hearings, likely all of them this month, in June, as America is busy with summer. Also, who are the persuadables? Who has an open mind and is willing to listen and perhaps change their mind based on whatever's being shown by this committee? Or are people's ideas too baked in? And one other thing, Margaret, the Republicans who have defied this committee, the five Republicans subpoenaed who have not come in to speak, and the Republicans who criticized the committee outside, have not paid a political price for doing so. In fact, Margaret, they may be better positioned for their primaries or general elections because of it. That has weakened a bit of foundation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott, I know you'll be busy this week and in the weeks ahead. Thank you for coming in this Sunday. We're going to go now to California Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff. He joins us from Los Angeles. Mr. Chairman, good morning to you. ADAM SCHIFF (Democratic Congressman from California): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: You wear a lot of hats, but I want to ask you about the January 6th committee that you serve on. The Justice Department, as you know, on Friday, decided not to prosecute the former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, or social media director Dan Scavino, for refusing to cooperate with your committee. I know the committee said that was puzzling. Is it your understanding that - that these men are immune from all prosecution? ADAM SCHIFF: No, they're not. And it is very puzzling why these two witnesses would be treated differently than the two that the Justice Department is prosecuting. There is no absolute immunity. These witnesses have very relevant testimony to offer in terms of what went into the violence of January 6th, the propagation of the big lie, and the idea that witnesses could simply fail to show up. And when the statute requires the Justice Department to present those cases to the grand jury, they don't, is deeply troubling. We hope to get more insight from the Justice Department, but it's a, I think, a grave disappointment and could impede our work if other witnesses think they can likewise refuse to show up with impunity. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it because these two men had such close proximity to President Trump, is the executive privilege argument actually applying here? ADAM SCHIFF: That shouldn't be the explanation here because, of course, there are a great many things these witnesses can testify with no even plausible claim of executive privilege. They were both involved in campaign matters. They both have documents that they could offer. None of which is protected by privilege. And the idea that you can simply refuse to show up, rather than show up and say, as to this question I'm going to assert a privilege, that just invites others to be in contempt of Congress or be in contempt of judges around the country in other courtrooms. And I think it's a very dangerous precedent to set. MARGARET BRENNAN: \"New York Times\" was first to report, CBS has confirmed, that Mike Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, actually warned the Secret Service and the lead agent protecting the vice president the day before January 6th that he thought the president would turn on the vice president and that it would pose a direct security risk. We know Mr. Short plans to testify himself before your committee. Is that sufficient? Do you need to hear from the vice president? ADAM SCHIFF: Margaret, we're not commenting on specific witnesses, so I can't confirm or deny who will appear before us. I can say that certainly one of the themes that we will be fleshing out is the fact that in advance of the 6th, that there was an understanding of the propensity for violence that day, of the participation of white nationalist groups, of the effect that the continued propagation of his big lie to rile up the country and rile up the president's base was likely to lead to violence. So, you will see that theme among the narratives that will be exhibited during these hearings. But as to a particular witness, I really can't comment. MARGARET BRENNAN: But if you don't deliver a bombshell on Thursday, don't you run the risk of losing the public's attention here? ADAM SCHIFF: Our goal is to present the narrative of what happened in this country, how close we came to losing our democracy, what led to that violent attack on the 6th. The American people, I think, know a great deal already. They've seen a number of bombshells already. There is a great deal they haven't seen. But perhaps most important is the public hasn't seen it woven together. How one thing led to another. How one line of effort to overturn the election led to another, and, ultimately, led to terrible violence. The first non-peaceful transfer of power in our history. So, we want to tell that comprehensive narrative. And we're aiming at people, an audience, frankly, that still has an open mind about these facts. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ADAM SCHIFF: We want to counter the continuing propagation of big lies. And that's - that's what our goal is. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about inflation, which is a problem throughout the country. The San Francisco Fed said that the American Rescue Plan contributed about 3 percentage points to inflation. It's not the primary driver, but a contributor to it. In hindsight, do you think Democrats should have structured that $2 trillion package differently? Should it have been smaller? ADAM SCHIFF: No, I don't think so. And, of course, there have been other studies that have reached the - the opposite conclusion, that it had an even more minimal impact on inflation. What I do think is the cause and -- MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a non-political group, you know that. ADAM SCHIFF: Well, no, I understand that, but I - but, again, there are studies that show that it had a negligible impact on inflation as well that are also very credible. I think that the reality is, though, and this - this, I think, is borne out by all the evidence, is there was a global inflationary pressure, a global problem with supply chains. Our economy, in fact, grew so fast in the United States that that problem is particularly acute because the deemed, when we emerged, you know, so quickly from the pandemic and grew so many jobs, that the disparity between that demand and the supply was so pronounced as to lead to this inflation. But people are suffering from it. We've got to attack it in every way we can. I think, sadly, the Republicans are getting in our way because they would rather have the issue of inflation than really do something about it to help the country. And this is what we're confronting in Congress and what the administration is battling against. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration seems to also be making some foreign policy decisions that keep inflation in mind as well. We know the president is preparing to travel to Saudi Arabia this summer. And he'll meet with the royal family, including, potentially, Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince, who U.S. intelligence said issued that order to kill or capture a U.S. based writer named Jamal Khashoggi. This is what you said in February of 2021. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ADAM SCHIFF:: I think he should be shunned. I think he should be -- I don't think the president should talk with him. I don't think the president should see him. (END VIDEO CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: Should the president still go to Saudi Arabia and meet with the crown prince? ADAM SCHIFF: In my view, no. I wouldn't go. I wouldn't shake his hand. This is someone who butchered an American resident, cut him up into pieces in the - in the most terrible and pre-meditated way. And until Saudi Arabia makes a radical change in terms of its human rights, I wouldn't want anything to do with him. Now, I understand the degree to which Saudi Arabia controls oil prices. I think that's a compelling argument for us to wean ourselves off of reliance on foreign oil and on oil more globally so we don't have despites and murderers calling the shots. But, no, I wouldn't go. And - and if - if I had to go to the country for some other reason, I wouldn't meet with the crown prince. I think he should be shunned. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there is no way to justify a trip like this, if it is an attempt to get Saudi Arabia to put more oil on the market and lower gas prices? ADAM SCHIFF: Well, in my view, we should make every effort to lower oil prices, but going hat in hand to someone who has murdered an American resident would not be on my list. And I would want to see Saudi Arabia lower their oil prices - or, increase their production, rather. I'd want to see them make changes in their human rights record. I'd want to see them hold people accountable that were involved in that murder and in the torture of other detainees before I would extend that kind of dignity to Saudi Arabia or its leadership. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Chairman Schiff, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by University of Michigan Professor Betsey Stevenson. She previously served as the Department of Labor's chief economist under former President Obama, and she is in Ann Arbor this morning. Betsey, welcome to FACE THE NATION. BETSEY STEVENSON (Professor Of Economics and Public Policy, University of Michigan and Former Labor Department Chief Economist): Hi. Good morning. It's a pleasure to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have seen more people return to the workforce. We saw that in the jobs number that we just got. The participation rate is back to almost where we were before the pandemic. But you've pointed out there are still problems in childcare, in nursing, in some of those care-giving roles. What does that signify to you? BETSEY STEVENSON: Yes, I think it's important to realize when we look -- take a look at the labor market, that we haven't seen all the jobs come back in services. We've definitely seen the jobs come back in the goods- producing sector. In the service sector, in health care and education and particularly caregiving, we haven't seen everyone get hired back. Maybe because people are slow to go back to wanting to consume those services. And it may be that it's just hard to find people to take those jobs right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, this is all -- all these dots connect, but on the specific issue of inflation and risks to the economy, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon said a few days ago, the hurricane is right out there, down the road, coming our way. We don't know if it's a minor one or Superstorm Sandy. You've got to brace yourself. So, what should consumers be preparing for? BETSEY STEVENSON: Well, you know, honestly, what everybody wants consumers to do is slow their role a little bit on spending. And that would actually bring some of the - some of the pressure on prices down. And so, you know, the Fed's raising rates, hoping that consumers will spend a little bit less. All of the, you know, accusations around how much did the stimulus spending contribute, it's really about, did we give people too much money in their pockets. They're in some of the best financial shape they've ever been. And the result is that demand is outstripping supply a little bit. So, if people were to pull back voluntarily, then the Fed actually has less work to do. So, I think that message of, you know, brace yourself, is great, it's sort of what we need to do. But the reality is that we don't have to stop job growth in order to stop inflation. We might end up accidentally stopping job growth, pushing ourselves into a recession, but it's not a fate of complete. We do not have to do that. What we need to do is get demand down a little bit while supply can continues to grow. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to go back on what you just said there in terms of fiscal spending, that's some of the - the congressional money that was thrown at the - the problem, the emergency spending. Do you think that all of this should have been structured differently? Whether it was President Trump or President Biden, should they be sending checks to people at home or was that really the main flaw in the deal they pushed through? BETSEY STEVENSON: You know, I think that there's a little bit of a glass half empty, glass half full perspective here. I mean we had unemployment at 6.4 percent when they started designing the American Rescue Plan. And most people predicted that it was going to play out a lot like 2008. In 2008 it took eight years to get unemployment below 4 percent. The Congressional Budget Office thought it was going to take six years to get unemployment below 4 percent. That it was going to take until 2026. So, of course, the idea was, let's make sure that we are supporting businesses, that we're supporting families, so that we can have the fastest economic recovery we've ever had. We accomplished that and we added 7.3 million jobs since that American Rescue Plan passed. The problem was, you know, things went even faster than expected. So, you know, we can look back and say, could we have done the same thing with a little bit less spending? Maybe, or maybe not. Maybe we'd be in a situation right now with 5 percent unemployment, with millions of people who are in jobs today, would still be sitting on the sidelines. And that's a situation that I think nobody wanted. We wanted to get back to where we were before as quickly as possible. And it's absolutely clear that the fast action that Congress took, every single time from the beginning of the pandemic to the American Rescue Plan, is why we've had the fast recovery that we have right now. And we just saw it in the Labor report yesterday that there are more opportunities than Americans have ever had before to find the job that's going to work for them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BETSEY STEVENSON: They're getting hired at incredibly high rates. And what we've seen for the bottom part of the income distribution is household incomes are up nearly 12 percent, even when we adjust for inflation. So, when you ask me, should we not have done that? I think we absolutely should have. For most families, they're better off, and they know it. What we're scared about is, we see prices rising, we want to know how long this good (ph) time can last. MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. And that's my question to you, because the Fed can act really quickly here to try to cool things off, but they can't stop the war in Ukraine, they can't stop Covid. Should consumers be prepared that high prices are just going to be with us for the foreseeable future? BETSEY STEVENSON: Well, I think what we want - you know, I don't think we should think high prices are going to be here for the foreseeable future. I do think the Fed's going to take some action. I think they're going to bring prices - they're going to bring the inflation rate down, not prices, but they will bring the inflation rate down, but they're not going to be able to change those relative prices. So, gas is still going to be expensive relative to other things until we end this war in Ukraine. I mean, look, the price of gas is up $1.50 a gallon since Putin started amassing troops at the border. The Fed can't undo that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. BETSEY STEVENSON: But what it can do is reduce the rate of price increases on average. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. BETSEY STEVENSON: But I still think you should be thinking about, you know, is it a good time to get a fuel efficient car or buy that electric bicycle. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Betsey Stevenson, thank you for your analysis. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Dr. Walter Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes at the National Institutes of Health. He's also the co-chair of the NIH's Long Covid Initiative and joins us from the NIH campus in Bethesda. Covid survivors often suffer some kind of symptom for weeks, if not months afterwards. How do we know that this is attributable to Covid and not caused by something else? WALTER J. KOROSHETZ, M.D. (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes Director): The vast numbers of people who are affected, the fact that the symptoms occurred with the infection and, in many cases, persist after the infection, it's that temporal relationship that really goes to causality. There are - there are some unusual features, though. Some people get better and then they develop the symptoms back again. There, you know, it's a little less clear. MARGARET BRENNAN: And what are the symptoms because I've read such a broad array, from brain fog to people having difficulty getting lung capacity back. Senator Tim Kaine talked about feeling like he had Alka-Seltzer bubbles on his skin. WALTER J. KOROSHETZ: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is a symptom of long Covid? WALTER J. KOROSHETZ: The great difficulty is the fact that the heterogeneity of the symptoms is quite vast. But I think there are some characteristics that make it very unusual. People develop usually more than one symptom. There's usually a cluster of symptoms. And they are falling into certain categories. So, there are neurological troubles, like you mentioned, trouble concentrating, sleeping, sometimes peripheral nerve trouble, that sense of the bubbling on your skin. Some people have pulmonary difficulties with continued sense of shortness of breath and a cough. Some people have cardiovascular trouble. A lot of trouble with exercise and tolerance. Fatigue is just pretty much with most of the people have trouble. There's digestive track trouble as well. And people tend to have, you know, a couple here and a couple there, but they are all seemingly tied to having had their Covid infection. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the NIH recover study was launched in February 2021. You've got about a billion dollars or more funding the research you are doing. What have you found in that study, and when will your results be made public? WALTER J. KOROSHETZ: We have upwards of around 4,000 people already enrolled, which makes it the largest in-person study of the post-Covid situation. And, right now, we're collecting data on the different symptoms. We want to understand the underlying biology that's causing this trouble. This is not a new problem, exactly, because there are other infections in the past that have led to similar symptom causes in people after infection. We've never been able to figure that out. This is our chance, I think, to delve deep and to try and understand what is going on in the biologic recovery in the people who don't make a good recovery. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, at this point, I mean some of the studies that have been done suggest that 60 percent of long Covid patients are female. That neurological symptoms can persist for about 15 months or more. WALTER J. KOROSHETZ: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC says Covid survivors have twice the risk for developing a pulmonary embolism or respiratory conditions. One in five has a condition that could be due to Covid. Are all of those things consistent with what you are seeing right now? WALTER J. KOROSHETZ: I - I think so. This is a significant problem for the country going forward. What we don't know is how long it will last. We don't know what the long-term effects, you know, a decade now from what has -- Covid has done to our health in the country. It looks as though, right now, there's also an increased chance of developing diabetes after Covid. We don't know about heart disease, dementia, all the other diseases that naturally occur, either. But that's kind of what we have to get at the bottom of. MARGARET BRENNAN: How is it that we are two years or more into this pandemic, and we know so little? And do we at least know that there are treatments for long Covid? WALTER J. KOROSHETZ: We don't have like a magic bullet, a cure for the - for long Covid because we don't understand what's driving it biologically. And so to get that, you know, holy grail, we need to understand what is wrong in the body that's causing these symptoms, clusters of symptoms in people. And for the other infections that have occurred in the past, we've never been able to figure that out. So there's people with post-infectious mononucleosis, people with post-lyme (ph), they've been suffering the same things. There's a condition call myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic fatigue syndrome. That looks almost identical to what we're seeing. And these have existed for decades. We've never been able to figure them out. And yet people should have hope because from what we've seen so far, people, after Covid, even months after, still are getting better. So, it's kind of targeting the symptoms and targeting the underlying biology, the two main avenues we're going after. MARGARET BRENNAN: And for someone who's listening to you right now and they think they might have long Covid, what would you advise them to do when they see their doctor? WALTER J. KOROSHETZ: Yes. Just being forthright with your physician and telling him what your problems are is the first step and not being afraid of it. The knowledge about this condition is spreading like wildfire across the country. So it's not a brand new thing anymore. It's called the post- Covid condition. So, it's actually - it's actually getting out into the general medical practice now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor, thank you for your research. We will track it. And we know the effects of this pandemic will be with us for some time in many different ways. WALTER J. KOROSHETZ: Thank you, Margaret. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Be sure to tune in to our primetime coverage of the January 6th investigation hearings.

I know our listeners are going to be very interested in your insights. And I think this is a terrific time to have a conversation with you because the president is just finishing up his first year in office. And there is, as you know, better than anybody, there's a large number of really critical national security issues at play at the moment. So welcome to the show and I'm really looking forward to the conversation. DEREK CHOLLET: Thanks, Michael. As always, it's great to be with you. Great to hear your voice and really looking forward to talking today. MICHAEL MORELL: I do need to let everyone know that before you joined the Biden administration that you and I worked together at the same consulting firm, Beacon Global Strategies. I just needed to get that out of the way. DEREK CHOLLET: And then before that, in the Obama administration. MICHAEL MORELL: Absolutely. Absolutely. So I'm going to need to be tougher on you, Derek, because that's right - I'm just kidding. So, Derek, before we get into kind of the issues that we both want to talk about, I want to start by asking what is the Counselor at the State Department and what does the Counselor do? DEREK CHOLLET: It's a great question, Michael. And again, it's great to be with you. And yes, the Counselor job, it sounds it's one of those jobs - and there's many of these kinds of jobs in Washington - it sounds entirely made-up, but it's actually got a long history here in the Department. That position has existed for over a century. And you know, I am humbled by some of my predecessors in this job going back many, many decades from George Kennan to Walt Rostow to Bob Zoellick to Eliot Cohen during the Bush administration. And so the job obviously is a bit of what one makes of it and what the Secretary of State wants it to be. And in this job - I had the good fortune of working with Secretary Blinken, as you did as well during the Obama administration. And of course, I went back with him to the Hill Days, Capitol Hill, when we both worked in the Senate together 20 years ago. So I've known him quite some time, and I was part of the State Department transition team a year ago, in November, December, January last year. And so in many ways, my job here on day one, January 20th of 2021 was sort of a continuation of what I'd been doing on the transition. And the first year of any administration, Michael, as you know well, is quite hectic and dramatic in some ways because so many positions are unfilled early on. And this year, of course, we had a particular case of that with so many of our senior folks who took a while for them to get Senate confirmation. I was not confirmed by the Senate. I didn't have to go through that process, so I was here on day one. So the first few months I was doing, I felt like, about five or six different jobs, all at the same time.  But what I do now as we're in that steady state, I would say a third to half of my time is spent really just dealing with the inbox that the Secretary's dealing with. So part of my role is literally as a counselor, kind of alter ego, someone who's just helping him and other senior officials here in the department, help navigate the department, help think through the issues, just blocking and tackling every day. So whether it's Russia/Ukraine or Iran or what's happening in Libya and Bosnia to China, you name it, whatever is kind of in the inbox, I'm helping to deal with. But then also there is, since I have the benefit of not having, as I say, line authority, I'm not someone who has hundreds or thousands of people reporting up to me, so I'm not burdened by a lot of administrative tasks, I have the bandwidth to, either by design or by default, dive into certain issues.  And so what I mean by that is there are certain issues that will come up and someone's got to deal with them and I can be available to do that. So that's more the default school. Then there's the design; things that we decide, I decide, talking to the secretary, is a priority for the United States. It's a situation where having someone close to the Secretary here on the seventh floor of the State Department working the issue would be helpful. And so over the last year, whether it's Libya or Bosnia or the situation right now in Myanmar, those are things where I've tried to put a little extra energy and effort here behind those issues because they're priorities for Secretary Blinken, but they're also priorities for the U.S. government. So it's a great job, it's one that every day is a little different and I have to be, in some case, sometimes, a mile wide and an inch deep on issues. And I know you're really familiar with that yourself, Michael, although you're always a mile wide and a mile deep in my experience. But you know, and I think, you know, over time, I expect there'll be some issues that over the course of this coming year will continue on into, picking up from where I was working in last year. But I fully expect that over the next few weeks there'll be things popping on my plate that I wasn't expecting and that's part of the nature of the job. MICHAEL MORELL: OK, that's great, Derek. So, here's what I'd like to do for the rest of the interview, is, I'd like to focus part of the interview on key substantive issues. And then the back half of the interview, I'd like to focus on those things that really determine the health of American diplomacy. So break it into those two pieces. And I think the place to start, obviously, is Russia and Ukraine. And I think all our listeners understand kind of where we are. Putin's demands regarding NATO expansion, particularly with regard to Ukraine. His threat to invade Ukraine if he doesn't get what he wants, our tough response that we'll never walk away from the concept that countries in Europe get to choose their own security path. Our threats regarding tough sanctions, if he should invade, the current talks underway in Europe, etc. So people know all that, I think, and with that as background, let me ask a couple of questions. Why do you think Putin chose now to play this game? DEREK CHOLLET: You know, it's a great question, and I don't have a satisfactory answer. I mean, this is something -- I think it's really important to note that this is an entirely unprovoked crisis. I mean, there's no NATO threat to Russia. There's no Ukrainian threat to Russia. That's all preposterous. So why he chose this moment is sort of anyone's guess. The Russian foreign minister recently gave a press conference where he said, \"Well, Russian officials have just run out of patience on these issues,\" because, as you said, these issues are not new issues, right? The NATO enlargement process is one that has basically been one of a policy that's been 25 years in process here. And so I don't know why. I mean, whether it's for his own domestic politics, whether it's because he perceives potential weakness on the side of the West, whether he's just fed up. I don't know. In some ways, it doesn't matter in the sense of, \"Why now.\" But what matters the most is what we're doing about it. MICHAEL MORELL: And so how do we think about de-escalating? What's kind of the strategy here? DEREK CHOLLET: Well, it's a multi-pronged strategy, for one. And you've seen that play out over the last few weeks. Clearly the foundation of the strategy is showing that we are at one with our allies and partners in the region. And that's why it was very important for us, when the Russians unveiled, in this most unusual negotiating tactic of laying out their bottom lines publicly at the beginning, several weeks ago, we made clear to them that, whereas there are certainly some issues that are relevant for a bilateral discussion - we've been having bilateral talks on security issues with the Russians throughout the past year through the Strategic Stability Dialogue, the dialogue that Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman leads - that there are a lot of issues that the Russians raised, particularly when it comes to the future of NATO, the future of Ukraine, that are not going to be discussed in a bilateral US-Russia context. They are going to be discussed alongside our NATO partners at NATO, or it's for a broader European discussion, which we said should occur through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. So that's why, the over the course of a week, the United States, working with our allies and partners, had these engagements with the Russian side, bilateral engagements talking about issues, security issues relevant between just the two of us -mainly the weapons of strategic stability issues - and then the NATO discussion at the NATO-Russia Council. So we're at 30 with 30 allies and the Russians and the OSCE bringing the 57 member countries of the OSCE together. So that's thing one, is to show that we are in lockstep with our partners.  Second is to be very clear to the Russians that there's an alternative path here: there's the path of confrontation and escalation, and that's the path that they've been on now for some time. But there's also a diplomatic path where we are willing to engage in talks with them alongside our allies and partners on issues and in good faith, talk to them about some of the concerns they have. We've made very clear that there are issues that are, from our perspective, totally off the table. As you said, on NATO's enlargement and closing NATO's open door, on trying to essentially roll back what has happened over the last quarter century in terms of European security, which the Russians are seeking; that's non-negotiable for us. But there are other areas, for example, on transparency on military exercises or deployment of offensive missiles, things of that nature that we'd be willing to talk to them about. But it would need to happen on a reciprocal basis and have an honest dialogue on this. And what we've been doing is testing whether the Russians are willing to have that dialogue. We put a lot on the table, us and our allies and partners in the past few weeks. They're digesting that and now we've got to see what the way forward is. But we are then preparing - and this would then be the third track - preparing for the worst and making clear to the Russians that if they were to choose the course of escalation and further intervention inside Ukraine, there will be, Secretary Blinken has said often, serious consequences and that they will regret those actions. And so, that's what we're doing for now. From where I sit here in the State Department, we can't control what's in Putin's head. We can't control what he's going to decide. And our best assessment as of now is he hasn't made up his mind yet. What we can control is how we are engaging with our allies and partners, we can control how we're preparing for the worst and how we're engaging in in this diplomacy. MICHAEL MORELL: So my reading of the media and - I don't know whether it's right or wrong - but my reading of the media is that the talks so far have not gone well. Is that accurate? DEREK CHOLLET: Well, they've not really been negotiations. It's been more of an airing of positions. So that's  going to be very not unexpected in sort of contentious circumstances like this. So we had low expectations for this first round of diplomacy, and I can say those expectations were met. But now we have to test and see what the way forward is. And we were not thinking that this was going to be solved over the course of one meeting or three meetings in one week; that it's an opening bid here, and now we'll see where this takes us. MICHAEL MORELL: I will ask one more question on Russia/Ukraine, and that's if we have to impose sanctions because the Russians do something stupid here, Russia's not Iran or North Korea, right? When we imposed massive sanctions on those countries, there were not a lot of U.S. companies doing business in either North Korea or Iran. But as you know, there's hundreds, if not thousands, of U.S. companies doing business in Russia. So how should they be thinking about sanctions? And if you're forced by Putin's actions to impose sanctions, will you give them time to unwind their business operations? How should they think about this at this point? DEREK CHOLLET: Well, we're doing the work within our own government, but then also with our allies and partners. Because obviously, as you remember well from eight years ago in 2014, the U.S. can do quite a bit on its own, but it's far more effective, in terms of the overall message, but also just the impact, if you're doing it in conjunction with, in particular, our European partners in the case of Russia. So as we're working through these issues, we are very mindful of the broader impact. And you're right, Russia, it's a completely different economy than in these other circumstances where we placed pretty significant sanctions against countries. And so we're looking at how we can best mitigate the worst from blowing back on us, but then also, obviously, we want to do things that don't do undue harm to innocent people. And so, this a very, very delicate set of decisions around taking those actions. It's really going to produce a lot of pain. And there are - and the Russians are well aware of things that we have not done up to now in response to Russia's behavior - whether it was what they did in Ukraine eight years ago or what they did interfere in our election in 2016 or the poisoning and attempted assassination of its political enemies at home. We've levied many sanctions against Russia over the last decade or so. And there's potentially more to come if they choose this course of escalation. But one of the messages we've had, not just to our European partners, but also to partners and allies around the world, as we've been discussing this brewing crisis over the last several months, has been that, if Russia chooses this course of escalation, it is going to be not just an issue for Ukraine. It's not just a European security issue. It's not just a U.S.-Russia issue. It's going to be a global issue because it's going to have global impacts. And so it's an all of our interests, and we hope that all of our partners are sending the same message to Moscow, which is: Choose the path of diplomacy here. Because if they take the steps we're worried that they're going to take it's going to have a huge impact on the global agenda over the next year. MICHAEL MORELL: So second issue is Iran. Again, I think my listeners kind of know the state of play here. A nuclear deal in 2015; the U.S. pulls out of that deal in 2018 and reimposes bilateral sanctions on Iran. The Iranians, after some time, eventually respond by taking more and more aggressive steps on the nuclear front.  We see aggressive covert action by the Israelis to undermine the Iranian program. We see calls in Israel for military action, right? All of this is not good. So, a couple of questions. How are the how are the negotiations going with the Iranians? Path to the to a deal seems pretty narrow to me. What's your sense? DEREK CHOLLET: Yeah. And just to just to add to the list of troubling developments, the real spike in attacks through Iranian proxies on U.S. diplomats, U.S. military forces, allies as well. Coming back into government this year after having been out for a few years, that's something that's noticeably different and more concerning. MICHAEL MORELL: It's worse than it's been in a long time. DEREK CHOLLET: Yeah, it's worse. And you can see the trend line really spikes after the withdrawal out of the JCPOA three years ago. Well, look, we have been the last year working it through with our European partners through these negotiations in Vienna. We've been willing to negotiate directly with the Iranians. The Iranians have not taken us up on that. So it's been indirect negotiations, so-called proximity talks, really. Rob Malley, our special envoy, and his team are in Vienna at the same time, the Europeans and Iranians are and they're all kind of working through one another to have these negotiations. We had a long pause in those talks when the new Iranian government came into office, and so they've restarted just right around after Thanksgiving and continued on, here, now, into the early new year. I could say progress is fitful. The talks are still ongoing, which is a good thing, I guess, given some of the concerns we had about the makeup of the new Iranian government. But the problem is, the clock is ticking on Iran's capabilities and they're not standing in place and the runway that we have to have some kind of diplomatic outcome that would be something that would serve our interests is running short. So that's the worry. Now, we're going to still push hard at these talks and, you know, they're continuing on as we speak. But we're well aware that time is running out and we've made very clear to the Iranians and, very importantly, the Europeans and the Russians and the Chinese, who are also part of these talks, are also making clear to the Iranians that we expect to see something from them on this. And this is one area where, despite all of the turbulence in the US-Russia relationship over the last year, particularly in the last couple of months, the Russians are still cooperating with us quite impressively at these talks, have been being relatively helpful. So, we'll see. But this has been really tough. I have to say it's one of the more regretful things that we've inherited,  is the situation with Iran and the withdrawal from the JCPOA, which - it's very hard to conjure up how in any way that served our interests, given where Iran's nuclear program currently stands and the fact that we're left with some pretty bad options right now in terms of the way forward. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. What's so stark here for me, Derek, is that no deal seems to mean either war - you know, we haven't taken that option off the table. The president has made that clear, and you always have the possibility of the Israelis going it alone. So, no deal means either war or, it seems to me, acquiescence to Iran achieving its objective of getting to the threshold capability for a nuclear weapon. So is there another option in a no-deal situation or are we stuck with one of those? DEREK CHOLLET: Well, you know, I think that there can be another option. Clearly, there is - even though Iran is under tremendous economic pressure, you can still dial that up further. And the Iranians are keen to get some economic relief. There unquestionably is leverage. It's important to note that the Biden administration has not lifted a single sanction on Iran that was in place a year ago before we took office. So the Iranians want economic relief. I think it's one of the reasons they're at the table and they're willing to talk. So we could go the other direction and dial that up further. But this is definitely a universe of bad choices. And they were never good, but they were made sort of worse by, I think, the decision to pull out of the JCPOA. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. The third issue I wanted to ask about is Afghanistan as a safe haven for terrorists. I was struck by General McKenzie's public comments a couple of weeks ago about at least him seeing the beginnings of a reconstruction of al-Qaeda and ISIS in Afghanistan. And I'm wondering how it's going, putting together a plan - which I assume involves some diplomacy with frontline states - in bringing together a plan to collect intelligence and then being able to action targets if we have to do that. DEREK CHOLLET: It's obviously an issue we've been really focused on. And as you know well, the ISIS-K issue, really got worse with the release of - when the Taliban started to take back territory and released a lot of prisoners, including prisoners that didn't serve their own interests, ISIS-K folks who were going after the Taliban. So that is what I would say is the most acute threat right now, terrorism-wise, coming out of Afghanistan -- although we are watching really closely the AQ threat. We, prior to the withdrawal in August, but after the president's decision to execute the withdrawal of U.S. forces, were focusing on the so-called over-the-horizon effort to ensure that we can preserve our CT goals there, and something we're really focused on talking obviously with with the border states and other states where we can, you know, basically continue to ensure that our interests are served in terms of placing capabilities there. I can say that, we've had reasonably good cooperation along those lines. And this is one area where, when it comes to ISIS-K, oddly this is an area where where we and the Taliban actually have an alignment of interests because ISIS-K is no friend of the Taliban, either. Now, the Taliban's not exactly a partner; nothing close to it. But this is one area where they're also taking action and being attacked by ISIS-K. So this is going to be one of the enduring challenges we face in the coming years as we watch what's happening in Afghanistan. We're obviously very focused, continue to be very focused, on getting anyone out of Afghanistan, the very few remaining Americans, but also those Afghans who've served with Americans who are still in Afghanistan, who want to get out. We are working hard to get them out. And then also, of course, thinking and trying to take some action to address the acute humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, which is only going to be getting worse as the winter sets in. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. And only at the end of the day, feeds potential extremism. DEREK CHOLLET: Right, exactly. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Derek, while we're on Afghanistan, I just want to ask about the chaotic nature of our withdrawal. To me, it did not seem to need to be so chaotic. The administration promised a kind of lessons-learned study at some point. We haven't seen that yet. I'm just wondering how you think about how we left and what we might have been able to do better? DEREK CHOLLET: Well, you know, you're right, it was a very, very difficult situation. I mean, in some ways, the nature of any evacuation, as I've sort of thought thought back through history, whether it's Cambodia, Vietnam 1975, or it's Libya 2011, Yemen 2015, there's sort of an element of chaos kind of inherent in any of these situations.  Obviously, in Afghanistan, no one saw the collapse of the government as rapidly as it came. General Milley was quoted as saying, several months back, that there was no piece of intelligence he saw, and I can share the sentiment, that said the government was going to collapse in a matter of a couple of weeks. And so there are a lot of lessons to be learned here. We in the State Department have launched an after-action review and lessons learned review that's in process now. It's going to be completed in a couple months or so, and I believe the IC is doing something similar. I think DOD's doing something similar. So, you know, because the Secretary committed, when this was happening, that we want to take a close look, not just at what happened during the evacuation itself in that two-week period, but also take a look back from, starting in February 2020, when the agreement was struck with the Taliban by the previous administration to pull out all U.S. forces by May 1st; I mean, that was the policy of record when the Biden administration took office. That, just in a matter of a few months in May of 2021, all U.S. forces were expected to be out of Afghanistan. So, what sort of preparations were made in that year, essentially, prior to the Biden administration taking office for a full U.S. withdrawal? But I do think it's also just really important to stress here, Michael, that, as chaotic as that moment was, 120,000 people got out of Afghanistan, and that was something that was only possible because U.S. military forces, U.S. diplomats ran to the fire and worked around the clock in what was, I think, an unprecedented, extraordinary humanitarian operation; something that had never been done before. Just the degree of difficulty, it's kind of hard to get your head around it, because here was a country we essentially had withdrawn from everywhere but the airport, and we didn't control anything outside the wire, and we were still able to get 120,000 people out.  You know, in Vietnam, when we left, when we were wheels up out of the embassy compound, we left that country. We didn't stay at the airport for several weeks trying to get people out. And so, there's also a lot of really heroic stories as part that effort by folks down range who were able to get a lot of people back to safety and get as many of them as possible - obviously, many here in the United States, but elsewhere around the world - where they can build better lives. MICHAEL MORELL: OK, maybe the the biggest long-term issue here: China. And I could ask a thousand questions, right? We could talk for days about this. But I really want to boil it down to two.  And the first one is what does the President, what does the Secretary see as the threat or the challenge in China's rise? In other words, why should the average American citizen care about this? How does this impact them? DEREK CHOLLET: Well, I mean, you've seen it, whether it's COVID, whether it's supply chains, whether it's our changing climate, whether it's our security interests, that China's rise is impacting all of those and many, many more areas and not necessarily in positive ways. And so, China - there's nothing inherent about China's rise that means that it has to be a confrontational relationship with the United States. China is, as you know better than I, is choosing to define their rise in ways that are confrontational, increasingly confrontational with the United States and our partners. And as many of the rules of the 21st century are being written, particularly in the new technology space, global economy, China is playing in a way where it wants to write the rules in its favor and not ours. And that matters. Now there are going to be issues where we want to work with China, whether it's changing climate, whether, obviously, global health - it would be great if we could work with China on global health; they've been less willing to do so than we have - which kind of illustrates that the US-China relationship is really complex. I mean, it's hard to put it on a bumper sticker. If you tried, you'd really need a really long bumper, because there are elements of the relationship that are confrontational, no question about it. There are elements that are competitive and we are more than happy and willing and look forward to the competition with China as long as we're all playing by the same rules. And then there's going to be elements of the relationship that are confrontational. MICHAEL MORELL: So the second question is, do you guys have a strategy for dealing with China or are you still working on the strategy? Do you have a set of objectives for what you want the US-China relationship to look like in the long term? Do you have a plan for achieving that? And the reason I ask is because I haven't seen the president give a speech or the secretary give a speech and say, \"Here's our strategy.\" So where are we on that? DEREK CHOLLET: Yeah. So there's been a lot of discussion of this over the last year. Obviously, a lot of thought went into this during the president's campaign and then before he took office. But now that we've been in office and sort of dealing with the inbox and thinking through what the possibilities are, a lot of thought going into strategy. Very much the intent is, the understanding is --  because it's important, we're going to be talking about this more publicly in the coming months. Clearly, it's very important for the American people, for the rest of the world, for our allies, for the Chinese to understand what our perspective is and what guardrails we want to put on the relationship and what our hopes are and what our concerns are. So we have worked very hard, and as you know, Michael, well, it's hard to do this often in a government where the urgent pushes out the important to have a lot of strategic discussions internally at the highest levels at all about what we are trying to achieve, what's realistic, what tools we have, what could we do differently? What have we inherited that actually works and we shouldn't try to fix it because it's working fine? So I expect that - we're well aware we're at one of those moments in history where it's very important - obviously the president, secretary, all of us - to be articulating this strategy publicly. And that's going to be something that folks will be seeing in the coming year. MICHAEL MORELL: Derek, let me shift to those enablers that I talked about of U.S. power and U.S. diplomacy, and maybe the first one is allies. Obviously, you guys inherited a situation where our allies were not particularly happy with the United States. Where do we stand with those relationships? DEREK CHOLLET: If I was going to be flip: in some cases, there was nowhere to go but up. So look, I think this is, and obviously here at the State Department and for Secretary Blinken, this has been perhaps the most important project of the year, the first year, which is, rebuilding that foundation of allies and partners. And for many reasons, we inherited a situation where some of those most important partnerships were under a great degree of stress. And so we tried to both shore up and revitalize and energize those existing partnerships, whether it's NATO or with the E.U. or with our Asian treaty allies, but also try to breathe new life and create new mechanisms like in the Indo-Pacific, for example, with the so-called Asian Quad - India, the United States and Australia and Japan -where it had been in existence before, but we elevated it up to leaders level. And now it's something where it's, sort of, perhaps some of our partners were a little tentative about it early on; now it's a thing. I mean, we're having another summit this year and it's a very useful mechanism and others want in, right?  Similarly, trying to re-energize our engagements with ASEAN - this is something I've been involved with a bit where, for a lot of reasons, there was a sense that the US had been absent from Southeast Asia for the previous few years, and that I think was a huge missed opportunity. It's also a place where China is playing, obviously, pretty seriously. And so trying to elevate our game there and the president in the coming months will hopefully be able to host ASEAN leaders here in Washington. I say \"hopefully\" host because of COVID, some of our events and interactions have been limited. But I mean, it seems to us that's our edge. Our allies and partners is what makes American leadership so unique. When you think of Russia and China, for example, they don't have a lot of friends, right? They have countries that maybe work with them because obviously, in China's case, the economy is, you know, they can coerce a lot of folks. They can't be ignored in some cases. But who are their allies? Who are the countries that have signed up to come to their defense if they were to come under attack? And so that's something that we can't take for granted. It's not a protection racket, it's not something where it's just purely transactional. These alliances are really what make the United States unique and also when it comes to solving any problems out there, whether it's dealing with threats, whether it's seizing opportunities, we're never able to do all this in the 21st century without strong allies and partners, so that's the foundation. MICHAEL MORELL: Yes, I agree with you 100 percent. And I think, a couple of missteps here and there, you know, the Australian submarine deal, etc, but you guys have done a really good job, right? Here's the question I get from the former officials I used to work with in our allied countries. What they say to me is, you know, \"The Biden administration is back. We feel we're in a much better situation. But Michael, can you guarantee me that we won't be back in the same mess in 2024 or 2028?\" And I don't have an answer to that question. What would you say to them? DEREK CHOLLET: So, you know, look, I think in some ways we to deal with what we have in the here and the now in the present moment. And I can't, you know, sort of like the serenity prayer - like, I can't think too far. I can't think of things that are beyond my control, like three or four years from now, eight years from now. What we can do is control what we're doing today and what I can say, the positive thing out there, despite all of the turmoil that the United States has been through, and all the drama of some of your alliance relationships over the last few years, there's still a tremendous demand signal for U.S. leadership. And a respect for U.S. leadership. And I have to confess, I have been a little surprised over the last year, expecting that we'd hear more of, as I've gone around the world talking to allies and partners of, you know, \"Well, you guys - we're done with you. We're moving on.\" No, it's, \"Thank goodness you're back,\" - meaning that the U.S. is back and trying to be a problem solver. Not that we agree on everything all the time or that we're going to make everyone happy all the time, but that we're trying to be constructive and trying to lead. And there's a demand for that. And we go through this with the faith that if we do that day to day, day in, day out, that that's the best proof point we can make that these things have value for the future and we can avoid a return to the turmoil that these alliance relationships suffered through. That's the best we can do. And there's really no alternative. I mean, the only alternative is not to try. And so you don't kind of do diplomacy if you don't have hope that things can work, if you don't think anything's going to work -- MICHAEL MORELL: --  go to the intelligence community. [Laughter] DEREK CHOLLET: Exactly. Right. So that's kind of the way we approach it. And as I said, the fact that people want us to be at the table, want us not just to be at the table, but to be driving an agenda, looking to the U.S. for answers -- I tell my friends from Nebraska, where I grew up, saying, that's a unique thing. Not a lot of countries have that  kind of stature where people are caring about, you know, they want us there. MICHAEL MORELL: So the other kind of piece of diplomacy here is the health of the Department, right? This is my view, you don't have to say this, but it's my view that the State Department has been underfunded for a very, very long time. And, post-9/11, the Defense Department, the intelligence community get tons of new money and the State Department gets nothing. And then during during the last four years, you had probably, more than any other agency in the national security community, you had an outflow of people. So where are you guys today on sort of rebuilding the department? DEREK CHOLLET: Sure. Well, I'm glad you asked that because this has been a big priority for for Secretary Blinken and all of us. And you're right, I mean, the Department, going back 30 years, the State Department has often gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to funding relative to DOD or to the intelligence community. It's gotten worse over the last decade or so, in particular the last four or five years. And then for, again, a variety of reasons, under the previous previous administration, this Department was under a lot of stress and the workforce was beleaguered. And layer in on top of that COVID, which we all suffered through in or out of government. But doing, as you know well from the intel community side, DOD, doing national security work remotely is very, very hard. And obviously at the State Department, where there's a lot of travel and in-person interaction is so important, you either can't do that or you're taking risks doing that, it adds another layer of stress to what was already a stressful situation. So one of the things that Secretary Blinken has said is the biggest priority is to return the health of the Department - first of all, ensure that we've got people in the seats. There had been a tremendous amount of vacancies at senior levels. Many, many ambassadors still today are now at post and they had been held vacant by the previous team, so we've obviously worked hard to amend that. We've embarked on a pretty bold modernization agenda here at the Department. Now that's not a new thing, for a secretary to come in and say they want to modernize the Department. And so we're not looking to kind of brand it as some big new initiative, but there is a lot of work going into making sure that we can recruit and retain the best possible workforce to have a workforce that is agile, that's stronger, that's effective and of course, more diverse and really reflects the best of America. So this work, like so much of the work we do around here is it's like turning an aircraft carrier. You're not going to be able to do it all at once, right? So this year was about setting the agenda and putting some quick wins on the board and also kind of getting the course, the navigation put in. And then now we've got a lot of work to do in the coming years to deliver on some of that. And as a first matter, leave this place in better shape than you found it, but then also, hopefully, put some put some reforms in motion here that over the coming decade will really play out. I can say despite a lot of the departures and the trauma that that the State Department went through in previous years, there's a lot of talent here. I mean, the folks who were here that I got to know during the transition are just fantastic. And so, yes, a lot of talent left, but a lot of really, really first-rate folks who are here working hard every day under what have been difficult conditions. MICHAEL MORELL: Derek, thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it. I think the the main thing that people will walk away with is it's fantastic to know that at the most senior levels of our government, there's somebody as thoughtful as you are and as caring about this country as you are. So, thanks very much for joining us. DEREK CHOLLET: It means a lot coming from you. Thanks so much. Take care.  \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump has endorsed J.D. Vance for Ohio's Republican Senate primary, weeks away from the May 3 election. Trump had been holding out on wading into the race, but ultimately decided to back Vance, a venture capitalist and author of the memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" In his endorsement, Trump said Vance has the best chance of winning in the general election against Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan, the front-runner in the Democratic primary.\u00a0 \"I've studied this race closely and I think J.D. is the most likely to take out the weak, but dangerous, Democrat opponent\u2014dangerous because they will have so much money to spend. However, J.D. will destroy him in the debates and will fight for the MAGA Movement in the Senate,\" Trump wrote.\u00a0 Vance is facing a crowded field in the Republican primary, including former Ohio GOP chair Jane Timken, former Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel and businessman Mike Gibbons. One rival campaign staffer had thought the endorsement for Vance may not happen, after a letter was sent Thursday by Ohio GOP central committee chairs that urged Trump not to back him. This was first reported by Fox News.\u00a0\u00a0 But Trump had been calling donors and trusted Republican operatives in his orbit to gauge their opinion on Vance, a Trump advisor told CBS News. Vance had previously been critical of Trump and voted for independent Evan McMullin in 2016's presidential race. Vance described Trump as \"cultural heroin\" and also called him \"unfit\" for the presidency in 2016. Trump acknowledged this in his endorsement, saying, \"like some others, J.D. Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades.\"\u00a0 Vance is backed by billionaire and GOP megadonor Peter Thiel, who also donated to Trump in 2016. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., also supports Vance. In debates, Vance has echoed Trump's baseless claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and has taken up Trump's stances on the U.S.-Mexico border and relationship with China.\u00a0 \"I'm incredibly honored to have President Trump's support. He was an incredible fighter for hard working Americans in the White House, he will be again, and I'll fight for the America First Agenda in the Senate,\" Vance tweeted. Trump's pick will be another test of the power of his endorsement in contentious Republican primaries. Earlier this month he backed Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania's Senate race against rival David McCormick. In both races, Trump has former senior advisors working for his chosen candidate's opponents. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's former 2016 campaign manager and senior White House adviser, now works for Timkin. Trump is holding a rally in the state on Saturday, April 23. Early voting began on April 5 and runs until May 2.\u00a0 Fin Gomez and Caitlin Huey-Burns contributed reporting. Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that aired Sunday, July 3, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" The transcript of the full interview appears below. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you speak to Putin, does he acknowledge the sanctions? Does he acknowledge how much his economy has been hurt? Or does he just not care? GERMAN CHANCELLOR OLAF SCHOLZ: I think he cares, but he will not really admit it. So you get some idea-- MARGARET BRENNAN:--Because it hasn't stopped him. CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: --you get some idea that it really is hurting him and that he understands the deep impacts of our sanctions on his economy. And I'm always mentioning it because it's necessary to say it. This is now happening to a country that is not that advanced, that is really needing all the technologies from the rest of the world for having a similar standard of living and for having the chance to be part of growth in the world economy. And this is now the real damage to the Russian economy that they have no chance to do this. MARGARET BRENNAN: When will Putin run out of weapons, run out of funds? Or can this continue for years?\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: No one really knows. He has-- he is perhaps the leader of a very great country with a lot of people living there, with a lot of means, and he is really doing this brutal war with-- and he prepared for it very long, so he will be able to continue with the war really a long time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that Vladimir Putin will stop at Ukraine? CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: I think that all what we do will help to give him the view that this is not working and that he will not be successful.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Germany. Your country has earned this reputation of over-promising and under-delivering when it comes to Ukraine. Ukraine received its very first delivery of German Howitzers artillery last week. Why did it take that long? We're in the fifth- fifth month. CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: So we took a very, very hard decision to change political strategies we followed for many decades--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: --never to deliver weapons into a country that is in a conflict. When we decide, for instance, to send the most modern Howitzer which you can buy on the world market, which is in use in Germany, it was very difficult to organize that this could be used in the war because you have to have some training. And we had Ukrainian soldiers in Germany, and when the training ended, in the end they came with the weapon-with-with the Howitzers to Ukraine, and the-- MARGARET BRENNAN:--But the United States is doing that. They're providing weaponry within 48-hours sometimes of the President signing and carrying out training.\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why did it take this long for Germany? CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: --I think you should understand that there is a difference if a country like the United States spends that much for defense, which is a very big investment, and you have a lot of weapons at your stocks. Together with the United States, and the United Kingdom, we decided to deliver multi-rocket launchers to Ukraine now, which are-- MARGARET BRENNAN:--Those haven't been delivered yet.\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: We are sending them and we are doing it with the means and ways we have, and with the training. And once again, there are a lot of very experienced people who yesterday looked at Google and today they know how to do things. We will always see that Germany is one of the countries that is doing the most, because what we are sending now is the most sophisticated technology you can use. There is also antiballistic- there are also weapons we give to the- to the Ukraine that they can defend the air--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN:The anti-aircraft missiles you've promised, radar you've promised. CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: --that they can defend the city from- against the rockets and missiles that were sent there from Putin. And this is very expensive and very effective technology, but they will get it--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013when? CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: \u2013this will help a country like Odes- to support, to-to defend the country, a city like Odessa or Kyiv.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The delays have led to speculation that it's not about getting the supplies, it's about the will of the government to actually deliver them and whether there's fear of provoking Putin, or whether it's years of budget cuts to your defense industry and to your defense budget that have made it just not possible for the German military to act quickly. How do you respond to that? CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: Those who are looking to the facts, see that we are doing what is feasible we are changing the way how we spend money for defense. And this is the big increase which will change the situation and will give us the chance to be more quick in reaction to a threat that is coming to NATO, the alliance, or to our country.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Germany is providing about 2 billion in aid to Ukraine. That's roughly what you spend per month on gas from Russia, on coal, on energy supplies. So while you're helping the Ukrainians financially, you're also essentially giving Vladimir Putin a financial lifeline. CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: He cannot buy anything from the money he's getting from us because he will- he has all these sanctions on imports for modern technologies and things he is looking for. So this is what is making very angry. But to be very clear, when we decided on sanctions, together, and with all our allies, we said always, we will do it in a way that we harm Putin more than us. And many countries in Europe are depending, for historical reasons and because they are near to the place, and it is the nearest place to get the gas--on the imports of gas. And when now, the whole of Europe is deciding to go out of this dependence, this will change the scenario, even on the world market. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Vladimir Putin can use that money elsewhere. Just not in the West.\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: But he cannot buy-- MARGARET BRENNAN:--So, is it still 2 billion a month that Germany is sending to Russia?\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: It is always decreasing. And I, once again, say that we decided that we do the sanc- that we draft the sanctions in the way that they hurt Putin and this is what we do. And, once again, we are now doing real investments into technology, in pipelines, in ports. And I know there people that sometimes think that when you are having taken a decision one afternoon, the next morning you have a port and a 40-kilometers pipeline-- MARGARET BRENNAN:--No, it takes time. CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: --but in the real life, this is not happening. When Europe is deciding to go out of the import of, of gas from Russia, this will have consequences.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: It'll have huge--I mean, this is the equivalent of them declaring-\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ:\u00a0 A hundred-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --war on you.\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: Hundred-- this is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --by cutting gas supplies to Germany. This isn't just your choice. They're using that as a weapon against you. CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: This is obviously the case. And this is why I was starting to discuss the question what to do if the gas delivery will be reduced right when I entered office. We should be very much prepared that we will have high energy prices all over the world in all countries MARGARET BRENNAN: So Germany's Heavy Industry Association, BDI, warned a halt in Russian gas deliveries would make recession inevitable.\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: It is not- it will be very tough if we will have a shortage of energy supplies. Obviously, all our countries, all our- all our life is depending on the supply of energy. And obviously, a lot of countries, the most countries of the world are depending on the supply from abroad. And so we have to prepare for a difficult situation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin is weaponizing inflation, he's weaponizing food. Is he right to bet that he can fracture the Western alliance by making it harder for Europeans and Americans and everyone else to afford food in these months ahead? CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: You're very right. The shortages of food many people in the world are seeing now as a threat to them, are the direct consequence of what Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the war he is imposing on the country. You're right that all the rising energy prices are also a direct consequence of his doing. And he is- he is the one that is doing the wrong things. And we are always discussing this with our partners around the globe. We are starting an initiative to support countries that have not enough food with food. MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't reopen the Black Sea ports, if Putin doesn't agree to let the food out of Ukraine, how do you lower global food prices? CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: We are now collecting money for supporting the poorest countries that they will be able to deliver food to the people. And this is our international initiative, we- we organized together with others for food security, and we will continue to do that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But it risks global instability. CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: It is a real problem, and it is a real consequence of Putin's war and this is why it is even more necessary that we support the people.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So it also puts pressure to end this conflict sooner. What is your timeline for when this can end?\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: The conflict will end when Putin understands that he will not be successful with idea to conquer part of the territory of his neighbor.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Members of the German government have admitted it was a mistake to be so dependent on Russia for so long.\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: I think it was not right that we were not prepared to have at any time the chance to change the one that is delivering gas, oil and coal to us. So we should have invested all over Europe in infrastructure that gives us the ability to change the supply from one day to the other. And I think this is the lesson that has been learned in Europe and in many other places that you have to be prepared- be prepared for a situation like this.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden also talks about this potential conflict between democracies and autocracies. Is that the biggest threat on the horizon? CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: We should be clear about these threats that are coming to our future. And this is coming from autocracies, yes, because they tend to be aggressive. And this is an aspect we should be very much aware of. And I am. And this is why I organized our meeting we had in Germany with the G7 group of democratic- economically successful democratic states that we invite partners from all over the globe that are also democracies for making it happen. That the democracies are strong. MARGARET BRENNAN: And by strong, it also comes with 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe and 300,000 NATO response forces in Europe. This isn't just diplomacy. This is muscle.\u00a0 CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: This is. And it's necessary.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Chancellor, thank you for your time this morning. CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Chancellor, thank you so much for making time in your busy schedule for us.\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: Good morning.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So I read your biographer says you don't often answer directly, but I'm going to try my best today. You speak with Vladimir Putin. Do you think that Russia is a terrorist state as president Zelenskyy says? OLAF SCHOLZ: Russia started a very brutal aggression against Ukraine. A lot of people are dying in Ukraine, citizens, men, women, children, elderly people. And this is what we call a really brutal, unjustified war that has- that Russia started. And we have to do all to support Ukraine, and to give Ukraine the chance to defend its own integrity and serenity. And that is what we are doing when we support the country.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But calling it a terrorist state, in your view, doesn't achieve anything?\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: It achieves something when we support Ukraine with all the financial means we give to the Ukraine, with all the humanitarian aid, with all the weapons we deliver. And we will continue doing this as long as it is necessary for supporting Ukraine, and for avoiding that the outcome of this war is what Putin is looking for: a dictated peace. And this is something that neither the Ukraine nor we will accept. So it is necessary that we continue with this very strong support. And it is necessary that we also continue with all the sanctions we imposed on Russia. And this is an important aspect from my- as I see it. We impose sanctions against one Russia after the election of Crimea, not too many, but we did--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2014-- OLAF SCHOLZ: And they are still in place. We imposed sanctions against Russia when they organize the uprisings in the east of Donbass in Ukraine, and they are still in place. And all the very heavy sanctions we impose on Russia now will be there, if there is not a real fair piece from the perspective of Ukraine, and this is the message I sent to Putin and many others do the same. And we make it very clear, you cannot look for a dictate piece against Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you speak to Putin, does he acknowledge the sanctions? Does he acknowledge how much his economy has been hurt? Or does he just not care? OLAF SCHOLZ: I think he cares, But he will not really admit it. So you get some- MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it hasn't stopped him. OLAF SCHOLZ: --idea - you get some idea that it really is hurting him and that he understands the deep impacts of our sanctions on his economy. And I'm always mentioning it because it's necessary to say it. Just to give you a view on this question, if a very advanced country like the United States, or Germany, with a very progressive economy with high tech industries, would go out of the world and would just stick to itself, we would go down in economic growth very, very soon. But this is now happening to a country that is not that advanced, that is really - needing all the technologies from the rest of the world for having a similar standard of living, and for having the chance to be part of growth in the world economy. And this is now the real damage to the Russian economy that they have no chance to do this. And it's also hurting them because many of the things, even the military weapons they produce themselves are in one or the other way- Just linked to the economic and technological progress of the world. And so they will go back very, very far. MARGARET BRENNAN: When Will Russia know- when will Russia no longer have the ability to continue this fight? When will Putin run out of weapons, run out of funds? Or can this continue for years?\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: No one really knows he has. He has-- he is perhaps the leader of a very great country with a lot of people living there, with a lot of means, and he is really doing this brutal war with-- and he prepared for it (for) very long. I think the decision to- to do this war was taken one year before it started or possibly earlier, because he prepared for it. And so he will be able to continue with the war really a long time. But this is the message we say to him. We are able to support the Ukraine as long as necessary for defending its serenity, the democracy, the rule of law and all the things the people in Ukraine are looking for.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: President Zelensky has said that he would like to see the war end by the end of the year. How does it end? And Is that realistic?\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: It is very difficult to judge whether this is realistic, because this is something that is decided on the ground. And even more, is this one of the reason why we are so active supporting the Ukraine with all the different means I already discussed on financial humanitarian support, sanctions and delivery of weapons. MARGARET BRENNAN: So Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been called a 9/11 moment for Europe, a big wake up call. Do you think that Europe, and do you think Germany, was just too complacent for too long? OLAF SCHOLZ: I think too many in the world were hoping that we are living in a different world that is different to the experiences of the last century and the centuries before, where might and power, were deciding on the future of countries and not the rules and the agreements we have between states, and we have had an agreement that there should be no attempt to change territory to, to change borders, to invade the neighbor. And this agreement is now canceled by Putin. And this is what I called site and vendor in German, a watershed moment of international politics. Peace is a danger. And this is why it is absolutely necessary that we spend more for defense, and Germany is going in elite in this question in Europe MARGARET BRENNAN: So it was too complacent? OLAF SCHOLZ: I think we should have been prepared for that situation. And- but it is really a big, big disaster for the expectations of all of us looking at peace, the chances we have in the world are better if there's no attempt to change borders with war and things like that. But now we are in that situation, and we have to be realistic. And this is why we have to do more. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is the fundamental nature of this conflict? Because the head of the British army called it a 1937 moment? Is that how you see it? Is that the moment in history we are in right now? OLAF SCHOLZ: I think this is a moment where we have to make absolutely clear that we are strong enough that no one should just think about attacking, for instance, NATO territory. And this is why I said to my parliament, that we are ready and willing to defend- any centimeter, every centimeter of NATO territory in- in Europe, and that we are together with our allies. And this is a very clear message to our eastern-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's a clear message. That's a clear line. But there are plenty of territories around Russia that aren't members of NATO. Do you think Vladimir Putin has his goal set as going into Moldova or surrounding countries? OLAF SCHOLZ : Let me just stick one second to what I already said. Because of this, I decided to- to establish an extra budget for spending for military- 100 billion euros, and that we will increase our spending up to approximately 2% all the years to come. And this will really create an army that has the strongest funding between the NATO allies and Europe, and this is what we are sticking to and we will continue to do this. MARGARET BRENNAN: --which was a big change for Germany.\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: This is something where we are acting realistically in a different time now. And this is necessary to do it. What is Putin thinking of? He is thinking like the imperialists in the 17th, 18th, 19th century. He is thinking that all about the nation is power, and that if you are mighty enough, you can just take territory of your neighbors. And this is an activity and an idea we cannot accept and we will not accept and this is why we are so strong on this question. He was always very, very critical about NATO and the European Union. And when I talked to him, I said, you have to accept the European Union. And that a big alliance of democratic states is building a very strong federal group of states- the union, a union, outside of you. And he was very much thinking about NATO. And I told him NATO is not aggressive. It's just about defense. But he thinks he has just to spend all the money he earns for the- for his military abilities and sometimes using it and this is what should fail now and this is why we are doing the right thing when we support the Ukraine-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that Vladimir Putin will stop at Ukraine? OLAF SCHOLZ: I think that all what we do will help to give him the view that this is not working and that he will not be successful.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So open question on that: When it comes to NATO territory, you now have these two new members, Finland and Sweden potentially joining the Alliance, it looks like they will. Will Vladimir Putin view that as provocative, as more of a threat? OLAF SCHOLZ: All wondered how he would react to the application of Finland and Sweden for NATO. But in the end, he accepted it -\u00a0 this is how I see it, and he has to, because it is the decision of these countries that they want to join. And it is our decision that we take them because they are really much fitting to the concept of NATO democratic states that are very strong with their own activities in defense. And this will strengthen the alliance. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Germany. Your country has earned this reputation of over promising and under delivering when it comes to Ukraine. You know that, you've heard that criticism. Ukraine received its very first delivery of German Howitzers artillery last week? Why did it take that long? we're in the fifth- fifth month. OLAF SCHOLZ: So we took a very, very hard decision to change political strategies we followed for many decades--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: --never to deliver weapons into a country that is in a conflict. And when we decided, when I decided to change that practice of our country, a lot of other European countries followed, and this made it that the group, big group of countries, are now supporting the Ukraine with weapons and do the best. Germany sent all the weapons we had our our stocks in our military infrastructure. And we decided also to deliver new weapons from our industry, which takes a longer time because they have to be produced. But we did all these things. And we continue to do so. And when we decide, for instance, to send the most modern howitzer, which you can buy on the world market, which is in use in Germany, it was very difficult to organize that this could be used in the war, because you have to have some training. And we had Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. And when the training ended, in the end, they came with the weapon, with with the howitzers to Ukraine, and the MARGARET BRENNAN: But United States is doing that. They're providing weaponry within 48 hours sometimes of the President signing and carrying out training.\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why did it take this long for Germany? OLAF SCHOLZ: I think you should understand that there is a difference if a country like the United States spends that much for defense, which is a very big (long pause) investment, and you have a lot of weapons at your stocks. the howitzers many other countries delivered to Ukraine were not the most modern one, but they were the stocks. So we had to do this. And this is how we are continuing, you should know we are doing right - this things which are necessary for helping now in this very situation in the east of Ukraine. And this is why we sent the weapons that were necessary, and that are necessary, there. Together with the United States, and the United Kingdom, we decided to deliver multi rocket launches to Ukraine now, which are MB interjects: those haven't been delivered yet.\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: We are sending them and we are doing it with the means and ways we have and with the training. And once again, there are a lot of very experienced people who yesterday looked at Google and today they know how to do things. But I will tell you there are weapons but you have to have your training. And you have to have- to have it- not in Ukraine, you have to have it here in our countries. And so the soldiers have to come to get the training and they are doing it. This is what we do with many other things. And if you look at this, what we are sending, from the perspective on- of two weeks, three weeks, four weeks from now, we will always see that Germany is one of the countries that is doing the most because what we are sending now is the most sophisticated technology you can use. There is also (long pause) anti ballistic- there are also weapons we give to the- to the Ukraine that they can defend the air.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN:The anti aircraft missiles you've promised, radar you've promised OLAF SCHOLZ: That they can defend the city from- against the rockets and missiles that were sent there from Putin. And this is very expensive and very effective technology but they will get it.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: When? OLAF SCHOLZ: And this will help a country like Odes- to support to to defend the country, a city like Odessa or Kyiv-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But I ask you when because you know that the delays have led to speculation that it's not about getting the supplies, it's about the will of the government to actually deliver them. And whether there's fear of provoking Putin, or whether it's years of budget cuts to your defense industry and to your defense budget that have made it just not possible for the German military to act quickly. How do you respond to that? OLAF SCHOLZ: --those who are looking to the facts, see that we are doing what is feasible and that we are doing the same things as our allies are doing. And that we are using all the means we really have. And when you compare what we are delivered to the Ukraine, and compared with activities of others, you will find that we are very much aligned with all the others. But the most important thing is that we are not just now supporting Ukraine, we are changing the way how we spend money for defense. And this is the big increase, which will change the situation and will give us the chance to be more quick in reaction to a threat that is coming to NATO, the alliance or to our country. And this is why I decided to do this- to do this. And I will continue to follow this policy making Germany strong enough for being the partner all our alliance- allies in Europe are looking for and all our allies in the transatlantic partnership.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're moving as fast as you can? OLAF SCHOLZ: We will move as fast as we can. And we are doing. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about German finances. Do you know how much right now Germany is spending on Russian energy? OLAF SCHOLZ: It's decreasing, the money we are spending. And this is why we are- why we have decided to change all the imports we have from fossil resources. Different to the United States, we are not producing them ourselves, we have to import them. And we get them from many places of the world. But we change- we decided to go out of the import of fossil resources from Russia. And we did so with the import of coal, which is not that difficult, because we already imported most of it from other places. We decided so- to do so with the import of oil. And we will go out of this imports in the end of this year, which is also something which is now, we are preparing for and which is from some region, if we just- if we look at the whole country will be, will be relatively easy because oil is shipped and we are also working on some refineries in the east of Germany that are not getting the oil by ship. So we are making this feasible for them also. And then we are- we decided that we will build pipelines to the shores of the north of Germany for importing LNG. This is- MARGARET BRENNAN: liquefied natural gas.\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: -liquefied natural natural gas. And this is something I was looking for, even when I was the mayor of Hamburg, because I thought it could be useful to have always the ability to change the the suppliers of your, of- of what you buy from- in case of gas- and this is why we are now doing it MARGARET BRENNAN: When we looked at the numbers though-- when we looked at the numbers, Germany is providing about 2 billion in aid to Ukraine. That's roughly what you spend per month on gas from Russia, on coal, on energy supplies. So while you're helping the Ukrainians financially, you're also essentially giving Vladimir Putin a financial lifeline. OLAF SCHOLZ: He cannot buy anything from the money he's getting from us because he will- he has all these sanctions on imports for modern technologies and things he is looking for. So this is what is making very angry. But to be very clear, when we decided on sanctions, together, and with all our allies, we said always, we will do it in a way that we harm Putin more than us. And many countries in Europe are depending, for historical reasons and because they are near to the place, and it is the nearest place to get the gas on the inputs of gas, and when now, whole Europe is deciding to go out of this dependence, this will change the scenario, even on the world market. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Vladimir Putin can use that money elsewhere. Just not in the West.\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: But he cannot buy- MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is it still 2 billion a month that Germany is sending to Russia?\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: It is always decreasing, and I once again say that we decided that we do the sanc- that we draft the sanctions in the way that they hurt Putin and this is what we do. And once again, we are now doing real investments into technology, in pipelines, imports, and I know that there people that sometimes think that when you are having taken a decision one afternoon, the next morning you have a port and a 40 kilometers pipeline. MARGARET BRENNAN: No, it takes time-- OLAF SCHOLZ: But in the real life, this is not happening. But what we did is deciding on legislation, we already did, which makes it easy to build these pipelines with the own- without any legal restrictions in the shortest time to come. And we really hope that the first of them will be able to work in the beginning of the next year. And if you see that things like this usually take 2, 3, 4, 5 years, and we do it in possibly six months or a bit more, in the first part- in the first pipelines that are going to work, you see that we are very, very strong and doing the necessary things for making us independent. And this also is- and but let me add this, when Europe is deciding to go out of the import of- of gas from Russia, this will have consequences.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: It'll have huge - I mean, this is the equivalent of them declaring-\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: 100 MARGARET BRENNAN: --war on you\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: this-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --by cutting gas supplies to Germany, this isn't just your choice. They're using that as a weapon against you. OLAF SCHOLZ: This is obviously the case. And this is why I was starting to discuss the question what to do if the gas delivery will be reduced. Right when I entered office, it was my political decision to say that I want to know exactly what we have to do for in case of that, and this is why we are not prepared for years, but prepared since I am the chancellor of this country. And this is why I was able, after the war started, to go to the parliament and say we will build this pipelines, we will build this new ports for liquid- liquefied natural gas. And just to repeat this, when whole Europe in some years will be not dependent on the gas from Russia, it will get gas from other places. But this is all together more than 150, nearly 160 billion cubic meters of gas that is now as a new request coming to the world market. And this is one of the reasons why we should be very much prepared that we will have high energy prices all over the world in all countries because of the fact that the gas that Russia is now supplying will, to a certain extent, which we will understand in some years, will not be able to be sold. And so we have to get it from other resources. But this is a very tough time for global economy when we did this change. MARGARET BRENNAN: It is. It is and you run the largest economy in Europe. What happens in Germany matters to the rest of the world. So if you are looking at gas supplies, potential shortages, you could have freezing homes, you could have shuttered factories, have you decided when and which industries you prioritize? Which factories get shuttered first? OLAF SCHOLZ: We prepare for the situation of having the difficulties may come up because of the energy supply. And this is why we decided to make new legislation on storage capacities for gas, legislation that is forcing the participants of the market that there should be 90% in the storages- storage capacities of Germany, in the- at the beginning of winter. And this is now already taking place and the storages are becoming- are now filled more than they were one year ago at that time. We also decided to change legislation that we make it possible to say we will not use that many gas at- in the summer, for instance, and we will use coal plants for producing electricity. And so a lot of decisions are already taking and we are preparing our selves for a very difficult situation as many other European countries do. And obviously, countries all over the globe are doing thinking about what might come up. MARGARET BRENNAN: When will you have to start rationing natural gas and will you have to shut down factories in the months ahead? OLAF SCHOLZ: I think we will see how things are now moving, how things are- how the development will be in the future. What we can do at this time is preparing ourselves for being ready to take the necessary decisions. And this is what we do. And we are all the time preparing with the necessary legislation that we are able to do what is necessary and not just looking for what we could do if we would have the right legal framework. We will have it when it's necessary.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So Germany's Heavy Industry Association, BDI, warned a halt in Russian gas deliveries would make recession inevitable. The World Bank economists say it's going to be very hard to avoid a recession. Is it inevitable? OLAF SCHOLZ: It is not- it will be very tough if we will have a shortage of energy supplies. Obviously, all our countries, all our- all our life is depending on the supply of energy. And obviously, a lot of countries, the most countries of the world, are depending on the supply from abroad. And so we have to prepare for a difficult situation. And as I explained to you very detailed, we are preparing and we are prepared. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are still preparing for energy prices to stay high for years? How long? OLAF SCHOLZ: I'm sure that this will be a time where the energy prices will be high, all over the globe, because of the request. And this is one reason why we accelerate our way out of the use of fossil resources. You should know that Germany decided that we will be a co2 neutral country in 2045, which is less than 25 years. And this means that we are now expanding the production of electricity and of en- with offshore wind, with onshore wind, with solar energy, that we are expanding the investment into our grid, so that we are able to have a completely different industry doing steel, doing chemistry, doing- producing cement with the use of electricity and hydrogen in the end. And so we are just going faster into the better world we are already looking for.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But inflation is crushing standards of living around the world. Vladimir Putin is weaponizing inflation, he's weaponizing food. Is he right to bet that he can fracture the Western alliance by making it harder for Europeans and Americans and everyone else to afford food in these months ahead? OLAF SCHOLZ: You're very right. The shortages of food many people in the world are seeing now as a threat to them, are the direct consequence of what Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the war, he is imposing on the country. You're right that all the rising energy prices are also a direct consequence of his doing. And he is- he is the one that is doing the wrong things. And we are always discussing this with our partners on the globe. We are starting an initiative to support countries that have not enough food with food. We're supporting the general secretary in finding a way how to get out all the wheat out of Ukraine\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: How? OLAF SCHOLZ: through the World War- he is discussing intensely on ways how this could happen, not just with trains, what we are organizing together with the Ukrainians, but also with shipping. Because this is something where we will find in the next one or two weeks, if an agreement between Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, the United Nations will be feasible,\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you really think- OLAF SCHOLZ: but coming back to- MARGARET BRENNAN: -that Vladimir Putin is going to allow grain to be shipped out of Ukraine? He's shut down the black sea ports. This is a really powerful weapon against the West. Why would he give that up? Why would he agree to let the grain out? OLAF SCHOLZ: There is one question the general secretary is asking to all, and also to Putin: will you be responsible? And the one that is responsible, that there is the wheat that is necessary in Africa and Asia and other places, is not going there. And so this is why he is working so hard to find a solution and we are supporting him.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you- OLAF SCHOLZ: Once again, I think we will face a situation of high prices. And we will face a very difficult situation. But this we knew right from the beginning when we decided to support Ukraine. And now it is necessary that we stand united and the outcome of this NATO meeting here in Madrid, the outcome of the g7 meeting we had in Germany in (Weimar?) and the outcome of all the meetings we had in the European Union is we stand united, we are united and he will not be able to fracture us. MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't reopen the black sea ports, if Putin doesn't agree to let the food out of Ukraine, how do you lower global food prices? OLAF SCHOLZ: We are now collecting money for supporting the poorest countries that they will be able to deliver food to the people. And this is our international initiative, we- we organized together with others for food security, and we will continue to do that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But it risks global instability. OLAF SCHOLZ: It is a real problem, and it is a real consequence of Putin's war, and this is why it is even more necessary that we support the people.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So it also puts pressure to end this conflict sooner. What is your timeline for when this can end?\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: The conflict will end when Putin understands that he will not be successful with idea to conquer part of the territory of his neighbor.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: He controls 20% of Ukraine right now, according to U.S. intelligence. OLAF SCHOLZ: This is why we are supporting Ukraine with financial means, with humanitarian aid, but also with arms deliveries and why we are doing our sanctions regime together on Putin.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So it has been a hard lesson to learn. But as you've laid out here, you know, members of the German government have admitted it was a mistake to be so dependent on Russia for so long. I wonder, do you look at that and wonder about China and see the same type of risk that the West is so financially intertwined with Beijing that it poses a threat, a direct threat?\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: Coming back to the first aspect of your question, I think it was not right that we were not prepared to have at any time the chance to change the one that is delivering gas, oil and coal to us. So we should have invested all over Europe in infrastructure that gives us the ability to change the supply, from one day to the other. And I think this is the lesson that has been learned in Europe and in many other places that you have to be prepared- be prepared for a situation like this. And this is also the answer to all the other questions coming up. If, for instance, if you look to China, it is more the answer- just understand that you should have supply change imports not just from one or two countries, but from many. And that even your business is looking for many other countries. So the answer to what we are discussing with China is not to go away from China. The answer is to go to the other Asian countries. And there are very, very big nations, which I think we have to look at. And it was very good when we at G7 came together with the leaders of Indonesia and India, for instance, and they are representing two very strong nations, nations with a good and important future in the world to come. And if we look around them, we find many others. And so the answer we all together should give is, just do your business with many countries so that you can live with a situation when trouble comes up with one.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And trouble may come up with China. I mean, the United States sees it as a threat. Does Germany see China as a threat? OLAF SCHOLZ: I think- I think the world we are going to live in 2050 will be multipolar. Many countries will be important. The United States, (long pause) Russia, China, the European Union and the countries in this Union, but also Indonesia and India, or South Africa, countries from the south of America. And the big task of all of us is to make this work, not just multipolar, with many influential countries looking to- to have to- looking for their own interests and what- what is useful for them, but making it the world that is working together. So multipolar is not enough. Multilateral, working together for a better future, this is what we are should- what we should aim for. And it is now the time to work for that MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. OLAF SCHOLZ: -better future. When we are looking at the midst of this century we are in.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are being diplomatic there. NATO, in this latest statement, identified china as a- as a threat, the secretary general said it poses challenges to our values, to our interest and to our security. Does that mean the West is on a path for a clash with Beijing?\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: No. And exactly. If you look at the decisions we took here and we are working on it, is that we are just aware of problems that might come up and we are aware of these problems because we are democracies and we are not an aggression to our neighbors, to- to the rest of the world. And we are not aggressive against them.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And China might be towards Taiwan-- OLAF SCHOLZ : --and this is why we say that we are working for a world where aggression is not working. And this is why we are making our alliance strong. But this is also why we say developing a strategy, this gives us the chance to be not dependent. And I come back to what I said, part of this answer is to look at many other countries in the world that will be strong in the future and make them their partner- our partners, especially when they are democracies. And this is, I think, the strategy we should follow.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm told we are running out of time. Before I let you go, President Biden also talks about this potential conflict between democracies and autocracies. Is that the biggest threat on the horizon? What keeps you up at night? OLAF SCHOLZ: First, I- I think the democracies are very strong and they- because they have the support of their people, they are really having also the future on their side. We should be- We should look at these things from this perspective. But we should be clear about these threats that are coming to our future. And this is coming from autocracies, Yes, because they tend to be aggressive. And this is an aspect we should be very much aware of. And I am. And this is why I organized our meeting we had in Germany with the G7 group of democratic- economically successful democratic states that we invite partners from all over the globe that are also democracies for making it happen, that the democracies are strong. MARGARET BRENNAN: And by strong it also comes with 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe and 300,000 NATO response forces in Europe. This isn't just diplomacy. This is muscle.\u00a0 OLAF SCHOLZ: This is. And it's necessary.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Chancellor, thank you for your time this morning. OLAF SCHOLZ: Thank you.",

We're going to be able to control this.\r\n \r\n\t(End VT)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Is the criticism of the administration's messaging on COVID justified?\r\n \r\n\tWe will talk with the new mayor of New York City, Democrat Eric Adams. His city is an epicenter of the Omicron surge, and facing the challenge of keeping kids safe in schools. Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb will also be with us.\r\n \r\n\tPlus: With the clock now ticking in a midterm election year, congressional Democrats are feeling the pressure to get things done fast, first item up, reforming voting laws.\r\n \r\n\t(Begin VT)\r\n \r\n\tSENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-Kentucky): It's not a voting rights bill. It's a sprawling, sweeping takeover of our democracy.\r\n \r\n\t(End VT)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: But same old problems. Republicans are not on board.\r\n \r\n\tOutside Washington, some states have passed laws restricting ballot access. Others have expanded it.\r\n \r\n\tGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger rebuffed former President Trump's attempt to tamper with the results of the 2020 election. Now he's overseeing controversial new voting laws in his state.\r\n \r\n\tElection expert David Becker will also be with us.\r\n \r\n\tIt's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\r\n \r\n\tGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\r\n \r\n\tIt was a sobering first full week of the new year, marked by soaring COVID infections, miserable weather in most of the country, and painful memories evoked by the first anniversary of the January 6 insurrection.\r\n \r\n\tBut it is a new week.\r\n \r\n\tAnd we want to turn our focus to what is ahead in 2022, particularly in an election year.\r\n \r\n\tAnd there is perhaps no better guest than the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.\r\n \r\n\tGood morning to you, Madam Speaker.\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D-California): Good morning. Good morning to you, and happy New Year.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Happy New Year.\r\n \r\n\tI don't think any of us wanted to start with this Omicron surge that we are seeing happen. And I know, in Congress, you are seeing infections spike as well, N95 masks now being given to staff.\r\n \r\n\tHow will this surge impact the work that you are able to do in the coming weeks?\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, before I go into that, I just want to say that I come here on this Sunday morning fresh from the service celebrating the life of Majority Leader Harry Reid.\r\n \r\n\tTwo presidents of the United States spoke. The leadership of the Congress, the vice president was there, governors, everyone. But nothing was as eloquent than the voices of his -- the voices of his children who spoke about their father.\r\n \r\n\tSo, being here in this on the Senate side, I have to begin by praising and remembering Harry Reid.\r\n \r\n\tCOVID is -- it is the center of it all. It's about the health of the American people, of course, but it's also about its impact on our economy, the education of our children, the safety of everyone at work or in school.\r\n \r\n\tSo, the -- I look forward to our taking advantage of advances in science on this, that there is a pill that will be able to intervene early -- in early stages. And we want to have the resources available to do that.\r\n \r\n\tThe issues before the Supreme Court will be very important, as two bills -- excuse me -- two cases there, one about health care workers, one about the president's mandate for going beyond health care workers.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: So, there is a good deal, whether it's legislation for more resources, whether it's the court's decision and the rest. And, also, it's just about our own taking personal responsibility to stay safe.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: When you say legislation for more resources, $6 trillion has already been spent over the course of this -- has been allocated over the course of this pandemic.\r\n \r\n\tAre you saying that you need more coronavirus relief? And will that go in the spending bill when government funding runs out next month?\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, the -- again, we have to protect the investment that is there. Most importantly, we have to protect the health of the American people.\r\n \r\n\tNow, the administration has not made a formal request for more funding, but it is clear from the opportunity that is there and the -- again, the challenge that is there from the resilience of this virus.\r\n \r\n\tAnd viruses are -- the more they spread, they are transmitted, the more they mutate. So the good advice, for everyone to get vaccinated, to be masked, to have spatial distancing, and the rest, and to be tested, tested, tested, continue to be important.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: When you have this government funding deadline, February 18, I believe it is...\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: ... you have that opportunity to bundle together perhaps some other things here.\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Will you try to extend the child care tax credit at that time, since it has expired?\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, that's a different bill.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: That is in the Build Back Better legislation.\r\n \r\n\tIn the appropriations bill, which is to keep government open, we are in those negotiations now under leadership in our House of Rosa DeLauro, our distinguished chair of the Appropriations Committee, and we must find a solution.\r\n \r\n\tNow, I'm an appropriator. That's my culture in Congress appropriations and intelligence. And I believe that, left to their own devices on both sides of the aisle, that the appropriators can get the job done.\r\n \r\n\tThe -- something like additional funding can be in there. It can be fenced off for emergencies, as would be COVID.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The child tax credit, we have to have that fight, that discussion in the Build Back Better legislation.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: So, you won't be pulling that out as any kind of stand- alone or any kind of attachment at this point?\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, I would hope to. But in order to do this -- in order to pass the Build Back Better, it's under reconciliation, we only need 51 votes.\r\n \r\n\tThe bill that is the reconciliation, the appropriations bill requires 60 votes in the Senate.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: So, we have to do what is possible there.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Manchin has made clear it's not possible at this point.\r\n \r\n\tIt sounds like you are trying to revive those talks. Are you -- where is that? Have you spoken to the senator?\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, I have spoken to the senator over time.\r\n \r\n\tI do think there's an agreement to be reached. It's so important for our country, whether we're talking about right now the need for child care for moms and dads whose children may or may not be in school. Child care is so important all the time, more important even now, when we're talking about universal pre-K and child care, and we're talking about the child tax credit, we're talking about home health care...\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: ... all of those things, expand the Affordable Care Act to include those who were not expanded under Medicaid in some of those states.\r\n \r\n\tBut in addition to that, we see weather. And that weather it's telling us that we must do what is in the bill to address the climate crisis, which is causing so many unusual natural disasters, not all of them from climate, but exasperated by it.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tWell, the White House is putting its shoulder behind this push for voting rights and election law vs. Build Back Better, in the coming days, at least.\r\n \r\n\tI want to ask you, when you look around the country, there are many states that are changing their own election laws, and it could increase the chance for partisan interference when it comes to certifying an election outcome.\r\n \r\n\tHave you thought about that scenario for these midterm races? Would you commit to seating an elected person if their election is not certified in the state that they are elected out of? I mean, regardless of the outcome, will you seat them?\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, first, let's get the bill passed.\r\n \r\n\tI think that the order of things is very appropriate. There's nothing more important for us to do than protect our Constitution and our democracy.\r\n \r\n\tWhat the Republicans are doing across the country is really a legislative continuation of what they did on January 6, which is to undermine our democracy, to undermine the integrity of our elections, to undermine the voting power, which is the essence of a democracy.\r\n \r\n\tSo, we have to do that bill. There is no more important bill. That enables us to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: There are not the votes in the Senate for that at this point. So I'm -- how will you handle...\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, we just have to keep working on that. We just have to keep working on it.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: But have you thought -- have you thought about that scenario? Because it is a potential scenario for these upcoming races, where you have this dispute at the state level. How will you handle that?\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, it isn't a question of how we will handle something a year from now.\r\n \r\n\tWhat is important right now is how we protect and defend the Constitution and the voting rights. What they are doing -- and you pointed out very clearly, and I thank you for that -- that they are not only suppressing the vote, suppressing the vote; they are nullifying elections, saying, well, it doesn't matter who gets more votes. It matters who the three people we appoint to analyze that, what they decide.\r\n \r\n\tWe cannot let that happen. And in this legislation -- thank you for taking us down this path. In this legislation, there are stiffened penalties for what they are doing to election officials...\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: ... what they are doing and threatening elective officials.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Well...\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: This is a very major threat on our democracy.\r\n \r\n\tThis legislation is the most important. And we have to keep working in order to get the job done.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Because it is as vital as any legislation we could ever pass.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: And we are going to be talking about election integrity later in the program.\r\n \r\n\tThank you very much, Madam Speaker, for your time this morning.\r\n \r\n\tREPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: It was my pleasure to be with you.\r\n \r\n\tHappy New Year to you. Thank you.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Happy New Year.\r\n \r\n\tFace the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to COVID-19.\r\n \r\n\tData continues to suggest that the Omicron variant is less severe than others. But the CDC warns that the surge will stress the health care system in the coming weeks, the most vulnerable, children, who are either too young to be vaccinated or who are just not vaccinated at all, along with those over age 65.\r\n \r\n\tHere's Mark Strassmann.\r\n \r\n\t(Begin VT)\r\n \r\n\tMAN: Those people are not in line. Don't give them one!\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): It's the same scene all over, Americans on a scavenger hunt for COVID tests.\r\n \r\n\tAUTOMATED VOICE: At this time, we are sold out of COVID tests.\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: Empty shelves, long lines, Colorado, Indiana, even Massachusetts, home to one of America's highest vaccination rates.\r\n \r\n\tAnd yet, somehow, Florida, long a bullseye for the virus, managed to let up to one million COVID tests expire in a warehouse. One critic called it heartless.\r\n \r\n\tGOVERNOR RON DESANTIS (R-Florida): There wasn't a lot of demand for them. They have been sending them out as requested.\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: COVID anxiety and COVID testing are both spiking now that the holidays are behind us. This is Glynn County, coastal Georgia. Six times as many people lined up for tests the first week of January than the week before.\r\n \r\n\tOmicron now surges everywhere with astonishing speed. Contract tracing is virtually worthless. Consider this. It took six months for the U.S. to report its first four million cases. The last four million took one week.\r\n \r\n\tThis is Southeast Georgia Health System near Savannah. Its COVID patients more than doubled in one week.\r\n \r\n\tMACEY FLOYD (Nurse, Southeast Georgia Health System): Every bed is taken. The E.R. is full.\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: Nurses like Macey Floyd keep running a COVID marathon.\r\n \r\n\tMACEY FLOYD: I don't know when a finish line will be. I don't see one. I think COVID is something we're going to be dealing with for a while.\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: Even more worrisome, the CDC says pediatric hospitalizations have hit a pandemic peak, mostly children under 4, too young for the vaccine.\r\n \r\n\tIn this week's COVID follies, the CDC's ever-evolving, consistently confusing guidance. Nearly two weeks ago, the agency halved its isolation recommendation for infected people from 10 days to five, then rejoin the world without passing a test first.\r\n \r\n\tIts new guidance? Taking that test is up to you.\r\n \r\n\tDR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY (CDC Director): If that test is positive, people should stay home for those extra five days.\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: The American Medical Association is having none of it: \"Those recommendations are not only confusing, but are risking further spread of the virus.\"\r\n \r\n\tExperts predict Omicron's surge across the U.S. to peak soon, but no question our next couple of weeks will be rough.\r\n \r\n\t(End VT)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann reporting in Brunswick, Georgia.\r\n \r\n\tWe go now to former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who sits on the board of Pfizer.\r\n \r\n\tGood morning to you, Doctor.\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Good morning.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: You said we'll be running past the Omicron wave by February. Do you stand by that trajectory? And do we get to breathe a sigh of relief at that point?\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Hopefully, we do,\r\n \r\n\tI mean, many people, including myself, have predicted that Delta would be the last major wave of infection. Then Omicron and came along, which was -- represented sort of divergent evolution, I think surprised us that the virus was able to mutate so heavily and evade the immunity that we have acquired.\r\n \r\n\tBut if you look what's happening across the East Coast right now in New York City, Washington, D.C., Maryland, probably Florida as well have already peaked, maybe Delaware and Rhode Island. You're going to start to see that in the statistics this week. You're going to start to see those curves, those epidemic curves bend down.\r\n \r\n\tYou are already seeing that in New York City and Washington, D.C. The risk right now is to the Midwest, where you have rising infection, where they aren't in the thick of their Omicron wave yet. And you have states that had high hospitalization rates going into this. They had a lot of Delta infection. They had been coming out of their Delta wave, so their hospital census was already high.\r\n \r\n\tAnd now they're seeing Omicron infections pick up. On the good side, hospitalizations are down relative to cases, but cases are up substantially, so it's pressing hospitals. Many of the hospitals on the East Coast are going to reach or surpass their previous hospitalization totals.\r\n \r\n\tNew York City is probably the city that's best equipped to handle it. They're about at 55 percent of the hospitalizations that they saw during that devastating first wave. But in other states, they're more pressed. They're close to 100 percent of the hospitalizations they saw in previous\r\n \r\n\twaves.\r\n \r\n\tFinally, on the good side, length of stay is down substantially, so length of stay has gone from four days to 1.6 days in the survey by Kaiser, for example. So that's allowing hospitals to turn over beds. But the sheer velocity of the spread right now and the number of hospitalizations is pressing them.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the speed of this is just incredible.\r\n \r\n\tWhat should parents do over the next two to three weeks? Because the unprotected are those ages 4 and under. We know it's just not realistic for parents to not drop their kids off at day care tomorrow or not send their kids to preschool.\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, there's a lot of risk right now.\r\n \r\n\tI think you have to look in on what the precautions are in the settings in which you're putting your children and try to encourage those who are taking care of your children in those settings to put in place measures to try to protect them.\r\n \r\n\tThe risk is to young children right now. If you look at New York City, for example, fully 55 percent of the hospitalizations, the pediatric hospitalizations are children ages zero to 4, and they only represent 26 percent of the population. So, we're seeing a lot of hospitalizations in those younger age groups, where the children are largely unvaccinated...\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: ... 5 to 11 as well, where vaccination rates are very low. Only 16 percent of 5-to-11-year-olds have been fully vaccinated.\r\n \r\n\tI think the old rules apply. Try to encourage social pods in those settings, hand hygiene. I think masks can be helpful where they can be worn. It's hard with the very young kids.\r\n \r\n\tTrying to keep kids distanced. The best thing that schools could be doing right now is serial testing. Again, hard to do with the very young kids, although you can do pooled samples, like saliva tests. And also keeping them in social pods, so, if you have a class of 10 trying to break it down, so all the kids aren't intermingling, so if you have a single introduction, it's not going to take down a whole class.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: So, the CDC guidelines -- we've talked about this for years now -- they continue to be changing. They continue to be murky.\r\n \r\n\tCan you help -- if I tick through some of these basics, can you help give us some clarity here? The U.K. says 10 to 13 percent of people will still be infectious from COVID on day six. On day six in the United States, the CDC says you can go back to work, you can go back to school, but they tell you don't go to a restaurant and don't travel.\r\n \r\n\tWhat do you do on day six, Doctor?\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.\r\n \r\n\tAnd, look, the CDC'S guidance recommended that you wear a mask for five days after your isolation period, recognizing that a certain cohort of people are still going to be showing the virus.\r\n \r\n\tI think what underlies the CDC recommendation there is a recognition that this is an epidemic that's not being instigated, spread, if you will, by people who get diagnosed, isolate for five days, and go back into public circulation day six. While a certain percentage of them will still be\r\n \r\n\tinfectious, they're not driving the pandemic.\r\n \r\n\tWhat's driving the pandemic right now is the fact that we're probably only diagnosing somewhere between one IN five and one in 10 actual infections, and there's a lot of people walking around with mild illness or asymptomatic infection who don't know it who are spreading it.\r\n \r\n\tSo, if you start from that premise, and if CDC was sort of up front about that premise, what it really tells you is that, if you're -- if you're someone who's isolated for five days, and, on day six, you're going to go back to work, you need to be mindful of what the setting is that you're reintroducing yourself into.\r\n \r\n\tAre you taking care of people who are vulnerable at home? Are you going into a health care setting or another setting where there's vulnerable people? And, if you are, you need to be more vigilant. Maybe use a diagnostic test to make sure you're no longer shedding virus. You certainly wear a mask in that circumstance.\r\n \r\n\tBut I think, if CDC was more granular, more descriptive in what they were actually doing and why...\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: ... and the fact that they recognize that there's going to be a certain number of people who are infectious, people could take more actions on their own.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: If people can find a test.\r\n \r\n\tThe Biden administration will begin distributing them to households. The reporting is, by January the 15th, they will start shipping out 500 million of them. That's not really going to help people on the East Coast right now who are trying to find in the midst of this surge a way to test like you're describing.\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, it's unfortunate. We started this late. We should have done this earlier.\r\n \r\n\tYou're right. These tests are going to be distributed as this epidemic is declining in many parts of the country, not all parts of the country. So, for certain parts of the country, the tests are going to get there in time or in time for the peak infection.\r\n \r\n\tI think they would have been better served by directly subsidizing the tests and having them delivered through normal retail channels, like pharmacies, rather than shipping these through the mail. We need to start to normalize the supply chain for the tools that people need to protect themselves from this pandemic.\r\n \r\n\tIt's not just the diagnostic tests, but also the vaccines and the therapeutics. We need to start thinking about how we distribute these through normal retail channels, where people are used to accessing health care services, and not these government-directed channels, which are going to make it more challenging for people to get these in a timely fashion.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: You were very clear last Sunday that you will not be protected if you're wearing a cloth mask because this is an airborne virus.\r\n \r\n\tGiven how transmissible this is, what counts as an exposure these days? Does the 15 minutes at six feet of distance mean anything, or is you walking down the street and passing someone by going to expose you just the same?\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, I certainly don't think, in an outdoor setting, it represents the same level of risk. And that's been consistent all the way through.\r\n \r\n\tBut the reality is that your risk is binary. You can have a casual encounter and contract the illness. You can have a prolonged encounter and not. CDC, with those kinds of recommendations about 15 minutes of cumulative exposure or things like that, with six feet of distance, they're trying to gauge, on average, where the highest risk of exposure occurs, and\r\n \r\n\tit occurs with prolonged exposures in confined settings with people who are infected. We know that.\r\n \r\n\tBut the reality is, with an airborne illness like that -- this, if you're in a setting, a confined setting...\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: ... that has poor air circulation, it doesn't matter if you're six feet or 10 feet. You're going to be at risk of contracting it.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right, which is why...\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And this isn't like radiation, where you have a cumulative risk.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right, which is why the mask matters so much.\r\n \r\n\tDr. Gottlieb, thank you for your time today.\r\n \r\n\tWe'll be right back with more Face the Nation. Stay with us.\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Now to the crisis in Eastern Ukraine, where Russian forces appear poised for an invasion.\r\n \r\n\tTonight, U.S. and Russian officials will begin talks, with the Biden administration already saying they're open to limits on NATO military exercises or missile placement in the region, if it will help defuse tensions.\r\n \r\n\tOur Holly Williams reports from Ukraine.\r\n \r\n\tHOLLY WILLIAMS: Good morning.\r\n \r\n\tHere in Eastern Ukraine, they have been fighting against Russian-backed separatists since 2014. And trenches like these now carve up this part of the country. The conflict has turned farmland and villages into killing fields. And more than 14,000 people have lost their lives, according to the Ukrainian government.\r\n \r\n\tNow, this winter, there are fears of a Russian invasion. Tens of thousands of Russian troops, up to 100,000 Russian troops, according to one count, are massed along Ukraine's border. And alarm bells are ringing in Washington.\r\n \r\n\tNow, according to some, a ground invasion involving tanks and artillery and armored vehicles is unlikely until the ground here freezes over. But, here in the trenches, they have told us they think that it could happen at any time.\r\n \r\n\tThe big question is what Russia's President Vladimir Putin is thinking and what his true objectives are. He claims that Russia is a victim of Western aggression. And he's demanding security guarantees in return for defusing these tensions, including rolling back NATO troops from Eastern Europe.\r\n \r\n\tBut here in Ukraine, some people have told us that President Putin is essentially playing a game of chicken, a Cold War-style game of brinkmanship, that is ratcheting up tensions, trying to extract concessions from the U.S. and its European allies, and thereby perhaps extending\r\n \r\n\tRussian influence here in Eastern Europe.\r\n \r\n\tNow, last year, the U.S. government gave Ukraine nearly half-a-billion dollars in military aid, including anti-tank missiles. And President Biden says that, if Russia invades, the U.S. will respond with -- quote -- \"severe consequences,\" economic consequences, but he has ruled out sending in U.S. combat troops -- Margaret.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Holly Williams in Ukraine.\r\n \r\n\tWe will be right back.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\r\n \r\n\tWe turn now to the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams.\r\n \r\n\tGood morning to you, Mr. Mayor.\r\n \r\n\tMAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D), NEW YORK CITY: Good morning. Good to be on with you.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you.\r\n \r\n\tYou have said that somewhere around 70 percent of hospital beds in your city are currently occupied. Are the hospitals close to be overwhelmed?\r\n \r\n\tERIC ADAMS: No, not at all. My daily briefings with my health care professionals -- I had one earlier today -- they stated that we are stable. And they're doing an amazing job. And those heroes and sheroes who are the nurses and doctors and hospital employees, we just need to really commend them for the job. And we're watching this closely. And we're going to make sure we respond and pivot as Covid continues to do so.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we look -- we wish you luck with that.\r\n \r\n\tYou have the largest school district in the country in your city, of course, and you have been very clear you are keeping schools open. To do that, you've giving out N-95 masks, required staff be vaccinated, everyone's got to be masked, you've got air purifiers, you have routine\r\n \r\n\tscreening, but you're not requiring a negative test before students return to the classroom. That's something they're doing here in the District of Columbia.\r\n \r\n\tAre you confident you can keep the level of transmission low?\r\n \r\n\tERIC ADAMS: You know -- and it's so important that you laid out the things that we put in place, because Covid is a formidable and moving target, and we have to pivot and shift based on that. And our policies have been rooted in, I need my children in school. And if my medical professionals tell me, Eric, we have to do a mandated vaccine, we're going to do that. But, right now, we have brought over 1.5 million tests in our schools, as you indicated, N-95 masks, as well as other resources and tools. And we have been doing an amazing job because of one thing, coordination and communication with our UFT and other agencies involved. And I believe we're doing the right thing for our children, having them in the safest place, and that is in the school building.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: That -- you're talking about the union there.\r\n \r\n\tBut you've kept schools open, but the plain fact of the matter is, people are still going to get sick. And I know you have had some staff shortage as a result of that. Attendance in school this past week was about 70 percent. So about 300,000 out of a million students missed class.\r\n \r\n\tAre you going to have to elongate the school year to make up for all this?\r\n \r\n\tERIC ADAMS: You know, I'm so glad you said that because I think many people are missing it. There was an amazing article in \"The New York Times\" that stated this is the first time we spent more time and energy around protecting adults than the future of our children. I'm troubled that we almost had a two-year loss for our children. They're behind in math, behind in English. We're going to sit down with my new chancellor and state it, how do we start doing the catch-up. Because remote options are not really being used and can't be used correctly for those children who don't have access to high-speed broadband, need the meals that they need.\r\n \r\n\tI know we have to look at a different way of living with Covid each time a new variant comes out.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tERIC ADAMS: And one area is education.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: But you do have these staffing shortages, as many schools are seeing around the country. The federal government says they're giving out plenty of money for you to hire people to come in, but how do you get someone to take a job as a teacher right now, in the middle of a pandemic, at a low wage?\r\n \r\n\tERIC ADAMS: Well, we need them in. And our teachers are paid accordingly to a great union contract, and they get the support that they deserve. And we need to attract people to do what I like to say, teaching is a calling. We're not just trying to make sure we fill a job applicant. No, we want the best in front of our children.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tERIC ADAMS: And what we have done successfully here in the city is pivot and shift based on the needs and how Covid is changing. We must learn to live with Covid, and we have to do it in a safe way.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we may have to live with it, but for the infection rate, when I look at the New York State Department of Health report, which I just did, it said, potential increased severity of the omicron variant may also play a role in increased rate of hospitalizations for children under age 11.\r\n \r\n\tWhat makes you confident that omicron isn't causing bad outcomes in kids when the state makes this point?\r\n \r\n\tERIC ADAMS: Well, let's look at something else the state -- the city has stated. A child is four times more likely to be hospitalized if they're not vaccinated. So, I am saying to my parents and the people of New York, get vaccinated and get booster shots. We don't have to feel helpless, like the beginning of this virus in 2020. Science and global communities came together. We now have the tools that we need. So, let's empower ourselves with the vaccination and booster shots.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tERIC ADAMS: If we do that, we will bring down those hospital rates, and that is what I'm encouraging parents to do.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: But some parents are just not vaccinating their five to 11-year-olds, at that younger demographic. But what about kids who are four and under? They don't have an option to take a vaccine, and that is where you're seeing the fastest growing infection rate according to the New York State Department of Health.\r\n \r\n\tAre you going to keep daycares facilities open? Are you going to keep pre- schools open when those kids can't be vaccinated?\r\n \r\n\tERIC ADAMS: Yes, we are. We're going to continue to do what we're doing, coordinating with our health care professionals. When you start to disrupt the stability of childcare, of daycare and education, it has a rippling impact throughout our entire city. Parents can't keep their children home. They have to work.\r\n \r\n\tThe economy is also part of this crisis that we're facing. And with the proper balance of creating a safe environment inside our daycares, our schools and other locations, or parents can go and do the job they need to do. And that is what I must face in the city. We have to insure the financial eco-system is healthy, as well as our children and our families are healthy at the same time.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Mayor, we'll be watching. Thank you for your time this morning.\r\n \r\n\tERIC ADAMS: Thank you. Take care.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Around the world we have reached another milestone. There have now been more than 300 million reported infections since the pandemic began.\r\n \r\n\tOur Elizabeth Palmer reports from Bangkok.\r\n \r\n\tELIZABETH PALMER: Good morning.\r\n \r\n\tThe Beijing Winter Olympics games are going to start in less than a month now, and China is desperately trying to keep Covid at bay, but the outbreaks haven't stopped.\r\n \r\n\t(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\r\n \r\n\tELIZABETH PALMER (voice over): Most recently in Tiangjing (ph), commuting distance from Beijing, an army of health care workers are testing the city's 14 million residents after two omicron cases were confirmed.\r\n \r\n\tIn the northern city of Tiang (ph), state media showed government food deliveries to some of the 13 million citizens in lockdown since December 23rd. Other heavy-handed tactics include welding shut the doors of anyone suspected of having been exposed to the virus.\r\n \r\n\tIn Serbia, there were demonstrations in support of the world's top-ranked tennis player and native son, Novak Djokovic. His visa was canceled when he arrived unvaccinated in Melbourne for the Australian Open. He's now grounded in his hotel. Some tennis fans and most anti-vaxxers are furious as an Australian court prepares to decide whether he'll be allowed to play or be sent home.\r\n \r\n\tFinally, omicron is surging in Europe, with more than 300,000 new cases yesterday in France alone. In Britain, hospitals are at capacity. But there are, at last, very early signs that the surge has peaked, at least in London. While Israel is now offering a second booster, that is a fourth vaccination, to the vulnerable.\r\n \r\n\t(END VIDEOTAPE)\r\n \r\n\tELIZABETH PALMER: Consider vaccine inequality, though. The world's richest countries have now given more booster shots alone than all the vaccines administered by the world's poorest countries put together.\r\n \r\n\tMargaret.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Elizabeth Palmer, thank you.\r\n \r\n\tWe'll be right back.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Since the 2020 elections, Georgia has become ground zero in the fight over election integrity. The state's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger joins us now from Atlanta.\r\n \r\n\tGood morning to you, Mr. Secretary.\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER, GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE: Good morning.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Just to remind our audience, you became known nationally in the wake of that election because you refused to succumb to pressure from President Trump when he specifically asked you to, quote, find 11,780 votes. President Biden, of course, won that state by 11,779 votes.\r\n \r\n\tNow you're up for re-election, and you are being primed by a Republican congressman who objected the even certifying the president's victory.\r\n \r\n\tI wonder, do you fear that in the future Republicans officials in your state may try to change the outcome of an upcoming election for purely political purposes?\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: Well, the person I'm running against, Congressman Hice, he's been in Congress for several years. He's never done a single piece of election reform legislation. Then he certified his own race with those same machines, those same ballots, and yet for President Trump he said you couldn't trust that. That's a double-minded person. And as a pastor, he should know better.\r\n \r\n\tSo, I'm going to run on integrity and I'm going to run on the truth. I don't know what he's going to run on.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: But to that point, is the level of what's at stake here the possibility that an election outcome in your state could be manipulated?\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: The laws that we have in place, there have been concerns raised. But, no, the results will be the results. And those will be the results that will be certified. You cannot overturn the will of the people. And so that won't matter. But, at the end of the day, I will be re-elected and he will not be.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about something that the former president claimed this week, which, once again, he says there was fraud in Georgia. He says people were being paid $10 for their ballots.\r\n \r\n\tI know that asking a third party to drop off your absentee ballot, something called ballot harvesting, is illegal in the state of Georgia. But I wonder, has there been any evidence that any of those ballots were actually fraudulent or cast by ineligible voters?\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: It is an ongoing investigation. What I can tell you is that we just got that information in November 2021, a year after -- over a year after the election. So we'd liked -- wish we would have gotten it a whole lot sooner. But we've opened up an investigation. But there's \u2013 no one has alleged that those are fraudulent ballots\r\n \r\n\tThose were lawful voters and the allegation is that then they were collected and delivered by a person. But that's one thing that I do think we need is to make sure that nationwide there should be a law that bans, you know, ballot harvesting. I don't think that ballot harvesting is good. The only person that should touch your ballot is you and the election official. So I think that's one solid, election reform measure.\r\n \r\n\tNumber two, I think that we should have a constitutional amendment, a U.S. constitutional amendment, that only American citizens vote in our elections. And I think we should also have photo ID. We now have photo ID for all forms of voting in Georgia. We have --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Only U.S. citizens do currently vote in elections, but go on.\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: But we don't have a constitutional amendment. Now you see cities are trying to push non-citizen voting. And I believe that only American citizens should be voting in our elections. And that's supported by a wide variety --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: A wide majority of all Americans, just like photo ID is supported by all demographic groups and a majority of both political parties. And that's what they've been using in Minnesota for over 11 years for their absentee balloting. So that's another, you know, solid, common sense federal reform measure, if they really want to get series about election reform.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: I assume there you're referring to the president and the vice president, who will be traveling to your state in the coming days. They are doing so to campaign for two laws, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: Right. And the --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: The Freedom to Vote Act actually does promote a national standard for states that have an ID requirement for in-person voting. You could use a bank statement, a utility bill.\r\n \r\n\tI wonder, why do you think Republicans --\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: It does not have -- it does not have photo ID. And photo ID is the most secure way of using and making sure that you can identify who the voter is. And I think that's very important. And then they also want same-day registration. And that's just -- you know, very difficult for any election official to manage. And I think that undermines trust in elections. And right now we need to restore trust wherever we can.\r\n \r\n\tIn Georgia, we've been fighting this theme of, you know, stolen election claims from Stacey Abrams, about voter suppression, and in 2020 it was about voter fraud. Both of them undermine voter trust.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: They may both undermine voter trust, but I'm sure you draw a distinction between someone who doesn't hold any kind of office and the president of the United States actively putting pressure on you to find and manufacture votes. They're not equivalent.\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: Well, January 6th was terrible, but the response doesn't need to be eliminating photo ID and then having same-day registration. And if you don't have the appropriate guardrails in place, then you're not going to have voter confidence in the results.\r\n \r\n\tIn Georgia, we've actually increased the number of days of early voting.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: We have more early voting now than New York, New Jersey, and Delaware.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: No, I -- I understand. But when you were talking about Stacey Abrams, I was just acknowledging that there is a difference, that she didn't call on people to attack the state capitol when she was questioning the outcome of the 2018 gubernatorial race.\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: The president is the top, you know, official that we have in our country. And, obviously, that position of power is just much higher than a candidate running for governor.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: But, be that as it may, when people lose races, I think the proper thing to do is admit that you lose. And if you want to run again, by all means do so.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.\r\n \r\n\tGeorgia has a painful past with racial discrimination. And until 2013, states, like Georgia, had to seek some federal pre-clearance where it came to changing their election laws. I won't get into all of the details of it, but this is one of the provisions that the White House says is so important in the John Lewis Voting Right Act.\r\n \r\n\tDo you see any merit in the idea that there needs to be more federal oversight in states that have a history of racial discrimination?\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: Georgia has moved so far ahead. We're not where we were in 1965. And you look at -- we hare more early voting than all the --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: But this was in place until 2013.\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: I know. And I think that we have shown that Georgia has fair and honest elections. We have record registrations. We have record turnout. Anyone that wants to vote in Georgia has tremendous opportunities to vote early, vote with no excuse absentee voting, with photo ID, and then also show up on Election Day. And I'll compare our record against other states.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: In fact, we were just recognized by Heritage as the number one state for election integrity.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Well -- by Heritage. And I think the public will hear a different version when they -- when the president goes to your state, and that's why we wanted to talk to you today.\r\n \r\n\tMr. Secretary, thank you for your time.\r\n \r\n\tBRAD RAFFENSPERGER: Thank you.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: And we will go directly now to the director and founder for the Center for Election Innovation and Research, David Becker.\r\n \r\n\tGood morning to you, David.\r\n \r\n\tDAVID BECKER, FOUNDER, CENTER FOR ELECTION INNOVATION AND RESEARCH: Good morning, Margaret.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: If -- I want to talk about a number of things, but is there anything there that the secretary laid out that you would like to respond to? I know specifically on voter ID and what he referred to as ballot harvesting, you have some views?\r\n \r\n\tDAVID BECKER: Well, I mean, I think there -- there's room for disagreement in the states on a variety of the administrative policies around elections. How many ballots a third party might be able to deliver from a place like a nursing home, how ridge an ID system has to be and what kind of failsafe is there to make sure that eligible voters don't exclude it because -- don't get excluded from voting because they don't happen to have ID.\r\n \r\n\tBut I think what we're really worried about at this -- in this moment in time, right now, because of the lies being spread by the losing presidential candidate, are the efforts to sew confusion and chaos into the vote counting and certification process. That's what I'm really working on and looking at in the states. And it's something I know Secretary Raffensperger and his colleagues, both Republican and Democrat, around the country are looking at.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: And we mentioned that earlier with the speaker of the House.\r\n \r\n\tBut looking nationwide, 25 states enacted 62 laws that expanded voting since 2020. Nearly all of them have Democratic-controlled legislatures. Nineteen states enacted 34 voting restrictive laws. All of those had GOP- controlled legislatures.\r\n \r\n\tWhen you look at that breakdown, what does this say to you? And when it comes specifically to Georgia, is it really the case that what they have done is Jim Crow on steroids, as President Biden refers to it, because the secretary of state there says that's not what he's seeing?\r\n \r\n\tDAVID BECKER: Well, I think what you're seeing -- obviously, that's not the sign of a healthy democracy. And our democracy is in crisis right now. I'm as concerned as I've ever been. And certainly in those states where\r\n \r\n\tRepublicans control majorities in the legislatures, those majorities are being fueled by the lies from the losing presidential candidate of their party. We are now over 400 days after what was, by any measure, the most secure, transparent, scrutinized and verified election in American history, more audits of those ballots than ever before, ore court scrutiny and verification of the outcomes than ever before, including judges appointed by the losing presidential candidate himself.\r\n \r\n\tAnd so in states like Texas, Florida, Arizona, and, yes, even Georgia, we see election policy being considered in a way that's not entirely constructive. It is partisan. It's based on some false premises about how well the election was run. The facts are, in Georgia, and in those other states and throughout the country, the election was run exceedingly well. It's remarkable how well it was run with resources being scarce, with the highest turnout we've ever seen.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tDAVID BECKER: And in the middle of a global pandemic.\r\n \r\n\tSo, in Georgia, it's true, compared to most of the other states, Georgia actually has pretty accessible voting policies. But that being said, the legislature removed some powers from Secretary Raffensperger, who he and his staff did a remarkably good job in 2020. They have injected some chaos into the counting certification process that doesn't need to be there. But in other states like Texas it's even worse, where the voting laws are much more restrictive and there's even more chaos being injected into the process.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: So, because of what's happening at the state level, the White House is making the broader argument that there needs to be more federal election law crafted. They are putting their shoulder behind two bills, and we're going to hear from the president in the coming days about the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Right Act.\r\n \r\n\tThe White House says these are absolutely essential. They don't have the votes to pass either of them. But on the premise here that there needs to be more federal oversight, do you agree?\r\n \r\n\tDAVID BECKER: I think that there could be some value right now given the unprecedented attack on our democracy, and the fact that tens of millions of American citizens have been led to believe, fueled by lies, that our system does not have integrity. And just to be clear, we have the most integrity in American elections than we've ever had in American history at this moment in time, and that will continue to grow.\r\n \r\n\tBut there could be some use for some federal standards. There's a lot of good things in those two bills. But as you noted, it's highly unlikely that either has even 50 votes to pass the Senate. But if there could be a truly bipartisan effort to look at the crisis issues in our democracy and try to find ways to resolve them so that we don't have confusion and chaos in the post-election period, that the person who gets the most votes is declared the winner under systems that are transparent, that would be really good.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tSo one of the ideas that was floated in the past week was trying to update the Electoral Count Act. So that's something that -- even some of the Democrats on the January 6th committee, including Congresswoman Lofgren, had supported updating that kind of archaic law, which was at the heart of some of the premise of disputing January 6th. But both of vice president and the Senate minority leader both really shot that down this week.\r\n \r\n\tIn fact, Senator Schumer said, clarifying the Electoral Count Act is a distraction and so, this is a quote, it's sort of like saying, well, I'm going to rig the game, but then I will make sure you count the score accurately. What the hell is the point if you rig the game to count the score accurately?\r\n \r\n\tWere you surprised to hear that kind of language from the Democratic leader, and should it be reformed, the Electoral Count Act?\r\n \r\n\tDAVID BECKER: Yes, well, there's, obviously, a lot of politics being played right now in terms of getting whatever bills that can be passed moved in the next year as we enter the mid-term elections. But I agree with many experts and members of both parties that it would be good to clarify and revise the Electoral Count Act of 1877 -- 1887, rather, and to make it clear that the joint session of Congress is purely a ceremonial session.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tDAVID BECKER: They are just counting the vote. It's really -- it's really like the Oscars. They're not voting on who won best picture, they're just announcing who won best picture.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. Exactly.\r\n \r\n\tDAVID BECKER: And, similarly, that's what the joint session (INAUDIBLE), and I think that would be really available.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.\r\n \r\n\tThank you, David Becker, for your perspective, as always.\r\n \r\n\tWe'll be back in a moment.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n",

            "article_content": "The 2022 primary season for this year's midterm elections officially launched Tuesday in Texas, where voters will cast ballots in several statewide races and all 38 congressional districts. Polls closed throughout the state at 9 p.m. ET CBS News projects that Governor Greg Abbott will avoid a runoff and secure the Republican gubernatorial nomination. CBS News also projects Democrat Beto O'Rourke will win the Democratic nomination and face Abbott in November. And in the Republican Lieutenant Governor race, CBS News projects that Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick will win his primary. Despite facing credible primary challengers, Abbott instead frequently focused on O'Rourke rather than attacking his GOP opponents. Abbott's campaign spent about $11.4 million during the primary, according to AdImpact, and his campaign reported having about $50 million cash on hand as of February 19. O'Rourke is hoping to revive some of the enthusiasm from his failed 2018 Senate campaign, when he narrowly lost to GOP Senator Ted Cruz. O'Rourke used the momentum from that campaign to launch a presidential bid, but dropped out of the race in November 2019 before any votes were cast. Abbott's campaign has attacked O'Rourke over some of the positions that he took during that primary, including his support for a mandatory assault weapon buyback program. O'Rourke softened that position in a February interview with\u00a0KLTV, telling the station that he's \"not interested in taking anything from anyone.\" O'Rourke spent much of the primary campaign talking about the massive problems with\u00a0Texas' power grid\u00a0during a 2021 winter storm. He also told supporters on Tuesday night that he wants to improve public education, expand Medicaid and legalize marijuana in Texas. \"We've got to get past the incompetence, the corruption and the cruelty of Greg Abbott,\" O'Rourke said. \"The people of Texas are sick of what we have and they want a change.\" \u00a0 In his victory speech, Abbott said he is \"running to keep Texas on the right course.\" \"Tonight Republicans sent a message they want to keep Texas the land of opportunity and prosperity for absolutely everybody, the prosperity that we have delivered over the past eight years,\" Abbott said. CBS News projects that Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton is advancing to a runoff election. The Associated Press projects that George P. Bush will face him in the runoff. \u00a0 Incumbent Democratic Congressman Henry Cuellar and progressive Jessica Cisneros are heading to a runoff in late May in Texas' 28th District, after neither candidate cleared the 50% mark in their highly\u00a0contentious primary race\u00a0on Tuesday,\u00a0according to the Associated Press.\u00a0 Cuellar, who has represented the district since 2005, recently had his home raided by the FBI in January, as\u00a0part of an investigation\u00a0related to Azerbaijan and several U.S. businessmen.\u00a0 Cuellar led the pack with 48.5% of the vote, with Cisneros capturing 46.8%. Tannya Benavides, a progressive educator and first time candidate, got about 4.7% of the vote. Cuellar's base of support in Laredo, as well as strong showing in the district's rural counties, put him in the lead early Wednesday morning. Cisneros was able to keep Cuellar under 50% due to her turnout in Bexar County and San Antonio, as well as Guadalupe and Atascosa counties. Texas allowed early voting until February 25, and 1,651,483 people opted to use it; more than 1 million Republicans and about 628,000 Democrats voted before primary day. Republican turnout was up slightly, compared to 2018, while Democratic early voting turnout remained the same. A majority of voters chose to cast their ballot in person \u2014 88% of Democrats and 95% of Republicans. Candidates must win at least 50% of the vote to win a primary outright. If no candidate wins 50%, the top two candidates will compete in a runoff on May 24. The primaries presented the first major test for the state's new elections law.\u00a0The hotly contested, sweeping elections bill known as SB1 was passed by Texas Republicans last year. Ahead of the primary voting, the law caused some confusion among voters applying for and returning mail ballots. Voters now must provide either a driver's license, state ID or Social Security number, and it has to match what's on their voter registration file. That file can be updated online, but many voters have encountered problems in filling out that information when returning their ballots.\u00a0 As of Monday, Harris County, home to Houston, reported that 29% of the 37,268 mail ballots received were flagged for rejection because voters did not fill out ID information correctly.\u00a0 Travis County, home to Austin, found that about 12% of the 7,000 mail ballots received were flagged for rejection, mostly due to missing ID information.\u00a0 In Williamson County, north of Austin, 690 of the 3,067 ballots returned were flagged for issues. As of Monday, 250 of those ballots had been corrected, according to the county.\u00a0 Voting by mail is down, compared to the last midterm primary elections in the state. About 7.5% of voters in Texas' 15 largest counties voted by mail as of February 25. Four years ago, 14.3% of voters in the largest counties cast mail ballots by the end of early voting.\u00a0 The Democratic primary in Texas' 28th District\u00a0was the blockbuster House race to watch on Tuesday, and because no candidate reached the 50% threshold, incumbent Cuellar now faces a runoff against Cisneros. This race was the first test of progressive challengers in elections this cycle, and can tell us a bit about what Democratic voters want in historically moderate districts like this. Cisneros came within 2,700 votes of beating Cuellar in her 2020 run, and argues her name identification and changes to the district through redistricting boost her chances. Progressive figures including\u00a0 Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are supporting and have campaigned for Cisneros while House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland is backing Cuellar. Republicans For Republicans, the crowded primary in the open 8th District has shown splits of support among the party. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has backed Morgan Luttrell, a former Navy SEAL, while Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has backed Christian Collins, a far right activist.\u00a0 In Texas' 3rd District, incumbent Republican Van Taylor advances to a primary runoff election in Texas' 3rd Congressional District. He had a slate of GOP challengers who highlighted his vote for the January 6 committee.\u00a0 The Associated Press projected Congressman Dan Crenshaw won the Republican nomination for the seat he holds in Texas' 2nd Congressional District. He faced primary challengers farther to his right who highlighted\u00a0his refusal to support any of the baseless claims that the 2020 election was \"stolen\" from former President Trump. Trump endorsements Trump endorsed all but five incumbent Republicans who are seeking reelection: Crenshaw, Taylor, Pete Sessions, Chip Roy and Tony Gonzales. Overall, he endorsed 36 candidates in Texas in federal, statewide and local races.\u00a0 Redistricting Texas Republicans took nearly all competitive House seats off the map during redistricting. Twelve seats were considered competitive in the old map, while only one (Texas' 15th District) is competitive in the new map. This means that Texas' congressional delegation will mostly be settled after Tuesday's elections, if not formally, short of any primary runoffs in May. Going into primary day, Abbott was expected to surpass the 50% mark and avoid a runoff in his bid for a third term, but he was among the many Republican governors facing primary challenges this year. Conservative former state Senator Don Huffines and former Congressman and Texas GOP chair Allen West were Abbott's two most notable challengers, running to his right. The two candidates tapped into the anger that some Texas conservatives have with Abbott over his handling of COVID, criticizing his early mask requirement at the start of the pandemic and his decision not to ban COVID-19 vaccine requirements or shut down the southern border completely. Despite the challenges, and pressure from some conservatives not to do so, Trump endorsed Abbott.\u00a0 CBS News projects that Paxton is advancing to a runoff election, and the Associated Press projects that it's George P. Bush who will be his opponent. Paxton has faced no shortage of scandals and legal issues, which earned him a crowded GOP primary. His best known challenger is Bush, the commissioner of the Texas General Land Office and son of Jeb Bush. Other challengers included Representative Louie Gohmert and former Republican Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. His challengers sing from a similar hymnal: if Republicans nominate Paxton, it will give Democrats a chance to win that seat in November because of past controversy over allegations of bribery and abuse of office. As expected, Democrat Beto O'Rourke cruised through his primary. During the primary campaign, he sought to distance himself from national Democrats, acknowledging inflation as he campaigns\u00a0 and dropping his last campaign's emphasis on gun control \u2014 his remark, \"Hell, yes, we're going to take your AR-15,\" cost him support in his presidential campaign.\u00a0 But after the power grid failure and the shift of the state legislature's agenda to the right \u2014 enacting a controversial abortion ban and election law overhaul \u2014, Democrats believe they have a fighting chance in November, in spite of Abbott's formidable cash and polling advantage. The University of Texas poll showed Abbott well ahead of O'Rourke 47%-37%. The Dallas Morning News and Emerson polls showed Abbott with high single-digit leads over O'Rourke.

And this week on Face the Nation: The future of a woman's right to choose an abortion is in jeopardy in many states across the country, as an unprecedented leak of a draft Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade creates the political equivalent of an earthquake. There is turmoil around the nation, as Republicans and Democrats scramble to figure out what the political and the practical impact of new abortion restrictions could be. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be with us. Plus, we will hear from South Carolina Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace. Then: Ukraine's military is on high alert this weekend, bracing for more attacks, as Vladimir Putin plans to celebrate Russia's annual Victory Day. Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, will be here with the latest. Plus, we will hear from the CEO of Lockheed Martin, Jim Taiclet, about what his company is doing to help provide weapons for the war effort in Ukraine. And, finally, we will take a look at the politics of this year's round of congressional redistricting fights with former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder. His new book is \"Our Unfinished March.\" It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. It has been a turbulent week across the country, as one of the most esteemed institutions in our government, the Supreme Court, experienced something that happens all the time here in Washington, the leak of a document to the media. But this leak was explosive. Not only does it draw into question the sanctity of the court, but, if the draft opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito holds, Roe vs. Wade may be overturned early this summer. Currently, abortion access is federally protected up to the point of viability. If overturned, abortion could become illegal or significantly restricted in 23 states. Republicans have been reserved in their reaction, but Democrats are furious. And we go now to the top Democrat in Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who joins us this Mother's Day from San Francisco. Happy Mother's Day to you, Madam Speaker. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D-California): Thank you. Happy Mother's Day to you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. And before we get to abortion, we did have this surprise visit on Mother's Day by the first lady, Dr. Jill Biden, to Ukraine. Last Sunday, you were in Kyiv meeting with Ukraine's president. How quickly can Congress deliver this $33 billion in aid that has been promised? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: I think we will be able to do it as quickly as possible. We have great bipartisanship in terms of our support for the fight for democracy that the people of Ukraine are making. We have respect for the strategy of the president of Ukraine. And we have a recognition of the need for weapons, for sanctions -- more weapons, more sanctions, more economic assistance, and more humanitarian assistance. I was very proud to be there with my colleagues to talk about those very specific issues and our bipartisan support for them. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you think you can get that done before the end of the month? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: I think we have to. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yes, I think we have to. The specificity with which we discuss these matters with the president, president of Ukraine, the connection that we have with the ambassador, whom you will have on the show later, we're very current on the needs and the urgency. And, again, we will have bipartisanship as we go forward with it. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Madam Speaker, I want to talk to you, of course, about abortion. California's Governor Gavin Newsom said Democrats have failed to target Republicans on this issue. Here's what he had to say: (Begin VT) GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM (D-California): Where is the Democratic Party? Where's the party? Why aren't we calling this out? This is a concerted, coordinated effort. And, yes, they're winning. We need to stand up. Where's the counteroffensive? (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Speaker, why were pro-abortion rights Democrats outmaneuvered? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: I have -- I have no idea. The fact is that we have been fighting for a woman's right to choose, and that is to choose. We have been fighting against the Republicans in the Congress constantly because the fact is, they're anti -- not just anti a woman's right to choose in terms of terminating a pregnancy, but in terms of access to contraception and family planning and the rest, both domestically and globally. This is a constant fight that we've had for generations -- I mean, decades, I should say... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: ... in my case in the Congress. And the -- we had been bipartisan early on, support for a woman's right to choose, until the politics have changed. And that's what happened to the court. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The science hasn't changed. The -- but the court changed. And, therefore, they're deciding that it will be different. I have no idea why anybody would make that statement, unless they were unaware of the fight that has been going on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have been fighting for decades on this issue. But back when Democrats held majorities in the House and the Senate, 2009, when you were speaker, President Obama was asked about codifying Roe versus Wade and said abortion is a moral and ethical issue and -- quote -- \"not the highest legislative priority.\" Do you think it was a mistake for him, for other presidents not to push harder when Democrats had the majority? (CROSSTALK) REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: If I just may, the focus we have right now is an urgent one in order to try to improve -- and try to improve this, whether we're calling it fake or draft decision, whatever it is. I think that this is a waste of time. The fact is, in '09, we really did not have a pro-choice Democratic Party. I had to fight against some of the people who did not want to pass the Affordable Care Act because they were concerned that it might enable more freedom of choice. It really didn't go down that path. Right now, we do have a pro-choice Democratic Congress, and we passed the law months ago, in last, I think, September. MARGARET BRENNAN: You did in the House, yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: It's been a while. It's a number of votes. The -- but the fact also is... MARGARET BRENNAN: But the votes aren't there in the Senate. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, the Senate is -- you'll have to talk to the Senate about the Senate. But I do think that it puts an urgency on what's happening in the election. Two more -- one or two more senators could sweep back the filibuster rule for this purpose, and then women would have a right to choose. This is about something so serious and so personal and so disrespectful of women. Here we are on Mother's Day, a week where the court has slapped women in the face, in terms of the disrespect for their judgments... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: ... about the size and timing of their families. So, the fact is, let's keep our eye on the ball. And the ball is in the court of those justices, one of whom at least said over and over again that precedent -- that precedence has been established again and again on Roe v. Wade and that -- so, this decision is about being anti-precedent and anti- privacy, and has serious ramifications as we go -- as we go down this path. And it has to be softened. I don't think there's a good outcome, but there's a better outcome as far as this is concerned. MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of the... REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: And, again, let's just be prayerful about this. This is -- this is about respect for privacy. What's next? What's next? Marriage equality? What's next, contraception? What is next? MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need to write bills to enshrine those things? Those things you just said you're concerned about, do you need bills to enshrine those now? Birth control access. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Excuse me? MARGARET BRENNAN: The things you think might be next, do you need to legislate to enshrine those in law right now to protect them, if you think the court may overturn? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: What is really interesting, Margaret, about this is, for decades, I have been trying to say to my Republican friends and women who care about a woman's right to choose, who contribute to Planned Parenthood and all of those organizations, you can't do that and expect -- you've got to weigh in with your own party on this. Barbara Bush, early on, Republicans were very much about family planning and respect for women. So, the thing is, is that most people always thought that this debate in the Congress was about the termination of a pregnancy, but it wasn't. My Republican colleagues have said to me on occasion, we're not for any family planning domestically or globally, because I was trying to get them to support us on some global family planning issues. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: We're not for any of it. And most people don't know that. And we don't want to be -- you know, this is a fact. This is a fact. That's what they believe. And they're true to their beliefs. MARGARET BRENNAN: But given the -- given the urgency of with which you're speaking, the Reproductive Choice Act, two pro-abortion rights Republicans in the Senate, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, put that forward. Leader Schumer says it's not even worth putting to a vote. But when you do have Republicans interested in working together, is that a strategic mistake? You say this is an emergency. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, it depends on what the legislation is and what the impact that it has on women's lives. The enshrinement of Roe v. Wade into the law is the way in order to protect a woman's right to choose. I don't know why they say they're for that and can't be for this legislation. Should we all have a discussion and find our common ground? Always. Always. But this -- you're either for the enshrinement of Roe v. Wade or you're not. It's the law of the land 50 -- or nearly 50 years. MARGARET BRENNAN: year REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The precedence -- precedence of it has been reaffirmed, what, 14 times. And just because there has been... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The Republicans were very clear when they had a presidential campaign that their campaign was to elect a president who would appoint judges who would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. It didn't say the science would change. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: And one more point in that regard. Mitch McConnell pulled back the filibuster rule in order to have those justices confirmed by 51 -- by not needing 60 votes, by 51. MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: So, this is a political decision on the part of this... MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The rule of law in our country should be respected. Women should be respected to make their own judgments with their family, their doctor, their God. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Speaker Pelosi, thank you for your time this morning. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The CIA director said yesterday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is doubling down on his invasion of Ukraine and does not believe that he can afford to lose. Violence is now escalating in the east. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata is in Ukraine -- Charlie. CHARLIE D'AGATA: Good morning, Margaret. The Ukrainian government blames Russian forces of bombing a school where dozens of people were taking shelter in Luhansk. Here in Kramatorsk, the bombardment has worsened too. This is some of the destruction left behind after a rocket attack struck several residential neighborhoods. (Begin VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice-over): Amid the ruins, everywhere evidence of ordinary lives violently interrupted, a woman's shoe, children's toys scattered on the ground, a favorite jacket now hanging from a tree. A few miles further east in Luhansk, emergency crews dig for survivors in a bombed school, where Ukrainian authorities say 90 people were taking shelter. In Mariupol, government officials say, while all women, children and the elderly have finally escaped from the besieged steel plant, as many as 2,000 Ukrainian forces remain, some medics, some badly wounded, some still fighting to the end. We traveled to the battered village of Velyka Novosilka, around 100 miles north of Mariupol, where 10 Russian battalion groups, around 10,000 troops, have already been redeployed. U.S. and Ukrainian intelligence says those Russians are now massing on the outskirts of this town. It's clearly come under artillery attack. The explosions are ringing out now. We found Irina Ilyenko and neighbor Valentina Hogenova in the ruins of their homes. (WOMAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CHARLIE D'AGATA: All around, shredded metal, downed trees, shattered windows, belongings blown out of bedrooms and onto branches. Can you describe what happened? (WOMAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CHARLIE D'AGATA: \"I was just sitting in the corridor when the explosions happened,\" she said, \"covering my ears and praying. The explosions deafened me.\" Wow. (WOMAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CHARLIE D'AGATA: \"Oh, my God,\" she says. Does that happen a lot? (WOMAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CHARLIE D'AGATA: There's no water or electricity. She's desperate to flee, but says she can't leave her bedridden husband behind. (WOMAN SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) CHARLIE D'AGATA: \"I just want peace to come to this land,\" she said. \"I don't want any more war and anger.\" (End VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA: That village is right on the path of Russia's main advance from the south. Here, Kramatorsk is on the firing line from the north. The Russian strategy is to close that gap and surround tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Charlie D'Agata, thank you. And some breaking news this morning. CBS News has learned that the Biden administration is sending a small group of American diplomats, including the acting ambassador to the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, to counter Russia's Victory Day celebrations. State Department sources tell CBS that the embassy hopes to resume operations and raise the American flag there in the coming weeks. We turn now to Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Good morning. Welcome back to the program. OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States): Good morning, and happy Mother's Day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Happy Mother's Day to you as well and to all the mothers out there. President Zelenskyy has said that he will speak with President Biden and other world leaders this morning. What are you expecting in terms of further support? AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Thank you. Well, as we celebrate the 77th also anniversary of the end of the World War II, it's critical that we all do everything possible to stop the war that Russian regime, very much like Nazi regime, started in Europe again. So the president will raise everything that we have been discussing during the past -- this past 73 days, more military support, more sanctions, more financial support to Ukraine. We count on all of our friends and allies to help us with everything, so we can stop Russia while it's still in Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Putin is expected to make a speech tomorrow in Red Square. It's not clear exactly what he is going to announce, but the CIA director said yesterday Putin is doubling down. What exactly are you preparing for? AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, we know that there are no red lines for the regime in Moscow, so we're preparing for everything. They said they will not go into -- that they were not going to attack us. And they did. They said that there is no war in Ukraine for the past eight years. And we know it was. They said they didn't take the Crimea. And they did. They said they're not killing civilians, and yet we see everywhere the deaths of women, children. They torture them. They rape them. They kill them. So we can count that Putin and imperialistic Russia will do everything bad they can possibly try to do. The question is, are we all prepared, the civilized world, to do everything possible to defend our democracy and freedom? And Ukraine certainly is not only ready, but shows for the past 74 days that we bravely defend those values and defend our homes. MARGARET BRENNAN: There is some speculation that Putin could officially acknowledge the country is at war and then start conscripting soldiers, which would help him build up that offensive in the east. Is that what you're expecting? AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, that would be the first time when Putin will say the truth, that it is war and that he is in dire need of conscripting soldiers. I hope that then it will be evident for all -- to all Russians what they are doing in Ukraine, that it's an aggressive war. They attacked a neighboring country, a peaceful country. And the question is, are they prepared to have more tens of thousands dying in Ukraine for no reason at all? MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. said a few days ago that Russia is planning sham elections and they're going to try to annex parts of your country, Donetsk, Luhansk in the east, also Kherson. They're already renaming schools and streets, teaching Russian curriculum, forcing the use of their currency. So, what does dismantling this part of your country actually do? Because if you want to get to a peace negotiation, they're already sort of swallowing parts of your country and trying to integrate it. AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, in addition to all the war crimes they're doing in Ukraine, this is part of their M.O. We saw it in Donetsk and Luhansk, which they occupied in 2014. We saw it in Crimea. So they tried to create the sham elections. They cannot find enough Ukrainians to participate in them, as we saw in Kherson, as we see in other places. We will never recognize it. The whole world will never recognize it. And we will do everything possible on the battlefield, but also diplomatically, to restore our territorial integrity and sovereignty. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the world will never recognize it? AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: I'm positive. MARGARET BRENNAN: Meaning? AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: I'm positive. Ukraine has to be whole within the internationally recognized borders. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, those sanctions the West has put on would stay in place... AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... is another way to say that. You know, we are seeing these reports out of Mariupol that there were some successful evacuations. It's just a dire humanitarian situation there. Can you tell us what is happening on the ground, who is left there? AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Our brave defenders, lots of wounded, a lot of doctors are still there. So, as of yesterday, we saw the reports. And our president has done everything possible to evacuate civilians. Now, while that is a success, of course, to get the civilians, women and children out, we have to remember that 95 percent of Mariupol is destroyed, that tens of thousand civilians died in Mariupol, were killed by Russians. Actually, more Mariupol citizens were killed by Russians in two months than by Nazis during two years of Nazi occupation in -- during the World War II. So, we are calling on everyone to do everything possible and impossible to get our wounded soldiers, to get our heroes, to create all possible corridors in order to get our people still out from Azovstal, where they bravely defend the Ukrainian flag and Ukraine in Mariupol. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's that steel plant where... AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... fighters have been holed up with some civilians. President Zelenskyy said influential states were involved in efforts to rescue hundreds of wounded fighters there. Who exactly is helping? What does that mean? Is that on-the-ground help? Is it just diplomatic? AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, we know that U.N. secretary-general has been in direct contact with our president, but also with others. There are a lot of diplomatic discussions with other states on that. So I think, after the war, we will be able to talk about all the efforts that were -- that were done... MARGARET BRENNAN: Israel, for example. AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: But, on the ground, it's -- it's our brave Ukrainians. And while evacuating civilians, we have to know that so many of our soldiers from Azov steel, from this plant who were trying -- helping civilians to get out have been killed and wounded during these attempts too. MARGARET BRENNAN: How significant is the intelligence sharing that the West is providing to Ukraine? We hear a lot about the weapons, but what about the actual sharing of information? AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: I think the sharing of information between Ukraine and the West with all of our friends and allies is at the level which we never had before. And we really appreciate it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you for your time today. AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. So, stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn back to the fight over abortion rights with Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace of South Carolina. She's in Charleston this morning. Happy Mother's Day to you, Congresswoman. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE (R-South Carolina): Thank you. And happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there today. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to have a conversation with you here and then we'll continue it on the other side of this break. But, first up, you are against abortion, but you believe that victims of rape and victims of incest should still have access to abortion. Do you think those exceptions should be backed up with a federal law? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Well, absolutely. I'm someone who -- I am pro-life, but I do support exceptions for rape. I'm a rape victim myself. And when you realize what's happened in your life, the trauma, the emotional, the mental, the physical trauma in a woman's life, that decision -- she should make that decision with her doctor and between her and her God. And I have worked to support those exceptions in my life, not only as a state lawmaker, but now as a member of Congress. And South Carolina has a fetal heartbeat bill that was signed into law that had those exceptions because I told my rape story. And those stories are often missed and criticized, and women are attacked when they tell those stories. And that's something that I have talked about extensively throughout the years as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you have. And I want to talk to you about those as well, because there is so much nuance here. I'm going to take a quick commercial break. And I want to ask you in more detail what kind of legislation you think could pass at the federal level, what needs to happen at the state level. So, stay with us, if you would. We will be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with Congresswoman Nancy Mace. So, stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to continue our conversation with South Carolina Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace. Congresswoman, you have spoken publicly about being molested when you were 14, raped at age 16, and how that has shaped your feelings and convictions about rape. I read that you said that it took you 25 years to talk about your attack and that you only shared it with your mother and one of your good friends. So, I wonder what you think about some of these restrictions in states that would require rape victims to provide police reports in order to obtain an abortion. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE:: Right. Well, I can't speak to other states. I - - from experience as a state lawmaker, I know that South Carolina's fetal heartbeat bill would not have passed without exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. And I told that story. I felt it was really -- a really important story. A story that's often missed and not told because women are afraid. And you can even see in public comments and on social media when I talk about it, the ways in which that I get attacked for telling that story. And one of the things that I think, you know, partially that's missing in this conversation is that, when you have victims. When Ohio did their fetal heartbeat bill, there was a 10-year-old girl that had been found to be pregnant, who was raped repeatedly by her father. And so, as -- I now it's part of the Republican Party platform, the vast majority of Republicans support those exceptions for rape, and incest, and life of the mother. And it's important for -- for some of us to step forward and tell those stories that are often missed in all of this as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So, to be clear, you would support a vote in Congress, federal legislation, to enshrine those exceptions? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Well, yes, and I think that -- I think one of the things that's missing, and I'm glad that you're bringing this up, in all of the conversation, the media coverage about Roe vs. Wade being overturned, is that what this does -- it's not an all-out federal ban on abortion, but it puts it back into state legislators and into Congress. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: You saw Congress a couple of years ago ban late- term abortions, for example. And so what this does is it puts it back to the states, it puts it back into Congress to deal with and figure out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: And it was even Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who we all know was a -- was working for women's right and thought there was a constitutional right for women to have an abortion. MARGARET BRENNAN: She did. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Knew that Roe v. Wade was flawed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, she did. She said that. She said that back in the '90s. It was a problem in her confirmation process. But -- so let's talk about states then. The governor of South Carolina, your home state, fellow Republican, said if Roe v. Wade is overturned, he wants further restrictions without those exceptions of rape or incest. He's considering restricting abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Is that too restrictive? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Well, I would only support legislation in South Carolina that had exceptions for rape and incest and life of the mother. I don't believe that that would pass without those exceptions. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about six weeks of pregnancy? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Well, that -- that bill has already been signed into law, the fetal heartbeat bill for South Carolina that he signed, I guess it was last year, had a -- it was -- it was six to eight weeks is when the heartbeat is found, but that bill had exceptions for rape and incest and life of the mother. So that law is already on the books in South Carolina. And it will be up to the legislature to determine if they want even more restrictions on it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But -- but that's where this gets messy, right, is if you're saying it's up to the states. When we look at national polling, it shows that there is a majority of Americans who want to kind of keep the status quo. At the state level, do you actually think the South Carolina legislature is in tune with public opinion here because, I mean, our polling shows more than two-thirds of Republicans say abortion should be generally available or available with stricter limits. Is it a political mistake to just paint this as pro-life, pro-choice? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Well, I think that some of the polling is murky, too. It depends on how you ask the question and who's paying for the polling. There is some polling out there that says that there are only 25 percent of Americans, some say up to 30 percent, that want abortion in ever case. They don't want any restrictions. So that says to me that there's a vast -- a vast majority of Americans that are OK with restrictions on abortion. And we have some of the most liberal abortion laws in the world. If you look at Europe, there are many European countries that don't allow abortion after the first trimester or after 15 weeks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Twelve weeks or so. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: And in Poland, for example, they don't allow any abortions unless there it's rape, incest or life of the mother. And so it is a complicated issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. It's a bit of an outlier there in Europe. It is. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Right. But, you know, Portugal is 12 weeks. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Congresswoman, I want to quickly ask you, you're being primaried by a Trump-backed candidate. Do you think your position on this is going to make it more complicated for you? Do you think President Trump is still the leader of your party? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Well, my position on life with exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother is in line with my district, it's in line with the majority of, I believe, voters in my state as well. We've raised over $4.5 million for this race. My opponent has raised less than $300,000. And, you know, I'm working very hard to win this, not just by single digits, but by double digits. And I think he's been given bad advice. My opponent lost -- had her top secret security clearance revoked for leaking classified information about our military. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: I live in a very fiscally conservative district, and she voted for the highest tax hike in South Carolina history. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: And so there are very stark contrasts in our record. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: And we've raised the most money. We have the highest polling. And I've got 40 days to go until the June primary and I'm looking forward to winning. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll watch for it. Thank you, Congresswoman. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We now turn to Jim Taiclet, the CEO of defense giant Lockheed Martin, which makes some of the weapons the U.S. is sending to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Good morning to you, sir. JIM TAICLET, CEO, LOCKHEED MARTIN: Good morning, Margaret. Happy Mother's Day to you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for saying that. We hear time and again one of the most powerful tools that the Ukrainians have are these anti-tank, Russian tank busting missiles known as javelins. That's what your company jointly produces with Raytheon. How quickly can you scale up production to get more to them and to backfill what the U.S. has given up? JIM TAICLET: Sure, Margaret. Well, the president visited us in Troy, Alabama, to thank the workforce earlier this week and we really appreciate what he's done for us. We are, therefore, on our side, accelerating our investment in that factory and in our workforce there. So we're already investing ahead of time to buy tooling, to expand the plant and also support our suppliers to get ready to ramp up production. So, right now our capacity 2,100 javelin missiles per year. We're endeavoring to take that up to 4,000 per year. And that will take a number of months, maybe even a couple of years to get there because we have to get our supply chain to also crank up as we do. So, we think we can almost double the capacity in a reasonable amount of time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Raytheon had said that a different system, the stingers, they couldn't even get going on ramping that up until 2023. But you can start when, exactly? JIM TAICLET: We're starting now to ramp it up because we have an active production line right now that the president saw. And, also, we've got a supply chain that's active, in addition to that. So we can start turning up the heat now and ramping the production immediately because of those circumstances. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said -- well, you implied your basically doing on spec, right? JIM TAICLET: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're anticipating that order is going to come through from the U.S. government. But you're a businessperson. You have to plan ahead. We don't know how long this war is going to last. The CIA says, you know, Vladimir Putin thinks he's got to double down here. So, how long are you planning for with this ramp up? JIM TAICLET: We're planning for the long run, and not just in the javelin, because this situation, the Ukrainian conflict, has highlighted a couple of really important things for us. One is that we need to have superior systems in large enough numbers. So like javelins, stingers, advanced cruise missiles, equipment like that. So, we know there's going to be increased demand for those kinds of systems from the U.S. -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Throughout -- OK. JIM TAICLET: And for our allies as well and beyond into Asia Pacific most likely too. The second really valuable lesson was control of the air space is really critical. So, the Ukrainians are managing to control their air space. The Russian air force doesn't have free reign over the entire country. And the reason that they don't is because the Ukrainians can still fly their aircraft and they also have a pretty effective integrated air and missile defense system. So products and systems like F-16, F-35, patriot missiles, THAAD missiles, we know that there's going to be increased demand for those kinds of equipment, too, because the threat between Russia and China is just going to increase even after the Ukrainian war, we hope is over soon. Though two nations, and regionally Iran and North Korea, are not going to get less active. Probably they're going to get more active. So we want to make sure we can supply our allies and our country what they need to defend against that. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what do you need to do that, because you did say supply chain is an issue? I read that there's over, what, 250 microchips or semiconductors in each javelin. JIM TAICLET: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: We know there's an effort in Congress to get legislation to try to create more semiconductors here instead of relying on Asian suppliers. Can you do this scale-up without that kind of legislation? JIM TAICLET: It will be extremely helpful to have the bipartisan innovation act passed, for example, because we do need to invest more in the infrastructure in the U.S. so we have domestic supply, especially in microprocessors. And so our production line can run today, but in the future we're going to need more domestic capability in microprocessor, not only design, but manufacturing, testing, et cetera, so that were have assured supply of those microprocessors in the future. And there will be other inputs too, but that's one of the highlighted ones. MARGARET BRENNAN: But we've heard on this program time and again from business people how important that is to get done. Congress still hasn't voted on it or voted it through. JIM TAICLET: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any commitments from anyone here in Washington to get this to the president's desk soon? JIM TAICLET: Well, we know that there's a lot of support for it both in Congress, in the administration, the Commerce Department, et cetera. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it takes time to scale that up? JIM TAICLET: Yes, it does. It takes years. And so we're collaborating right now, for example, with Intel. It's one of our partners in trying to drive what we call 21st century security into national defense. And we're going to need the most advanced processors and we're going to need them to be customizable to defense needs as well. So having that domestic capability again to go all the way through production and testing is going to be more important in the future than it is even today. MARGARET BRENNAN: You also make F-35s fighter jets, you referenced there. Germany is now trying to buy them. I mean you have a lot of buyers in Europe right now potentially. Do you have enough workers to meet all of these requests? JIM TAICLET: We have enough now, but we know, like, for example, in the F- 16 line as well that we're building up in South Carolina, actually, we need more workers. And so we're recruiting heavily. We've got a very strong workforce in Fort Worth, Texas, where we make the F-35s. So that production line is running just fine now. We've got sufficient employees there to do that. But in other parts of the country, and ultimately in Texas, we're going to need to actually hire more people. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you very much for giving us insight to your business. JIM TAICLET: Glad to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: And for being here in person. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Every 10 years the 50 states redraw their political boundaries based on population changes. Some states can gain seats in Congress, others might lose some. The process is almost always messy as state parties try to secure an edge for the decade to come. CBS's Ed O'Keefe took a look at four redistricting fights. (BEGIN VT) ED O'KEEFE (voice over): In four big states this year, two red and two blue, Democrats and Republicans couldn't agree on a redistricting plan, so courts were asked to intervene. New York's highest court tossed out a map drawn by the Democratic controlled state legislature saying lawmakers did an end run around a non- partisan commission. New York lost one House seat in the census, and although Republicans currently hold eight House seats, the new map drawn by Democrats would have make it difficult for Republicans to win more than four. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're trying to silence the voices of the people in this district. ED O'KEEFE: The court has appointed an official to draw up yet another map due this month. In Illinois, after the state lost a House seat, Democrats eliminated two districts where Republicans were expected to win. Republicans challenged the new map in court, but it's likely to stand. The GOP is also guilty of creative cartography. Texas is gaining two seats in Congress. And although minorities accounted for 95 percent of the state's population growth in the last decade, Republicans redrew the map to protect their incumbents by eliminating competitive districts were Democrats were making gains. The Justice Department and civil rights groups sued. VANITA GUPTA, ASSOCIATE U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Texas' redistricting plans will dilute the increased minority voting strength that should have developed from these significant demographic shifts. ED O'KEEFE: And in Florida, which also gained a House seat, Republican governor Ron DeSantis insisted state lawmakers draw a map that eliminated an historically black congressional district, stretching from Jacksonville to Tallahassee, potentially giving Republicans four more seats. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): We are not going to have a 200 mile gerrymander that divvies up people based on the color of their skin. That is wrong. ED O'KEEFE: Democrats have filed suit, but they're running out of time before November's elections. STATE SEN. TRACIE DAVIS (D-FL): The black population in Florida that lives north of the I-4 corridor, their voices will be diluted. ED O'KEEFE (on camera): When the dust settles after this decades round of redistricting, it remains to see whether either party will emerge with a distinct structural advantage nationwide. Now, whether the new lines are fairly drawn, well, that's a matter of political preference. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Ed O'Keefe in Washington. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to former Obama administration attorney general, Eric Holder. He started a group in 2016, the National Democrat Redistricting Committee, to help the party redraw congressional lines. And he has a new book out called, \"Our Unfinished March.\" Good morning to you. ERIC HOLDER, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad to have you here. You know, in the book you write both parties have embraced gerrymandering when they were in control of state governments, but you say Democrats were caught asleep at the wheel when Republicans started investing 12 years ago in some of these local races. You know, critics call your strategy just sue to blue. That it's just all about partisanship. How do you respond to that? ERIC HOLDER: No, ours is a fight for fairness. And, yes, we've brought a lot of lawsuits -- successfully brought a lot of lawsuits in order to make sure that the process is done in a fair way and so that the American people actually pick their representatives as opposed to politicians choosing their voters. And so sue to blue, that's what they say when you're winning in court, which is what we have done at a whole bunch of levels. MARGARET BRENNAN: You think Democrats have an advantage then going into the midterms versus where you started out? ERIC HOLDER: Well, I think we certainly stopped the Republicans when they said they wanted to secure a decade of power in this next decade based on the redistricting that they were going to do. We have blunted that effort and we certainly have more fair maps than we did coming out of the last redistricting cycle. The thing that really worries me, however, is that we have 40 percent fewer competitive seats than I think we should have as a result of what both parties have done. MARGARET BRENNAN: You say this is about fairness, but you haven't challenged any Democratic gerrymanders. Ed O'Keefe laid out some of those examples there. Both of the maps passed by Democrats were thrown out by courts in Maryland and in New York. Do you have a problem with what happened there? ERIC HOLDER: I indicated my opposition to what had happened, what the legislature did in Maryland. I agreed with the judge, which he did there. And In New York what I've said is that those are not the maps that I would have drawn in New York. My guess is that after the courts look at what happened in New York, you will see maps that are different but not fundamentally different. I think you can't compare, however, what happened in New York and Maryland to what is going on in Texas, Georgia, potentially Florida, Wisconsin, where Republicans have really gone to town in terms of gerrymanders. Fundamentally different from what Democrats have done. MARGARET BRENNAN: How so? ERIC HOLDER: They are -- if you look at Texas, which is getting two additional seats strictly as a result of the increase in the Hispanic population, they have not increased that -- the power of Hispanics in Texas at all. In fact, they have created more majority white districts in Texas. The map that you see in New York reflects really a population shift, a hollowing out of the rural areas in New York, as well as an increase in the urban areas in New York. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ERIC HOLDER: So there's a census basis -- census bureau basis of what's happening in New York that does not exist in the -- in Republican states. MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard there what is happening in Florida and what Governor Ron DeSantis describes. He says that what he is doing with redrawing is race neutral. I know you strongly disagree. Are you saying the gerrymandering there is rooted in racism? ERIC HOLDER: It's certainly race conscious. What he is doing there, by doing away with a traditionally black seat is certainly a factor. Race is a factor there. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you think it's to intentionally disenfranchise? ERIC HOLDER: That's certainly a component of, I think, their thinking. They're going after Democrats. And the fact that that -- the Democrats that they're going after happen to be black I don't think is necessarily a coincidence. The suit that we won in Alabama was -- where we said that you should have additional representation for a black -- the black inhabitants of Alabama, those districts were certainly drawn with the thought that they would disenfranchise African-Americans in Alabama. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Alabama because as I understand it, the Supreme Court has tried not to directly get involved in what they deemed political gerrymandering, but they have signaled a willingness to hear cases that involve issues of race. There are still elections scheduled in November, in the state of Alabama, even though the court will hear this case. Do you think that the maps being redrawn in Alabama will ultimately be deemed to be illegal and therefore the election should be invalid? Is that what you're saying? ERIC HOLDER: Well, you know, it's interesting -- no, it's an interesting thing. Well, they're going to have an election in November based on maps that judges, including two Trump judges, said were inappropriately, unconstitutionally drawn. The Supreme Court said too close to the election and so we're going to allow the election to go ahead on those maps that were found to be defective. Now, that the Supreme Court will ultimately do with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which was the basis for the lawsuit in Alabama, will remain to be seen. But that's one of the things I talk about in my book, this notion of us getting to some structural changes, that we need to look -- we need to ban partisan gerrymandering. We need the structures of our democracy if we're going to try to -- if we're going to try to save it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have a lot of different recommendations in the book, but, I mean, it's a long to-do list. And the problem that you sketch out here, you say that the entire democratic system, essentially, is broken, as I understand it. Unrepresentative Senate, unnecessary anti- democrat Electoral College, gerrymandered House of Representatives, panoply of state legislatures, and a stolen Supreme Court. A stolen Supreme Court. You say every person having an equal say in our democracy, one person, one vote, is far from a reality. ERIC HOLDER: Yes, I think that's true. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying the entire system is broken. What -- so if Republicans win control of Congress in November, is that election -- does it not have integrity? Do you not accept the outcome of it? ERIC HOLDER: No, I think your premise goes a little far. I wouldn't say that everything is broken, but there is -- MARGARET BRENNAN: I was reading from your book there. ERIC HOLDER: No, what I'm saying -- I would say is, there is a substantial amount of our structure that needs to be repaired, that needs to be examined. And I think we should -- what I've tried to put out -- point out in the book is that we have faced these issues before and that we've had heroes and heroines in our history that have faced similar kinds of issues and through sacrifice, commitment, they have made a difference. And we have the capacity, I think, to make these kinds of changes. Banning partisan gerrymanders. If you look at the Supreme Court, we have two seats, one stolen from the Democrats that Merrick Garland should have now. That -- that seat was not filled because it was to close to an election. And then Amy Coney Barrett was placed into a seat while people were actually voting. I mean those are the kinds of things that I think need to be addressed. And what I talk about in the book is to say, look, we should term limit the justices, 18 years, and that every president should have an opportunity to nominate two justices per term and to try to take some of the pressure out of this -- the partisanship and the confirmation process. MARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans would, obviously, disagree with your characterization of how that played out. But I do want -- Merrick Garland, you mentioned, he's now in your old job as attorney general. ERIC HOLDER: Uh-huh. MARGARET BRENNAN: There have been critics of him who say that he isn't being aggressive enough around the prosecutions regarding January the 6th. Do you think that's right? ERIC HOLDER: No one knows. I mean, you know, I have great faith in Merrick and in the people at the Justice Department. We won't really know how aggressive they have been until they are before a camera and announcing a decision, either to indict certain people or not indict certain people. And here's my prediction, at some point people at the Justice Department, perhaps that prosecutor in Atlanta, are going to have to make a determination about whether or not they want to indict Donald Trump. The air is going to be -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you do it? ERIC HOLDER: Well, I think there's going to be sufficient factual information. And I think that there's going to be sufficient proof of intent. And then the question becomes, what's the impact of such an indictment. I'm an institutionalist. My initial thought was not to indict the former president out of concern of what -- how divisive it would be. But given what we have learned, I think that he probably has to be held accountable. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll leave it on that incredible note. Mr. Holder, thank you for your time and for sharing your book. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. And to all of the mothers watching, Happy Mother's Day to you.

And some breaking news this morning. CBS News has learned that the Biden administration is sending a small group of American diplomats, including the acting Ambassador to the U.S. embassy in Kyiv, to counter Russia's Victory Day celebrations. State Department sources tell CBS that the embassy hopes to resume operations and raise the American flag there in the coming weeks. We turn now to Ukraine's Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Good morning. Welcome back to the program. AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Good morning and happy Mother's Day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Happy Mother's Day to you as well and to all the mothers out there. President Zelenskyy has said that he will speak with President Biden and other world leaders this morning. What are you expecting in terms of further support? AMB. MARKAROVA: Thank you. Well, you know, as we celebrate the 77th also anniversary of the end of the World War Two, it's critical that we all do everything possible to stop the war that Russian regime, very much like Nazi regime, started in Europe again. So the president will raise everything that we have been discussing during the past- this past 73 days: more military support, more sanctions, more financial support to Ukraine. We count on all of our friends and allies to help us with everything so we can stop Russia while it's still in Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Putin is expected to make a speech tomorrow in Red Square. It's not clear exactly what he is going to announce, but the CIA director said yesterday Putin is doubling down. What exactly are you preparing for? AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, we know that there are no red lines for the regime in Moscow, so we're preparing for everything. They said they will not go into- that they were not going to attack us, and they did. They said that there is no war in Ukraine for the past eight years, and we know it was. They said they didn't take the Crimea and they did. They said they're not killing civilians, and yet we see everywhere the deaths of women, children. They torture them, they rape them, they kill them. So we can count that Putin and imperialistic Russia will do everything bad they can possibly try to do. The question is, are we all prepared, the civilized world, to do everything possible to defend our democracy and freedom? And Ukraine certainly is not only ready, but shows for the past 74 days that we bravely defend those values and defend our homes. MARGARET BRENNAN: There is some speculation that Putin could officially acknowledge the country is at war and then start conscripting soldiers, which would help him build up that offensive in the East. Is that what you're expecting? AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, that would be the first time when Putin will say the truth, that it is war and that he is in dire need of conscripting soldiers. I hope that then it will be evident for all- to all Russians what they are doing in Ukraine. That it's an aggressive war. They attacked a neighboring country, a peaceful country. And the question is, are they prepared to have more tens of thousands dying in Ukraine for no reason at all? MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. said a few days ago that Russia is planning sham elections and they're going to try to annex parts of your country, Donetsk, Luhansk in the east, also Kherson. They're already renaming schools and streets, teaching Russian curriculum, forcing the use of their currency. So what is dismantling this part of your country actually do? Because if you want to get to a peace negotiation, they're already sort of swallowing parts of your country and trying to integrate it. AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, in addition to all the war crimes they're doing in Ukraine, this is part of their M.O. We saw it in Donetsk and Luhansk, which they occupied in 2014. We saw it in Crimea. So they tried to create the sham elections. They cannot find enough Ukrainians to participate in them as we saw in Kherson, as we see in other places. We will never recognize it, the whole world will never recognize it. And we will do everything possible on the battlefield, but also diplomatically, to restore our territorial integrity and sovereignty. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the world will never recognize it? AMB. MARKAROVA: I'm positive--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --Meaning? AMB. MARKAROVA: I'm positive. Ukraine has to be whole within the internationally recognized borders. MARGARET BRENNAN: So those sanctions the West has put on would stay in place--\u00a0 AMB. MARKAROVA: Absolutely.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --Is another way to say that. You know, we are seeing these reports out of Mariupol that there were some successful evacuations. It's just a dire humanitarian situation there. Can you tell us what is happening on the ground? Who is left there? AMB. MARKAROVA: Our brave defenders, lots of wounded, a lot of doctors are still there. So as of yesterday, we saw the reports and our president has done everything possible to evacuate civilians. Now, while that is a success, of course, to get the civilians, women and children out, we have to remember that 95% of Mariupol is destroyed, that tens of thousand civilians died in Mariupol, were killed by Russians. Actually, more Mariupol citizens were killed by Russians in two months than by Nazis during two years of Nazi occupation in- during the World War Two. So we are calling on everyone to do everything possible and impossible to get our wounded soldiers, to get our heroes, to create all possible corridors, in order to get our people still out from Azovstal, where they bravely defend the Ukrainian flag and Ukraine in Mariupol. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's that steel plant where-- AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --fighters have been holed up with some civilians. President Zelenskyy said influential states were involved in efforts to rescue hundreds of wounded fighters there. Who exactly is helping? What does that mean? Is that on the ground help? Is that just diplomatic? AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, we know that U.N. Secretary General has been in- in direct contact with our president, but also with others. There are a lot of diplomatic discussions with other states on that. So I think, you know, after the war, we will be able to talk about all the efforts that were- that were done-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Israel, for example. AMB. MARKAROVA: --But on the ground, it's you know, it's our brave Ukrainians. And while evacuating civilians, we have to know that so many of our soldiers from Azov steel, from this plant who were trying- helping civilians to get out have been killed and wounded during these attempts too. MARGARET BRENNAN: How significant is the intelligence sharing that the West is providing to Ukraine? We hear a lot about the weapons, but what about the actual sharing of information? AMB. MARKAROVA: I think, you know, the sharing of information between Ukraine and the West with all of our friends and allies is at the level which we never had before. And we really appreciate it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, thank you for your time today. AMB. MARKAROVA: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. So stay with us.",

            "article_content": "Andy Parker, the father of a journalist who was killed during a live TV report in 2015, is running for Congress in south-central Virginia. Parker is a Democrat running in Virginia's 5th district against Republican freshman Congressman Bob Good, who he called the \"Marjorie Taylor Greene of Virginia.\" \"This district is not being represented the way it should be,\" Parker told CBS News before his launch. \"Since Alison was killed, I've always tried to honor her life through action. Given the atmosphere we face right now, this is the time to jump in and make a difference.\" Parker's daughter Alison was a TV reporter at CBS Roanoke affiliate WDBJ-TV who was shot and killed, alongside cameraman Adam Ward, by an ex-coworker in 2015.\u00a0 Parker, a former member of the Henry County Board of Supervisors, has been an advocate for gun rights reform since his daughter's killing. But after failing to get Facebook and other social media to take down video of his daughter's killing, he has been vocal about reforming Section 230, a law that protects social media companies from lawsuits over content on their platforms.\u00a0 He said he has reached his limit as a private citizen to push for social media reform, and saw an opportunity to \"champion this as a member of Congress.\" Parker previously testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the issue, and notes attempts that push reforms in the right direction, but said \"it doesn't go far enough.\" \"It's tough for anybody, for one out of four hundred plus members to do anything. But I think I've got a better chance at pushing that issue,\" he said, adding that it's an issue that has bipartisan support in Congress.\u00a0 He added that Good has helped the spread of misinformation allowed on social media.,Since being elected to Congress in 2020, Good has established himself as a hard-line House Republican. He voted against the electoral certification on January 6 and bipartisan infrastructure bill, and has spread misinformation about mask and vaccine mandates. \u00a0 Good launched his reelection campaign on January 3, and held a fundraiser on the one-year anniversary of the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol that featured state Senator Amanda Chase, a former Republican gubernatorial candidate who has been called \"Trump in heels.\" In a statement, Good says he's done \"what I said I would do when first running for Congress in 2020, and have been on the front line fighting for our nation's founding principles and against the Democrats' radical leftist agenda.\"\u00a0 He added that he's introduced bills against the \"unconstitutional mandates, open borders, runaway federal spending and efforts to indoctrinate our kids at school against the will of parents.\" \"When he's not wasting time to try and overturn lawful elections and opposing repairs for roads and bridges, he busies himself pushing dangerous vaccine conspiracy theories and divisive and extreme politics,\" Parker said, adding that Good's rhetoric and votes in Congress was \"one giant\" reason to do this.\u00a0 In 2020, Good upset incumbent Republican Denver Riggleman in a controversial \"drive-thru\" convention. In November 2020, Good won by 5 points over Democrat Cameron Webb. Virginia's 5th district had minor changes during the redistricting process, but still leans towards Republicans by about 8 points.\u00a0 Good is facing a challenge from the right from veteran Dan Moy, as well as two other Democratic opponents: lawyer Jack Lewis Jr. Combs and small-business owner Joshua Thorneburg. Both Combs and Thorneburg have cash on hand balances of over $150,000, while Good has $313,734 cash on hand according to the last Federal Election Commission report.\u00a0 Parker, and other Democrats running in Republican-leaning seats like Virginia's 5th, are facing a political environment that favors Republicans. A CBS News poll earlier this month showed a 56% disapproval rating for President Biden. A total of 29 House Democrats have decided to retire or run for another office. A self-described \"Reagan Republican\" who voted Republican until 2008, Parker describes himself as a Democrat that'd work in a bipartisan manner with any \"reasonable Republicans\" and can build on Webb's single digit loss.\u00a0 \"I just feel there's a lot of buyer's remorse out there,\" he added.\u00a0 His campaign team includes a former media consultant for former President Obama's presidential campaigns and a campaign manager for Democrat John Kerry's unsuccessful 2004 presidential bid. Chris Hurst, the boyfriend of Parker's late daughter and former Virginia state representative, is also helping run the campaign. For Parker, Hurst's involvement is another way his daughter's death is connected to his campaign. He said he is \"absolutely prepared\" for her killing to be brought up on the campaign, either by him or opponents. \"Nothing that they can do or say compares to losing your child, to losing your hopes and dreams,\" he said. \"There's no candidate that I'm aware of running for Congress that has a running mate. Well, I do. And she's going to be with me every step of the way.\" Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "The mutilated bodies of six people were found on Thursday in a vehicle in southern Mexico, authorities said -- the latest gruesome discovery in a country riven by gang-related violence. Reuters, citing a statement from the attorney general's office of Guerrero, reported that the severed heads of six men were discovered on top of a Volkswagen abandoned on a busy boulevard in the town of Chilapa de Alvarez. According to local authorities, a warning sign strung from two trees was also found at the gruesome scene, Reuters reported. \"In Chilapa selling crystal, kidnapping, extortion and stealing are strictly prohibited. This will happen to anyone who messes around,\" the sign reads, according to a photo of the crime scene provided by the police to Reuters. \"Capital punishment is the sentence for all these crimes.\" Authorities said the corpses would be buried on Friday. Discoveries of mutilated bodies dumped in public or hung from bridges have increased in Mexico in recent years as criminal gangs seek to intimidate their rivals. In June 2021, two heads and other human remains were left at polling stations in the border city of Tijuana on election day. The violence in Guerrero has also included the\u00a0discovery of hidden graves\u00a0holding dozens of bodies and a camp where gunmen stored the severed heads of nine rivals in a cooler. Across the country, more than 340,000 people have been killed in a wave of bloodshed since the government deployed the army to fight drug cartels in 2006. On Sunday night, \u00a020 people were killed at a\u00a0venue used to host cockfights\u00a0in the town of Las Tinajas, Michoacan state in Mexico. An American mother was among the victims.\u00a0 Meanwhile, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador accused popular television shows of glamorizing the violent drug trade. Lopez Obrador on Thursday hit out at TV series on platforms such as Netflix, saying they presented a rose-colored version of the lifestyles of drug traffickers.\u00a0 The shows feature \"gangs of drug traffickers, with actors, men, beautiful women, property, the latest cars, jewelry, designer clothes, power,\" he told reporters. But they ignore \"the destruction in particular of young people. And we are talking about thousands of deaths. In the United States, it's a serious problem,\" he added, referring to victims of drug overdoses. Lopez Obrador took office in 2018 championing a \"hugs not bullets\" strategy to tackle violent crime at its roots by fighting poverty and inequality with social programs, rather than with the army. He has asked the U.S. to invest in regional economic development instead of sending helicopter gunships and other weapons to take on drug traffickers.",

And this week on Face the Nation, we will mark President Biden's first full year in office and see if he can rebound from a week of setbacks.\u00a0  2022 is not exactly off to a good start for the Biden administration. One news organization characterized last week as filled with miscues, missteps and miscalculations. Inflation continues at a 40-year high. The Supreme Court blocked Mr. Biden's vaccine mandate for businesses. And his attempt at pushing fellow Democrat Senators Manchin and Sinema to support rules changes to pass the voting rights bill is all but certain to fail.\u00a0  (Begin VT)\u00a0  SENATOR KYRSTEN SINEMA (D-Arizona): And while I continue to support these bills, I will not support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division infecting our country.\u00a0  (End VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: The president even concedes his effort is likely doomed.\u00a0  (Begin VT)\u00a0  JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): The honest-to-God answer is, I don't know whether we can get this done.\u00a0  (End VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Given the enormous challenges facing Mr. Biden, is the fight a good use of precious political capital? We will ask Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine.\u00a0  Plus, a CBS News poll out this morning shows many Americans think Mr. Biden has misplaced priorities, and where they think he should focus.\u00a0  Then: As the threat of a Russian invasion into Ukraine intensifies, we will talk with White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. And, as Omicron's bullseye moves West, cases in the Northeast are peaking. But health care systems are still in crisis mode, and the warnings are getting more dire. \t  (Begin VT)\u00a0  DR. ANTHONY FAUCI (Chief Medical Adviser to President Biden): Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will ultimately find just about everybody.\u00a0  (End VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, and former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb will all be here. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\u00a0  Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Thursday will mark the first full year since President Biden took office, and a new CBS News poll shows Americans think he's not focused enough on key issues like the economy and inflation. Forty-four percent of Americans approve of the job he's doing overall, with a split on his handling of the coronavirus. When it comes to Mr. Biden's efforts on the economy just over a third, 38% approve. His handling of inflation is worse; 7 in 10 Americans disapprove. We turn now to CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto. Good morning to you, Anthony. What is weighing on the president's approval rating the most?  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, MARGARET, let's start with COVID, now part of this is just expectations at the start of his term; people thought COVID would get better, but right now most people don't think the effort against the pandemic is going well. Part of a president's ratings always carry some of that general feeling. You look back at the start of his term, he got very strong approval ratings for handling the pandemic that carried into the summer; a two-thirds approval. That started to dip a little bit as cases got a little bit worse, some vaccine controversies, down to where it is now. Now, let's be clear, it's not that people blame a president for all of this. When you look at why people might think he's not doing a good job, the thing that stands out is information, people feel it's been confusing \u2013 that stands out. In fact, overall, people in the nation say that that guidance has been increasingly confusing and that does accrue to a president. We know that the science is always trying to get a hold on this. But in the public mind, they do look for that clarity, MARGARET.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when it comes to the issues that we say matter here, the economy and inflation, what exactly is hurting the president?  SALVANTO: Yeah, the economy story, the inflation story are stories about focus, and here's how you start with a majority of people saying that the administration is not focused enough on the economy, on inflation, and these are their most important issues. Sometimes politics is really simple. You've got to be seen attacking the problems that people think are paramount. Now, when you look at how that plays out in his ratings on the economy, well, what's the blame for it? It's a mixture of things. Again, some of it, yes, people blame his policies. There's also the pandemic. There are supply chain issues that people see in the mix. But when they don't think he's focused, they're more likely to disapprove overall. And then that goes to a broader sense of emotions about his first year. We see a lot of folks describing that as making them feel frustrated or disappointed. He's got to be seen looking at those problems that people think are paramount and that is inflation, MARGARET.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this is the lowest point in his presidency when it comes to approval of how he's handling COVID, not approval of the economy and how he's handling inflation. Do people just think he's wasting his time here?  SALVANTO: Well, let's take a look, because we asked people, well, if you don't approve of the president, what might change your mind? And what really stood out is if he gets inflation down, people say they might improve their opinion, and that's a lot higher, I should add, then if he passes the Build Back Better Act. It's really about inflation, not legislation at this point. In fact, even for Democrats, even within his own party, when they rate him on the issues, they're toughest on him about being focused on inflation, MARGARET.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The things that people actually experience. I know, Anthony, you've been tracking this for some time. It was back in the summer with the withdrawal from Afghanistan that we saw the president's approval rating really begin to decline. Has there been any recovery along the way? Is that still an overhang?  SALVANTO: That's correct. He started out strong when it declined in the summer, right around Afghanistan, other characteristics of him took a hit too. He got declines in ratings on effectiveness, on competence that have not recovered, those things have continued to be lower. And as it's gone down, that's been correlated with these views that he's not paying enough attention to inflation and to the economy. Now, when you look at this in context, presidents in their first year, he is a little higher than Trump was, lower than Obama was. But you want to look at the era, because of late the last 10, 20 years or so. We've seen more polarization. We've seen more- more partisanship that tends to put both a ceiling and a floor on presidents because the other party won't give them any credit. And their own party tends to bolster their approval. But I would add this about Joe Biden, he still gets positive marks for people liking him personally, that's something that's carried through even since the presidential campaign. That helps underpin him as well. It's just about whether he's seen focusing on things like the economy and inflation right now. MARGARET.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you so much for your perspective. \u00a0We go now to Sen Tim Kaine. He joins us from Richmond. Good morning to you, senator.\u00a0  SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): Good morning, MARGARET. So, you just heard that CBS poll, which shows 65% of the country, doesn't think the president is focused enough on inflation, which is that a 40 year high of 7%. Why do you think the White House appears so out of touch with the public?  SEN. KAINE: Well, look, I think it's a tough time right now, and MARGARET, as you know, the White House's focus, significant energy on the economy in the first year, record job growth in the first year of the White House, 3.9% unemployment rate and very strong growth in wages. But the inflation issue is real, we've got to tackle it. Some of the inflation is- is related to the continuing pandemic, which has disrupted supply chains. But President Biden and Congress are also working on initiatives in the Build Back Better legislation that will reduce cost health care, prescription drugs, education. People hear the title of the bill, and they don't know what it might do for them. But if we can get it passed, some of it deals with cost drivers that bedevil most families and we can show them we're paying attention.  MARGARET BRENNNA: Even the White House economist is using the past tense when referring to Build Back Better. It's dead. You don't have the votes in the Senate.\u00a0  SEN. KAINE: Yeah, I don't agree with you, MARGARET, you're right that it's dead, the- the most recent version of it is not going to happen, but if you look at the core of the bill, I think the core is education and workforce and things like reduced child care and education expenses, workforce training and then support for the workforce in areas like health care. There are other pieces of the bill that are more controversial. I still believe we're going to find a core of this bill, whatever we call it, we're going to find the core of the bill and pass it, and it will deal directly with some of these inflation concerns.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Democratic strategist James Carville was on another network this morning, and he said Democrats whine too much. He said- you're not talking- he said you're not talking enough about the infrastructure bill you just passed. You're talking about things that have failed, and you have a vote scheduled this week that will also fail on voting rights. Why do you think that is an effective strategy to have high profile failures rather than talk about the things that people are saying do matter to them on the economy and inflation?  SEN. KAINE: Well, MARGARET, I do think we- we are talking a lot about the infrastructure bill. Certainly, I am, in Virginia and whether it's broadband road, rail, bridges, ports, airports, electricity grid, it's going to mean a lot of good for every zip code in the country. With respect to voting rights, look, whatever the pundits say, you know, makes political sense. It is- it is such an existential issue. Those of us who survived the attack on the Capitol Jan. 6 and are witnessing wholesale efforts around the country to make it harder for people to vote and to undermine the integrity of elections, we have to do this. We all have to be recorded at this moment in time about where are we in protecting the right to vote. Right now, it doesn't look like it has the votes to pass, but we're going to cancel our Martin Luther King Day recess and be there this week because we think it's so important for the country. And we will be voting, both on the bills, but also on if we can't get Republican support for the bills- we have uniform Democratic support, could we find a path to make some rules, adjustments to pass them.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you don't have the votes to suspend that 60-vote threshold. So, what- what kind of mechanism are you envisioning here that is somehow going to get this through?  SEN. KAINE: As of right now, MARGARET, we don't have all 50 Democrats on board with rules changes, but there are a couple of different paths. Some involve rules changes like a carve out to the filibuster. But there's other paths that we could take where we just- the 60-vote threshold is only if you want to limit debate, we could do longer debate and then in the debate and have a simple majority. But we will have a vote on the bills, and we will have a vote on a rules path to get there because it's so important for the country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The- the president, as you know, gave this very high-profile speech this week- this past week in Georgia. He's called the local law there \"Jim Crow 2.0.\" In that speech that he gave, he- he compared his opponents to Bull Connor, Jefferson Davis, which Republican leader Mitch McConnell said was akin to saying, \"agree with me or you are a bigot.\" How does characterizing opponents like that actually win over any kind of Republican support? Isn't the president hobbling himself?  SEN. KAINE: You know, MARGARET, I read those comments differently. Joe Biden was tough in his words, but I think what he said is in the 1960s, say the Voting Rights Act of 1965, people, including people of goodwill, had to decide were they going to stand on the side of Bull Connor or stand on the side of John Lewis. It was the same point that Martin Luther King made in his famous letter from the Birmingham Jail and said, I'm writing to people of goodwill. You may not be bigots and you may not be pro discrimination, but this is a moment in time where you have to decide which side, you're going to stand with in these efforts to hobble minority votes and put up stunts and schemes and people's way, all people of goodwill have to decide where they're going to stand.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you disagree with Sen. Dick Durbin, who said the president may have gone too far there. I mean, is there any outreach to Republicans here who have- some have signaled some willingness on the Electoral Count Act or other measures?  SEN. KAINE: MARGARET, I've been engaged in outreach to Republicans on voting rights since July and have found zero support with the exception of Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who was a co-sponsor of the John Lewis bill. We can get no co-sponsors despite repeated efforts when we put the bill up on the floor to proceed to it, they vote against even debating the bill, knowing that they could block its passage. They don't even want to talk about it. So, I thank Sen. Murkowski for being a supporter of restoring the preclearance provisions in the John Lewis bill, but thus far she's been the only one who has been willing to put her name to support for any of these provisions.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, you were with us back in Nov. when a Republican won the governorship in your home state. You blame that Democratic loss on congressional Democrats, who you said, \"just blew the timing of infrastructure, workforce and education. Congressional Democrats have majorities in both houses, and the American public expects us to deliver.\" Clock is ticking here ahead of those midterm races. What do Democrats need to deliver on in order to hold on to any kind of majority?  SEN. KAINE: You're right, MARGARET, I think we could have won that race had we done infrastructure a month earlier. Now we have delivered on the far-reaching American Rescue Plan. We have delivered on a once in a generation infrastructure investment, although a month too late, I think we have to go into that Build Back Better bill and do the core provisions that reduce costs for Americans in these key areas. If we do that will speak to their inflation concern, we will help people out in every zip code in this country; I think we've got to do that. And it is my hope that we will find a path, although the Vegas odds may not be great. We need to find a path to protect democracy from an assault that is being led by President Trump and his followers all over this country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time this morning.\u00a0  SEN. KAINE: Absolutely.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute with national security adviser Jake Sullivan.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Good morning to you, Jake. I want to start by asking you about what happened overnight in Texas with this synagogue and the hostage situation there. I know a British man who took the hostages is now dead, the others were released. Any indication that this is part of any kind of broader extremist threat?  WH NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, MARGARET, it's too soon to tell at this point what the full parameters of this act of terrorism, this act of anti-Semitism were. We have the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and law enforcement and intelligence agencies working intensively to get a full picture of what this person's motives were and whether or not there are any further connections. So, I will leave it to the professionals to continue the work today, and as we have more information, we will share it. But I do think we should all take a moment today to pay tribute to the local, state and federal law enforcement officers who acted bravely, professionally and effectively to rescue those hostages and bring the situation to a safe conclusion. They are heroes and they deserve our support, and we then all should also raise our vigilance against acts of terrorism, acts of antisemitism, particularly at synagogues and places of worship in this country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted. Thank you, Jake. I want to ask you about what I believe is eating up a lot of your time right now, and this is this active threat from Russia. Microsoft last night said they discovered all sorts of highly destructive malware in computer networks in Ukraine. Ukraine was hit by a cyberattack earlier in the week as well. Is Russia using this to prepare the battlefield and will a cyber-strike draw U.S. sanctions?  SULLIVAN: We've been warning for weeks and months, both publicly and privately, that cyber-attacks could be part of a broad-based Russian effort to escalate in Ukraine. We've been working closely with Ukrainians to harden their defenses and we will continue to do so in the days ahead. We're also coordinating with the private sector companies like Microsoft, both in Ukraine and here in the United States, in case there are potential cyber-attacks that unfold in the coming months here. Of course, it's possible that Russia could- could conduct a series of cyber-attacks. That's part of their playbook. They've done it in the past in other contexts. We have not specifically attributed this attack yet. Neither we nor some of the key private sector firms have attributed it. But we're working hard on attribution, and we will do everything we can to defend and protect networks against the type of destructive malware that Microsoft flagged in their blog post last night.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Ukrainians are saying it looks like it has some Russian fingerprints on it. Why wouldn't this draw US sanctions? Why are you waiting for Vladimir Putin to go further and actually cross the border? Aren't we already in the middle of a conflict?  SULLIVAN: Well, first, MARGARET, as I said before, we need to work through attribution, and again, as I said, this is part of the Russian playbook, so it would not surprise me one bit if it ends up being attributed to Russia. But let's do first things first, let's get attribution and then make a determination about what we do next. In terms of sanctions, what we have laid out is a very clear message to the Russians, and we've done so in concert and in unison with our allies that if they do further invade Ukraine, there will be severe economic consequences and a price to pay. And yes, of course, if it turns out that Russia is pummeling Ukraine with cyberattacks, and if that continues over the period ahead, we will work with our allies on the appropriate response.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia has been moving, tanks have been moving military equipment, their top diplomat said Friday, \"their patience is running out, diplomacy is not working.\" Are- are you planning to get President Putin, President Biden and President Zelensky of Ukraine all on the phone together, like the Ukrainians are asking?  SULLIVAN: Well, we're in close touch with our allies and partners, including the Ukrainians. I speak to my counterpart in Ukraine, the national security adviser, regularly. We've spoken seven times just in the past month, so we're coordinating closely our next steps. And we'll have more to share in terms of the next steps into diplomacy early next week. But the key point here, MARGARET, is that we're ready either way, if Russia wants to move forward with diplomacy. We are absolutely ready to do that in lockstep with our allies and partners. If Russia wants to go down the path of invasion and escalation, we're ready for that too, with a robust response that will cut off their strategic position. So, from our perspective, we are pursuing simultaneously deterrence and diplomacy, and we've been clear and steadfast in that again, fully united with the transatlantic community.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia's been pretty clear in just charging ahead with this. Mike Morrell, who I know, you know, the former acting director of the CIA, said this comes down to a matter of American credibility, which will be lost if Vladimir Putin defies President Biden when- when the White House has set out these clear lines, that's what is- what is at stake here, Jake. I mean, we've been talking about the president's approval ratings being on the decline since that chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. This is a risk not just to foreign policy, but to the president's ability to set bright lines for adversaries.  SULLIVAN: Look, I'll leave the political analysis to you and others. Here's what I'm focused on. Will the United States and NATO and our allies emerge from this- whatever happens in a stronger strategic position, and will Russia emerge in a weaker strategic position? That's the test. And that test doesn't get passed tomorrow or the next day or the day after that test gets passed over weeks and months and years. And if Russia does move, we will take measures that go at their economy that go at their strategic position in Europe that strengthen the solidarity of NATO. And what we just saw this past week in Brussels at the NATO headquarters was 30 allies speaking as one after years under the previous administration, where NATO was fractured and beginning to- to lose focus. So, we actually believe that we have made strides in shoring up and strengthening our alliances and in putting the United States in a position whatever happens here to defend our interests, defend our friends and support the Ukrainian people as we have been doing.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake quickly on Iran. The Secretary of State says we are very, very, very short on time. Iran is getting very close here to the ability to produce a weapon. Are they just playing for time?  SULLIVAN: Well, I would say two things on this front. Number one, our policy is straightforward, we are determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Number two, we believe that diplomacy is the best way to do that. But as you said and as the secretary of state has said, time is running short, and I was in Israel at the end of last month\u2013  MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Yeah.--  SULLIVAN \u2013coordinating on the possibility that diplomacy does not proceed.  MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Yeah.--  SULLIVAN: We are working closely with our European allies and partners on this as well, and we will find a way forward. But MARGARET,--  MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 OK.--  SULLIVAN: \u2013 a critical point here\u2013  MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake I have to wrap you right now, I'm sorry.\u00a0  SULLIVAN: The reason we are in the situation we're in right now is because the previous administration pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, and we were paying the wages of that catastrophic mistake.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Jake Sullivan, thank you. Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We turn now to Covid-19, where the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths are still rising. On the economic front, inflation is also climbing. Here's Mark Strassmann.\u00a0  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0  MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): Confirming America's case of omicron jitters has no test and needs none. We're undeniably anxious.\u00a0  WOMAN: This is not a game. It's for real.\u00a0  MARK STRASSMANN: And with good reason.  WOMAN: We are in the midst of another Covid-19 tsunami.\u00a0  MARK STRASSMANN: Omicron has exploded Covid nationally like never before, with new cases rising in 46 states. America's averaging more than 750,000 new cases a day, a record. More than 20,000 daily hospitalizations, up 25 percent, and almost 2,000 daily deaths, up 37 percent.\u00a0  MARK STRASSMANN (on camera): Here in Boston, new cases have almost doubled in Massachusetts over the last two weeks. Hospitalizations have almost doubled. And omicron's siege goes on. Local health experts expect those numbers to keep soaring for the rest of January.\u00a0  MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): In short supply, hospital staff, hospital beds. Pennsylvania is one of 49 states where service members reinforce the front lines of the Covid response. Also scarce, home tests. Starting Wednesday at covidtests.com, you can register with the federal government for free rapid tests. A limit of four per household. \t  But America's supply chain issues include high-quality masks in high demand.\u00a0  WOMAN: I feel safer in these than I do around people with the regular masks.\u00a0  MARK STRASSMANN: She should. After months of dithering by the CDC, the agency now concedes that masks like N95s, KN95s, and surgical once protect better than cloth masks.\u00a0  DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, DIRECTOR, CDC: The CDC continues to recommend that any mask is better than no mask.\u00a0  MARK STRASSMANN: But while Covid's endless dynamics have fractured America, everyone agrees the economy needs help. A 7 percent rate of inflation, the highest in nearly 40 years, from gas to groceries.\u00a0  WOMAN: Prices are off the charts, off the charts, for a middle class family to eat.\u00a0  WOMAN: As you can see, the shelves are empty.\u00a0  MARK STRASSMANN: And continuing supply chain issues. Pharmacies really should have aspirin.\u00a0  WOMAN: And there's only three bottles on the shelf, and thank goodness I could get one bottle.\u00a0  MARK STRASSMANN: If there's good news, it's this, in certain cities like New York and Washington, D.C., the early hotspots, omicron's breathtaking spread seems to be flattening.\u00a0  (END VIDEOTAPE)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who joins us from Annapolis. Good morning to you, governor.  MARYLAND GOV. LARRY HOGAN: Good morning.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Eighty percent of hospital beds are occupied in your state, Omicron is really hitting hard. There are comparisons right now to where we were in 2020. Have you seen a real change in the ability of the federal government to respond to states like yours?  GOV. HOGAN: Well, so we have been impacted really hard over the past couple of weeks, and we reached a higher point than we ever did during the rest of the nearly two years of this crisis. We've got a little bit of positive news and- in that it's not quite a trend, but over the past four or five days, we've seen fairly dramatic decreases in both hospitalizations, positivity rate and case rate. And so it's hopeful, and we're- we're going to keep an eye on that over the next 10 days to see if we continue. But we're still in a pretty tough spot, and that's why I declared a state of emergency. We- we did a lot of things to try to help increase the capacity of our hospital systems. Sent in a thousand members of the National Guard. And you know, we're taking a lot of actions directly and we're- we're trying to get as much help as we can from the federal government. But, you know, quite frankly, they're fallen short in a couple of ways.  MARGARET BRENNAN: How- what do you need?  GOV. LARRY HOGAN: Well, we've been pushing for quite some time, you know, the president announced nearly a month ago before Christmas that he was going to distribute these half a billion rapid test out across the country. And so far we haven't seen any. We were acquiring our own, you know, the states have been on the front lines throughout this crisis. And now it appears as if, rather than producing more of these rapid tests, the federal government is just purchasing the ones that we had already contracted for. You know, so now we're sort of hijacking the tests that we already had plans for, and we're now getting some of those providers to tell us they no longer have the mat-Masks- the rapid tests. On masks, you know, I announced last week that we were- we were delivering free of charge 20 million N95 and can KN95 masks across the state. And I think the federal government is following behind trying to do the same thing in other places.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. The president is expected to announce something in detail this week on that front.  GOV. HOGAN: I hope so.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And I understand- I understand the CDC just changed their guidance or adapted their guidance on Friday regarding masks. But other states were out there, like Connecticut distributing and N95s earlier. Why did you wait until this point?  GOV. HOGAN: Well, we've been distributing them throughout the crisis. I mean, from the beginning, but the 20 million is a pretty huge number. So we've had unlimited mass for the schools, for, you know, more than a year already. We've got them out of health departments and hospitals. But now we're- we're having even bigger reach because we realize that these masks are much more protective and that we've got a much more contagious variant that's spreading not only across our state but across the country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. In nearby West Virginia, their governor, also Republican Jim Justice, has asked the CDC to authorize a fourth booster for the most vulnerable in his state. Are you going to do the same? Are you interested in that?  GOV. HOGAN: Well, five or six months ago, we did move forward on the third booster ahead of the federal government because we- we had done our own antibody study in our nursing homes, which were some of our most vulnerable patients that we were very concerned about. The CDC was taking their time, and so we were now doing another very similar antibody study in our nursing homes to see if we should move forward with a four fourth dose, at least for our most vulnerable patients that are at risk.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're working on that. When it comes to\u2013  GOV. HOGAN: Yes.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: What's happening in schools right now, and I understand that this is district by district and the decisions are different, but Prince George's County, as you know a District of Columbia suburb, went virtual right around Christmas. They're going back to school in person this coming week. You will pose that. You wanted kids in person.  GOV. HOGAN: I don't oppose them going back to school.  MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but you oppose them going virtual and in other- other parts of the state where they did go back in person, you had some lower attendance rates because people were sick. So why not allow for a little bit of flexibility there? Is there a time when virtual remote school actually is the best choice?  GOV. HOGAN: Well, there is flexibility with local school systems, but what we ought to do and what the state policy actually is, if there's an outbreak in a particular classroom or a particular school, then they have certain protocols that they, you know, they should take, but shutting down entire school systems to punish a million kids. Look, we have- we currently have 34 people in the hospital\u2013\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well they went remote\u2013  GOV. HOGAN: 30 of them are children, 30 of them are children, and half of them are in for another reason in the hospital. We're now filling our pediatric empty pediatric beds with adults because children have not been that big of a problem. Our school systems have not been overrun. And you know, we started vaccinating teachers more than a year ago as a priority. That was what they asked for. We provided the masks. We provided hundreds of millions of dollars for filtration systems to try to keep our kids safe. And you know, I understand people being concerned about kids. We all are. But we missed a year of learning in some cases, and it's absolutely not the way to go to keep the entire school system shut down.  MARGARET BRENNAN: understood, but remote is somewhere in between. But I want to ask you about some politics here because as you know, there's been a lot of talk among some high level Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader who's trying to recruit you to run for Senate. You said you don't have a burning desire to serve in the Senate. You got a February 22nd filing deadline. If you don't want to tell me you're running or not today, can you at least tell me if a Republican can win a statewide federal election in Maryland?  GOV. HOGAN: Well, most Republicans couldn't, but both The Washington Post and the Senate leadership did two polls showing me beating Chris Van Hollen by 12 points, so I think it is possible it's the same- same- same number that I was reelected by in 2018 against Ben Jealous as governor. But look what I said, I've been saying all along. It's not something I aspire to, but I also have said that I-I care very much about the-the country and where we are and the divisive rhetoric that the divisiveness and dysfunction in Washington. And so, you know, people are calling on my kind of more patriotic duty to say, even if it's not the job that you want, maybe we need you to run anyway. And so that's where we are. I've never expressed an interest in it, and I still haven't taken any steps in that direction.  MARGARET BRENNAN: February 22nd Are you going to run or are you going to file?  GOV. HOGAN: February 22nd is like a month away, and right now we're just focused on the day job as governor and focused on this Omicron crisis and our legislative session, and that's where my focus is going to stay.  MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, well, we will stay on top of you and then we'll start asking you if you're going to run in 2024, which you've been asked and said, you won't comment on either. Governor, thank you very much for your time today and good luck with the hospitalizations. We'll be right back with the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, Quinton Lucas. He joins us from our CBS affiliate KCTV. Good morning to you, Mr. Mayor.\u00a0  MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS (D), KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI: Good morning.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Omicron is surging. Hospitalizations in your city up 25 percent in the last week. Are hospitals having to postponed surgeries? Are they at risk of being overwhelmed?\u00a0  QUINTON LUCAS: They are overwhelmed right now in Kansas City. Really since the Christmas season, we have seen incredible challenges in our health care network. Even getting employees that are working in our EMS services, fire department and in public safety. It is a substantial concern. It's why we have brought back a number of different requirements, including a mask requirement in our schools, to a great level of controversy, to make sure that governments can continue to function, schools can stay open, our hospitals can stay open, and we're doing all we can from a local government level to respond to our choices.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said you'd consider a citywide mask mandate if deaths and hospitalizations reached a certain point. Do you have a threshold there? What's holding you back?\u00a0  QUINTON LUCAS: Right now what's holding us back is, in some ways, the political challenge that we receive from the state of Missouri. There have been numerous lawsuits filed by the attorney general of Missouri, who is running for United States Senate, a Republican, who has sought mask \tmandates and called them things that are challenges to freedom. He's called them challenges in tyranny, those sorts of things, that we face every time we issue a new mask requirement. The Missouri state treasurer has gotten into the act. But what we're really trying to focus on is more vaccination. What we're seeing is even though omicron is spreading, 80 to 90 percent of people that are in our ICUs are those that have not been vaccinated. We're facing challenges because there is a substantial amount of misinformation out in the public about if vaccination is important, if it's good, if it's free, what it does to you. So we're really fighting, I think, a battle on two different fronts. One is from my political right, and those that are trying to say that this just isn't that big of a deal, and then always trying to fight the information side to make sure that we get people vaccinated and safe.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But to that point, we have new CBS polling out today that really faults the administration itself for confusing messaging around Covid. The president's approval rating for his handling is at the lowest point. Two-thirds of those polled cited confusion about Covid information and guidance. Is the federal government response here two confusing? Is it too slow?\u00a0  QUINTON LUCAS: You know, I think that those polls reflect a moment of frustration in America, certainly frustration in Kansas City. Time and again, and everybody in America knows this, every few months we thought that this would be over. I think what we recognize is now that Covid will be with us for some time, that we may continue to see new variants. But I do think that there is a role, not just for the federal government, but for state governments, to actually be helpful, right? We have seen in a number of different states, mine included at times, where there has not been the level of assistance, when we're looking for that intermediate step, who can actually deliver that testing to us in the cities, small towns as well? Who can actually make sure that schools stay open? I don't think that those are federal concerns and those aren't at the feet of the president. I think much of that is, how can our entire government system, from local government up to the federal side, make sure that we're responding in an active way. I just think the president's face is on any number of things, and so he'll continued to be blamed. But, look, what I want in Kansas City are more nurses, more hospital workers, more staff, and more tests. I don't care where they come from. Whether they come from our state capitals, whether they come from federal government, I think that's what the people of America want on the ground.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned one of the people who is challenging your mandates is someone running for Senate in your state. I want to ask you, I know you're running for re-election as mayor, but you are rumored to also \tbe considering a Senate run. What are national Democrats missing on the ground in states like yours? Do you think a Democrat could actually win a statewide federal election in Missouri?\u00a0  QUINTON LUCAS: I absolutely think a Democrat could win a statewide election in Missouri. I think, first of all, because what you see right now is that we're trying to respond to a crisis of the moment. We're trying to make sure we're answering Covid issues, trying to make sure that people are getting back into jobs, and talking about things that are responsible and reasonable. Not looking back over the last four years, not trying to push what I think is false information, whether it be related to Covid or whether it be related to the economy or anything under the sun. I do think, of course, there's a communication challenge that we face. The Democratic Party is a very big tent. And I do certainly think that more national voices that are saying, look, Democrats are doing things that make basic sense now, trying to address supply chain issues, trying to make sure people have Covid testing, and fundamentally making sure that we're looking out for the people of Kansas City in America. You know, a few weeks back my family came down with Covid and then the toughest part, I have a nine-month-old baby, with seeing him sick. I don't think that there's any American who wants to see that harm to their young children, to their babies, to their families. That's what I see a lot of mayors looking to, Democrats, moderate Republicans, and others, and that's why I think the public would be receptive to messages from folks that are on the political left.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You'd have to file by the end of March. Are you going to run?\u00a0  QUINTON LUCAS: I -- I have already said that I'll be running for mayor of Kansas City again.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0  QUINTON LUCAS: I'm excited to be mayor.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Mayor, thank you for your time. Good luck with the surge. We'll be right back.\u00a0  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to check in now with former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who also serves on the board of Pfizer. Good morning to you, Dr..\u00a0  DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Good morning.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: The acting FDA commissioner told Congress most people are going to get COVID, Dr. Fauci said most people will be exposed to it at some point. I mean, these statements make people at home go, what am I doing here? Why am I trying to protect myself? At this point, what can you do?  DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think the reality is most people are going to get COVID in their lifetime, I don't think most people need to get COVID within the next month and anything we can do to try to protect ourselves to extent that there are people who haven't been exposed to this virus yet, who've gone out and gotten vaccinated, been able to protect themselves. You know, if they can keep themselves protected for the next several weeks, we will probably be through this Omicron wave. And then we'll have to deal with this probably next fall when we have better tools available to us. I would much rather have my reckoning with COVID after I've been vaccinated a number of times after there are orally available drugs widely accessible to treat this infection. After there's monoclonal antibodies, widely accessible to treat it. After diagnostic testing is stockpiled in my house and those- those realities will be truth come this fall, certainly come this summer, so I think people will be in a much better position to grapple with this next fall. I think we should remain vigilant for the next several weeks, try to avoid this infection if you can.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So hold strong for the next few weeks. Pfizer CEO,\u00a0 I know you served on the board of the company, said a vaccine that targets Omicron could be ready in March. Does that mean everyone needs to start planning to go out and get another dose?  DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, I think the reality is that this is going to become an annual vaccination, at least for a period of time. We don't know what the epidemiology of this infection is going to be over the long run, but certainly over the next couple of years, you can envision boosters becoming an annual affair, at least for some portion of the population; people who are more vulnerable. It could be the case that if we have an Omicron on specific vaccine or Delta specific vaccine, it is still unclear what the most prevalent strain of this infection is going to be on the back end of this Omicron wave. I think most people presume it will be Omicron, but if you can fashion a vaccine that's specific to the variant that's circulating. You probably have the potential to restore a lot of the original promise of the vaccine. And by that, I mean the ability to actually prevent transmission to reduce infection. Right now, the vaccines are very effective at preventing serious disease and preventing hospitalization. They are also preventing symptomatic illness. But the prevention of transmission has been dramatically reduced in a setting of Omicron. If you could fashion a vaccine that is specific to Omicron, you can restore the ability of the vaccine potentially to prevent transmission, and it once- once again becomes a public health tool for actually controlling spread.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard Governor Hogan, a Republican, say the federal government is falling short on its response right now. Our polling has shown even confusion among Democrats, I mean this isn't necessarily a partisan issue on frustration with pandemic response. That gets laid at the foot of the president, is that his fault? Is that the CDC falling short? Is that the FDA, where we still do not have a confirmed commissioner? Where does that blame actually lie?  DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think I think it lies in a lot of places, I think a lot of the confusion emanates from CDC and the mixed guidance that they've- they've issued. Look, the administration, I think, has done an admirable job with certain aspects of this response. They put a big emphasis on rolling out the vaccines. They've done a good job at that 85% of adults have received at least one dose of the vaccine. We have to think about the counterfactual: what if we didn't have that much vaccination as a country? What situation would we be facing right now? I think the administration made some mistakes at a macro level. The first was buying into this prevailing narrative when they took office that a lot of the problems, if not all the problems at CDC and from the federal public health agencies owed to the Trump's administration and their mishandling of those agencies. Now, notwithstanding what the Trump administration did, it didn't do to try to reform those agencies and interfere in their operations. The reality is those agencies had deep flaws and it made it hard to reform the agencies once you bought into that- that macro narrative. The- the second challenge I think that they bought for themselves was federalizing this in ways that they didn't have to, particularly with respect to the vaccine mandates. I think once the federal government, the Biden administration, stepped in and federalized aspects of this response, they owned it and created a perception that they alone could fix it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Governor Hogan said they were having a hard time at the state level, getting a hold of tests. According to the White House, those will start- they'll take orders starting in Jan, but HHS said you might not receive those tests for weeks afterward. Is the strategy here just to have Americans stockpile tests for the future because it's not coming in time for Omicron?  DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think that's what Americans ought to be doing and the administration steps to try to provide tests directly to consumers and try to provide payment for those tests is an important step in that direction. They've also in the last week extended the expiration dates in the popular BinaxNOW test and I expect they're going to extend the expiration dates on other tests so that it makes it more feasible to stockpile these tests. The reality is the tests are available. They're not cheap. But if you go to Amazon right now, you can buy 10 or more tests. I tested it before- before we got on this show this morning, so they are available. I think that they're difficult to get for bulk purchase, for purchases for municipalities and states, but consumers can get access to them. And now, with the federal government, you know, providing reimbursement, most consumers can reach into the market and buy these tests. Unfortunately, they weren't available when we had peak demand, and that was when Omicron hit up against Christmas break, when a lot of people went out, wanted access to tests and the store shelves had run out.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, failure to plan around the holiday in the largest gatherings of the year, but bigger strategy. You've said there should have been in Operation Warp Speed for drug treatments, not just the vaccine. Do you think the administration is over emphasizing vaccination and not talking about things like masks and ventilation?  DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, I think they've talked about masks, there's only so much the federal government can do to try to get consumers to wear masks, this really has to be done at the state and the local level. I think the administration should have earlier revised the guidance on the quality of the mask, recognizing that higher quality masks were going to be important against variants that spread primarily through airborne transmission, like the Delta variant, like the Omicron variant. There has been an emphasis on vaccines. I think that there could have been more emphasis on trying to get capacity in place over the summer for the production of not just the orally available drugs like the one manufactured by Pfizer. Pfizer put up a billion dollars to advance manufacture of that product, but also the monoclonal antibodies, especially the drugs that could be used as a prophylaxis and treatment.  MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, Dr. Gottlieb, always good to talk to you. We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.

Vickers and Morell discuss whether and how Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine may have been a gross strategic miscalculation, how and when the West might have deterred his moves, and what future scenarios for the conflict exist. They discuss Putin's options and decision-making and how his pariah status will affect developments domestically and globally.\u00a0 Highlights Russia's military performance to date:\u00a0\"He's really in a no-win situation. I mean, the Ukrainian Armed Forces and Territorial Defense Forces are way overperforming and Russia's forces are way underperforming. They haven't been able to take any major cities. Its forces have been repelled and pushed back in several places. They haven't even been able to achieve air superiority after four days of war. You know, in short, Ukrainian David is just kicking the crap out of the Russian Goliath.\" Has Putin changed?\u00a0\"He was always cold, calculating and ruthless. A KGB man through and through. And you know, a lot of these anti-West, anti-U.S. statements really started in 2007. Or even, some of them, like the collapse of the Soviet Union being the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century, I think dates back to 2005. But he's now more emotional, more erratic, more rambling, I think more reckless, perhaps from increasing self-isolation and confidence in himself. He's been ruling for 22 years and he's really gone for broke here, as we've talked about earlier. This looks like a major strategic blunder that the potential losses way outweigh the gains. And so, I think in that sense, he really is a different man now, and therefore potentially more dangerous.\"\u00a0 Could Putin be toppled?\u00a0\"He's really in a no-win position here in Ukraine. I just don't see how he achieves his objectives. And so he's got to find a way out. And you know, they're clever about saying anything they want for justification. So maybe he'll resort to that at this point. \u00a0I wouldn't rule out that he could be toppled. I know it's a long shot, but he really has put himself in a bind here. But you know, it could get ugly before it gets better. And I hope we have the stomach to see this through.\"\u00a0 Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - MIKE VICKERS\u00a0 PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS MICHAEL MORELL: Mike, welcome back to Intelligence Matters. It is great to have you on the show again. For those who don't remember Mike, he is a very special person, tons of experience in the intelligence community. Also tons of experience at the Department of Defense. Very close friend of mine. We closely together during both the Bush and Obama administrations. Mike, it's great to have you back. MIKE VICKERS: Thank you, Michael. It's pleasure to be with you. MICHAEL MORELL: I should also mention that we're taping this on Monday, the 28th of February. It's going to run on Tuesday, March 2nd as a podcast. I just want everybody to keep that in mind because what's going on in Ukraine is a very fast-moving event. So please just remember that as you're all listening. I should also say that that this is not going to be sort of a standard Intelligence Matters interview where I'm asking questions and Mike is answering them. We're going to actually try to turn this into a conversation, maybe the kind of conversation that we would have had in one of our offices when we were back in government, or the kind of conversation that we have today when we're having breakfast together. So we'll try to make this a conversation. So. Mike, I'd love to start by talking a little bit about where we are and then we'll go to how did we get here and where might we be going? But I really want to start with with the situation that Vladimir Putin finds himself in right now. And the question on my mind is: did he miscalculate? Nothing seems to be going right for him. Not the fight in Ukraine - most people thought, sure, the Ukrainians would put up a struggle, but he would quickly get to the capital. Nothing seems to be going right for him in terms of the international response. Most thought it would be more split, and it's, as you know, significantly unified. And certainly not the response that he hoped to get at home, right? We have people out in the streets protesting. So I'm just wondering how you think about that question of miscalculation. I'm beginning to think this might be one of the most significant miscalculations he's made as president. MIKE VICKERS: Not surprisingly, Michael, I agree with you. I think this is a major strategic blunder. And I think it stems from the fact that he's overconfident, that he always wins his wars. Second Chechnya war, Russo-Georgia war in 2008, annexation of Crimea and the seizure of the Donbass in 2014, his intervention in U.S. presidential elections in 2016 and 2020. And now this. But he really in a no-win situation. I mean, the Ukrainian Armed Forces and Territorial Defense Forces are way overperforming and Russia's forces are way underperforming. They haven't been able to take any major cities. Its forces have been repelled and pushed back in several places. They haven't even been able to achieve air superiority after four days of war. You know, in short, Ukrainian David is just kicking the crap out of the Russian Goliath. Now it's only four days in. The Ukrainian leadership and and people's grit and societal mobilizations is inspiring the world. You know, as you noted, Europe, and more and more the world, is mobilized in opposing Russia. The turnabout in Germany is particularly striking, supplying stingers and other weapons. Several countries, including small ones on Ukraine and Russia's borders, are providing weapons to the Ukrainian resistance. And then you mentioned his position at home. You know, the Central Bank sanctions are already biting. The ruble fell 20 percent today. And so while he's progressively turned Russia into a police state and killed or attempted to kill and jailed his opposition, he's increasingly vulnerable at home. MICHAEL MORELL: You know, I think you're right about history driving his calculation here and how easy he had things in other places militarily. But history may have been affecting how he was thinking about how the West would respond. Because before they didn't respond as a group, the EU didn't join sanctions in 2014. The US sanctions after Georgia, after the invasion in 2014 in Ukraine, after the 2016 election - they were essentially slaps on the wrist. So again, if history was guiding him, it's not turned out the way that it had turned out before. MIKE VICKERS: Yeah, exactly. I think that's right. That's certainly what he expected. I don't really see the theory of victory he had other than he thought he could really divide the West and conquer Ukraine easily.  But you know, I would add, he doesn't have enough force to achieve his objectives. If he keeps his forces in Ukraine, even if he were to nominally install a puppet government, Russia's casualties will increasingly mount as long as the U.S. and the West support the resistance. And if he withdraws, that public regime would be in mortal danger from day one. So he's in a real tough spot. MICHAEL MORELL: So Mike, you think he's at risk militarily in Ukraine, that he could get bogged down, that he could fail to meet his objectives? Is that your sense? It's certainly mine. MIKE VICKERS: Yes. Now he does have escalation options and a lot depends on what the West continues to do. MICHAEL MORELL: So how do we make it more likely that he fails militarily? MIKE VICKERS: Well, I think it's really important that he fail. Boris Johnson has said that, and I certainly agree with it. If we don't defeat him here, if he does prevail, he's likely to go on. Ukraine isn't his sole interest. He's likely to go on and and do other things. So the way we make it more likely is strong support of the resistance. Ukraine has a lot of things going for it that resistance movements would need: friendly border countries, 2,500 kilometers of border with NATO countries, external sponsor in the United States and others, favorable terrain, and most importantly, a society really mobilized for irregular warfare. So that's one way. And then really biting sanctions. We haven't put sanctions on the energy sector yet. They've been exempt. We haven't put full sanctions on SWIFT. They've been mostly symbolic. There's ways to really hurt the Russian economy and to undermine Putin's role at home through non-lethal covert measures. He's done it to us. We should certainly return the favor. My concern is if he escalates internally in Ukraine, if he levels cities like he did in Chechnya and Syria, indiscriminately kills civilians, employs chemical weapons, I hope we would get off our duffs and use air power to stop that carnage. You know, U.S. air power could certainly bring an end to this war much sooner than irregular warfare could, although irregular warfare will make its position increasingly untenable. MICHAEL MORELL: I wonder, Mike, why he's struggling so militarily, right? I mean, one is the will of the Ukrainians to fight, right, and will to fight is incredibly important - as we saw in Afghanistan, where there was not a will to fight. So there's the will to fight of the Ukrainians, who are very effective at what they're doing. But I'm wondering to what extent the Russians made mistakes militarily, number one, and number two, I'm wondering to what extent his own troops, Putin's own troops, don't have a will to fight here against their Ukrainian brothers, particularly killing women and children. MIKE VICKERS: Yeah, I think that last part is a big part of this. Russian troops seem to be surrendering even in fairly elite formations, 1st Tank Guards Army, for example, that's led part of the assault on Kyiv has really struggled. Even their special forces don't seem to be performing all that well. So I think the Russian military here was really overestimated in its capabilities. Taking cities is hard, but they haven't even done well on the outskirts. MICHAEL MORELL: So back to the question of is he at risk politically at home. My view is that this may be the first time that he has done something that significantly risks undermining his strength and perhaps even risks him losing his job. The oligarchs are paying significant costs here. His whole society is paying a significant cost. Women and children dying in Ukraine and being stuck in subways and struggling to get out of the country - that kind of thing doesn't sell well in Russia. And I'm just wondering how you think about the vulnerability that he faces politically at home? Could we see an end to Vladimir Putin's rule here if things continue to go badly for him? MIKE VICKERS: Yeah, I think it's not out of the question. I mean, he has this tacit alliance with China, and China may prop him up in some ways, although there seems to be some wavering there. But I think this is the most precarious position he's been in in his 22 years of rule by far. He had a good economy the first eight years, after that interregnum with Medvedev, for four years when he was prime minister, then he came back and he's been increasingly belligerent. It actually started in 2007 at a speech he gave in Munich that was vehemently anti-West. But he's had this string of victories. And they've built up reserves and he's clamped down on the opposition. But this changes things very dramatically. The tenuous position that Russia is in now globally, and then the costs at home, including the psychological costs of this brutality. MICHAEL MORELL: And back to something you said earlier. I'm wondering about the risk of escalation here. Will things not going right for him lead him to be more reckless? You talked about Chechnya-style activities in Ukraine. Any risk, Mike, that you think he might use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine? MIKE VICKERS: It's possible. I think he would flatten cities and then use chemical weapons and then potentially nuclear weapons. Then if he did use nuclear weapons, I think the first thing he'd do, likely, is a demonstration shot. Something we talked about a lot in the Cold War, to signal intent and try to get your opponent to back down, you know, fire off a weapon in some area without a population, over water or something to say, 'Look, I'm serious.' And so I think that would be their first move. But you know, the Russians consider tactical nuclear weapons as just another weapon to employ under the right circumstances. And their fundamental doctrine is to escalate to de-escalate. And he's got options; the internal ones I talked about in Ukraine. He could widen the war to a NATO frontline state, particularly the the Baltic countries. We tend to think of sanctions as almost this free lunch, something you could do if you don't want to use hard power and punish an adversary. It works against some adversaries, although it takes time. Putin's not likely to take that lying down. You know, if you do enough real damage to his economy, something like defeating him in war conventionally or other means, he would lash out to try to stop that and cyber is his most likely weapon to do that against the West and the U.S.; particularly maybe in the energy sector, financial sector is a harder target. But he also could cut transatlantic cables, and that would really have a bad effect on the global economy and do other things. So he seems desperate and he's reckless and he doesn't seem like the same guy he was five years ago. So there definitely is an escalation risk. MICHAEL MORELL: So Mike, you mentioned a few minutes ago that if he starts indiscriminate killing, the leveling of cities, use of chemical weapons, that the West should essentially join the fight from the air. I certainly see the logic in that. But I also see the risk for escalation of general war between Russia and NATO or Russia and the United States. How do you think about that risk? How do you think he would respond to, you know, F-35s over Ukraine shooting down his aircraft, bombing his troops on the ground? How do you think he'd react to that? MIKE VICKERS: Well, there certainly is a risk. But I think he'd also fear it in some way because we have superiority in those areas, and that would put him in an even bigger bind. Most of his available combat forces are tied up in Ukraine right now, and so he's bitten off more than he can chew already. And so, you know, if he succeeds there, then he could do other things. He might lash out with a strike or two against NATO countries, but an all-out invasion - they're invading Ukraine right now. So I think there's a bit less risk of that. I would add we had to deal with this problem in the Cold War. We were prepared to defend Europe against Soviet forces on the inner German border where there was the risk of escalation. If we're going to defend South Korea against a North Korean attack, there's a risk of escalation; North Korea has plenty of nuclear weapons. If we're going to defend Taiwan, China has nuclear weapons - so this is not a problem you can wish away, I think. And so Ukraine has to be put in that larger strategic context. You know, if we can win indirectly, that's great. I think it was a real mistake to take at least the possibility that we would use U.S. air power and build up forces to match Putin's buildup in Europe like we would have done in the Cold War before the conflict. I think we might have prevented this war had we done that.  We and the Russians and the Brits are all signatories to a thing called the Budapest Memorandum of 1994, where Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in return for assurances that its sovereignty and territorial integrity would be respected. And now it wasn't a collective defense treaty, but it should have some force and we haven't even mentioned it. MICHAEL MORELL: And it was a promise. It was an absolute promise. MIKE VICKERS: That was a promise. That's right. From a U.S. administration and I think that might have deterred Putin. There are lots of things that could have deterred Putin, had we done things, if we could wind the clock back to 2008. But we can't. MICHAEL MORELL: And what about, Mike, what about the risk of other ways we get to escalation between Russia and the United States or Russia and NATO? You know, I'm thinking of the foreign arms that are flowing into Ukraine now and the Russians tangling up with that, or in the Black Sea, right? I mean, there's numerous countries' ships in the Black Sea, the risk of an accident there. I guess that's another way we could get the escalation between Russia and NATO and Russia and the United States. MIKE VICKERS: Sure, absolutely. You know, when I was supporting the Afghan resistance in the 1980s, there was always concern that the Russians might - the Soviets might invade Pakistan. And so we supplied Pakistan with a lot of capabilities. They they did a number of cross-border raids and airstrikes and sabotage. They didn't have the forces then just like today to invade. But, you know, the threat was there. And as I said, this is war, whether we like it or not. If the sanctions really bite, he might escalate in response to that. We do irregular warfare, he might strike base areas, even if he doesn't fully invade NATO countries. As you know from our prior experience, there is always the threat that the Iranians might try to close the Strait of Hormuz in any crisis, and it would take us a while to clear it. And so there are any number of ways this could escalate. That's just part of great power war. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Mike, maybe we switch now a little bit to talk about. how did we get here? And I guess the first thing to talk about is what does Putin want? Why did he do this? How do you think about that? MIKE VICKERS: So, this is not about Ukraine possibly becoming a member of NATO way down the road. It's not about resolving the Donbass conflict, so-called Minsk-2 agreement or recognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea or, even more laughable, Ukraine posing a military or nuclear threat to Russia. The threat Ukraine posed to Russia is a democratic threat to Putin's authoritarian rule. And he's been very clear about this. One of the things I've learned from you over the years is, when dictators say something, you ought to listen to them; it's an important part of international relations. And he's been saying since 2007 that Ukraine is not a real country, that it should be incorporated back into a Russian empire along with Belarus, and he's become increasingly obsessed with denying the legitimacy of Ukrainian identity and sovereignty. It's almost a cult following they put in Putin's speeches about Ukraine illegitimacy in Russian military education and send these these these things to all their soldiers. So that's his main goal here, is to extinguish Ukrainian sovereignty. His broader goals are to reverse NATO's expansion, weaken and dissolve NATO and weaken the US. At a minimum he wants a sphere of influence over territory formerly controlled by the former Soviet Union. At a maximum, he wants to bring Europe more under Russian domination and reverse the U.S. victory in the Cold War and upend the world order. And the bottom line is if he wins in Ukraine, he is not going to stop there. MICHAEL MORELL: I agree with all of that. I would just add that Ukraine, of all the nations that border Russia, Ukraine special for him, right? It's not only all of the things you said, but it's also to him a very significant political risk, at least the way he thinks about it. If Ukraine is aligned with the West, if it's a vibrant democracy, if it's a vibrant economy, if it's not aligned with him, then in his mind because of the closeness of the two nations, historically, culturally, etc., in his mind, that would be an existential risk to him because he would fear that his own people would look at Ukraine and say, 'Hey, we want to be like them; we want to be a democracy, we want to be tied to the West and we want you to go away.' That is a major concern here for him. It's what drove him, I think, more than anything else in 2014, because he was afraid what was happening in the streets of Kiev could happen in the streets of Moscow. So I agree with everything you said. I would just add that one piece. MIKE VICKERS: Oh, I agree. And it's personal in a bizarre way, and he's very crude about it. I don't know if you've heard this joke he made about, basically, \"Remarry me, Ukraine, or I'll kill you like we've killed you before.\" You know, it has this line in Russian: \"It's your duty, my beauty,\" which means, we're going to abuse you and you do what I say. And it's sick and Ukraine has a special place for him in lots of ways. MICHAEL MORELL: So, what do you think, when he started this war, what was his preferred outcome? Was it to incorporate Ukraine back into Russia or was it simply to get rid of the Zelensky government to put his own Ukrainians in charge who would align themselves with Russia, who would destroy Ukrainian democracy, who would put down any protests in the streets? Which of those two things do you think it was? MIKE VICKERS: I think it was really to incorporate Ukraine back into Russia. MICHAEL MORELL: Really? MIKE VICKERS: Yes, I think if he were able to install a puppet government, that puppet government would do just what those idiots in the Donbass did in these new Russian-recognized republics and ask, you know, for independence, but in this case, to be incorporated into Russia. And he'd reluctantly say, \"OK.\"  And I think also he would see that as a way to further guarantee the security of Ukrainian territory, because then it would be Russian territory, and the risk to the West of trying to dislodge it would be higher in his mind. MICHAEL MORELL: Either way, whether it was to install a puppet government and he needs to keep some force there to support that government, or he incorporates it and he keeps force there, he would be incredibly vulnerable to an insurgency. Just as the Ukrainians did after World War II, and they sent thousands of dead Red Army soldiers back to Russia. MIKE VICKERS: Yeah, I agree completely. MICHAEL MORELL: So that's the specific goal, right, with regard to Ukraine. What's the general - go through that again, just for people to understand that? MIKE VICKERS: Yeah. So I think more broadly, as he said, it's to really reverse NATO expansion, essentially to rewrite the history of the end of the Cold War, and then to weaken or dissolve NATO or to weaken U.S. ties with Europe, and then importantly, to weaken the U.S., which he sees as his main adversary. I think he wants the whole kit and caboodle. It's not like NATO is going to expel 13 countries or whatever it is from NATO that have joined since 1997. But that's his goal. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Mike, here's an important question, I think. Is Putin in any way a different person than he was five years ago or 10 years ago? Are we dealing with the same guy or has he fundamentally changed? I mean, some people have talked about the isolation he's been in in the last two years because of COVID. I don't know about that. But are we dealing with the same guy or not? MIKE VICKERS: I think yes and no. He was always cold, calculating and ruthless. You know, a KGB man through and through. And you know, a lot of these anti-West, anti-U.S. statements really started in 2007. Or even, some of them, like 'the collapse of the Soviet Union being the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century,' I think dates back to 2005. But he's now more emotional, more erratic, more rambling, I think more reckless, perhaps from increasing self-isolation and confidence in himself. He's been ruling for 22 years and he's really gone for broke here, you know, as we've talked about earlier. This looks like a major strategic blunder that the potential losses way outweigh the gains. And so I think in that sense, he really he really is a different man now, and therefore potentially more dangerous. MICHAEL MORELL: I wonder, you know, the isolation with only a small group of advisers for a very long time, they've all become Yes Men. That probably plays a role here. His age probably plays a role in terms of him worrying about whether he can get to his ultimate goal in time, right? MIKE VICKERS: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: Must play a role here, too. But I agree. I mean, he is being reckless. And that does make him more dangerous. But we can't - this is just really important - we can't let that stop us from taking the steps we need to step to keep pressure on him. MIKE VICKERS: Yeah, absolutely. That's the so-called 'Madman Theory' of international relations. Sometimes it's faked. Sometimes it's unfortunately real, but you're absolutely right in that. MICHAEL MORELL: So Mike, do you think we could have deterred him from this invasion? Was there any way? Is there anything we could have done? You mentioned this briefly earlier. Is there anything we could have done to deter him? In my mind, there's kind of two buckets here. One is a longer term, 20 year kind of bucket and then the other is maybe more of a short-term. Maybe I'll take the longer term and say, if we had responded anywhere near as tough and as unified as we're responding today back to what he did against Georgia in 2008 or against Ukraine in 2014 or against the United States political system in 2016, I believe that would have been enough to deter him from thinking that he could get away with this.  So A- your thoughts on that and B- your thoughts on could we have done something in the immediate months before the invasion that could have deterred him? MIKE VICKERS: So I agree fully with that, and I think you're right to look at this in the long term and in the short term, you know, the immediate crisis. I strongly agree that had we responded more forcefully to his early adventures, it would have deterred him, and we didn't - he won all those. And that's why he thinks he can't lose. I would add a couple of others. One, Ukraine applied and Georgia applied for NATO membership in 2008, and it's been progressively stalled by NATO members. You have to have unanimity among 30 countries - particularly Germany and France. If they had agreed to that, particularly after 2014, I think that would have done it, you know, that he was actually taking on NATO.  Alternatively, if we recognized that NATO membership was unavailable, but we created a sub-alliance of frontline states - you know, the Poles have been asking for more guarantees, the Baltic states, etc. So if we had them and Romania and Slovakia and the US and UK, you know, just like we created this new Australia, UK, US alliance in East Asia, I think that would have deterred him.  Had the Europeans not made themselves so totally dependent on Russian energy, going back years, where he thought he had a stranglehold on them, that might have helped deter him as well.  But moving to the near term, I think the biggest thing we could have done was if we had not taken U.S. military intervention - particularly air power intervention, not ground forces, and had matched Putin's build-up with one of our own, and had we made it clear that we intended to enforce the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which Russia signed and we signed, I don't think he would have started this war. We did none of that. We just watched for months hoping that sanctions would deter him, and they didn't. MICHAEL MORELL: This is a great place to transition to how well the Biden administration has handled this. How do you think about that? MIKE VICKERS: I think reasonably well. I think looking at our government as a whole, the performance of the IC has really been outstanding. I think the administration's rallying of allies in support of Ukraine has been very good. I think military support to Ukraine could have been better. It was very poor during the early years - that's another thing we could have done, potentially, to deter this, was to make Ukraine a much harder target than it is. But that's been pretty good. And the sanctions on the Central Bank have hurt them.  I'm reluctant to criticize the administration, so I offer these thoughts solely in the spirit of wanting to see more effective U.S. policy, but, I think we misread Putin for most of the Biden administration's first year in office. MICHAEL MORELL: What do you mean by that? MIKE VICKERS: I think we thought we could just park the Russia problem and deal with China. And the Biden administration said they wanted a stable and predictable relationship with Russia. Well, they sure as heck didn't get that. I think our withdrawal from Afghanistan and then these repeated statements very early on that we would not use direct military force to contest a Russian invasion convinced Putin that we were weak and he could take Ukraine unopposed. And as I said, I think we put too much faith in the deterrent power of sanctions. After the invasion, our response has been better, but it's still been characterized a bit by incrementalism. So overall, I give them reasonable marks MICHAEL MORELL: And no doubt in your mind that we should sanction the energy sector? It's 60 percent of his exports and 30 percent of his economy. And with energy prices skyrocketing, he actually benefits to that to the extent that he can continue to export energy. So I think it's your view - I don't want to put words in your mouth here, but I thought you said it earlier - it's certainly my view that that's the next step here. MIKE VICKERS: Yeah. So there's obvious reasons why we're not doing that. European dependence on Russian oil and gas and not wanting to have the U.S. population pay more at the pump than they already are. But we're working at cross-purposes. It's the same thing with these symbolic sanctions on SWIFT. Either do it or don't do it, you know? And as you said, even if they can't convert their oil gain dollars into rubles, they're still getting richer. They can live to fight another day with when this conflict is over. So I think we're kind of in the half-measures place on sanctions at this point. MICHAEL MORELL: So Mike, if we think about the scenarios for how this ends, what do you think? MIKE VICKERS: That's really tough to say. I mean, they've got these talks going on at the Belarus border today. We don't know the outcome; most are pessimistic about it. He's really in a no-win position here in Ukraine. I just don't see how he achieves his objectives. And so he's got to find a way out. And you know, they're clever about saying anything they want for justification. So maybe he'll resort to that at this point. I wouldn't rule out that he could be toppled. I know it's a long shot, but he really has put himself in a bind here. But you know, it could get ugly before it gets better. And I hope we have the stomach to to see this through. MICHAEL MORELL: You know, the irony for him is, the more reckless he is in Ukraine or even elsewhere, with, say, cyberattacks against the West, the more reckless he is, the greater chance that he gets toppled. MIKE VICKERS: That's right. MICHAEL MORELL: And that's why he's stuck, it seems to me. MIKE VICKERS: Exactly. MICHAEL MORELL: He's in a horrible position. MIKE VICKERS: Yeah, exactly. And that depends, obviously, on our response. But I think that's exactly right. We have lots of ways to hurt him that we haven't done yet. And we could certainly do that. MICHAEL MORELL: And do you - I don't - but I'm wondering if you see any way that he comes out of this with a win from his perspective, or is it right now just minimizing the damage? MIKE VICKERS: I think it's more minimizing the damage unless we were to suddenly capitulate and the Ukrainians were suddenly to capitulate, which certainly doesn't seem likely. So I think it really is damage limitation. I just don't know that they know how to do that. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. If you think about him being toppled, there's really only three possibilities, right?  One is somebody walks in and arrests him; the other is somebody shoots him; and the other is he shoots himself. He's not going to be able to go anywhere in the world. Nobody's going to accept him. So, you know, being toppled is not pretty from his perspective, which loops back to being as reckless as he thinks he needs to be in order to try to stay in power. MIKE VICKERS: Right. Although, if he's concerned about being toppled and some of the advisers speak up and he doesn't kill them, he might decide that it's better to forestall that and find a way out of this crisis. MICHAEL MORELL: Just one more question. We're kind of running out of time here a little bit. But one more question, Mike: if this ends badly for him and he limps his way out of Ukraine, he's undercut significantly at home in terms of his politics, maybe he's even toppled - does this end up being a revitalization of the global order? Is this a shot in the arm to the global order that's been eroding the last decade and a half? MIKE VICKERS: So I think it's definitely that, but it depends on what the outcome really is with Russia.  If he's toppled, there's still China to deal with. And at least Europe, the European West, may revert back to, you know, the good days of the 1990s again, slowly, over time, because China's too distant and they have multiple interests there. If he manages to survive, if he cuts his losses and then rebuilds, you still have this tacit China-Russia alliance that has a very different vision of the global order. That makes it a bigger challenge for us than any time since the end of the Cold War. So I think that that's still uncertain. You know, on the other hand, if he does survive, I think he's really lost the West and Europe at this point. MICHAEL MORELL: He's a pariah forever, MIKE VICKERS: He's a pariah forever. So there's a number of ways this could go. But this has changed the world. There's no question of that. MICHAEL MORELL: Also, if you're China and you see the world's response to his invasion of Ukraine, it's got to make you think twice about invading Taiwan. MIKE VICKERS: Well, I think both both are true. If this had gone easy for him, they might have taken advantage of that and now it ought to make you think twice. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, yeah. Mike, thank you so much for joining us. It's been great to have you. MIKE VICKERS; My pleasure, as always.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday recognized the independence of Moscow-backed rebel regions in eastern Ukraine, a move that will further fuel tensions with the West amid fears of Russian invasion. Putin's move follows days of heightened tensions in Ukraine's eastern industrial heartland, where Ukrainian forces are locked in a nearly eight-year conflict with Russia-backed separatists that has left more than 14,000 people dead. Here is a look at the history behind the rebel-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine: When Ukraine's Moscow-friendly president was driven from office by mass protests in February 2014, Russia responded by annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula. It then threw its weight behind an insurgency in the mostly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine region known as Donbas. In April 2014, Russia-backed rebels seized government buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, proclaimed the creation of \"people's republics\" and battled Ukrainian troops and volunteer battalions. The following month, the separatist regions held a popular vote to declare independence and make a bid to become part of Russia. Moscow did not accept the motion, but used the regions as a tool to keep Ukraine in its orbit and prevent it from joining NATO. Ukraine and the West accused Russia of backing the rebels with troops and weapons. Moscow denied that, saying any Russians who fought there were volunteers. Amid ferocious battles involving tanks, heavy artillery and warplanes, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people aboard. An international probe concluded that the passenger jet was downed by a Russia-supplied missile from the rebel-controlled territory in Ukraine. Moscow still denied any involvement. After a massive defeat of Ukrainian troops in August 2014, envoys from Kyiv, the rebels and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe signed a truce in the Belarusian capital of Minsk in September 2014. The document envisaged an OSCE-observed cease-fire, a pullback of all foreign fighters, an exchange of prisoners and hostages, an amnesty for the rebels and a promise that separatist regions could have a degree of self-rule. The deal quickly collapsed and large-scale fighting resumed, leading to another major defeat for Ukrainian forces at Debaltseve in January-February of 2015. France and Germany brokered another peace agreement, which was signed in Minsk in February 2015 by representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the rebels. It envisaged a new cease-fire, a pullback of heavy weapons and a series of moves toward a political settlement. A declaration backing the deal was signed by the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany. The 2015 peace deal was a major diplomatic coup for the Kremlin, obliging Ukraine to grant special status to the separatist regions, allowing them to create their own police force and have a say in appointing local prosecutors and judges. It also envisaged that Ukraine could only regain control over the roughly 125-mile border with Russia in rebel regions after they get self-rule and hold OSCE-monitored local elections \u2014 balloting that would almost certainly keep pro-Moscow rebels in power there. Many Ukrainians see it as a betrayal of national interests and its implementation has stalled. The Minsk document helped end full-scale fighting, but the situation has remained tense and regular skirmishes have continued. With the Minsk deal stalled, Moscow's hope to use rebel regions to directly influence Ukraine's politics has failed. But the frozen conflict has drained Kyiv's resources and effectively stymied its goal of joining NATO \u2014 which is enshrined in the Ukrainian constitution. Moscow also has worked to secure its hold on the rebel regions by handing out more than 720,000 Russian passports to roughly one-fifth of their population of about 3.6 million. It has provided economic and financial assistance to the separatist territories, but the aid has been insufficient to alleviate the massive damage from fighting and shore up the economy. The Donbas region accounted for about 16% of Ukraine's GDP before the conflict. Amid soaring tensions over the Russian troop concentration near Ukraine, France and Germany embarked on renewed efforts to encourage compliance with the 2015 deal, in hopes that it could help defuse the current standoff. Facing calls from Berlin and Paris for its implementation, Ukrainian officials have strengthened their criticism of the Minsk deal and warned that it could lead to the country's demise. Two rounds of talks in Paris and Berlin between presidential envoys from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany have yielded no progress. The lower house of the Russian parliament, meanwhile, urged Putin last week to recognize the independence of Ukraine's rebel regions. Putin's recognition of the rebel-held territories' independence effectively shatters the Minsk peace agreements and will further fuel tensions with the West.\u00a0 The move follows several days of shelling that erupted along the line of contact in Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukraine and the West accused Moscow of fomenting the tensions to create a pretext for an invasion. Russia, in turn, accused Ukraine of trying to reclaim the rebel-held territories by force, a claim that Kyiv strongly rejected. On Friday, separatist leaders released video statements announcing the evacuation of civilians in the face of what they described as a Ukrainian \"aggression.\" The data embedded in the video indicated that their statements had been pre-recorded two days earlier when the situation was still relatively calm, suggesting a deliberate plan to try to sever the regions from Ukraine. The rebel chiefs put out new video statements Monday urging Putin to recognize their regions' independence, and the Russian leader responded quickly by convening a carefully orchestrated meeting of his Security Council and then signing the recognition decrees in a televised ceremony.",

And today on Face the Nation: U.S. officials warn that Russia is planning  to invade Ukraine, and soon.\u00a0   And the FDA puts a pause on vaccines for the very youngest.  President Biden warns Vladimir Putin of the -- quote -- \"swift and severe  costs facing Russia if they attack Ukraine, and tells most Americans to get  out of there now.   We will have the latest news, plus White House National Security Adviser  Jake Sullivan and Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger.   As COVID cases continue to plummet, it's blue state governors now leading  the charge to lift some health restrictions. Health officials say it's too  soon. We will talk to New Jersey Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, plus  former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb.   Finally: Inflation jumps again, and the Fed moves closer to raising  interest rates to stabilize the economy. We will check in with San  Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly.  It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.   Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation on this Super Bowl Sunday.  For many pandemic-weary Americans, game day is a much-needed break, if only  for a day.   But we are now at the 11th hour of a crisis that is 5,000 miles  away in Ukraine. Diplomatic efforts to defuse a potential military conflict  that poses the biggest threat to Europe since World War II involve not just  the U.S., but our NATO allies.  President Biden spoke with Vladimir Putin for an hour yesterday, telling  the Russian president that an attack on Ukraine would have a catastrophic  impact and cause widespread human suffering. Mr. Biden also told him a  diplomatic solution was still possible.  President Biden plans to speak to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky  later today.   Our Imtiaz Tyab reports from Kyiv.   (Begin VT)   IMTIAZ TYAB (voice-over): Ukraine's armed forces may be small compared  with Russia's, but they are mighty.  President Volodymyr Zelensky oversaw the exercises held not far from  Russian-occupied Crimea, a territory seized by Vladimir Putin eight years  ago.   The U.S. is now warning of an all-out invasion of Ukraine, and says  there's mounting evidence that Russia is poised to attack again, this time  with a multiaxis assault using ground troops, amphibious forces,  airstrikes, and even ballistic missiles.  But Zelensky says those dire warnings are doing more harm than good.   VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT: The best friend for enemies, that  is panic in our country. And all this information that helps only for panic  doesn't help us.   IMTIAZ TYAB: As thousands took to the streets of Kyiv, calling for peace,  the U.S. quickly pulled military and other personnel out of the country,  along with the U.K., Canada, Australia, and nearly a dozen other nations  following suit.  Russia's military buildup in the region is only growing, with enormous  live-fire military drills in neighboring Belarus and Moldova. The war games  are mere miles away from the thousands of NATO and allied troops in the  region in what is the largest military buildup on the continent since the  Cold War.   Haunted by the chaotic scramble to evacuate from Afghanistan, President  Biden has vowed he will not send in troops to Ukraine to rescue trapped  Americans, with the State Department urging all Americans to leave  immediately.   (End VT)   IMTIAZ TYAB: Now, the deep skepticism here in Ukraine of an all-out war is  dwarfed by Russia's massive military buildup on its borders, as attempts to  end this crisis with diplomacy intensify -- Margaret.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Imtiaz Tyab, thank you.   For more insight on the military threat, we're joined by national security  correspondent David Martin.  Good morning, David. Good to have you here.  What is the latest on the Russian troop movements?   DAVID MARTIN: Well, about 30 Russian warships have begun live-fire  exercises in the Black Sea. And if you plot the coordinates of those  exercises, you will see that those exercises cover virtually the entire  southern coast of Ukraine.   Meanwhile, you have those exercises with 30,000 Russian troops going on in  Belarus, whose border is just an hour away from the Ukrainian capital of  Kyiv. Russia now has 80 percent of the forces it would need to conduct an  all-out invasion. And the rest are on their way.  Some of those troops that we have seen parked bumper to bumper in those  assembly areas in satellite photos, they're starting to move out of those  assembly areas a little closer to the border, but not yet into what you  would call an attack position.  The U.S. has intelligence that Putin has told his commanders to be ready to  go on the 16th, which is Wednesday. Now, whether it all plays out according  to that timetable remains to be seen. But we are clearly at crunch time.  And, up until now, we have been able to see what Putin is doing, but  haven't been able to know what he's thinking. He is about to have to  declare himself.   MARGARET BRENNAN: And this is just incredibly high stakes. President Biden  has said he would not send in combat troops to Ukraine.  But, if you look at that map, we have NATO forces very close to Russian  forces. There's a high degree of miscalculation risk.   DAVID MARTIN: The stakes in this are really incredibly high.  I mean, you have the sovereignty of a country, Ukraine. You have the  solidity of an alliance, NATO. But, above everything else, you have the  threat of a war between two, U.S. -- nuclear -- and two nuclear  superpowers, the U.S. and Russia. And that has to be avoided at all costs.  And, frankly, I think that is why Putin has been so methodical in this  buildup, and, in fact, maybe even telegraphing some of his punches, so that  the Americans have plenty of time to get out of the way, because, once the  shooting starts, unintended consequences set in, political pressures build,  and nobody can guarantee where this is going to end.  And if that wasn't dicey enough, Putin has taken an annual nuclear exercise  usually run in the fall and rescheduled it to run this month. And that  exercise usually includes the firing of ICBMs, test-firing of ICBMs, and of  submarine-launched ballistic missiles.  The last time he did that, reschedule that exercise, was when he annexed  Crimea. It's his way of saying, Ukraine is much more important to me than  it is to you. And, if I have to, I will resort to nuclear weapons.   MARGARET BRENNAN: David, thank you for clearly sketching out the stakes  here.   DAVID MARTIN: Sure thing.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here.  We go now to the White House, national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.  Good morning to you, Jake.   JAKE SULLIVAN (U.S. National Security Adviser): Good morning.   MARGARET BRENNAN: You were on that hour-long call between President Biden  and Russian President Vladimir Putin. There were no breakthroughs.  Is there any reason to believe Putin is going to take any of the diplomatic  options you've given him?   JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I'm not going to predict what Vladimir Putin is going  to do.  All I can do is make sure that we're prepared to respond either way. If  Russia wants to continue engaging diplomatically to find a way forward to  address their security concerns and our security concerns, we're prepared  to do that. If Russia decides instead to take major military action against  Ukraine. We're prepared to respond decisively.   MARGARET BRENNAN: But there's no diplomacy underway right now? There's  nothing that came out of yesterday's call?   JAKE SULLIVAN: As far as we're concerned, the United States of America,  diplomacy is still open and available.  But, if Russia chooses to move, we're prepared to respond.   MARGARET BRENNAN: You said an attack by Russia could happen as soon as  this week.  Are you seeing Russian troops move into tactical positions?   JAKE SULLIVAN: We have seen over the course of the past 10 days a dramatic  acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces and the disposition of those  forces in such a way that they could launch a military action essentially  at any time.  They could do so this coming week. But, of course, it still awaits the go  order. And so, therefore, we cannot predict the precise day or time that  they may take action.  We also are watching very carefully for the possibility that there is a  pretext or a false flag operation to kick off the Russian action, in which  Russian intelligence services conduct some kind of attack on Russian proxy  forces in Eastern Ukraine or on Russian citizens, and then blame it on the  Ukrainians.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.  Russian intelligence is already publicly claiming things are happening in  the east of Ukraine in that Donbass region. Is that the flash point where  you think things would start?   JAKE SULLIVAN: It is one distinct possibility.  And, to your point, the Russian media has been laying the groundwork for  this publicly by trying to condition their public that some kind of attack  by the Ukrainians is imminent.  And there is a kind of bizarre quality to all of this, where the Russians  are claiming they are the ones who are under threat, despite the fact that  they have amassed more than 100,000 forces on the troops of -- excuse me --  on the border of their neighbor.  And they have done so not just on their own territory, but on the territory  of Belarus, which is the country, of course, that borders Ukraine to the  north.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  I mean, you said on Friday in the White House Briefing Room Americans  should get out within the next 24 to 48 hours. That puts us at today. What  are you telling Americans who remain? Should they go underground? Is it too  late to leave now?   JAKE SULLIVAN: As long as commercial transport options are available,  Americans should take advantage of them.  We had hoped, based on our warnings, that Americans would have gotten out  by now, but, as long as those commercial transit options are available,  Americans should avail themselves of them.  They should move out by air or rail or road as rapidly as possible,  because, as I said also on Friday, if there is military action, if there is  a war between Russia and Ukraine started by a Russian invasion of Ukraine,  President Biden is not intending to send in American forces to fight Russia  in that war.  And Americans who have the opportunity to get out now should avail  themselves of it.   MARGARET BRENNAN: But airspace remains open right now.  If Russia does carry out this invasion, you've talked about the  consequences with sanctions, but are you committed to actually funding,  arming, helping a Ukrainian insurgency?   JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, what the president has said is that we will continue  to support Ukraine even after an invasion begins.  And I'm not going to get into the specific details of what that will look  like, but it is one of the three fundamental elements of our response,  continue to support Ukraine as it seeks to resist Russian aggression,  second, impose severe and swift economic measures, in concert with our  allies and partners, that go at Russia's financial system and at its  defense industrial base, and then, third, reinforce, reassure and deter.  That is, reinforce NATO territory, reassure our allies on the eastern  flank...   MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.   JAKE SULLIVAN: ... and deter Russia from any action against NATO allies,  to whom we have a sacred Article 5 commitment to defend.  We are going to carry out all of those actions...   MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.   JAKE SULLIVAN: ... in the event that Russia moves forward. And we've been  very clear about that.   MARGARET BRENNAN: But, at the same time, you have pretty close proximity  between NATO troops and Russian troops.  Is this just a potential risk of a miscalculation that's incredibly high at  this moment?   JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Margaret, part of the reason that we've been as  transparent as we have about the deployment of American forces to Romania  and Poland, about our exercises from the Mediterranean up to the Baltics,  the reason we've gone out publicly and laid out both what the scope and  parameters of those deployments and exercises are and what their purpose  is, is to avoid mistake, miscalculation or escalation, and also to send a  very clear message to Russia.  We will defend every inch of NATO territory, every inch of Article 5  territory. And Russia, we think, fully understands that message.   MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it possible this is just the world's most  expensive and dangerous bluff on the part of Vladimir Putin?   JAKE SULLIVAN: Again, as I said at the top of your show, I can't get in  the head of Vladimir Putin and I can't predict exactly what he's going to  do.  The United States is prepared. Our allies are prepared. And now it's up to  Russia to determine what the next step they will take is.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake, I know Afghanistan and Ukraine couldn't be more  different, but there is always the risk when you are making policy choices  that you're fighting the last war, instead of addressing what's happening  now.  These loud warnings about Ukraine, about the need to get out, is this  because of how the White House miscalculated the level of chaos around the  U.S. evacuation from Afghanistan? President Biden said this week that he  wasn't warned. \"No one told me.\"  And he rejected the findings of this Army report, pointing to errors.   JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, Margaret, Afghanistan does play into  this in an important way.  Because the American people saw the United States deploy thousands of  soldiers and then evacuate 124,000 people from Kabul last August, it's  totally possible that there are some Americans out there in Ukraine  thinking the exact same thing is going to happen in Ukraine.  And it's our obligation to indicate to them that that is not, in fact, the  case, that there is a big difference between ending a 20-year war in  Afghanistan and sending American forces in to fight Russian forces near  their border in a war in Ukraine, which the president is not prepared to  do.  So, we are trying to dispel any notion that the United States is going to  deploy thousands of forces to Ukraine to fight in order to evacuate  Americans.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you learn the lessons of Afghanistan? Are you  applying them now?   JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, to the point about the report you just  mentioned, the president and I sitting here today do reject the reports in  \"The Washington Post\" that the White House or the NSC sought to slow down  the evacuation...   MARGARET BRENNAN: This was a FOIA version of an Army report.   JAKE SULLIVAN: The opposite is true.  From the president -- from the president on down, it was the White House  and the NSC pushing military leaders and diplomats day by day through those  early days of August to say, should we begin the evacuation now?  And as soon as, the minute our military leaders and diplomats recommended  to the president that he do so, literally, that minute, he ordered the  evacuation.   MARGARET BRENNAN: August 12.  Thank you, Jake Sullivan, for your time today. We'll be watching.  Good luck.  Face the Nation will be back in a moment.  Stay with us.   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: With COVID cases dropping nationally, some states are  now dropping mask mandates. But the Biden administration and the CDC are  saying, not so fast.  Mark Strassmann reports.   (Begin VT)   MAN: Rip up those cards and be proud.   (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)   MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): Shredded vaccination cards, proof that COVID  resentment...   PROTESTER: What do we want   PROTESTERS: Safe schools!   MARK STRASSMANN: ... runs a continuous fever on all sides.   GOVERNOR JAY INSLEE (D-Washington): They say the last mile of any trip is  the most challenging, and that may be the case here.   MARK STRASSMANN: But for COVID chroniclers and all you mask haters, a  milestone moment.   GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL (D-New York): Given the declining cases, given  declining hospitalizations, that is why we feel comfortable to lift this.   MARK STRASSMANN: With new cases plunging, New York is one of 10 blue  states where governors announced plans to drop some form of indoor mask  mandates last week, getting out ahead of the Biden administration's  guidance.  Seven of the 10 are dropping mask mandates in schools.   WOMAN: I'm very excited. My children have had enough of this. I'm ready  for normalcy to begin.   MARK STRASSMANN: But with COVID, reality always clouds normalcy's return.   DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY (CDC Director): We continue to recommend masking in  areas of high and substantial transmission -- that's much of the country  right now -- in public indoor settings.   MARK STRASSMANN: For parents of young kids, another setback, the FDA and  Pfizer's decision to delay approval of a vaccine for kids 5 and under at  least until April.  Millions of Americans have another growing worry, America's startling  inflation rate, a spike of 7.5 percent, the highest in 40 years, showing no  signs of mercy until at least summer.   WOMAN: I have noticed all of my fun money has gone to food.   MARK STRASSMANN: And for 2022 zeitgeist, COVID economic agitation, social  fracturing, these ongoing protests along the Canadian border have it all,  truckers furious about mandatory vaccinations.  A Canadian judge's order: Go home.  Many did. But police this morning began making arrests and towing vehicles.  Until traffic flows again on the Ambassador Bridge, two countries will  worry about their latest supply chain headache.   (End VT)   MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann reporting from Atlanta.   We go now to former FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Doctor, I have to say there was a lot of whiplash this week with the FDA and the Pfizer decision to hit the brakes on this vaccine for toddlers, for children ages four and younger. Now we have to wait until April for a decision. What happened?   DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, there were no new safety issues coming out of the data set, the issue here is the ability for the FDA and for Pfizer to clearly define the level of efficacy that the vaccine is delivering. And what you have is a situation where the data sets continuing to evolve because we're still in the middle of this Omicron wave of infection, there still effect infections accruing on the patients in the clinical trial, both the patients who have been vaccinated and the patients who've been unvaccinated. And so, the data set is changing. And there was additional data that was submitted to the FDA late last week, on Thursday and Friday that changed the FDA's perception of the absolute efficacy of the vaccine. And given the fact that that is changing, that's evolving. New data is accruing. It's hard for the FDA to give its advisers a fixed snapshot of what the absolute efficacy is of this clinical trial, of the data set. And so, if they wait a little longer, if they administer the third dose in that clinical trial, they're not only going to have perhaps a better measure of effectiveness from this trial, but they'll also have a settled data set. They'll have a very firm picture of what- what level of effectiveness the vaccine is delivering, and that's important for patients and pediatricians to be able to make fully informed decisions because it's important to know that the vaccine is safe. But it's also important to know what the level of effectiveness that's delivering as well.   MARGARET BRENNAN: It's whiplash in the meantime, as parents continue to wait. And then we also see, you know, in some areas of the country, like New Jersey, states lifting their mask requirements in schools. So should parents of children under the age of five keep their kids back- keep their kids masks in school?   DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, I think there's portions of the population that are going to be in a very difficult spot right now because they remain vulnerable, one portion of the population are young children, parents who work who are at risk of bringing the infection back into the home with a child who's unvaccinated. Also, people who are older, who have comorbid conditions that put them at risk of COVID will continue to be vulnerable. But we're clearly shifting from a compact where there was a shared sense of sacrifice across the population generally to take certain measures to take certain mitigation, like wearing masks, like protecting congregate settings towards one where policymakers are clearly shifting the burden onto individuals to try to protect themselves based on their own measure of their risk and the risk of their environment. It's incumbent upon policymakers to give people the tools to do that, but there are pockets of society that don't have those tools, like young children don't have vaccines, so parents are in a difficult spot. They're going to continue to have to remain vigilant if they're concerned about the risk of infection, those young children. But this is clearly a trend right now across the country.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Walmart, world's largest retailer, I mean, they set the tone for a lot of corporate America. They have decided to lift the mask mandate for vaccinated employees. You have this wave of Democratic governors, as you predicted lifting mask mandates. But the CDC and the president say it is too early. Is this just another round of the CDC being too slow or is everyone else moving too fast?   DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, the CDC is setting a national standard and there's still parts of the country that have a lot of Omicron infection, not every part of the country is through this wave of the epidemic. Clearly, the Northeast is the mid-Atlantic, where cases are 20 cases per hundred thousand people per day. But when you look at states like Kentucky, West Virginia, Tennessee, Missouri, they're at about 100 cases, or Mississippi, there are about 100 cases per hundred thousand people per day. That's a pretty dense epidemic. So the CDC has a hard time setting a national standard across a very diverse experience with this- this virus. I think what you're going to see the CDC do, though, is come out with guidance that's more specific to communities. That's based on what the local prevalence is, and that's probably where they should have been all along. I think they're going to make that adaptation because there clearly are parts of the country where prevalence is low enough now and heading in a positive direction if they can start lifting this mitigation.   MARGARET BRENNAN: One other question before I let you go, you tweeted this week that it's hard to believe in the middle of the worst public health crisis in modern times. Democrats are letting twist in the wind, their party's nominee for FDA chief. Why, more than a year into the administration do we not have a confirmed FDA commissioner?   DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I'm hoping Rob Califf, Dr. Rob Califf, will be confirmed this week is going to go before the Senate. I think he's an outstanding choice for the agency previously held that job, and I inherited the FDA from his leadership, so a lot of his policies and his team was what I inherited when I took over the agency. You know, there's different political reasons why senators have made an issue of his confirmation. One of them is the issue of opioids, which he's been very strong on advancing policies to help deal with the opioid epidemic.   MARGARET BRENNAN: So well, it sounds like he has your endorsement there. Dr. Gottlieb, I have to leave it there and hit this break. Thank you so much.   Dr. Gottlieb, I have to leave it there to hit this break. Thank you so  much.  Stay with us, all of you. There's more Face the Nation ahead.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set  your DVR. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with more Face the Nation.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with a new CBS News poll.  The drop in Covid cases has, in turn, improved America's views on our  handling of the virus, but people are still struggling with trying to deal  with the pandemic's impact.  Joining us now is CBS News elections and survey's director Anthony  Salvanto.  Good morning, Anthony.  You know, the CDC director says we're still not out of the clear. Is that  how the public feels?  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret.  Yes, that sense that things are better but not yet well. When you look at  the emotions that people express toward Covid safety measures right now,  there is still a lot of patience with them, but it is mixed. There is  frustration. There is exhaustion. It is not just one thing in the public  minds, it's reflective of the fact that we've been through all these ups  and downs and the waves.  Now, when you look at particular measures, mask requirements, there still  is a majority that would favor that.  But the thing you want to understand  is, besides partisanship behind this is the difference between the fully  vaccinated, who are far more supportive, they've long been more concerned  about the pandemic, long been more concerned about what to do, and they are  more supportive than the remaining unvaccinated who are more frustrated and  who feel that these measures do not work, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we saw some of that in our own focus group that we  did with parents. And, really, across the board, we heard, regardless of  political affiliation, they were all incredibly concerned about their  children.  ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes, when we talked to parents in this poll, we found  that so many said that their kids' mental and emotional health, their kids'  educational development had gotten worse during the pandemic. Sizable  numbers there. So, yes, parents are seeing those changes.  And what to do about it, though? When you see parents who still support  mask mandates, with the majority saying they still could be required, how  do those two things mesh? Well, there are plenty of things that parents do,  as any parent of young kids will tell you, that they thing will protect  their kids, even though it makes them feel frustrated and exhausted.  And, finally, Margaret, I would add this, when people look right now at the  state of things in this country, the number who say things are going well  is up from last month, but it's still not a high number. So, a little bit  better but not yet well.  Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, how people feel impacts how they might vote.  Thank you.  We go now to Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey. He was the first of several blue state governors this week to announce plans to roll back statewide mask mandates in schools. Good morning to you, governor.  NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR PHIL MURPHY: Good morning, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC says we are not there yet. You say you're following the science, so what do you know that the CDC director does not?  MURPHY: Yeah, I think New Jersey's Scott Gottlieb hit this point very well. Our numbers are- are improving and I would use the word dramatically, rate of transmission, positivity rate, hospitalizations, cases, in-school transmissions, all going in a dramatically good direction. The- the- challenge is this- this spike, this- this variant has spiked straight up, and it's now coming straight down. New Jersey, New York, got hit early in this wave, as we have in all of the waves. The fact of the matter is our experience is very different right now from the average American state's experience. So, the CDC, which we have been adherent to from the get-go, and we think they're doing a terrific job, they've just got a much more complex reality. The- the science and the data and the facts on the ground in New Jersey have allowed us to take this step.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, CDC still says you're at a high transmission level, but I want to ask you about- in Virginia, the Republican governor here, right nearby Washington, D.C.- is locked in court battles over his decision to pull back mask mandates. He made that call back in January. Did you fear similar political blowback? I mean, did you look at that example?  MURPHY: Now, listen, I think they've done it- with great respect, they've done that backwards. They basically banned mandates and- and- and then said to the districts sue us to get that overturned. We've done the exact opposite. In other words, we're lifting the mask mandate, by the way, on March 7th, so we gave ourselves a four week runway and then allowed districts or individuals as they so choose to- to put local mandates or wear masks in place.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But for those local districts, I mean, aren't you just kind of transferring a political problem down to a more local level? How do those school districts, how do those mayors, how do they make the call? What benchmarks are you specifically giving them on whether it's safe to advise lifting those masks or not?  MURPHY: Yeah- we have got the virus at least as we sit here, Margaret, and every time you think you've got to figure it out, it humbles you, it takes a turn you don't expect. But as best we can tell right now, this thing is going from pandemic to endemic. And we feel it is the responsible step to take to allow districts, if they so choose, based on their local health realities, working with their local health officers to- to make a decision on their own. My gut tells me, particularly as we get into warmer weather in the spring and assuming the virus continues to go in the right direction, you'll have the overwhelming amount of districts following suit and lifting the mandate.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you get any timeline from the White House, from the CDC at all on when they will give federal guidelines to do what you're doing?  MURPHY: We have not, although w-we think that the Biden administration has done an outstanding job managing this, but again, they've got a much more complex reality. This isn't one of these earlier waves where the curves went sort of- sweeping over months up and sweeping over months down. This thing goes up like a rocket ship, and it's straight down. I'm sure it's only a matter of time until we see federal guidance.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you- you know- as a Democrat, your thoughts here, going into these races, you just went through an election yourself. Former President Obama spoke this week to House Democrats and told them to take the wins you can get, it doesn't help to whine about stuff you can't change. Do you feel like Democrats are in a defensive crouch going into these midterm races?  MURPHY: I'm not sure, Margaret, defensive crouch, but I- I would say that we're probably focused a lot more on what we have not been able to get done, a lot more on process, than we have on the historic things that we have got done as a party. I mean, the president and Congress have gotten a bipartisan infrastructure law that is historic. The American Rescue Plan money's historic- by the way, a lot of which have yet to be spent. I think we should celebrate, just to pick those two examples and- and- and- remind folks why they got done and who delivered the goods for them.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But when it comes to political liabilities, one of the things we've seen in our polling, is the lived experience of Americans, and they experience the economy through the prices they pay- inflation at seven and a half percent- is this the biggest political liability for Democrats or is that just not how you see things?  MURPHY: I think it's a challenge for Democrats, for sure. I- I think and I'll put myself in this category early on, we talked a lot about whether this was transitory, how deep and- and- and- and impactful it would be. The fact of the matter is it's real. It's here. My guess is it's here for the balance of this calendar year. We've done a lot in- in our state as it relates to affordability. So I think anything Democrats can do- we- we've passed 14 tax cuts for the middle class of working families and seniors in our first term- steps like that, making health care more affordable, college more affordable, property taxes more affordable, anything we could do as a party, I have to believe, will resonate because inflation is real.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, is there a risk from this trucker convoy in these protests? I know New Jersey is a logistics hub.  MURPHY: Without question, we have one of the largest ports in the country and knocking on wood with our folks have managed it brilliantly in the context of this pandemic, but that trucker reality is a threat without question.  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Governor, thank you very much for your time today. We will be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who is one of two Republican members on the committee investigating the Jan. 6th insurrection. Good morning to you, congressman.\u00a0  REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Good morning.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to start on what is happening most immediately between Russia and Ukraine. You have these massive Russian military exercises. How do you assess the Biden Administration's handling of the situation so far?  REP. KINZINGER: Yeah, look, I'm on- I'm on Team America. Team Ukraine. There are some nuances I would have done different than the Biden administration, but I think now's the time to- to stand unified. And what I'd say is they have done a good job, particularly in bringing out intel early to try to defang any Russian narrative that could come with Ukraine. We know about the discussion of a false flag attack. Well, now we've made it clear that Russia may do that. And and so I think a lot of that is good. One thing I will add, though, is we have to shut down Nord Stream Two regardless of what happens in Ukraine because Ukraine is using energy as a weapon. And I think that's important to do.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia is using energy as a weapon--  REP. KINZINGER: Yes, that's what I mean-\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that's what you mean.\u00a0  REP. KINZINGER: Yes Russia.  MARGARET BRENNAN: On Russia, generally, you know, there had been for so long bipartisan support for standing up to Russia and standing up for democracies. But there is this interesting trend within the conservative movement right now. You have more Trump oriented parts of the party, like- like Senator Josh Hawley, who recently called on President Biden to rule out admitting Ukraine into NATO. You have similar sentiment- sentiments elsewhere. What is happening here? I mean, how significant a portion of the Republican Party is moving in this direction.  REP. KINZINGER: Well, I don't think it's a huge portion, but it's way too big and it's growing and it's a huge concern. I mean, what was this five years ago? It might be like somebody like Rand Paul that would say something or Dana Rohrabacher. Now there's a significant number of folks doing it with Tucker Carlson talking about, you know, how great Vladimir Putin is and how Ukraine is really actually part of Russia. I think it's a couple of things. Number one, it could be some naivete on foreign policy, not in Tucker's case. I think it's an affection for authoritarianism. And I think Vladimir Putin has done a decent job of engaging in culture battles and culture war, and he is seen as the person defending, in essence, the culture of the past. And so it's very frightening. And by the way, you know, Ukraine is not sure. Already, one third of the country of Georgia is occupied by Russia. Nobody's going to stop them from going into the rest of that. Then you have the Baltics, you have the Balkans that they're interfering in. This is a frightening moment, and any Republican that has affection for Vladimir Putin has no understanding of what our party stands for or what out country stands for.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to what your party stands for. You are on that Jan. 6th committee, as we mentioned, Rudy Giuliani, the president's attorney, former attorney, is apparently speaking to the committee in some form. Is he being cooperative at this point? What can you tell us about that?  REP. KINZINGER: Well, what I can tell you is he's been subpoenaed, our expectation is he is going to cooperate because that's the law, that's the requirement, same as if somebody subpoenaed to court. There may be some changes and dates and moments here as, you know, lawyers do their back and forth. But we fully expect that in accordance with the law. We'll hear from Rudy. But look, regardless of when we hear from Rudy or how long that interview is, we're getting a lot of information and we're looking forward to wrapping this up at some point when that is right, showing it to the American people, but not rushing it, not hurrying this. We want everybody to have the full story. That's what's important. I have a new son. I want to make sure that in five and 10 years, when he's learning about this and history class, he gets the full answer and not some conspiracy garbage that we hear out there every day.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the plan still to begin those public hearings in the spring?  REP. KINZINGER: I think spring or summer and in that timeframe is the hope, basically we'll will want to be able to- to take this information and present it to the American people, not just in a report which is going to be essential, but in people, in faces and in stories.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said this week in very clear terms that January 6th was a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election. So unlike some Republicans, he's clearly pointing to the intent of the actors, he's not just talking about the fact that there was some violence. He's saying what the people were doing that day was inherently wrong. And what President Trump was saying about the election has also now been clearly said by Vice President Mike Pence to have been wrong. Does this give more political cover to Republicans running for election in 2022 to say this? Or is it still too dangerous?  REP. KINZINGER: Well, it does give more political cover. The question is, will it? You know, I have- I have lost faith in some of the courage of my colleagues. I thought that every person when they swore an oath had some version of a red line they would never cross. But certainly, Mitch McConnell's statement was important. Certainly, the vice president's statement was important. But Margaret, this is a moment where every Republican. I don't care if you're running for city council all the way up to Congress, Senate, et cetera. Every Republican has to be clear and forceful on the record. Do they think January 6th was legitimate political discourse? Don't let them avoid it. Don't let them hem haw and don't let them transition to some other subject they'd rather talk about. This is an answer every one of them have to give, and then we can move on once they're clear and on the record. But this is definitive to our democracy. How do you feel? Was it legitimate?\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 As you know, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee and even Senator Marco Rubio, who was on this program last Sunday, argued that there's a difference between the day and then what the committee you are on and the work you were doing, what those things add up to. They argue that your committee is persecuting ordinary citizens that had nothing to do with violence. How do you respond to that?  REP. KINZINGER: I mean, it's obviously a convenient way for them to deflect. We are not looking at the twenty thousand or so people that were there on January 6th that did not enter the Capitol grounds. We're looking at the corruption that led up to the moment and what happened since. We're talking about anybody communicating and of course, those that went into the Capitol attempting to overthrow this. And they know that. Marco Rubio knows that. Ronna McDaniel knows that. All these folks know it. But they're trying to kind of pass around it because they don't want to tick off the base. OK, but they also don't want appear -appear to be too in there with Donald Trump, and that's the game. But the truth is, this is a moment where we have to choose. We have to take definitive lines and it's starting to shape up. It's starting to happen, but everybody should have to take a position.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Inflation went up again in January, and there is growing pressure on the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates in order to cool down the economy.\u00a0 Mary Daly is president and CEO of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. Good morning.  FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO PRESIDENT MARY DALY: Good morning.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, we say consumer prices are at the highest level in 40 years. I mean, if you look at certain items like car prices, they're up more than 40 percent compared to where they were last year. Energy is up 27 percent. Bacon up 18 percent. I mean, you've said inflation is going to get worse before it gets better. What do consumers need to be bracing for and what needs to be done to get this under control?  DALY: So first, it is very true that inflation is too high and is really hitting the pocketbooks of average Americans across a wide range of categories. The Federal Reserve is actively focused on this. As you know, we've talked about changing our policy stance, raising rates as early as March, which would certainly be something I would support it barring any surprises. And that's really meant to take some of the accommodation out of the economy and help inflation come back down to a place where people don't have to worry about the price of bacon or the price of used cars. But as you know that we're not the only part of this puzzle. We also have to get supply chains repaired and we have to get back out of our homes after COVID and start talking about service consumption, not just goods consumption.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you do not favor a half a percent increase in interest rates in March. What do you favor?  DALY: So, I look at the data and I see that it is obvious that we need to pull some of the accommodation out of the economy. But history tells us with Fed policy that abrupt and aggressive action can actually have a destabilizing effect on the very growth and price stability we're trying to achieve. So, what I would favor is moving in March and then watching, measuring, being very careful about what we see ahead of us and then taking the next interest rate increase when it seems the best place to do that. And that could be in the next meeting, or it could be a meeting away. But either way, the most important thing is to be measured at our pace and importantly, data dependent.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Measured in your pace. The financial markets are anticipating six to seven rate hikes in the year ahead. Is that the kind of tempo you foresee?  DALY: Well, I think it's too early to call. Really, you want. I mean, you talk about it. We had the \u2013 we have Ukraine right now, geopolitical risk. We are just coming out of our homes after Omicron. We hope that the virus will stay at bay, but we have to watch. We have another print before the March meeting on both the employment, the jobs report and inflation. All of those things are very important because before we make any pronouncements about exactly what we'd be doing on this year, I think what every American wants to know and deserves to hear is that we're on this and we're going to take those data in and get the accommodation right sized for the economy.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I mean, one of your colleagues at the Kansas City Fed has said current monetary policy is out of sync with the economy. The Fed is still injecting some emergency support measures here that, you know, because of the pandemic. Can you continue to do this when inflation is at seven and a half percent? Is this just about rate hikes to something or need to happen?  DALY: That's a terrific question, and you're right, we are continuing to taper asset purchases, but those will be complete by the early March. And markets understand that we're just doing that to ensure that we have a predictable decline in our purchases, so we don't dislocate financial markets. If you look at financial markets, they've already priced in the removal of that part of our accommodation, that injection as you referred to it. And they've also priced in rate increases over the coming year. So, I think markets and households in all of my contacts in the business community that I speak to you regularly, they understand that the Fed is moving on the policy path and adjusting it so that we get it right sized for the economy we have.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned geopolitical risk. The Federal Reserve chair has mentioned the crisis in Eastern Europe as a potential risk. How should people at home understand that? I mean, the White House is vowing to wage financial war on Russia here. They're cautioning U.S. businesses to be prepared about potential blowback from cyber-attacks. How do you foresee this playing out?  DALY: Well, any time, as you know, that we have geopolitical risk, it creates uncertainty, and Americans are already facing quite a bit of uncertainty. uncertainty about when COVID is ever going to leave our shores. Uncertainty about how the economy is going. So, this is just another factor and uncertainty we know affects consumer sentiment and ultimately affects consumer demand. So, what I think businesses \u2013 I know businesses in my district are thinking about is cautious optimism. They're bullish on our U.S. economy. They're bullish on coming out of the pandemic strong. But they're also very aware that we're not out of concerns yet, and we have many things in our future that we have to balance.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, is that an argument against taking emergency action before March? Is that a prediction that energy prices, you know, how do you see the risk that we're facing right now?  DALY: So, I see risks on both sides, if we act to aggressively, then we could actually add to Americans uncertainty now they have to worry about whether the Fed is being too aggressive and if we act too slowly, then of course we we have accommodation that's too much for the economy. So that's why this balanced approach I we might look at it. I see March as an appropriate time to raise the interest rate, and then we have to take in all of the information that you've mentioned and make the right decision at the right time for the economy.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mary Daly, thank you very much for your analysis. Thank you. We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.

And today on Face the Nation: a winter whiteout in parts of New England, as a blizzard with hurricane-force winds rocks the Northeast.\u00a0 Plus, we will talk with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb about the new Omicron variant. How concerned should you be?\u00a0 Then: President Biden vows he will make good on his promise for an historic pick for the Supreme Court, as Justice Stephen Breyer announces his retirement. We will talk to two key players when it comes to the confirmation. South Carolinians Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Jim Clyburn will be with us.\u00a0 Overseas, Ukraine's president insists the showdown with Russia just isn't as dire as the U.S. and Europeans warned. We will have a report from Eastern Ukraine and check in with Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, and one of the Biden administration's top diplomats, Ambassador Victoria Nuland. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\u00a0 Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. There's a lot to get to today, but we begin with that massive winter storm that walloped the Northeast, bringing with it at least two feet of snow, hurricane-force winds and coastal flooding. Our Mola Lenghi reports from Boston -- Mola.\u00a0 MOLA LENGHI: Well, good morning, Margaret. It was a relentless and historic single-day snowstorm here in Boston. There was more snow here yesterday than the city averages the entire month of January. Throughout Massachusetts, plows faced whiteout conditions, as the rate of the blinding snowfall made it a challenge for those cleanup crews to keep up. Now, the storm also whipped up waves Saturday, battering the entire New England coastline. Images from space show the bomb cyclone bearing down on the Northeast, dumping more than two feet of snow. Winds gusted as high as 83 miles per hour on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. A couple hundred thousand homes and businesses lost power in the state, and tens of thousands are still without power today. A majority of flights, thousands of them, were canceled at major airports in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. Now, this morning, the snow has finally let up, but we're not yet in the clear, with much of the region now digging out and concerned about a deep freeze.\u00a0 The entire Eastern Seaboard was somehow, some way impacted by this storm system, as far south as Florida, which felt freezing temperatures. Now, plows are working on the roads again this morning. They continue to do that, trying to clear them, not only for the utility crews that have to restore power, but also getting them ready for the Monday morning work and school commutes -- Margaret.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mola Lenghi in Boston, thank you. We turn now to the COVID-19 pandemic, where, despite a decline in hospitalizations and new cases, deaths are still rising, and the virus is still highly transmissible. Community spread is in the high range across the country, and a new variant of Omicron has raised new concerns. Mark Strassmann reports.\u00a0 (Begin VT)\u00a0 MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): Finally, a COVID update not steeped in dread.\u00a0 JEFF ZIENTS (White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator): We continue to move toward a time when COVID won't disrupt our daily lives, a time when COVID is no longer a crisis.\u00a0 MARK STRASSMANN: New COVID cases down sharply, hospitalizations down encouragingly, but Omicron's overall milder impact comes with a qualifier:\u00a0 DR. ROCHELLE WALENSKY (CDC Director): Milder does not mean mild. And we cannot look past the strain on our health systems and substantial number of deaths.\u00a0 MARK STRASSMANN: A wintry sorrow. We're now averaging 2,300 COVID deaths a day, many preventable.\u00a0 WOMAN: We have been trying to scream at the top of our lungs to say how bad it is.\u00a0 MARK STRASSMANN: Roughly 100 million eligible Americans have yet to get fully vaccinated.\u00a0 GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE (R-Ohio): We have done everything that we could. Ultimately, the decision does come back down to the individual, what choice they want to make.  MARK STRASSMANN: After two months of runaway infections, Omicron is generally relaxing its headlock on American life. Only nine states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, still require indoor masking, regardless of vaccination status. San Francisco will ease its mask mandate starting Tuesday. And, in Roanoke, Virginia:\u00a0 MAN: It's time to stop refusing parents their right to parent.\u00a0 MARK STRASSMANN: The school board agreed. Masking is optional starting next month. But day care centers remain worrisome, with kids too young for vaccines. The CDC's new guidance: Providers should get boosted and tested at least once a week.\u00a0 (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Something to keep an eye on, a new subvariant nicknamed Stealth Omicron.Detected in roughly half the states, preliminary findings show it's even more contagious. This truly is the virus that wouldn't leave -- Margaret.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann, thank you. We go now to former FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who made it out of the snowstorm in Connecticut and down here to Washington, D.C. this morning. That is dedication, doctor. Thank you.\u00a0 DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thank you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: There is a new variant of concern BA2. The CDC says it's already here in the United States. How concerned do we need to be? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: You know, the question is, does this change the decision space? I don't think it does. I don't think it really changes the narrative. It maybe, perhaps extends the tail on the decline that we're seeing across the country. There's some critical questions. Is it more contagious? It appears to be more contagious. Data out of Denmark from the Serum Institute suggests it's about 1.5 times more contagious than the strain of Omicron that has made it around the US\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: which is already so transmissible. DR. GOTTLIEB: Exactly. Does it evade our immune system? Does it evade the immunity that we've acquired from Omicron infection or the vaccines? Most of the evidence so far, it's preliminary, suggests it does. And in fact, there's data out of the U.K. that suggests that a fully boosted person may be more protected against this new variant than they were against the original strain of Omicron. And then the final question is, is it more virulent? Is it more dangerous? And so far, based on what we've seen out of Denmark and the U.K., which are collecting very good data on this, it doesn't appear to be a more virulent strain. MARGARET BRENNAN: So if you had Omicron, can you be reinfected with this version? DR. GOTTLIEB: You should be protected. So the mutations in this new version are not in the receptor binding domain on the spike protein. That's the portion of the spike protein that we develop our best antibodies against that neutralize the virus. Most of the mutations are in a separate part of the spike protein called the N-terminal domain. So if you had Omicron infection, you should have protection against subsequent infection from this new variant. That's why I don't think this is going to create a huge wave of infection. What's likely to happen is as we were coming down, and coming down quite sharply in parts of the Northeast, Florida, the mid-Atlantic, you might see as this new strain starts to pick up, you might see that we start to slow down in that decline, but the decline will happen nonetheless. Right now, it represents probably about five percent of infections in the US, and we have so much Omicron immunity that's probably going to be a backstop against this really taking off. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you know, we've talked about it there every time that there is an infection, these child care centers have to shut down. That creates practical problems for parents who want to go out and participate in the economy. They want to show up for work. I mean, this is a drag for the country. The CDC issued new guidance to child care centers. It recommended toddlers remain masked. It lowered the recommendation for isolation post-infection to about five days. Is this prudent? Is this good health policy along with economic policy? DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, I think they're doing all they can do, but the guidance really focuses on trying to prevent spread within the daycare center. I think we need to focus a little bit more attention on trying to prevent introduction into those settings, because once you get an infection in that setting it's hard to control. You know, you've got kids who don't wear masks very well. I think it's hard to ask a two or three year old to wear a mask. Even if you keep them in social pods, they're going to play together, so it's hard to control transmission within that setting. I think we should be focusing more on trying to keep the infection out in the first place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but to that point, and you know, because I ask you almost every week because my own kids can't get vaccinated, that that's just going to continue to be a risk right until the youngest children, four and under can get a vaccine. So this portion of the puzzle, and if a vaccine is greenlit for the youngest Americans, does it unlock everything else? Does this start to move us back to normal? DR. GOTTLIEB: I don't think it unlocks everything else for a couple of reasons. Number one, a lot of- we're seeing a lot of parents with young kids aren't getting their kids vaccinated. Only about 25 percent of kids five to 11 have been vaccinated. It's been very disappointing. About 18 percent have been fully vaccinated. So I suspect that there's going to be some hesitation with the youngest kids as well. We can't fully explain it. Also, while the vaccines prevent infection, so a fully boosted adult has probably a 50 percent lower chance of getting infected in the first place with that vaccine. They're not- They're not 90 percent protective and probably in the younger kids, they're going to be a little less protective against infection. So you're still going to see kids be able to get infected even if they're vaccinated. What the vaccine is going to do is protect them from bad outcomes. And we've seen a lot of bad outcomes with kids. There is some indication if you listen to federal health officials that they may be rethinking the vaccine in zero- in six months to four years old. And I'm hopeful that you could see some movement on trying to entertain that application earlier. Ultimately, the decision resides with FDA, but there is some indication that there may be an early reaction on that application. MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Fauci said this week the best- that it would be a three dose regimen for the youngest. You said best case would be March. Are you sticking with that? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, if the- if federal health officials in the agency decide to authorize this on the basis of two doses, it could be out much sooner. And I think the decision matrix has changed around the vaccine for six months to four year olds. And so far as we know that the vaccine isn't as protective at preventing infection. Previously, we had data showing that the childhood vaccine for four- six months to four years wasn't as protective against infection as the adult vaccine. That's the reason why they pushed it out and asked for that third dose, but now, if the goal of the vaccine is to get baseline immunity in the kids to prevent really bad outcomes, and you're really not using the vaccine as a tool to prevent infection in the first place, two doses could do that. Getting two doses into a child can provide baseline immunity that protects them from severe disease from hospitalization. And I think that may be why federal health officials are rethinking this if in fact they decide to authorize this on the basis of two doses. It could be out much sooner, perhaps as early as early March. MARGARET BRENNAN: That could be a big development. We mentioned there, our Mark Strassmann was reporting on San Francisco being the first major city to roll back its indoor mask mandate. Here in D.C. that just extended it to the end of February, at least. Is there a clear benchmark yet for when health measures should be lifted? DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, this is going to be a real challenge. So right now you look at a lot of federal health guidance, and it says that these measures should be lifted when there's low prevalence. The CDC defines low prevalence as 10 cases per 100,000 people per day. That was the old measure in the age of Omicron, with a much more contagious variant and with the fact that the population has a lot of immunity, so we're less susceptible overall, we may need to rethink that. We may need to decide that once we get to 20 cases per 100,000 per day, that may be the point at which we start to withdraw these things. I'm not so sure we're going to get to 10 anytime soon. Right now, Washington, D.C. is at 50, New York's at 75. With this new homegrown strain that's circulating, we may stall out around 20, and that may be the point where we have to consider withdrawing a lot of these measures. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, Dr. Gottlieb, thank you so much.\u00a0 DR. GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot. Good to see you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to see you in person. And FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden has promised to name a black woman to replace Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. Contenders include Ketanji Brown Jackson of Washington, D.C., Leondra Kruger of California, and Michelle Childs of South Carolina. The only potential nominee that the White House has publicly acknowledged being under consideration is Childs.\u00a0 South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham joins us from Clemson, South Carolina, this morning. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, coming up on this program, Congressman Jim Clyburn, he has said repeatedly in interviews that South Carolina Federal District Judge Michelle Childs, not only as someone he likes, but that both South Carolina Republican senators will support her. So he's talking about you. Did you tell him you're a yes vote on Childs? SEN. GRAHAM: Here's what I'll tell him and the nation, I- I can't think of a better person for President Biden to consider for the Supreme Court than Michelle Childs. She has wide support in our state. She's considered to be a fair minded, highly gifted jurist. She's one of the most decent people I've ever met. It would be good for the court to have somebody who's not at Harvard or Yale. She's a graduate of the University of South Carolina, a public education background. She's been a workers comp judge. She's highly qualified. She's a good character. And we'll see how she does if she's nominated. But I cannot say anything bad about Michelle Childs. She is an awesome person. MARGARET BRENNAN: That- that sounds like pretty close to yes. You're a yes vote? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, what I don't know if she's going to be nominated\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. GRAHAM: if she's nominated, she will not be treated like Judge Kavanaugh, I promise you, by Republicans. Let's see how she does at the hearing. But I think I've made it pretty clear that I'm a big admirer of\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, you did\u2013 SEN. GRAHAM: Judge Charles. And I'd like to see the court have- a have a lot more balance, some common sense on it. Everybody doesn't have to be from Harvard, Yale\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. GRAHAM: It's okay to go to a public university and get your law degree. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have been glowing in your descriptions, but your colleague, Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, said picking a female black Supreme Court justice is affirmative racial discrimination. He questioned her- any potential impartiality from any of the candidates named. Nikki Haley of South Carolina also tweeted the president should not have a race or gender litmus test. President Reagan promised to nominate a woman, Sandra Day O'Connor. So why is this different? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, it's not different to me. Put me in the camp of making sure the court and other institutions look like America. You know, we make a real effort as Republicans to recruit women and people of color to make the party look more like America. Affirmative action is picking somebody not as well qualified for past wrongs. Michelle qual- Childs is incredibly qualified. There's no affirmative action component if you pick her. She is highly qualified. And President Reagan said running for office that he wanted to put the first female on the court. Whether you like it or not, Joe Biden said, I'm going to pick an African-American woman to serve on the Supreme Court. I believe there are plenty of qualified African-American women, conservative and liberal, that could go onto the court. So I don't concede- I don't see Michelle Childs as an act of affirmative action. I do see putting a black woman on the court, making the court more like America. In the history of our country, we've only had five women serve and two African-American men, so let's make the court more like America. But qualifications have to be the- the- the biggest consideration. And as to Michelle Childs, I think she's qualified\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. SEN. GRAHAM: by every measure. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator, I want to move on to Ukraine. Senator Menendez, Democrat, on another program this morning, said they're nearing bipartisan agreement on a package of sanctions, some of which would put sanctions on Russia now, some later. I know you're part of the talks. I know you want sanctions now. So what exactly are you pushing for? What needs to be hit? SEN. GRAHAM: More. More against Russia, more for Ukraine. There's bipartisan support to sanction Russia now. They're dismembering the Ukraine by the invasion- the threat of invasion. It's 2022, for God's sake. You can't get your way by threatening to invade a country. So, punish Putin now more, weapons to the Ukraine now so they can defend themselves, more economic aid to the Ukrainian economy so they can- they can deal with the threat of invasion and more troops to NATO. As Putin tries to dismantle NATO and divide NATO, I support President Biden's decision to send more troops in to reinforce NATO. He's trying to destroy a neighboring democracy. He hates democracy- Putin. And I will just say this to President Putin. If you invade the Ukraine, you will destroy the ability of future presidents to treat you and Russia as normal. You'll long for the good old days of the Cold War because every president in the future will pound you and every Congress in the future will pound you if you dismantle this democracy. So be careful what you wish for, my friend. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, strong words there. We know President Biden is already looking at sanctions after an invasion. He's looking at sovereign debt sales, hitting oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin, the banks that handle critical industries and- on top of export import restrictions. Is this enough or are you saying you're pushing President Biden further? SEN. GRAHAM: The bipartisan working group will submit sanctions now. Look what Putin has done. He's dismantled\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: On what specifically, though? SEN. GRAHAM: he's hurting the- Oh, an array of pre-invasion sanctions, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is a cash cow for Putin, that'll probably be after the invasion, knocking them out of financial systems that they will need to conduct business normally, the Swift program. All of this is on the table, but the\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: European allies don't support that. SEN. GRAHAM: It is 20. Well, the Congress has a different view here. I want sanctions on Putin's behavior now. What is Putin doing? He's threatening- he's warning to get his way by threatening it to invade a country. This is 2022, for God's sake. That's not the way to resolve disputes. So, I think there'll be bipartisan support for sanctions now. There'd be a bipartisan support for more- more lethal aid now to the Ukraine, more economic assistance for the government now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. GRAHAM: And I think there's bipartisan support to reinforce NATO. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, well, in your version of a bill, what would trigger invasion? Right? Because there's an array of options Vladimir Putin's looking at. Does a cyberattack trigger sanctions? SEN. GRAHAM: A cyber attack against the United States would be an act of war, and we shall respond in kind. I am tired of Putin, China and North Korea attacking us. If they blew up a pipeline that would be an act of war. Well, if you shut it down through a cyber attack, it's the same outcome. MARGARET BRENNAN: But a cyberattack in Ukraine? SEN. GRAHAM: My Russian friends- Yeah. Well, any- any attack on the sovereignty of a nation, any attack on their critical infrastructure, any attack on their ability to do business. But he needs to be sanctioned now. What is he done? He's using the threat of force of arms to get his way. That should be outlawed in 2022. Listen, I want to support President Biden to the- to the full extent possible, but the Congress is ready to sanction Putin now. But there will be more sanctions come if he invades. And I will end with this point: If you invade the Ukraine, if Russia invades the Ukraine, no future president, no future Congress\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. GRAHAM: will give you a pass. It will change the relationship forever. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, more than 730 people have been charged by the Justice Department for their role in the attack on the Capitol on January 6th to stop\u2013 SEN. GRAHAM: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: the certification of our election. Last night, President Trump, at a rally, said this. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6th fairly. And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons because they are being treated so unfairly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Pardons? Do you agree? SEN. GRAHAM: No, I don't want to send any signal that it was OK to defile the Capitol. There are other groups with causes that may want to go down to the violent path that these people get pardoned. MARGARET BRENNAN: But isn't that a dangerous thing to say? SEN. GRAHAM: Kamala Harris- Yeah. Well, I think it's inappropriate. I- I don't want to reinforce that defiling the Capitol was OK. I don't want to do anything that would make this more likely in the future. And just let me finish my thought here. When Kamala Harris and her associates and the people that work for her, her staffers, raised money to bail out the rioters who hit cops in the head and burned down stores. I didn't like that either. So I don't want to do anything from raising bail to pardoning people who take the law into their own hands because it will make more violence more likely. I want to deter people who did what\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SEN. GRAHAM: on January the 6th. And those who did it, I hope they go to jail and get the book thrown at them because they deserve it. MARGARET BRENNAN: That was clear, Senator, before I let you go, I want to ask you. The District Attorney in Georgia has- in Fulton County has gotten clearance to set up a grand jury to investigate President Trump. She says she wants to talk to you about that phone call you made to Georgia's secretary of state ten days after the election, are you going to cooperate? SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah give me a call. Yeah, I talked- I asked about how the system worked when it came to mail in voting- balloting. The January 6 committee was not the 911 committee. After 911, we came together, we formed a bipartisan committee after the next election-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I was talking about Georgia though. SEN. GRAHAM: So what's going on Georgia and the January 6th- Yeah. I know, but there's an effort here to use the law, I think inappropriately. So I don't know what they're going to do in Fulton County. I don't know what the Jan. 6 committee is going to do. I expect those who defile the Capitol to be prosecuted. But there's a political movement using the law to try to knock Trump out of running. And I, particularly, don't like it or appreciate it. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, Senator, thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back with Congressman James Clyburn.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Democratic Whip Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina. Good morning to you Congressmen. You've been vocal in your endorsement of Federal District Judge Michelle Childs the White House acknowledged she's being looked at. Senator Graham just gave her a glowing recommendation. Have you spoken to President Biden about her?\u00a0 HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP JIM CLYBURN: Yes, I did it several months ago. I have not spoken to him recently about her, sent him or sent the White House a letter 13 months ago.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0 REP. CLYBURN: And he and I have been talking about it for several months. MARGARET BRENNAN: You and I are going to talk about her and the whole process more in just a moment. But I have to hit this quick commercial break and we'll have an extended conversation on the other side of it. So stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We continue our conversation with Democratic Whip, Congressman James Clyburn of South Carolina. Good morning. Thank you for sticking with us through that break. HOUSE MAJORITY WHIP JIM CLYBURN: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: You had just shared that you'd spoken to President Biden months ago with Michelle Childs, a candidate we know for this potential spot on the Supreme Court. More broadly, you were the man who really exacted this promise during the campaign from President Biden. What do you think putting this kind of diversity on the court the first black woman does for the country? REP. CLYBURN: Well, it says to every little child up there growing up under moderate circumstances, needing the entire community help raise it, getting scholarships to go up to school because she couldn't afford to go otherwise, going to public schools because you didn't get an offer from one of the big private schools. It says to them, you've got just as much of a chance to benefit from the greatness of this country as everybody else. As you probably know, I have made it the motto of my service; making America's greatness accessible and affordable for all Americans. And that's what this will do. That's the kind of conversation I had with candidate Biden way back when he was running for president. In fact, we had those conversations when he was serving as vice president that he came up under modest circumstances- Scranton, Pennsylvania, then in Delaware. And look, he should have as much opportunity as everybody else.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REP. CLYBURN: That's one of the things that drawed me to him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know the president has said he will make his pick public by the end of February. That fits right nicely with that March 1st State of the Union address. As Whip, what else are you going to be able to deliver to the president to- to sort of announce that date? Can you revive any portion of build back better, which is completely stalled at the moment. REP. CLYBURN: I hope we can. It's possible the opponents of the big package have talked about things that they can support. For instance, child tax credit. Joe Manchin has made it very clear that if we were to meet- make it means tested that he could agree to it. So that's the means test it. He's already said that he agrees with us closing the so-called coverage gap, so that those people who are eligible for Medicaid or in states that cannot- did not expand the Medicaid, that they will have health care. So if we can do those things, let's do them. I'm not- MARGARET BRENNAN: By March 1st?\u00a0 REP. CLYBURN: I'm sorry? MARGARET BRENNAN: By March 1st?\u00a0 REP. CLYBURN: Yes, we can do that by March 1st. You can do it next week. We go back all this week. We go back on Tuesday. What I'm talking about could be done in several days, if not several hours. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be watching for that. I want to ask you about something REP. CLYBURN:I didn't say I was going to be done. (LAUGHTER) It can be done. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will watch you to see if it actually will be done, sir. You've repeatedly said that black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party. And you've talked about this Supreme Court nomination as the kind of things that Democrats may need. You know, the failure to get voting rights legislation passed, the failure to agree on a police reform bill. Do you feel that Democrats need this nomination and that it will make a difference going into the midterms, given these other promises were not delivered on? REP. CLYBURN: As- I certainly do believe that. I believed that two years ago, it is why I advised then Candidate Biden to put that into his campaign. And you recall the first time he ever said that was at the South Carolina debate the 25th of February- MARGARET BRENNAN: I remember I was there.\u00a0 REP. CLYBURN - 0f 2020. OK. Well, I advised that. Now a lot of people told him not to do it. But his guts told him as he told me, when you grow up with the kind of experience the two of us have had, then your guts telling you some things, and sometimes people did not have those experiences they would not feel. So he did it, and it made all the difference in the world and it's still making a big difference. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, talking about those midterms and the need for a win here, I want to ask you about Jamie Harrison, the head of the Democratic Party, right now. I know he worked for you for years on Capitol Hill. You're close to him. You're a mentor. He's reportedly considering leaving that job ahead of the midterm races because of disagreements with the White House. Do you think the DNC needs new leadership? REP. CLYBURN: I do not. I think he is exactly what we need for this party at this particular juncture. I also know he like all of us in this business. He has his detractors. I have mine. It doesn't mean that he is wrong or they are wrong. It means that people have different approaches to doing things. And so Jamie Harrison is there. He will never run. He believes in fighting rather than switching. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are being very diplomatic in your answer there. Back in November, you told the AP, \"Jaime Harrison knows how to do the job. I fear he may not be allowed to do the job. He's being hamstrung by people who never ran for anything.\" Who are those people whose standing in his way? REP. CLYBURN: I'm not going to name those people, I think it's not- MARGARET BRENNAN:Is it the White House? REP. CLYBURN: No, I'm not saying who it is, I am saying that all of us, I had the same problem every time I run for election, talking to my grandson just yesterday, telling me what he thought I ought to do now. I said now, when is the last time you've been out asking anybody for their vote? So we do not necessarily believe in all of the consultants and the people who run things. Jamie Harrison ran a very bruising race with the gentleman you just had on here. He knows what it is to run. He knows what it is to lose. And I'm the same way I lost three times before I got elected. So I know what it is to lose an election and I know what is to come back from the election. So Jamie Harrison is just what we need. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, congressman, thank you for your time today. REP. CLYBURN Thank you very much for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back in a moment.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Turning now to the tensions in Ukraine. The diplomatic back and forth continues, and NATO allies are considering sending more troops to the region. This as Moscow continues to ship weapons and equipment. Holly Williams is near Donbas (Sp?), close to the front lines.\u00a0 HOLLY WILLIAMS: Good morning. Here in eastern Ukraine, people do not seem to be panicking, and perhaps that's because they've been living with Russian aggression for years. But they are making preparations for a possible Russian invasion.\u00a0 (BEGIN VT)\u00a0 HOLLY WILLIAMS (voice over): More Russian fighter jets arrived in Belarus this week on Ukraine's northern border. Moscow says for military exercises next month. That's when President Biden believes there's a distinct possibility Russia could invade. The secretary of defense warned of unconventional tactics, like staged incidents that Russia could use as a pretext to move in.\u00a0 LLOYD AUSTIN, SECRETARY OF DEFENSE: This is straight out of the Russian playbook. And they're not fooling us.\u00a0 HOLLY WILLIAMS: With tensions reaching a crescendo, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, laid a wreath for the fallen during the Second World War. Russia still maintains it has no plans to invade its neighbor, but that doesn't explain the roughly 100,000 Russian troops amassed on Ukraine's border, while Russia military drills on land and at sea have set off alarm bells. Experts say they've previously been a prelude to an incursion.\u00a0 LLOYD AUSTIN: And Mr. Putin can do the right thing as well. There's no reason that this situation has to devolve into conflict. He can choose to de-escalate.\u00a0 HOLLY WILLIAMS: There are 8,500 American troops on heightened alert. NATO says it's sending more fighter jets and ships to reinforce eastern Europe. And plane loads of military equipment have been arriving in in Kyiv, including Javelin anti-tank missiles.\u00a0 (END VT)\u00a0 HOLLY WILLIAMS: Ukraine's government is not ruling out an escalation, but continues to urge calm. The country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, accused other world leaders of sowing panic late last week and putting Ukraine's economy at risk. Margaret.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0Holly Williams, thank you. We're now joined by Oksana Markarova, Ukraine's ambassador to the United States. Good morning to you, Ambassador. Thank you for being here. AMBASSADOR OKSANA MARKAROVA: Good morning. Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, says he hasn't seen a military buildup like this since the Cold War: Artillery, ballistic missiles, ground air forces. He said the impact would be horrific if Russia uses these. But President Zelensky stood up and said Russia may simply be applying psychological pressure. Why is your president downplaying the risk? AMB. MARKAROVA: We are not downplaying the risk. We actually see the situation the same way and we see the build up and we also know what Russia is capable of because they have attacked us already. Since 2014, for eight years, we are at war and we are defending our country. At the same time, in order to defend our country, we cannot afford to panic. We have to get ready. All of us, not only our military, our very capable military and veterans, but also all civilians. So we know and we see what's going on. This is the reality with which we live for eight years. This is the reality of this recent escalation since April. So we monitor it. We assess it. We share the information with our friends and allies. We're very grateful for the United States, for very strong relations, strong relations and strong response this time. MARGARET BRENNAN: But your president said Ukraine's grateful for support, but I can't be like other politicians who are grateful to the United States just for being the United States. What does he mean by that? Because it sounds a lot like there's some friction here. AMB. MARKAROVA: There is no friction. I mean, look, we can have some discussions and we can have difference of opinions. But United States is our strategic partner, and I would even say strategic friend, number one. Our relations, especially during the last year, has been at the highest level ever, I would say in 30 years. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the White House says- they issued a statement: \"At the same time, President Zelensky is downplaying the risk of invasion, he's asking for hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to defend against one. \"We think it's important to be open and candid about that threat.\" AMB. MARKAROVA: We are open and candid and we are discussing it with our partners here. Again, we just cannot afford to panic. So we're preparing for any options. And again, as I said, we know what Russians are capable of, But let's be very clear here, we know who aggressor is and everyone knows who aggressor is. It's Russia. With the United States, especially and with other partners and allies, we may have difference of opinions on when to introduce sanctions, we may have difference of opinions on some issues, but those are friendly, open and candid discussions\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: You do\u2013\u00a0 AMB. MARKAROVA: and we really value this. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to understand what you need now. What are you asking the White House for? AMB. MARKAROVA: It's the same we have been asking for eight years, but especially this year, you know, strong three levels of deterrence: political, economic and military defensive. So strong political messages. And we're very glad that this year U.S. is actually taking active role in negotiations. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're in terms of what you're asking U.S. taxpayers for. The chairman of your parliament wrote a letter to eight senators, including one of them on this program, asking for air defense, anti-ship, anti-armor capabilities, flexible loans, financing mechanisms. Is this a formal request from your government? Is what the White House giving you not sufficient? AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, if you look at the statement by our presidents when they met in the White House, you will see a number of these issues in the joint statement. You will also see it in the framework agreement that we signed. So we are merely discussing what we already agreed with the United States, and we are discussing how to implement it MARGARET BRENNAN: To be very clear, you are asking Congress and you were asking the White House to put sanctions on Russia right now not to wait for an invasion. Is that right? MARKAROVA: We ask both. Russia is there. Russia illegally occupied Crimea. Russia illegally occupies together with their controlled people, parts of Donetsk and Luhansk territories, and they didn't change their behavior during the eight years. So yes, we believe the basis for sanctions is there. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 You told me before you think a cyber attack will proceed any military action? What exactly are you preparing for? Because the US is warning this could have global impact. AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, in addition to military attacks, we experience it since 2014 and especially now, Russia engages in cyber attacks or kind of hybrid war, cyber disinformation, all kinds of information campaigns. Recently, couple of weeks ago, a number of Ukrainian ministers have been attacked and defaced. The attack has been wider than that, and our security sources, together with our partners from the U.S., are looking at that particular attack. But it's one of many. We are under constant attack, especially in the cyberspace. And we're trying everything possible and doing everything possible to strengthen our capabilities there as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying the war has already started. AMB. MARKAROVA: In 2014, when Crimea has been attacked and when Crimea has been illegally occupied or annexed, as Russia says, that has been the start of the war. MARGARET BRENNAN: So if Vladimir Putin does launch a further attack on Ukraine, do you believe he will stop there? AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, the reason why Putin attacked us is not because he wants Ukraine, or only Ukraine. The reason he attacked us is because we have chosen to be a democracy and we have the Euro-Atlantic and European aspirations. So it's an attack on democracy, and I believe nobody is safe if Ukraine will be attacked. We do not want to be part of the Soviet Union or the Russian Empire or the Russian Federation. We want to be sovereign, we are sovereign and we are fighting for our independence. And if Ukraine will be further attacked by Russia, of course they will not stop in Ukraine- after Ukraine. So that's why it's in the interest of Europe and all democratic world to help us to defend ourselves, but also to show that the international rule of law still works. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Ambassador, thank you very much for your time today. AMB. MARKAROVA: Thank you and thank you to all your viewers and all American people for support. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Victoria Nuland, the State Department undersecretary for political affairs. Good morning to you, ambassador. AMBASSADOR VICTORIA NULAND: Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We heard from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs this week that Russia has given itself the capability if it wanted for a full invasion, not just an incursion. What is the US assessment at this point? Has Vladimir Putin made a decision on what to do next? AMB. NULAND: Margaret, we don't believe he's yet made a decision, but as he has done in the past, he's given himself every option, including, as the chairman said, a massive potential invasion of all of Ukraine, including cyber attacks, including incursion from Belarus, where he is moving up to thirty thousand troops there as well. So we have to be prepared for all options. MARGARET BRENNAN: So there is no sign yet of any kind of de-escalation. AMB. NULAND: On the contrary, he's moved more forces since we've been encouraging him to de-escalate. That said, Margaret, as you know, we did send our diplomatic proposal to Russia, as did NATO this week. We've heard some signs that the Russians are interested in engaging on that proposal, including the fact that Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Lavrov will likely speak this week. So again, here's, here's where we are. We want to settle these issues through diplomacy, through arms control. Putin's given himself that option, but he's also given himself the option of a major invasion. So we have to be ready for that, too. MARGARET BRENNAN: How significant is the risk that Russia may deploy tactical nuclear weapons to to the border? Is there any indication of that type of buildup? AMB. NULAND: We have not seen nuclear weapons move. There have been some loose talk from folks in Russia. But as you know, Russia already has tactical tactical nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad and elsewhere that can range Europe. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, exactly. I think that's an important point to make to show the potential of this kind of conflict. Can you sort of put in perspective what the strategy is here? Because President Biden has said he's not sending combat troops to Ukraine. He's talking about moving potentially a small number of troops into allied countries in the region. Is this about containing the threat from becoming a regional war? AMB. NULAND: Well, first of all, Margaret, with regard to the diplomatic proposal, you know, Putin put forward and publicly all of the things that he's interested in. Our response and NATO's response agrees to engage him on many of these things that you've talked about. We have said, let's talk about the medium and short range missiles, the threat you feel from us, the threat we feel from you. Let's talk about how we can de-escalate, with regard to exercises, with regard to military deployments, let's have that conversation on a reciprocal basis. But we also have to prepare, as I said. So what we've been doing is first, given Ukraine the kinds of defensive lethal equipment that they need in order to be able to make this if Russia makes that big mistake and moves in a very bloody fight and slow Moscow's role. So defensive lethal equipment like anti-tank, like anti-air, all of these kinds of things. We have also worked with our European allies on a massive package of economic sanctions so that if he does move on Ukraine, he will feel it acutely, as will the Russian people in terms of their economy. It will have a crushing blow on them, and we are also preparing within NATO's territory because obviously we have a sacred and sovereign responsibility to protect our NATO allies and with the kind of forces that he's moving. They are coming also closer to the borders of our Baltic allies Poland, Romania, Hungary, so we have to be ready. MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Ukraine's President Zelensky said Friday that his country is aware of these risks, but they don't want panic. Do you feel that is what the White House is doing here? Have you resolved this kind of friction with the Ukrainians? You don't want to have divide with an ally here. AMB. NULAND: Panic is not a policy, as one of my bosses once said, what we need to do is prudent planning, and that's what we are doing. That's what our NATO allies are doing. That's what we are encouraging Ukraine to do as well. So, you know, given that Putin has made these moves before, even as we encourage diplomacy, we have to be ready for the worst. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it appears that the Senate is also nearing a bipartisan agreement on a package of sanctions, some of which would hit Russia. Now some post administrate... post-invasion. The administration has wanted to wait and hold on to sanctions as leverage. Will the president veto this bill? I mean, what would the impact be? AMB. NULAND: We are working intensively with the Congress on this piece of legislation that we expect will be very well aligned with what we are also building with our NATO allies and partners. I would say that one of the strengths of U.S. policy vis-a-vis Ukraine going back some 30 years, but particularly in this instance, has been that we've had a really strong bipartisan approach to supporting Ukraine. We've had members of Congress out there regularly over the last couple of weeks. But with regard to this package of sanctions, you know, deterrence is best when there's a little bit of strategic ambiguity around exactly what we are going to do. So we've said financial measures, we've said export controls, we've said new sanctions on Russian elites. But if we put them on the table now, then Russia will be able to start mitigating and that doesn't make any sense to us. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Nuland, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0 (ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

Good morning to you. REP. MICHAEL MCCAUL (R-TX): Good morning. Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lots to decipher with you. But first, I want to start on what we just heard from the chairman. Has that seemed fairly extraordinary what he just laid out? He says that there is reason to believe, and the committee has possession of documents about this plot, essentially to seize voting machines that involve members of the military that they have already been in touch with the former attorney general. What is your reaction to this? REP. MCCAUL: Well, you know my reaction, it was a dark day, Jan.6, I want the truth to come out. I think this committee has been somewhat politicized. But the truth should come out, and I think the Department of Justice has been conducting an investigation. I worked at the DOJ for almost 15 years, and I trust their trust investigation- I in fact called upon them to investigate this, so I'm hopeful that the truth will come out on this. The allegations are very serious. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I do know that you are endorsed by the former President Trump. So, this has to be a little uncomfortable to hear these kinds of allegations. REP. MCCAUL: I've- of course, I mean, when the executive- commander in chief and these are allegations, I don't think the executive order was ever followed through with\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Right, It was a draft, but it was discussed in the Oval Office. REP. MCCAUL: \u2013 Right. I think it should come out the truth, obviously. I always say it. The truth should come out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will continue to watch the committee on that point on Russia. You heard the secretary say that if he uses the leverage of sanctions now, he gives up an important bit of deterrence. Do you disagree? REP. MCCAUL: I completely disagree. I think this has been a passive deterrence, right? I don't. I don't see Putin changing his course of action. It's getting very aggressive. The noose is tightening around Ukraine. President Zelensky, as you mentioned, said he wants the sanctions now. We can always remove the sanctions if it deters Putin's bad behavior, but if you reward that and there are no consequences, it's going to continue. And I think all along, there are so many things we can be doing to provide deterrence if we don't do this, MARGARET. The plan of action that I've seen in the classified space, as well as very specific, very aggressive, is timetable. If we don't do something strong right now, I'm afraid that he's going to invade Ukraine, which will have, as- as the secretary talked about, he's right and I think you and I did. It will have global ramifications here. MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed the secretary on that, he twice said that the US is going after Russian agents in Ukraine. Is the US doing something now that the rest of us just don't know about? Or is he just talking about sanctions? REP. MCCAUL: Well, we know that the Brits released this intelligence report that the Russians are trying to depose Zelensky and put their own leader. We know that they're right on the border with Belarus, they're going to do joint exercises with precision weapons and aircraft. We know that Kiev is right- Kiev is right there. I think there are three forces one Kiev, one on the Donbass and the other one Black Sea Crimea. This is a buildup we've never seen before. And if with no deterrence, it's going to happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's take a break and continue to talk about this on the other side of it. So, congressman, please stay here. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION, we continue our conversation now with Congressman Michael McCaul, the lead Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Let's pick back up on the issue of Russia. We're talking about immediate action, potentially. Congress is going away for a week. There are bills before the Senate. I know you're working on one in the House. I mean, do you have that kind of time to play with legislation or do you need something in terms of a tool set to hand the president more quickly? REP. MCCAUL: Well, time is of the essence. I'm working on a bill I've introduced to get- we're getting key Democrats on board. It would be a-a-a assistance package of lethal aid to Ukraine. That's important. But what's also important is the message of deterrence. We need joint exercises in Poland, the Baltic states, Romania, Bulgaria to show Putin that we're serious. Right now. He doesn't see we're serious and that's why the buildup is taking place. I think this all started, MARGARET, with Afghanistan and the unconditional surrender to the Taliban when he saw weakness, weakness invites aggression. We saw that with Chamberlain and Hitler. You know, Reagan talked about peace through strength. And right now, whether- and-and the thing is, this is not just about Ukraine. It's about China. It's about President Xi and Taiwan. It's about the Ayatollah and the bomb. It's about North Korea that just fired off two missiles, they said, were, you know, these, you know, these hypersonic weapons. I think this has broader global ramifications. We're seen as weak right now be-because of President Biden, his-his comments about a limited- a limited invasion was somehow acceptable, and that NATO was divided. I think one thing he said was true is that NATO is divided, and that's- Putin's goal is to divide and weaken NATO. He's accomplished some of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as you know, I mean, this has been going on since 2014 and during the Trump administration, there was some accommodation, at least in language from the former president on- on whether or not there were hard lines. So, Vladimir Putin has been getting kind of a mixed message for some time here. How do you change that when President Biden and you just heard Sec. Blinken send that message that they're willing to have reciprocal restrictions on military exercises or on placement of missiles? Is that kind of accommodation weakness to you? REP. MCCAUL: Well, you know, like let's talk about Nord Stream 2, biggest concession ever. You know\u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the potential gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. REP. MCCAUL: It's, you know, Putin's pipeline into Europe. Congress passed bipartisan mandatory sanctions to stop that from happening. We have a presidential waiver, that's very normal. We never dreamed that the President of the United States would waive that in the national interest of the United States. How is that in the interest of the United States to allow Putin to dominate Europe's energy supply? and then at the same time, shutting down Keystone and not allowing the United States to be the leader in energy. LNG, which is cleaner than Putin's dirty energy from getting into the region. I think this president has made so many concessions with nothing in return. That's why Putin smells weakness. He's wanted this, as you and I talked about for a long time. It's his legacy issue. And if we don't provide that deterrence, he will go in. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the Germans have sort of been uncomfortable with the idea of moving on Nord Stream and the administration is saying they're just- they are waiting on that. On the other risk here, we have midterm races coming up. In 2018, the United States took offensive action against Russia to stop them from meddling in those races. Do we need to see something like that in 2022? REP. MCCAUL: You know, I don't want to see Russia overturning Ukraine's government. You know, I don't want to see any foreign nation adversary getting involved in our elections. But again, pointing from Afghanistan forward, we have sent a message to our adversaries that we are projecting weakness, not strength. One thing Reagan talked to us- peace through strength, going back to Chamberlain and Hitler. If we're projecting weakness, it only invites aggression. Historically, you know that. And this is exactly- I mean, I talked to the administration. I want to stop this from happening, but I'm very concerned about the aggression I'm seeing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you very much for your perspective. You're right back with Dr. Scott Gottlieb.",

            "article_content": "Democrats in a Richmond-based congressional district are voting Tuesday to select a nominee for the seat held by the late Rep. Donald McEachin. The party is holding a firehouse primary at eight voting sites throughout the state's 4th Congressional District. The winner will be a heavy favorite in a Feb. 21 special election in a district where Democrats have a traditional advantage. Four candidates are on the ballot: state senators Jennifer McClellan and Joe Morrissey, former legislator Joseph Preston and civil rights advocate Tavorise Marks. The party's establishment has coalesced around McClellan, who has received numerous endorsements. One formidable candidate, Del. Lamont Bagby withdrew from the race and endorsed McClellan. Establishment Democrats did not want to see McClellan and Bagby split the vote and create an avenue for Morrissey, a populist and twice-disbarred former prosecutor-turned-defense attorney who's proved remarkably resilient over a three-decade career in electoral politics. McClellan, 49, a corporate attorney, has represented parts of the Richmond area in the General Assembly since 2006. She ran for governor in 2021 but lost the Democratic primary to Terry McAuliffe. If she wins in February, she will become the first Black woman to represent Virginia in Congress. Voting at the polling sites for the party-run primary are not the same locations voters use in November elections. Polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. No winner will be declared Tuesday night. Party officials won't begin counting the ballots until Wednesday morning. The winner will face Republican Leon Benjamin in February. The GOP picked Benjamin, a Richmond native, pastor and Navy veteran who twice previously unsuccessfully challenged McEachin, as their nominee over the weekend. VIrginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin called the special election after McEachin died Nov. 28 following a a battle with colon cancer. The 4th District is based in Richmond and stretches south to the North Carolina border.",

            "article_content": "Russian TV personality Ksenia Sobchak \u2014 the glamorous daughter of Russian President Vladimir Putin's one-time boss \u2014   has arrived in Lithuania on an Israeli passport after fleeing Russian investigators who raided her home this week, officials said Thursday. \"Citizens of (Israel) do not need a visa and are allowed to stay in the country for 90 days,\" Darius Jauniskis, head of Lithuania's State Security Department, told a local radio station. Jauniskis said Lithuania has no evidence of any threat that Sobchak could pose to national security. \"If we had anything, certain appropriate measures would be taken,\" he told the Ziniu Radijas station. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told reporters that \"Ms. Sobchak currently is not included in any sanctions list of the EU, U.K. or the U.S. This does not mean that it cannot occur.\" Landbergis said Sobschak might already have left Lithuania as she had entered Europe's passport-free travel zone -- a 26-country area made up of most of the EU members plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Israeli citizens with a valid passport can travel freely within Europe's visa-free zone, known as the Schengen area. \"Ms. Sobchak might have left Lithuania's territory already because she is not restricted in her movement to Poland, to other European countries, or to the north,\" he said, according to the Baltic News Service, the region's main news agency. A video from a surveillance camera shows Sobchak entering Lithuania on foot and talking to border officials.  Lithuania and other Baltic states along with Poland stopped admitting Russian citizens who hold a valid Schengen visa back in September, a move to support Ukraine. Hundreds were turned away, but many still entered after presenting passports of other countries at the border. Sobchak, 40, has often been critical of Putin, but many Russian opposition figures have accused her of serving the Kremlin's agenda. In 2018, she became a liberal challenger in Russia's presidential election, finishing a distant fourth with about 1.7% of the vote in what her critics described as a Kremlin effort to add a democratic veneer to Putin's sweeping re-election. Russian media claimed she had bought tickets to Dubai and Turkey to mislead the authorities but eventually left for Belarus, from where she traveled to Lithuania. The reports claimed that investigators suspected Sobchak of being involved in an extortion scheme along with her media director and alleged that a warrant was issued for her arrest. The Russian news agency Tass also cited information from the probe indicating that Sergei Chemezov, a longtime Putin associate who heads the state Rostec corporation, a conglomerate controlling Russian aviation industries and other high-tech assets, was the victim of alleged extortion. The claims couldn't be independently confirmed. Sobchak dismissed the case as the Russian government's attempt to put pressure on her media group. \"It is clear that it's an attack on my editorial team, the last remaining free editorial team in Russia which had to be pressured,\" Sobchak said on Telegram, which has 1.4 million followers. Sobchak, the daughter of Anatoly Sobchak, a liberal mayor of St. Petersburg for whom Putin served as a deputy in the 1990s, has extensive contacts among Russia's rich and powerful, and the search of her home topped domestic news. She has 9.4 million followers on Instagram, and her glamour, sharp wit and defiant ways have made her both loved and loathed. Sobchak first gained fame as a fashionable socialite and reality TV star and was once dubbed the \"Russian Paris Hilton,\" but later sought to shed her spoiled and arrogant image. She got involved in politics when joining the massive protests in Moscow against Putin in 2011-12, and later reinvented herself as a serious TV journalist and opposition activist. Sobchak has denied serving the Kremlin's agenda by running as a challenger to Putin in 2018. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny denounced her for discrediting the opposition by joining the race, saying that she was a \"parody of a liberal candidate\" and her involvement in the campaign helped the Kremlin cast the opposition in a negative light. Kirill Sukhanov, the commercial director of Attention Media, was arrested earlier in the week as part of the investigation. Attention Media runs a number of social media projects, including Sobchak's YouTube channel that has over three million subscribers. \"Kirill, we love you and we don't believe anything,\" Sobchak said on Telegram.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to President Biden, said Sunday that Democrats' victory in the battle for control of the Senate in the midterm elections is \"hugely consequential\" for the success of Mr. Biden's agenda in his next two years in office. \"He believes that at the end of the day, there are going to be things that Republicans and Democrats can work on together as they did over the last two years,\" Dunn said in an interview with \"Face the Nation,\" referring to the president. \"Control of the Senate is hugely consequential both for judiciary nominations and appointments, the most diverse group of judicial nominations ever under the first two years of President Biden, but also for controlling the agenda in the U.S. Senate, and that means continued progress for the working families, middle class of this country.\" While Republicans are in position to win a majority of House seats with a handful of races still unresolved, their majority is likely to be narrow. CBS News estimates Democrats hold a minimum of 210 seats, while the GOP holds at least 214, four seats short of the 218 needed for a majority.\u00a0 In the Senate, however, Democrats were able to maintain their control of the upper chamber with Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto's projected victory over Republican challenger Adam Laxalt. Her projected win gives Democrats 50 seats in the next Congress, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes if needed. Democrats could widen their majority if Democratic incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock defeats Republican Herschel Walker in next month's runoff election for the Senate in Georgia. Confronting the likely possibility of a divided Congress come January, Mr. Biden told reporters Wednesday that he is ready to work with Republicans, and Dunn echoed that the White House believes Americans do not want partisan gridlock. \"He's going to reach out his hand to work with the Republicans, and the question is whether they will reach out their hand to his,\" she said. \"Given these narrow majorities, obviously the Senate, Democrats will control. The House is still up in the air. Voters in this country are going to expect their leaders to work together.\" But a Republican-led House is also poised to launch numerous investigations into the Biden administration, and GOP lawmakers have previewed probes targeting Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden's son, over his business dealings; Dr. Anthony Fauci, related to the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic; and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for his handling of border security. Dunn said Republicans discussing these investigations and the potential impeachment of Mr. Biden or some of his Cabinet secretaries have not hidden the political motivations behind their efforts. \"The White House has and will continue to comply with fair and legitimate oversight because we are a White House that respects norms and the rule of law,\" she said. \"But I think that the American people didn't vote for Congress being used to conduct political vendettas over the next two years. They voted for working together to make progress on the issues they care about. The president is going to be focused on the priorities of the American people.\" Dunn continued: \"We would hope that the Republicans who've just suffered a substantial defeat in terms of both their expectations and what historically midterm elections tend to do, would also listen to the American people, focus on the priorities of the American people.\" Lawmakers will return to Washington to resume their work this week, and Dunn said \"priority number one\" for the Biden administration during the lame-duck session is passing a funding bill to keep federal agencies operating. Congress approved a stopgap measure in late September that maintained current funding levels through Dec. 16. Other priorities include additional assistance to help Ukraine continue to fight back against Russia's aggression and emergency aid to help Florida and Puerto Rico rebuild after recent hurricanes, she added. \"It's going to take a little while still for lame-duck priorities to really be set, given the uncertainty about the outcomes of the elections still,\" Dunn said. \"Last Sunday, when you were sitting in your chair and you had guests on, I don't think anybody would have predicted that we still would not know who would control the United States House of Representatives the following Sunday.\"",

            "article_content": "The 2022 primaries kick into high gear Tuesday when Ohio and Indiana voters head to the polls, initiating a month of elections that will preview where the parties could be heading in November's midterm elections.\u00a0 The brightest spotlight Tuesday is shining on Ohio's Republican Senate primary, featuring a crowded field of candidates vying to represent the party in the race to replace retiring GOP Senator Rob Portman. Ohio voters will also decide who the Senate Democratic nominee will be, whether incumbent Republican Governor Mike DeWine will get a shot at a second term and which former southwest Ohio mayor will earn the Democratic nomination. The state also features a slew of interesting House primaries, including a rematch between Democratic Representative Shontel Brown and Nina Turner, and a former Trump aide trying to win a spot in Congress. Indiana, which also has a Senate race this fall, already has its candidates, since Republican Todd Young, who will be a heavy favorite, and Democrat Thomas McDermott Jr. are both running unopposed.\u00a0 Here are the key races to watch: Former President Donald Trump's influence in the GOP will be tested in several primaries this month, and the first will come in the Ohio Senate primary. He endorsed venture capitalist and \"Hillbilly Elegy\" author J.D. Vance in mid-April, giving a jolt to Vance's campaign in the closing stretch of the race.\u00a0 Vance has embraced Trump's populist, nationalist, right-wing brand of politics. He's been railing against the migration crisis at the southern border, demanding that big tech companies be broken up and slamming old trade deals. Billionaire Peter Thiel has given at least $10 million to a super PAC supporting Vance's campaign.\u00a0 The Republican candidates largely agree on issues, but Vance distanced himself from his opponents on the war in Ukraine. He told Steve Bannon in February, \"I don't really care what happens to Ukraine one way or the other.\" \"It's tragic. It's terrible. What Vladimir Putin did was wrong in invading a sovereign country, but we have our own problems in the United States to focus on,\" Vance said at a debate in March, echoing Trump's \"America first\" rhetoric. Vance lamented that \"Congressional Republicans refused to give Donald Trump $4 billion for a border wall,\" but gave \"Joe Biden $14 billion for Ukrainian aid.\" He said aid to Ukraine should be conditioned on \"support for our border.\" Three of Vance's main rivals were also vying for Trump's endorsement. Former Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel campaigned on being \"pro-God, pro-gun and pro-Trump.\" Former Ohio GOP Chair Jane Timken bragged about the work she did campaigning for Trump in 2020. Investment banker Mike Gibbons often touted his financial commitments to Trump's campaigns.\u00a0 Vance and these opponents have all either falsely claimed that the 2020 election was stolen or raised unsubstantiated questions about widespread fraud.\u00a0 Ultimately, Trump's endorsement went to Vance, formerly a fierce Trump critic. Vance's opponents have tried to use those words against him, but Trump told Ohio Republicans during a rally in late April to forget about those comments. \"He's a guy who said some bad (expletive) about me,\" Trump said at the rally. \"But you know what? All the others did, also. In fact, if I went by that standard, I don't think I would have ever endorsed anybody in the country.\" A Fox News poll released last week, conducted after Trump's endorsement, showed Vance leading with 23%, up from 11% in a Fox News poll from early March. Vance was followed by Mandel (18%), Gibbons (13%), state Senator Matt Dolan (11%) and Timken (6%). Notably, 25% of voters said they were still undecided. \u00a0 That poll also showed that 42% of Republican primary voters said Trump's endorsement made them more inclined to support Vance, while 23% said it diminished their support.\u00a0 An Emerson College poll released Saturday showed Vance (26%) just ahead of Mandel (24%) and Dolan (21%). Gibbons was at 17%, while Timken was at 8%.\u00a0 One other incident drew significant attention between those Fox News polls: Mandel physically confronted Gibbons at a forum in March. Mandel accused Gibbons of dismissing his military service, though Gibbons insisted he did not make such an insinuation.\u00a0 Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians, is the only leading candidate to assert that President Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. Unlike his rivals, he did not seek Trump's endorsement, leaving a potential lane open for him if the Trump-aligned candidates divide that slice of the electorate enough.\u00a0 On Monday, he told CBS News that if Mandel or Vance win, \"they're going to have to do some explaining\" about their baseless claims of a stolen election.     \"President Trump was a good Republican president. You're going to have to ask them why they chose to ignore Ohioans and go after his vote. I went after Ohioans. That's what I was focused on,\" Dolan said.\u00a0 Trump, meanwhile, has told supporters not to back Dolan. \"Anybody who changes the name of the 'storied' Cleveland Indians (from 1916), an original baseball franchise, to the Cleveland Guardians, is not fit to serve in the United States Senate,\" Trump said in a statement last week. \u00a0 Vance and Mandel supporters have been locked in a bitter feud in the campaign's closing days. The pro-Mandel Club For Growth released an ad last week spotlighting Vance's Trump criticisms and Trump's previous endorsement of Mitt Romney, who Mandel spent a lot of time campaigning for in 2012. Club For Growth President David McIntosh has been a close Trump adviser in recent years.\u00a0 While campaigning with Vance, Donald Trump Jr. slammed the group's continued attacks on Vance. Vance even released a statement last week saying, \"Josh Mandel and his allies have declared war on President Trump and the entire MAGA movement.\" Trump allies stepped up their criticism against Mandel when excerpts from the book \"This Will Not Pass,\" claimed that Mandel told Republicans in Washington \"that he was parroting absurd rhetoric in the primary campaign out of a desire to court Trump and his supporters - but that was simply what he believed it would take to win.\"\u00a0 The closing days of the campaign brought a host of top surrogates to the state. Texas Senator Ted Cruz spent Friday and Saturday campaigning with Mandel. Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz hit the trail for Vance on Saturday. Senator Josh Hawley campaigned with Vance on Sunday and has events with him on Monday. Portman is campaigning with Timken on Monday.\u00a0 The Democratic Senate primary has been far less competitive. Congressman Tim Ryan of northeast Ohio entered the race in April 2021 and has raised millions of dollars as he appears set to cruise to victory on Tuesday night. He has built his campaign around a desire to \"cut workers in on the deal.\" Ryan has focused his campaign on economic issues, including outsourcing, trade deals and minimum wage. Some Democrats are hopeful that his past success with working class white voters can give the party a chance in a state that Republicans have otherwise dominated in recent elections. Ryan has a pair of challengers in his race, including Morgan Harper, a lawyer and former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau official during the Obama administration. Harper has embraced progressive ideas like \"Medicare for All\" and expanding the Supreme Court. Tech executive Traci Johnson is also in the race.\u00a0 Ohio was long considered a key battleground state, but Republicans have dominated most statewide races in recent years. Trump won the state by 8 points in 2020. But despite the GOP's strength in the Buckeye State, the state's other senator is a Democrat, , Sherrod Brown, who easily won reelection in 2018.\u00a0 Whichever Republican emerges from the primary is likely to have significant resources. While every race is critical with a 50-50 split Senate, Democrats are expecting to dedicate more resources to trying to flip Republican-held seats in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\u00a0 Governor Mike DeWine is in a similar position to many of his Republican colleagues: He has to first defeat a primary challenge before he can fully focus on November, a similar position toTexas Governor Greg Abbott, who easily won his primary in March.\u00a0 While DeWine doesn't have Trump's endorsement, he has incredibly high name recognition in Ohio given his years as governor, attorney general, U.S. senator and congressman.\u00a0 Former Congressman Jim Renacci and farmer Joe Blystone are hoping that lingering conservative anger over DeWine's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic may spur voters in a different direction.\u00a0 Renacci, in a meeting with the Cleveland Plain Dealer's editorial board last week, said DeWine \"did not listen to the people\" when he closed businesses and set other unilateral rules in 2020. DeWine said during that meeting that he believes he took a \"middle-of-the-road position\" on COVID and is \"proud of what we did,\" including pushing to open schools earlier than some planned last spring.\u00a0 DeWine's opponents have also tried to link him to an energy bribery scandal that took down top Ohio Republicans, including the former House speaker. DeWine has denied having any knowledge about any alleged improper actions by the person at the center of that scandal.\u00a0 A Fox News poll released last week showed DeWine in a relatively safe position, leading his opponents with 43% of the vote. Renacci was at 24%, while Blystone had 19%.\u00a0 DeWine has also trumpeted Intel's decision to build semiconductors in Ohio, along with conservative victories in the legislature like abortion restritctions, a stand-your-ground law and a law allowing people to carry a weapon without a permit.\u00a0 Democrats, meanwhile, are hanging their hopes on a pair of former mayors from southwest Ohio: John Cranley, the former mayor of Cincinnati, and Nan Whaley, the former mayor of Dayton.\u00a0 The state Democratic Party did not endorse a candidate in the primary, but the state's top elected Democrat, Senator Sherrod Brown, is supporting Whaley.\u00a0 The candidates agree on several issues, including legalizing marijuana, although Cranley emphasizes it more, keeping qualified immunity for police officers and opposing the concealed carry legislation that DeWine signed.\u00a0 Whaley has criticized Cranley over abortion. He only recently announced that he supported aborition rights before he entered the primary, saying he changed his mind after he and his wife had to make their own fertility decision. Whaley has touted her support for abortion rights throughout her career. They have both said they'd veto new abortion restrictions. There are a few interesting House primaries to monitor on Tuesday. Representative Shontel Brown is facing another race against Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator who was the campaign co-chair for Senator Bernie Sanders' 2020 run. Brown defeated Turner in a 2021 special election. Turner's loss was seen as a setback for the progressive movement in challenging incumbent or more moderate Democrats, especially since Turner had high name recognition and strong fundraising. The rematch is again a battle between the establishment and progressive wings of the Democratic party. Brown is backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, the Congressional Black Caucus, Senator Sherrod Brown and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Turner is backed by Senator Bernie Sanders, Black Lives Matter and the Working Families Party.\u00a0 In addition to the Senate and Governor races, Trump's team will be watching to see how Max Miller does in this open Republican primary in northeast Ohio. The seat was left open by Republican Congressman Bob Gibbs, who is retiring.\u00a0 Trump will also be watching the crowded GOP primary in Ohio's 13th District, left open by Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan. Trump endorsed former campaign advisory board member Madison Gesiotto Gilbert in March. Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina is backing former staffer Shay Hawkins.

            "article_content": "As tensions simmer along the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, the chair for U.S. special envoy to Belarus remains empty.\u00a0 In a letter Thursday, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina and Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, called for action from the administration. \"As Mr. Lukashenka tightens his authoritarian grip, the United States must remain a committed partner for all those pursuing a democratic future for Belarus,\" they state in the letter provided to CBS News.\u00a0 President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko, who was reelected in what the international community widely regarded as a fraudulent election in 2020, has been one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's staunchest allies since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February.\u00a0 The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine announced that some of Belarus' special operations forces were holding a \"combat readiness check\" along the Belarusian-Ukrainian border, according to a Thursday Facebook post. Belarus currently allows Russian troops to use its territory. Lukashenko reaffirmed his commitment on July 3, saying Belarus stood fully behind Russia as part of its longstanding commitment to a \"union state\" with Moscow, per a Reuters report.\u00a0 The post of U.S. ambassador to Belarus was meant to be filled by Ambassador Julie Fisher after she was confirmed by the Senate in December 2020, but the Belarussian authorities did not allow that to happen. They denied the ambassador's visa and accreditation, leading to her serving as U.S. special envoy to Belarus from Vilnius, Lithuania. She stepped down from the role on June 9.\u00a0 \"Nomination of special envoy would be a strong signal of support for Belarusians thriving for independence and democracy in Belarus. We count on U.S. leadership to keep Belarus on the agenda and strengthen the international coalition for free Belarus,\" said Franak Viacorka, senior adviser to Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsihanouskaya, to CBS News.\u00a0 The State Department has spoken out against human rights abuses by the Lukashenko regime. In May, Secretary Tony Blinken condemned a new amendment to the criminal code in Belarus that would allow for the use of the death penalty against political prisoners.\u00a0 The aftermath of Lukashenko's reelection led to mass protests followed by violent crackdowns. Between May 2020 and May 2021, at least 37,000 people were detained, many of them placed in administrative detention for up to 15 days, according to a May U.N. report. The report said Belarus violated international law, stating, \"there was an active policy to shield perpetrators and prevent accountability, reflected in the level of reprisals, intimidation of victims and witnesses, attacks on lawyers and human rights defenders\".\u00a0 On Wednesday, Belarussian journalist Iryna Slaunikava was sentenced to 5 years in prison for organizing activities that disrupt social order as the government crackdown on media continues. The Committee to Protect Journalists called the sentencing \"another example of the deeply cynical and vindictive nature of the Belarusian government.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The U.S. has revealed new intelligence of a Russian plot to use a phony video as a pretext for an invasion of Ukraine. Senior administration officials said Thursday that the U.S. believes Russia has already recruited players to stage a propaganda video depicting \"graphic scenes of a staged false explosion with corpses, actors depicting mourners, and images of destroyed locations and military equipment.\" The White House publicized the Kremlin's alleged plans to fabricate an attack Thursday, in the hopes it would dissuade Moscow from going through with its latest disinformation effort.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"We have made a decision \u2014 a strategic decision \u2014 to call out disinformation when we see it,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a briefing with reporters, last week. \"We are much more cognizant of the Russian disinformation machine than we were in 2014,\" Psaki added. \"Russia has a boundless capacity to misrepresent truth and what it's doing.\" The Biden administration has been redoubling its counterattacks against Russia's disinformation machine, reacting quickly to the storylines Moscow is churning out to undermine trust in Western democracy.\u00a0 U.S. officials registered a record-breaking number of efforts by Russian state media and proxies to push out anti-American and anti-Ukrainian content online, even as the Kremlin continues to threaten Ukraine by massing troops and equipment along the border. In another example of Russia's online malign influence campaign, self-declared \"Russian federal news agency\" Avia.pro published an article on January 23, claiming, \"the United States has begun moving its heavy tanks and light armored vehicles to the border with Ukraine, apparently preparing to use these vehicles to attack Russia.\" While Avia.pro is geolocated in the Netherlands, open-source data indicates the domain is registered to a private address of an apartment building in Moscow, Russia,\u00a0according to fact-checking website StopFake.org. Researchers at the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis have sorted through an avalanche of disinformation produced by Russian state media groups \u2014including state media RT and Sputnik \u2014 that claim Russia has no intent to invade Ukraine and that the West fabricated the invasion story as an excuse for its own military buildup. DHS warned state and law enforcement partners this week that \"from September 2021 to January 2022, Russian state media and proxy websites published a greater number of anti-Ukrainian and anti-American narratives on a month-by-month basis than during any preceding period,\" going back to World War II. \"Ukraine-focused article production by Russian media outlets\" surpassed 800 in January 2022, according to the DHS bulletin published Monday and obtained by CBS News. Researchers noted reactionary jumps in derogatory stories about the United States, NATO and its allies on December 7, following the video conference between President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, then again on January 10 at the start of negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland. Recently, Moscow's online armies have spun out wild tales of disinformation accusing the U.S. of hiring mercenaries to carry out a chemical attack plot and revisiting false narratives aligning Ukrainians with Nazism. \"Disinformation is a significant threat,\" deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger told reporters Wednesday, during her diplomatic mission to Brussels. \u00a0 \"The disinformation narrative is that Ukraine is the source of the crisis. That is not the case \u2014 Russia is the source of the crisis,\" Neuberger stressed. Russia is also perpetuating the lie that there are \"significant NATO forces in Ukraine, significant threats in Ukraine to Russia, Neuberger added. \"That is not the case.\" She reiterated that Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops at Ukraine's border. Propaganda is flooding Telegram channels, according to the Ukrainian Crisis Media Center, a non-governmental organization backed by supporters of Ukraine's sovereignty.\u00a0 The group took note of one recently hatched claim that Ukraine and NATO are plotting an undercover operation code named \"Crushing Sword.\" That story, initially posted on the telegram account of Yan Leshchenko, self-proclaimed military leader of the so-called Luhansk People's Republic, and circulated by Russian state media, uses bogus footage of Ukrainian aggression as a pretext for Russian military deployment. While many messages are posted anonymously, others on Telegram connect to pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians such as Yevheniy Muraiev, the owner of \"NASH\" TV channel and one of Moscow's chosen candidates for pro-Russian leadership, according to recent British intelligence reports concluding Putin plans to install a puppet government in Kyiv. The White House dispatched its top cybersecurity official to NATO, Tuesday, to organize its mission to detect and deflect Russian cyberattacks \u2013 both against Ukraine, as well as possible retaliatory cyberattacks against Europe and the U.S. Neuberger equated Russia's use of cyber with \"a kind of kinetic operations\" intended to destabilize a target population and government. \"The goal of Russian disinformation is to\u2026 shake confidence in a country's government or to make it difficult to assess a situation.\" Cyber criminals attempted to \"shake confidence\" in Ukraine last month, targeting more than 90 websites linked to 22 Ukrainian government organizations on January 14 in a three-pronged operation intent on driving Russia's state-sponsored story, according to top Ukrainian cyber official Victor Zhora. Approximately 50 websites were defaced with a \"much smaller number of organizations and IT infrastructures\" suffering damage. \"Some external IT infrastructures were destroyed,\" the deputy chairman of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine told CBS News. Hackers successfully employed specially designed \"wiper malware\" on two of Ukraine's government agencies, but there is no indication that personal information has been compromised. And while the Ukrainian government has yet to formally attribute the attacks to Moscow, the investigation points to familiar Russian tactics. \"It's a part of hybrid warfare against Ukraine. Cyberspace is just one of its areas of warfare,\" said Zhora, who believes that the investigation would benefit from international experts. \"We consider this to be a psychological operation against Ukraine,\" Zhora said. \"It's about seeding chaos and instability,\" he added. Ukrainian government websites, including the homepage for the Foreign Ministry, temporarily displayed a message warning Ukraine's people to \"be afraid and expect the worst.\" But in some ways, officials had expected far worse. \"Fifty websites defaced and some data loss isn't a big deal.\" Zhora said, pausing. \"It's serious. It's a good lesson for all of us. It's one more hit in a series of cyber attacks, but we showed that our security cyber security system is working.\" The State Department\u00a0issued a fact sheet\u00a0last month, highlighting five themes Russia has been trying to refine and peddle in its disinformation campaign to rationalize its own actions in Ukraine. For one, there's \"Russophobia\" \u2014\u00a0 falsely portraying Russia as an 'innocent victim' of U.S. aggression, downplaying the Soviet's alliance with Hitler during WWII and portraying the collapse of Western societies as \"imminent.\" \"Disinformation has been part of Russian military doctrine for more than a decade,\" said James Lewis, a researcher and tech expert at CSIS. \"The one thing Russians have learned is if you tell a falsehood often enough, there'll be people who believe it.\" Lewis says that lesson learned was reinforced back in 2016, when Kremlin-backed trolls revamped their 'classic playbook' with an online disinformation campaign designed to sow doubt about the presidential election. The result culminated in a massive network of fake social media accounts or 'bots' programmed to spread divisive political content across the internet that would further exacerbate existing rifts in American society. But Russian meddling in U.S. elections \u2014 surfacing again for a bite in 2020 \u2014 offered up its share of hard-earned lessons to U.S. officials, too. Experts tracking Kremlin-backed information warfare have welcomed the administration's approach to combating Russia's disinformation campaign, along with efforts by social media companies to curb fake news at its source. \"One thing that's improved in recent years is that the social media companies have gone from saying, 'Oh, we're just, we're just a bulletin board\u2026.' to making a much more aggressive effort to weed out fake information,\" Lewis said. \"The Russians create hundreds of bogus individuals, using artificial intelligence to tweet out nonsense. But there's a much stronger effort to expose that.\" Margaret Brennan and Olivia Gazis contributed to this report. CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

Sipher and O'Shea review movies, TV series and books on how realistic their portrayals are of life in the agency.\u00a0 HIGHLIGHTS:\u00a0 Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. INTELLIGENCE MATTERS WITH JOHN SIPHER AND JERRY O'SHEA: TRANSCRIPT PRODUCER: PAULINA SMOLINSKI MICHAEL MORELL: John, Jerry, it's great to have you on our show. John, you were on Intelligence Matters in its very early days talking with us about Russia's interference in the 2016 election. So welcome back. Great to have you again. JOHN SIPHER: Thank you very much. MICHAEL MORELL: Jerry, you are a first time guest. So a very warm welcome to you as well. JERRY O'SHEA: Thank you very much. It's great to be here. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0 As you know, we're going to talk about the CIA intelligence and espionage in books, both fiction and nonfiction and in TV series and in the movies. And I can't count the number of times that I've been asked, by any number of people, 'what can I watch? What can I read that will give me a good sense of what the CIA is really like, what intelligence is really like, what espionage is really like?' \u00a0 Today we're going to answer those questions. And I can't think of two better people to do that with than the two of you, not only because you were both terrific CIA operations officers, but also because you are the co-founders of a company called Spycraft Entertainment. And that's where that's really where I'd like to start. What is Spycraft entertainment? What does the company do, and why did you start it? John, why don't you go first and then Jerry can add? JOHN SIPHER: There's sort of a story of how we got started. But when Jerry retired a couple of years after I did, he was one of the great storytellers in the agency with a great experience in all kinds of crazy places. We had an in. In fact, you may remember at one point Rob Reiner called me out of the blue and he was very upset after the Trump election about Russian interference and wanted to do a video series with General Hayden and myself. And so I was with a group of my former colleagues and was bragging about my Hollywood contacts. And one thing led to another and we started to go and talk to people in Hollywood about maybe doing some version of a sort of a Bourdain like series where we travel around the world and tell old spy stories. And that morphed into actually creating a company where we would work with Hollywood writers to try to bring real and realistic stories to Hollywood.\u00a0 Our real goal is to be the place where Hollywood can come if they're looking for a tie into the national security space or to the intelligence espionage space. And eventually, as we have success on the screen, a place where people like you and others who write books and have stories can come to get help navigating Hollywood. Hollywood has been very good about sort of taking people's stories and not paying them very well for them. And so we want to get to the point where we're producers on stories. And so we have our own stories. We've optioned books. We work with a wide variety of writers to do feature films, streaming series and even network TV. MICHAEL MORELL: Jerry, you want to add? JERRY O'SHEA: As with any company telling the story of how they began there are always two different versions, right? The version I would like to try out is the same as John's but just a touch different. It actually, like so many good agency operations, started at a bar at a big table over perhaps one too many drinks. And we were telling the spy stories that agency officers, when we're amongst ourselves actually tell. Which is, as you know well, aren't like car chase scenes or finding some exotic, beautiful thing in your bag. Those things really don't happen. And the stories we tell are of, you know, of success very early on, failure of something that you work really hard at that maybe worked out for reasons that it shouldn't have. The stories of the hunt. And then the core of it really, I think, was ordinary people like the three of us on this call, being asked to do things and occasionally getting away with it. Occasionally pulling it off. But operating right in the very blurry edge of right and wrong and doable and not doable. Also with a high and fascinating failure rate. And the things that Hollywood doesn't get, and one of them is sort of that human element, that element of absurdity and what it's really like. And so we wanted to bring that as well. So it's a bit of color to what you have to say.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: For the rest of the show, except at the very end, I'm going to throw out titles of books, TV, series, movies and I want to get your take on them as entertainment, if that's what you want to do. But more importantly, as realistic portrayals into the business of intelligence. I want to start with the three most obvious candidates, because they may well be the most popular. I want to put them together for reasons you'll understand in literally 5 seconds. The James Bond films, the Jason Bourne films and the Mission Impossible films. The Bond films were inspired, as you guys know, by the fictional work of Ian Fleming. The Bourne movies, by the novels of Robert Ludlum. And Mission Impossible by the 1960's,1970's TV series of the same name. Only one of those is about the CIA, the Bourne films. The Bond films are about the British Secret Intelligence Service. Mission Impossible Films are about an organization that does not really exist called the Impossible Mission Force. But what's your take on those three incredibly popular sets of films?\u00a0 JERRY O'SHEA: First, just a slight detour into history, Mission Impossible, the initial TV show, was based off the writings of someone named Maheu who was a disgraced agency officer. Maheu and Fleming both understood the business and I think what they do capture is the occasional sort of tip of the iceberg. The times when things really are exciting, when they are on stakes and when it is do or die and and and very meaningful. What it misses of course is the other 99% that is also meaningful as well. But I think it does capture that sense of excitement we can be sometimes feel.\u00a0 JOHN SIPHER: One of the things about a lot of shows that are meant to show espionage or work in the intelligence field is they're often too high stress, too serious. Everything is taken as live or die. And frankly, Michael, as you know, and Jerry as you know, is people don't operate that way. You can't operate that way. Sure, the work is important. Sure, the work actually does involve national security and important issues. But it is also fun and farcical and all kinds of crazy things happen. And you have to often keep a lightweight sense of humor to deal with things. So many Hollywood films, like the ones you mentioned, are often put into the category of action films. So they have car chases and kill teams and have rogue agents and murders. Whereas I think the realistic, more realistic portrayals are one sort of a little more like Le Carre or there's some other novelists, Jason Matthews, David McCloskey, Charles McCarry, others who have experience in working in CIA and other intelligence services to tell the stories in a more nuanced way. Frankly, this is where Hollywood shines. The Hollywood writer wants to deal with human relationships, human factors, flawed individuals placed in tough situations dealing with trust, betrayal, ego manipulation, all of these kinds of things, rather than just sort of constant action. And so that's the sweet spot that we're trying to hit. MICHAEL MORELL: What about two other very popular takes on intelligence, Homeland and The Americans? Both are TV series. Homeland is about the CIA, but it was adapted, I believe, from an Israeli TV series about Israeli intelligence. And The Americans is about the KGB. What's your take on those two? John, your turn to go first and then Jerry. JOHN SIPHER: At the end of the day, shows, whether they're movies or streaming series, they have to be interesting. They have to have characters that you care about. And I think Homeland did a good job with that in terms of making a character that was sort of interesting and different and engaging the audience. But some of the stories are obviously farcical. There's killings in the streets of America and all sorts of crazy things. But some of the feel, for example, when Carrie was in Pakistan and places like that, for someone who worked in those kinds of places like Jerry and I did, it did sort of feel right, the places that they set them in.\u00a0 In fact, Jerry and I will work with the writer of the original Israeli Homeland, Gidi Raff, who did The Spy with Sacha Baron Cohen. And we're working on some shows with him. And then with The Americans. It's interesting for me because I spent a lot of my career in Moscow working on Russian operations and counter espionage with the FBI and others. And The Americans is interesting because it deals with this unique thing that the Russians have called illegals, people who are under such deep cover that they're not even Russians. They're meant to be Canadians or Finns or Swedes or South Americans who are actually Russian intelligence officers living amongst us. And the things the Americans did, which I really enjoyed, is\u00a0 the sense of tradecraft, of cover, of operating always in an enemy environment. And I think they did a nice job there. But again, the same thing is they added so much sort of killing in car chases and things that sort of got away from reality. But again, both of them have really good writing and good characters that engage the audience. JERRY O'SHEA: I agree with John. I think what's really compelling about the two is that they both have interesting characters. And I think that people can relate to that. And there's an agency officer, too, that I can relate to. I can relate to those characters as fictitious and flawed as they are, in a lot of ways. More than a James Bond who really doesn't have those flaws, this Superman syndrome. And I think people are drawn to it. What Hollywood does well taking people in extraordinarily difficult situations who are real and the kind of people who populate the world.\u00a0 Which one encapsulates like the real CIA or the real world of espionage best. My general answer is none of them get it all right. But all the ones we mention in here get a piece of it right. And I think these two do as well. MICHAEL MORELL: What strikes me is one of the things that Homeland gets right is Carrie's passion for the mission that defines nearly every agency officer. That passion for getting the job done and that's her defining characteristic. JERRY O'SHEA: Absolutely. MICHAEL MORELL: Next on my list are Argo and Zero Dark 30. Both are films that are based on actual events. Argo was adapted from the non-fiction books of Tony Mendez, a legendary CIA technical operations officer and the main character in the film. And Zero Dark 30 literally went from the actual events to a screenplay within a matter of weeks of the bin Laden operation. Jerry, let's start with you with these two. JERRY O'SHEA: There's a term I use from time to time. And it's true fiction. And I think both of these fall into that, they are true. They're a fictionalized truth and one blends into the other. And I think both of them create something both greater and lesser than the actual fact if you were to do this as a documentary. And so both of these, I think, are creating myths. And I don't mean that in a bad sense. They're creating a sort of myth as to what happened both with the bin Laden issue and with what happened in Tehran. I enjoyed them enormously. And I think they both come close in their own ways to getting it right, even though the facts, which we all know are sort of mixed in and matched and slightly airbrushed a little bit.\u00a0 JOHN SIPHER: It's very interesting to me in the sense of, now that we're learning a little bit about this industry as we deal with Hollywood writers and producers and such. And what's interesting, Argo was actually a study and intelligence article, was an article inside a CIA sort of journal that got an outside interest. And frankly, it took like 8 to 10 years for it to get made. And that's one of the things we're finding is just Hollywood would operates on a different time schedule and things take a long time to get all the pieces together. To get writers and get the right people who want to act in the thing and directors and people to get things made.\u00a0 But I think Argo did a nice job of taking a CIA case and portraying it in a realistic but still in a sort of humorous way. One thing they did- a lot of these shows are too serious, too much action. I think Argo gets that mix right where it's still serious business, but it's lighthearted from time to time. And Zero Dark 30, I think was originally they were starting to write about the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed case when, of course, bin Laden was captured. And it sort of morphed over to be more about the bin Laden raid. And I thought it was okay. But I think they tried to smush so much stuff into a feature film. It might have been better as a streaming series. And that's one thing that's sort of new in the last 10, 15 years of Hollywood, too. In the old days, you had one way to tell a complicated story and it was in a two or three hour movie, whereas now obviously, you can draw that out into an 8 to 10 episode series and tell it in a longer way. I think there's a lot around the effort to get bin Laden about counterterrorism operations that could have been told in a longer way, I think. MICHAEL MORELL: How do you decide as filmmakers, how do you decide whether to do something as a two hour movie or as a ten episode series? JOHN SIPHER: It's interesting. There's a whole different industry for each. There's people who have better experiences with them. There's writers that have more experience in a series. They have a thing called a showrunner. There's almost like the chief of Station who is in charge of the general look and feel of the show, and then recruiting writers to work in a writer's room and then divvying up which writers write which episodes, and then making sure it all holds together. Whereas with a feature film, you tend to have one writer who's at least the main writer. Sometimes someone might come in and edit it and fix it up. They're different animals. And you almost have to decide that early on as you find interested partners, writers or directors or producers to do things. There's some stories that just need the time to draw them out. And there's others that can be told in a much tighter window. JERRY O'SHEA:\u00a0 Far be it from me to agree with John, but I think he got it exactly right/ There's three aspects to it. One is the artistic aspect. How long to take whatever the plot is, can you tell it best in 10 hours or can you tell it best within an hour and a half or two? So that's one question. I think the other is there is different financial incentives inside of the industry for how you do it. And one is also on talent. When you got actors, it's much easier to get somebody to sit down, and especially a big actor, to sit down for a two hour feature than to write like 10 hours and take much longer. It's much more of a commitment to make because there's a lot of factors in that. And with Zero Dark 30, I'll say, and Michael, you know better than anybody, there was so much inside baseball in there that they never really touched on. They sort of mentioned it and moved on. They could have easily made it into 10 hours.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: John, I think you wanted to add a point to the discussion here about movies versus TV series. JOHN SIPHER: I think a lot of writers like the idea of writing longer streaming series, although there's downsides for them in terms of how long it takes. But a good example for me is the movie The Good Shepherd, which was with Robert De Niro years ago, and it was an effort to talk about the early days of the CIA. A lot if really big, interesting characters. There were counterintelligence chiefs and there was a mole hunt and all these things, and it was sort of squeezed into a two and a half hour movie. The movie failed on a lot of fronts. And I think it's almost that there was just too much content for a feature film. Whereas I think on a streaming series, you can take those bigger than life characters, you can take those bigger than life historical issues they were dealing with and pull it out into a longer single season or even multi season story and tell it more effectively. MICHAEL MORELL: Let me ask you guys about one particular moment in Argo that's always stuck with me. So the main character is with the hostages who have escaped and they're in the home of the Canadian ambassador. And the main character is an alias. It's not his true name, but he has to earn the trust of these hostages for them to follow him. To follow him out. And so he breaks alias and he tells them his true name. And I always found that to be a profound moment in that movie. I just want to get your take on it. Whoever wants to go. JOHN SIPHER: \u00a0I think the thing that you have to most understand when you're dealing with humans, when you're dealing in human intelligence, the relationship between a source and a handler or someone that you're trying to get to do something for you is no different than anybody else. You have to build trust and you have to build a relationship, and you can't just tell people things to do in our business just like any other business. And so I think that was a very good way of showing how you have to show some vulnerability sometimes. Sometimes you have to put yourself out there, you have to put some risk for you so that others can see that, so that they can develop a sense of trust. It's an odd business because we're dealing with big issues and there's parts related to undercover or betrayal or things you're trying to do. Sometimes you have to use people and manipulate relationships, but you're not successful unless you're able to build those human relationships. And human relationships are built on trust. JERRY O'SHEA: That is really a central issue to what we started with which is what does Hollywood not get right? And I think the one place that they get it almost unerringly wrong with the exception of maybe Le Carre is the intimacy of the art of espionage. It is arguably one of the most intimate relationships between two human beings outside of romance or anything like that. This is something where absolute trust between people is extraordinarily necessary to to stay alive and to do what you need to.\u00a0 One quick anecdote. What people don't understand and not seen in Hollywood is there was a particular person, his raison d'etre of his country was a very orthodox and violent view of the religion that they had. And we started to become close and eventually in a long car ride. And I'm sort of wondering why he's talking to me. He asks something that was really sort of gnawing at his soul. The question was, do you think there's a God? And he wanted to know the answer, and it turns out he wasn't certain. So if you just think at four in the morning, he gets up and he prays and he looks at his wife, he thinks, is she thinking it? And he's with his parents and he's with his co-workers and he's wondering, am I the only one? And so this was his chance to have a father, confessor, or friend, someone he could talk to, someone he could talk to about something that he couldn't even talk to his wife, whom he loved. That interaction between the case officer and the agent isn't manipulative at all. But it is really deep. And your point about Argo touches on that. MICHAEL MORELL: \u00a0It is an amazingly human business, isn't it? Let me throw out some TV series here. And whoever wants to go first, just jump right in. But just give me your sense for what you think about it. And the first is one that I like a lot called The Bureau. It's a series about a French intelligence officer. JERRY O'SHEA: That's a softball one. I love this. It's great. I'll let John continue to rave about it. JERRY O'SHEA: I think The Bureau's interesting because I think the DGSE, the French service, actually worked with the writers and producers of that show, which is interesting. They found that that actually helps their service as they operate around the world. And I agree with that, too. They did a nice job of getting the bureaucratic interplay. There's some scenes in Paris, in their headquarters and how headquarters operates with the people that are at the far end in the field. And they get a lot of details right in a lot of places where the French service operates in Syria and in Russia, in other places. And so I think it's one of the shows that is more realistic than any other. And I think they did a very good job, in my opinion. MICHAEL MORELL: And then another is The Spy about an Israeli intelligence operation. JOHN SIPHER: As I mentioned before, we work with the writer of The Spy with Sacha Baron Cohen. And I think that is also an intense thing. And what that it points out is just that they had, the Israelis had a spy in place in Syria that was collecting information that was of great importance to sort of the success of Israel. And he got more and more into a dangerous, precarious position. And I think that show does a good job of explaining that tension of policymakers and people in Tel Aviv wanting more and more and trying to push this person, this source to get greater and greater granularity of information, whereas this guy on the ground is getting himself closer and closer to danger. And where is that line? At what point if you're running spy cases, do you actually stop? When do you pull back? When is it a point where you've got enough? And that's a difficult issue. People, once they're getting information, they can't get in the way. It's intoxicating. You want that. You sort of need that. But on the other hand, cases like this can't go on forever. And if you run on a case until your source dies, you're also not an effective espionage service. JERRY O'SHEA: This was an existential case. There were really lives and international border riding on this so\u00a0 the moral dilemma when to write this case is one that A I think they got that right. And the other thing I think that got right is the difficulty that human beings have of having second identities. I've operated in alias, but nothing like his. But in the Sacha Baron Cohen movie it really captures well the essence of him trying to live two lives. And I think in a way he was a Syrian official. I think he really was, he could switch his brain around to do that, although he always knew he was Israeli at the end of it. And I think that it is fascinating to look at people's ability to take these two identities, two competing realities and hold them in their head and operate at the same time. Extraordinarily difficult.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: The Little Drummer Girl, a book by John le Carre, a movie and a TV series. What's your sense of that? JERRY O'SHEA: I saw this before I joined the agency. I'll just jump ahead. And what I love about it and what I think it gets great is that there are no or very few very clear lines in the intelligence world. And I think she sees two different truths, two different causes. And I think she understands both. She is influenced by both. Although at the end of the day, she has to pick one over the other. And that moral dilemma, and moral dilemmas in general that we as agency officers dealt with, I think is one of the real things that keeps the espionage genre of interest to a greater public. And as a former espionage officer myself, it was something that we always struggled with and that I still look back on. I think you got it right. JOHN SIPHER:\u00a0 One of the things that The Little Drummer Girl did well is it got the headquarters piece of it. It got the sort of behind the scenes piece of it, the amount of planning and detailed rehearsal and trying to make sure that people had the right covers and background and plan ahead and those things. I think it captured it pretty well, too. MICHAEL MORELL: It got the tension right, too, between the field and headquarters. JOHN SIPHER:\u00a0 Tension? What are you talking about? There was no tension. JERRY O'SHEA: The field was always right, Michael. MICHAEL MORELL: Healthy tension, healthy tension. Interestingly, we haven't talked about a lot of books here. In fact, we haven't talked about any books about analysts. And I think for obvious reasons. But one that comes close and I know it's not analysts, but it's close and I want to get your take on it, is The Assets about CIA spy catchers. The work is inherently analytic. Can you talk about The Assets, which I think is an amazing series. JOHN SIPHER: I don't think I've seen it. Tell me more about it. MICHAEL MORELL: So it's about two counter-intelligence officers who piece together that Rick Ames is a spy for the Russians. JOHN SIPHER: Interesting. Well, I know they know the issue in books about that quite well. In fact, I was in Moscow when Rick Ames was arrested and I worked on counter espionage investigations with our Russia house and counterintelligence officials in the FBI. I found that the place where I work most closely with analysts was in the counter intelligence realm, because it takes that sort of meticulous planning and it takes a lot of digging through in history and experience and really, really is important to understanding these issues and catching spies. And so I'm eager to watch that for an example. And there's some other books that talk about analysts. Guy Bird wrote a book about Robert Ames. There's people, obviously academics, who write about the agency, Robert Jervis, Why Intelligence Fails. David Preiss wrote a book, The President's Book of Secrets. I think authors and Hollywood people need to do a better job of sort of incorporating how important the analytic piece is to the overall intelligence mission. MICHAEL MORELL: Jerry, did you know The Assets? Have you seen it? JERRY O'SHEA: I'm afraid I don't. I'm afraid to say.\u00a0 But I will say that Three Days of the Condor, while not particularly reflecting truth is a great film with Robert Redford as an analyst.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: I am so excited that I have given you guys something that you two can go watch. I think that's really cool. I'm really happy about that. JOHN SIPHER: One of the things that's interesting, when we first started going out to Hollywood, as you can imagine, like you've seen shows about Hollywood. Everybody wants to say this is like Argo meets something or other. And at first we go out there and people would be talking about shows and movies. And Jerry and I had essentially spent 30 years living overseas. And so we were like- people would bring up these shows. And is your show like this one? And we would be looking at each other sort of dumbfounded, having to admit like we've never watched any of these things that we're talking about. We are getting better. MICHAEL MORELL: Let me ask you guys about two nonfiction books, Ghost Wars and Billion Dollar Spy. JOHN SIPHER: Let me start there because I think those are both excellent books. I think Ghost Wars is probably the best at contextualizing the background on the lead into the war on terror and what happened with 9/11 and al Qaeda. I think it does a really fine job of explaining that background to bin Laden and other things. And Billion Dollar Spy is really good about explaining the kind of work that takes place in a place like Moscow where the counter espionage service, their version of the FBI that tries to stop the CIA collecting intelligence and collecting information overseas is very, very aggressive. And so how to plan to meet a source. You might have planned literally for months to meet a source for one or 2 minutes in a dark alley to exchange information for money or what have you.\u00a0 It a story about a Soviet military electronics engineer. And to give a sense about the things we were talking about earlier, Michael, about how intense that relationship can be. The people who met him met him literally for minutes at a time. But the intensity was there. He was so engaged in trying to destroy the Soviet system, he wanted to pass the most damaging information he could to the United States. So much so that he insisted on having a suicide pill. And it was a lot of back and forth with him in writing and dealing with him and with trying to talk him out of that. But he insisted, he understood what would happen if he was caught.\u00a0 And as the case went on and he continued to work with the CIA, it became clearer and clearer and clearer that people were sort of, if not on to him, they were looking for a spy, a mole in that area. So much so that every time he would get called in by his boss into his boss's office, he would take this spy pill, this suicide pill, and put it in his mouth between his cheek and gums to walk in to see his boss. Worried that this is the time he was going to be caught and he would have to have to kill himself himself. And then his boss would tell him to do something normal and he'd walk back out. He'd take the suicide pill, back out, put it away for next time. So you can imagine the intensity of when you have that final time that 2 or 3 minutes where you're going to meet your CIA handler. The intensity of that relationship, how important it is for that person to to get information to the Americans and to defeat the Soviets.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Finally, what did I miss here? What are the one or two movies or TV series that we did not talk about that you would recommend to our listeners? Jerry, you wanna go first? JERRY O'SHEA:\u00a0 Let me take your question just a little differently. The two things that Hollywood doesn't get, one is the work of the analysts. And what CIA guys don't get right about the film is most people don't want to hear about the case or its importance or the stakes. They want to hear about the characters. And so getting the characters and the stakes, putting them together just right is so important. Both sides struggle to get that right. Agency guys don't understand how to build characters. When I briefed you in Anbar Province and outside Fallujah overlooking the Al Qaeda lines with possible snipers in the area, it was all about, here's what's going on. Not about the people.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Jerry, what I remember was it was raining and it was really cold. That's what I remember. JERRY O'SHEA: It was raining and it was really cold and the map melted.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0 The map melted literally. John, what would you recommend to our listeners? JOHN SIPHER: That's exactly why we got into this business. We wanted to create movies that give a real feel of work and we do it. Frankly, I have to say, it's kind of hard because so many of the people in Hollywood are younger and there's this aversion sometimes to what they called period pieces. But there's so many stories. Even just in general, we talked about the early years in the CIA and the kind of people that were trying to fend off the Soviets and fend off World War Three at the time. There's just a plethora of stories that I think can get made into movies. And so what we're trying to do now is work on some stories of issues we've been involved with or books that we found particularly interesting to get those made into movies. And as we do that and get our brand new forward, we'll have a it better, easier to try to pull back some of the older stories and get them made.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Let me just ask one more question, guys. Since you sparked this in my mind, the analysts are really good, right? They have a tremendous amount of expertise, but they can only take an issue so far. And what they really need to fully understand an issue and give the policymakers what they need are those secrets, right, that the adversary is trying to keep from us. And human intelligence is a big part of acquiring those secrets. And I just wonder how you think we're doing on that front. Have we lost something over the past 40, 50 years or even over the past 20, because of the war on terror. Are you worried at all about where we are with our capabilities of recruiting other human beings to provide information to the United States that we need to keep us safe?\u00a0 JOHN SIPHER: I think Hollywood has in many ways defined what intelligence is. And oftentimes it focuses on the kind of jobs that Jerry and I did in the field. The human espionage part of it. But frankly, the human piece, the human espionage part is essentially usually a very, very small part of a much larger intelligence picture. We are value add. If the U.S. can't get information in any other way, we will try to steal it. There's ways of stealing it that isn't just having a spy, a source in place. If we can do that, that's wonderful. But those are small pieces that may go deep and they may prove themselves critical.\u00a0 But there's also, as you well know, the NSA technical collection, expertise, academics, diplomats, all this stuff sort of has to pull together. And frankly, our business of running spies is getting harder. The technology that's out there, the cameras on the street, the quantum computing and these things make it harder. In the past, for example, if I had a source and we met and met briefly on the street in an alley somewhere, or we were sending messages or some sort of encrypted secret communications. That's great. But now I have to worry that when I told that source, the one thing I'm going to do is protect them for the rest of their lives and the rest of my life. Can I say that anymore when there might be a way now that computing is getting to a point that it can go back and find messages from 5, 10, 15 years ago and can maybe break those messages and decrypt them. And we will never know if the person is safe one day and not safe the next day, what it was that made that happen. Or cameras on the street. If I'm meeting someone, I have to know with 100% assurance that nobody is watching, that nobody is seeing that meeting and it's getting harder and harder to do. JERRY O'SHEA: Taking a different tack here. My last was Chief in Baghdad. And I have to say, the young women and men who worked for me in the agency, onsite analysts, case officers, reports officers, security officers. These were people who I was in awe of. Young people, they were taking pay cuts, working 18 hours a day, in dangerous and difficult circumstances. And yet what I saw was really some of what this country can produce. Some of our very best people who could and wanted to sacrifice. People of enormous talent. And so I'm positive about the people coming into the agency and taking on those challenges. We really are getting great people. And the second is what's going on in Ukraine. I think that really brings into stark contrast that there is evil in this world. There are authoritarian, dangerous countries and ideologies and leaders out there. And I think people do realize that the agency does play a critical role in revealing plans and intentions of dangerous adversaries who are completely at odds with the ideals of what our country stands for. MICHAEL MORELL: Jerry, that's a great way to end here. Jerry, John, thank you so much for joining us. Terrific discussion and good luck with Spycraft Entertainment.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Tom Cotton that aired Sunday, Nov. 13, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: And we go now to Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who was a regular on the 2022 campaign trail boosting GOP candidates. He's out with a new book called \"Only the Strong,\" and he joins us this morning from McLean, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator. And on this Veterans Day weekend, I do want to thank you for your past military service. SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, thank you, Margaret. That's kind of you, and thanks to all our veterans for their service in all of our nation's wars. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me get to the story of the moment. Democrats faced historic headwinds. Eight out of 10 Americans said they felt it was out of control. Republicans had issues like economy and crime really break in their favor. President Biden has a low approval rating. How did Republicans end up with this complete disappointment? SEN. COTTON: Well, Margaret, I wouldn't say it was a complete disappointment. On the one hand, we had strong Republican leaders running on positive records of accomplishments who won very big victories. If you look at governors, like Ron DeSantis in Florida, Brian Kemp in Georgia, Mike DeWine in Ohio, Kim Reynolds in Iowa, Greg Abbott in Texas -- we had senators with the same victories, like Marco Rubio in Florida, and Tim Scott in South Carolina, Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. But on the other hand, obviously, we hoped that we would have won more seats. I think the lessons in our victories can be applied to some places where we came up a little bit short. We need to focus on serious substantive accomplishments and issues like crime, like our wide-open border, like addressing runaway inflation. Even in places where we came up a little bit short, like Lee Zeldin's race for governor in New York, he performed very well compared to Republicans in recent elections, and he probably helped save the House of Representatives by bringing four new Republican Congressman-elect across the finish line in New York. I think we have lessons in the places we had victories that we can apply to places where we were disappointed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, but you lost the ballgame in the Senate. Karl Rove blamed candidate quality and specifically put the blame on former President Trump. He said, \"Mr. Trump turned what should have been a referendum on Mr. Biden's terrible record into a choice between himself and the current president. As in 2020, lots of voters chose Mr. Biden.\" Should Mr. Trump remain the leader of the Republican Party? SEN. COTTON: Well, Margaret, when the party- when any party is out of power, as Republicans are now, we don't have a single leader. The former president is obviously very popular with many of our voters\u2013 (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: He's the center of gravity. SEN. COTTON: But we also have important other leaders as well, like some of those victors I just mentioned earlier, like Brian Kemp in Georgia, Ron DeSantis in Florida. Last year, you had Glen Younkin have a great victory in a bluish democratic state like Virginia. I hope to remain a leader in the United States Senate as well, in addition to people like some of those I just mentioned who were reelected, like Tim Scott. So, when you're in opposition, you don't have a single leader. That won't be the case until we're through the '24- '24 nominating season, and we have- we have a new nominee. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you're not going to run for president in 2024. The former president says he intends to announce he's running on Tuesday. Should he be the automatic nominee, or should he face a primary? SEN. COTTON: Well, Margaret, since I opted against being a candidate in 2024, I- I don't plan to be a pundit or a strategist\u2013 (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you just throw out a whole bunch of names of guys who might be running for president, Senator. Are you endorsing them? SEN. COTTON: And I know almost- I know almost all of them personally. And I respect their accomplishments, not just their big victories on Tuesday or last year in Glenn's case, but also their accomplishments in office. But you know, I know everyone already wants to focus on 2024. I just want to remind everyone that we're still in the middle of the 2022 midterm, because we're in overtime in Georgia. And the most important thing we can do is elect Herschel Walker to make sure that we can keep the pressure on Democrats in the Senate not to veer far to the left, as they have over the last two years. That's where I think everyone should remain focused for these next three weeks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Should leadership elections in the Senate be delayed until December, and should Mitch McConnell remain as Republican leader in the Senate? SEN. COTTON: Well, I don't see why we would delay the election, since all five or six of our leadership elections are uncontested. You know, the great wrestling champion Ric Flair used to say, to be the man, you got to beat the man. And so far, no one's had the nerve to step forward and challenge Senator McConnell. So, I support Senator McConnell. I support the other slate of candidates for our leadership elections. I think it's better that we move forward with these elections, so we can focus again on the Georgia runoff. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, I want to ask you as well about what will be a consequential meeting tomorrow between President Biden and President Xi Jinping of China, their first face-to-face of the Biden presidency. Mr. Biden says he wants to talk through red lines to understand critical interests. Can the US avoid conflict with China at this point? SEN. COTTON: We want to avoid conflict with China most certainly in the military sense. I don't think we can avoid conflict and tension in terms of diplomatic and economic and political competition. I would urge the president to be very firm in drawing those red lines. We don't want to see a repeat of what happened last summer in Russia when Vladimir Putin walked away from their summit in Europe, tempted to go for the jugular in Ukraine, especially a month later after the collapse in Afghanistan, or a replay of something I write about in my new book, \"Only the Strong,\" of the disastrous Vienna summit in 1961 between John Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev, which encouraged Russian leaders to rampage all around the world for the next year. So I hope the president is very clear in drawing red lines, for instance, saying that the recent rule against China using American semiconductor technology is only the first step. I hope he's very clear about Taiwan, that we will continue to arm Taiwan so it can defend itself, and if China goes for the jugular in Taiwan, then we will come to their aid. That's the simplest way to avoid military conflict, is to be clear and firm upfront. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what would you recommend in terms of China not going for the jugular, but a slow strangulation to take over Taiwan, which I know you know is one of the scenarios national security officials are concerned about? SEN. COTTON: Well, the simplest thing we can do for Taiwan is what we should have started doing for Ukraine before Russia invaded Ukraine, is to provide them with the weaponry that they need to stop an invasion. It's urgent that we do so now because unlike Ukraine, Taiwan is an island, which means China could blockade it, and we might not be able to resupply them once China might start military conflict. So, it's urgent that we accelerate arms sales to Taiwan, the kind of anti-ship, anti aircraft, missiles and sea mines that they need to fend off a potential evasion from the Communist Chinese. MARGARET BRENNAN: With China, it's a hard problem set because, as you know, our economies are so interlinked. iPhones are made in China. We learned during the pandemic, how dependent we are on the supply chain. They own an enormous amount of U.S. debt. You're arguing to separate the two economies, but people like Hank Paulson of the Bush administration have said that'll end up with a less stable world with really dangerous economic forces here. How do you possibly do that? SEN. COTTON: Well, Margaret, as I write in \"Only the Strong,\" it was a bad mistake by leaders in both parties going back 30 years to allow China to get itself so entangled in the United States and to allow us to become so economically dependent in so many ways, whether it's things like high tech, electronic equipment, or low tech, basic pharmaceutical ingredients or medical equipment. What I say in \"Only the Strong\" is that we should try to decouple in a strategic sense so we don't harm our own people, but we're no longer dependent on those critical sectors that we depend on to keep ourselves safe, safe, healthy and prosperous. It's one thing if Americans buy, you know, say, children's toys or plastic Christmas trees from China. It's another thing if China has the market cornered on things like basic pharmaceutical ingredients or the rare earth elements that are so vital to all modern electronics. We have to do so in a smart way, but we have to be aggressive and quick about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll watch to see if there's congressional action on any of that. Senator, thank you for your time today.",

            "article_content": "The U.K., U.S. and Irish governments have urged rival parties in Northern Ireland to come together to resurrect its power-sharing government after Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein scored a historic victory to become the biggest party in Northern Ireland's Assembly. Sinn Fein, which seeks union with Ireland, won 27 seats in the 90-seat legislature, beating the Democratic Unionist Party, which secured 25 seats. It's the first time in Northern Ireland's history that an Irish nationalist party has topped the voting. But it's not clear whether Sinn Fein will lead a new government because of Northern Ireland's delicate power-sharing politics and ongoing tussles over the legacy of Britain's exit from the European Union. While Sinn Fein's vice-president Michelle O'Neill now has the right to the post of first minister, a functioning Northern Ireland Executive \u2014 or devolved government \u2014 cannot be formed unless the largest unionist party agrees to join in the role of deputy first minister. In February the DUP's Paul Givan quit as first minister in protest against post-Brexit border arrangements, collapsing the Executive. His party has said it will not return to government unless their demands over the customs arrangements are met. Leaders in London and Dublin said all parties must now re-establish Northern Ireland's government as soon as possible. Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin said late Saturday that \"it is now incumbent on all political parties and elected representatives to deliver on their mandate.\" \"Power-sharing and principles of partnership, equality and mutual respect are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, through which peace has been secured and progress achieved for almost 25 years,\" he added. \"A new power-sharing Executive is vital for progress and prosperity for all in Northern Ireland.\" In London, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he will meet with party leaders Monday to discuss how to re-establish a functioning government. Lewis reiterated his position that the U.K. government would like to reach an agreement with the EU to resolve disputes over post-Brexit rules known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. The DUP is strongly opposed to the rules, which have imposed customs and border checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. Unionists say the new checks have created a barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. that undermines their British identity. Britain's Conservative government is trying to get the EU to agree to major changes, but negotiations have reached an impasse. \"The U.K. government's position is we want to secure a deal with the EU. We're very clear about that,\" Lewis told the BBC Sunday. \"We have worked very hard on that for over a year now across a series of conversations. We made proposals. The EU haven't shown any flexibility.\" Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said post-Brexit problems are an \"obstacle to stability\" in Northern Ireland, and that the government in London will take \"whatever measures are necessary\" to try to resolve it. \"It's clear from the dynamic that we now see that we won't get to that position of stability unless and until it is fixed,\" Raab said. U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price also urged Northern Ireland's political leaders to take the necessary steps to re-establish a functioning government. Brexit's legacy adds an extra challenge to Northern Ireland's politics, which operates under a delicate system splitting power between the largest British unionist party and largest Irish nationalist party. The system was created by the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement that ended decades of Catholic-Protestant conflict. If no power-sharing Executive can be formed within six months, a new election may be triggered.",

            "article_content": "When Steve Bannon was indicted on fraud and money laundering charges in September, the former Trump adviser claimed he was the target of a politics-driven prosecutor. Bannon said the Manhattan district attorney \"decided to pursue phony charges against me 60 days before the midterm election,\" implying the criminal case against him was designed to sway the nation's vote. Trump has made similar claims about Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg, publicly accusing him of bias for a tax fraud case against Trump's company. But when lawyers for the Trump Organization signaled they might make a similar argument during the company's recent trial, they were quickly shut down by the judge presiding over the case. \"I will not allow you in any way to bring up a selective prosecution claim, or claim this is some sort of novel prosecution,\" Judge Juan Merchan said on Sept. 12, limiting both sides in the Trump Organization trial to arguments focused on the law. That same judge is presiding over Bannon's case, which is expected to go to trial in November 2023. Bannon was charged on Sept. 8 for his role in a group that raised millions promising to privately build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, but allegedly pocketed funds instead. Bannon had faced similar federal charges in 2020 but was pardoned by Trump during the final hours of his presidency. Presidential pardons do not apply to state charges, such as the ones filed by the Manhattan D.A. In the Trump Organization trial, two branches of the company were found guilty on Dec. 6 of a combined 17 counts related to criminal tax fraud. An attorney for the corporation, Susan Necheles, said the judge's restriction against arguing political bias hampered the defense. She said Bannon is likely to face similar limitations. \"These are political cases. They wouldn't have been brought if they weren't political cases, you know, and it's like the elephant in the room,\" Necheles said. \"You're not allowed to talk about it, but there's a reason why this case was brought.\" Necheles noted that during jury selection, many potential jurors \u2014 and some who were ultimately selected to decide the case \u2014 expressed strong opinions about Trump.\u00a0 Just before opening statements on Oct. 31, Bragg praised Merchan, saying he \"runs an efficient courtroom.\" That was apparent during early hearings in both the Trump Organization and Bannon proceedings, when Merchan made rulings designed to limit the defenses' ability to drag the cases out. In the Trump Organization case, during an at-times testy pretrial hearing on Sept. 12, Merchan told Necheles and other attorneys that he was determined to start the trial on time.\u00a0 \"One of the accusations is that the defense is trying to stall, you know, it's starting to feel that way a little bit,\" Merchan said.\u00a0 In Bannon's case, Merchan has already rejected efforts to extend the time before trial.\u00a0 On Oct. 4, Bannon's attorneys asked for a year to go through four terabytes of data and documents collected by prosecutors, before filing their first motions in the case. Merchan gave them four months. He laid out a schedule, including discovery \u2014 the process by which the two sides exchange information \u2014 that would have the case ready for trial in a year.\u00a0 And in case Bannon's side might want to draw out discovery, there's a cautionary note from the Trump Organization case they might want to heed: In a recently unsealed decision from October 2021, Merchan held the company in contempt for failing to comply with prosecutors' subpoenas. Bannon is scheduled to appear before Merchan on Jan. 12 for a hearing on discovery. Reached by phone, his attorney John Mitchell declined to discuss the hearing, saying he did not want to violate a Sept. 19 order by the judge, broadly restricting public disclosure of information related to discovery. \"I really am not at liberty to discuss these things. We have some rather strong protective orders in place and I'm not entirely sure what I can say,\" Mitchell said.

            "article_content": "Toronto \u2014 Canada's opposition Conservative Party elected its go-to attack dog as its new party leader Saturday. Pierre Poilievre is a firebrand populist who opposes vaccine mandates and blames global inflation on Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He won the party leadership on the first ballot, defeating a moderate, centrist candidate with 68% of the votes cast by the party's members.  The 43-year-old Poilievre is a career politician and was a cabinet minister in then Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government. He embraced Canadians who were against vaccine mandates and supported the freedom truck convoy that paralyzed Canada's capital and blockaded the border with the U.S. Poilievre won the party base, attracted large crowds and signed up thousands of new members.  Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said an apt U.S. comparison for Poilievre is Republican Sen. Ted Cruz but without the anti-abortion stance.  \"He is a right-wing populist,\" Wiseman said. \"Most Canadians recoil at his populism now, but he'll moderate some of his positions and soften his language and image. I expect the next election to be about the incumbent, an incumbent with growing political baggage.\" Poilievre, who led his campus conservative club while at university, has been a member of Parliament since age 25.  He has urged the firing the head of Canada's central bank, calling him Trudeau's personal ATM machine. He has also promoted crypto currency and has said he will defund the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  In 2005, Poilievre joined other Conservative lawmakers on the losing side of a vote by Parliament to approve same-sex marriage. In 2008, he apologized after questioning whether Canada was \"getting value for all of this money\" by compensating survivors of the country's widely criticized Indigenous residential school. Poilievre is a married father of two who represents a district near Ottawa. He was adopted by two school teachers and says he was born in Calgary, Alberta, to a teenager who couldn't raise a child.  Trudeau channeled the star power of his father, the Liberal Party icon and late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, when he first won election as premier in 2015 and has led his party to the top finish in two elections since. But his popularity has faded.  However, the Liberals and the opposition New Democratic Party reached an agreement that would see Trudeau's party keep power until 2025. Trudeau has said he will lead his party into the next election.",

            "article_content": "Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan believes that if former President Donald Trump were to announce a 2024 presidential bid before the midterm elections, it \"would be a terrible mistake\" for the GOP and could \"upset the applecart\" for the party's aspirations in the midterm elections this November.\u00a0 Hogan, a potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate, has been traveling across the presidential primary state of New Hampshire this week to promote his group's plan to combat inflation and hear from local business owners and trade workers.\u00a0 In a phone interview on the road, Hogan argued that recent primaries where Trump's endorsed candidate has lost, such as the gubernatorial primaries in Georgia, Idaho, Ohio and Alabama, are proving his long-held theory that the former president's influence over the party has waned.\u00a0 Those election results are building momentum for some Republicans, including Hogan, to consider a 2024 run for the White House. \"More and more people are encouraging me to consider it,\" Hogan said, adding that he isn't going to make a final decision on a presidential run until January 2023.\" \"There's a diminishing number of folks that are wanting the former President Trump to run. There's a growing number of people that are looking for our kind of successful, bigger-tent politics.\" Hogan said that part of the reason for his trip to talk about the economy in New Hampshire is that congressional Republicans haven't been focused enough on providing solutions to inflation.\u00a0 His five-point plan proposes cutting government spending and adjusting tax rates for Social Security benefits and child tax credits and includes more energy-based policies, like a suspension of the federal gas tax and restarting work on the Keystone XL pipeline.\u00a0 \"Most politicians in Washington, both parties, just spend more time trying to win arguments on Twitter, rather than actually talking about or working on finding bipartisan solutions,\" Hogan said. Hogan is testing his economic ideas on the road, with more than 20 events on Tuesday and Wednesday in New Hampshire. He's not alone in the field, though. There are a number of potential 2024 candidates who have been making trips to early presidential primary states this summer.\u00a0 Former United Nations Ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was in the first-in-the-nation presidential caucus state of Iowa earlier this month for an event with Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton was also in Iowa last week. Last Friday, Trump held a rally promoting his favored candidates in the primary state of Nevada. He's holding another rally this Saturday in Arizona, another battleground state.\u00a0 And Hogan's neighbor to the south, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, was the keynote speaker at the Nebraska GOP State convention this past Saturday in Lincoln, Neb., about 60 miles west of the Iowa border. Youngkin said on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that he's \"humbled\" to be considered as a candidate, but that is \"not a decision that we have even begun to undertake.\"\u00a0 When asked about the possibility that the Virginia governor might run in 2024, Hogan pointed to his own success as a Republican governor in a blue state. Hogan won re-election with 55.4% of the vote in 2018, running nearly 23% ahead of Trump in 2020.\u00a0 \"He's a terrific guy, has got business experience. But he's only been governor for five months. So, I'm not sure what he's going to be thinking about. He'd have to start campaigning next year and I don't know how the people of Virginia would feel about that,\" Hogan said about Youngkin. But the growing question for the Republican party has been not if Trump will run, but when. Earlier this month, Trump had told allies and aides he could announce a 2024 presidential run as early as this summer.\u00a0 A New York Times/Siena College poll released Tuesday showed Trump leading the potential field of 2024 Republican candidates with 49%, followed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis at 25%. Hogan was not mentioned in the poll, and only 1% said they'd vote for \"someone else.\" DeSantis recently held a conference in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with several Republican governors and gubernatorial candidates that connected them with his donors and conservative media figures, according to a source close to one of the attendees. Although Hogan doesn't think Trump will ultimately run again, an early announcement would turn off \"huge swaths of voters\" that the Republican Party needs to win elections this November.\u00a0 \"It sure could upset the applecart,\" Hogan said. \"[During his term], we had the worst four years for electoral politics since the 1930s. We lost the White House, the Senate, the House\u2013 we can't repeat that again. I mean, he already lost to Joe Biden. That's hard to do.\" Not surprisingly, Hogan concurred with a recent poll by the New York Times that shows a majority of voters don't want Biden to run for re-election. \"Donald Trump was the least popular president in American history until Joe Biden, and Joe Biden is breaking the records. There's a solid 60% of people in America who don't want either one of them to be nominees or the next president,\" Hogan said.\u00a0 The visit adds to Hogan's recent campaign activities helping like-minded Republicans in 2022. Earlier in the trip, Hogan fundraised for Connecticut Republican Senate candidate Themis Klarides. He also did recent fundraisers for Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski and Washington Rep. Jamie Herrera-Beutler, who both have primaries in August.\u00a0 He said he's campaigning for candidates \"who I believe are the kinds of people that will take the country in the direction that I want it to go and that are not drinking the Kool-Aid and can get beat in the general election.\"\u00a0 Maryland's Republican gubernatorial primaries next Tuesday will serve as an electoral proxy war between Hogan and Trump. Hogan has backed former Maryland Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz, while Trump has backed Delegate Dan Cox, who has embraced his claims of a stolen election in 2020.\u00a0 When asked about the primary, Hogan called out the Democratic Governors Association for \"colluding with Trump to elect a crazy whack job who has no ability to win an election whatsoever.\" The DGA appears to agree with Hogan's assessment of the weakness of the candidates Trump has endorsed. It has spent $1.2 million on ads, according to data from AdImpact, to boost Cox in the primary, highlighting Cox's more conservative stances and Trump's endorsement. The committee has pointed to polls with Cox leading Schulz and said they are \"starting the general election early and wasting no time to hold him accountable.\" In a statement Tuesday morning, Trump reiterated his support for Cox ahead of next Tuesday and called Hogan \"one of the worst in the country.\" He called Hogan's move during the pandemic to acquire COVID-19 tests from South Korea \"cheating\" and said he \"governed more like a Democrat than a Republican\u2026 and locked everything up with really bad results. Dan Cox is a terrific guy with a beautiful family. He has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\" Fin Gomez contributed reporting.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "Former hedge fund CEO David McCormick conceded the Republican primary in Pennsylvania for U.S. Senate to celebrity heart surgeon Dr. Mehmet Oz, ending his campaign Friday night as he acknowledged an ongoing statewide recount wouldn't give him enough votes to make up the deficit. McCormick said he had called Oz to concede. \"It's now clear to me with the recount now largely complete that we have a nominee,\" McCormick said at a campaign party at a Pittsburgh hotel. He added, \"Tonight is really about us all coming together.\" Before the recount, Oz led McCormick by 972 votes out of 1.34 million votes counted in the May 17 primary. The Associated Press has not declared a winner in the race because an automatic recount is underway and the margin between the two candidates is just 0.07 percentage points. Friday's development sets up a general election between Oz, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, and Democrat John Fetterman in what is expected to be one of the nation's premier Senate contests. The result could help determine control of the closely divided chamber, and Democrats view it as perhaps their best opportunity to pick up a seat in the race to replace retiring two-term Republican Sen. Pat Toomey. Fetterman, the state's lieutenant governor, acknowledged earlier Friday in a statement that he nearly died\u00a0when he suffered a stroke just days before his primary. He said he had ignored warning signs for years and a doctor's advice to take blood thinners. Oz, who is best known as the host of daytime TV's \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" had to overcome millions of dollars in attack ads and misgivings among hard-line Trump backers about his conservative credentials on guns, abortion, transgender rights and other core Republican issues. The 61-year-old Oz leaned on Trump's endorsement as proof of his conservative bona fides, while Trump attacked Oz's rivals and maintained that Oz has the best chance of winning in November in the presidential battleground state. Rivals made Oz's dual citizenship in Turkey an issue in the race. If elected, Oz would be the nation's first Muslim senator. Born in the United States, Oz served in Turkey's military and voted in its 2018 election. Oz said he would renounce his Turkish citizenship if he won the November election, and he accused McCormick of making \"bigoted\" attacks. Oz and McCormick blanketed state airwaves with political ads for months, spending millions of their own money. Virtually unknown to voters four months ago, McCormick had to introduce himself to voters, and he mined Oz's long record as a public figure for material in attack ads. He got help from a super PAC supporting him that spent $20 million. Like McCormick, Oz moved from out of state to run in Pennsylvania. Oz, a Harvard graduate, New York Times bestselling author and self-styled wellness advocate, lived for the past couple of decades in a mansion in Cliffside Park, New Jersey, above the Hudson River overlooking Manhattan \u2014 drawing accusations of being a carpetbagger and political tourist. The celebrity heart surgeon stressed his connections to Pennsylvania, saying he grew up just over the state border in Delaware, went to medical school in Philadelphia and married a Pennsylvania native. Before he ran, McCormick was something of a celebrity on Wall Street, running the world's largest hedge fund, and had strong Republican Party establishment ties going back to his service in former President George W. Bush's administration. His wife, Dina Powell, was a deputy national security adviser to Trump and had strong party connections as well. McCormick had long considered running for public office, and moved from his home on Connecticut's ritzy Gold Coast to a house in Pittsburgh before declaring his candidacy. He stressed his connections to Pennsylvania: growing up on a farm as a high school wrestling and football star before going to West Point and fighting in the Gulf War. He also spent 10 years in Pittsburgh in business, giving him a stronger claim to Pennsylvania than Oz. Like Oz, McCormick had worked hard to earn Trump's endorsement, and he insisted he was the authentic \"America First\" candidate, invoking Trump's nickname for his governing philosophy. However, Trump attacked McCormick repeatedly in the campaign's final two weeks, leading a rally for Oz where he called McCormick the \"candidate of special interests and globalists and the Washington establishment.\" Despite that, McCormick closed the campaign by airing a TV ad showing a video clip of Trump in a private 2020 ceremony congratulating McCormick, saying \"you've served our country well in so many different ways.\" \"You know why he said that,\" McCormick said in the TV ad. \"Because it's true. I risked my life for America and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. ... I'm a pro-life, pro-gun, America First conservative and damn proud of it.\"",

            "article_content": "Days before he reports to prison, former West Virginia Republican state legislator Derrick Evans tells CBS News he's considering a run for federal office in 2024. \u00a0 Evans, the highest-ranking government official to charged so far in a Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol breach criminal case, resigned his seat in the state legislature shortly after his arrest in January 2021. But he said his post-prison plans include a possible run for Congress \u2014 when Sen. Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, could be seeking reelection. He believes his arrest might actually galvanize political support in a state that overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Evans said he'd seek to have oversight of the U.S. Justice Department, which has just finished prosecuting him. He pleaded guilty to a count of civil disorder in March and was sentenced in June to three months in prison. He said he expects to be ordered to report to prison in the coming days, and is hoping to be incarcerated close to his home along the West Virginia-Kentucky border.\u00a0 Evans acknowledged wearing a helmet and live streaming his movements at the Capitol on Jan. 6. And he says many of his former constituents and his community in Prichard, W.Va., have had few, if any criticisms, of his actions at the Capitol.\u00a0 \"A lot of these people shook my hand,\" Evans said. \"They thought it was dumb, but they did thank for me for having guts and a backbone.\" The Justice Department sought prison time for Evans, arguing he was part of a crowd that pushed against the police line during the riot.\u00a0 \"Evans also made clear his enthusiasm for what was happening \u2014 he cheered each advancement of 'patriots' against police on all sides of the Capitol,\" prosecutors said in a court filing. \"He urged rioters around him to 'take' the Capitol and he told them that the certification of the electoral college vote was paused 'because of protestors' and that 'patriots' made it onto the Senate floor. Evans whooped and hollered throughout his livestream, telling his followers, 'Guys, oh my gosh, I can't even explain what is happening right now, how amazing this is to see in person. I am in awe. The revolution has started. The revolution has started!'\" He told CBS News he does not regret going to the Capitol on Jan. 6, but acknowledges it was wrong to go inside amid the mob. \u00a0 \"Absolutely, I would never go inside, if I had to do it all over again,\" he said. \"In terms of showing up and standing up for what I believe, I'm never going to regret that.\" The prosecution of Evans and his request for leniency at sentencing have not softened his position on the 2020 election or former President Trump.\u00a0 Evans referred to the House select Jan. 6 committee as a \"witch hunt,' said he was \"overcharged\" by prosecutors and referred to the 2020 election as \"stolen.\" Federal prosecutors have already informed a federal judge about post-sentencing statements by Evans, in which he sought to minimize the crime to which he's pleaded guilty. In a June 30 court filing, a federal prosecutor wrote about a local radio appearance made by Evans after his sentencing, in which he made statements \"inconsistent\" with the contrition Evans expressed in court. \u00a0 \"During the radio interview, Evans made multiple, self-exonerating statements that are directly contradicted by his own livestream video from January 6, 2021,\" the prosecutor said. \"Of his intent to move towards the Rotunda Doors and enter the Capitol building, Evans stated: 'I had no intention of going up there [to the Rotunda Doors]. I never honestly thought that we was going to be inside the Capitol, never crossed my mind.'\" Evans said if he were to win a seat in Congress, he would seek to have oversight of the U.S. Justice Department. \u00a0 \"From top to bottom, our criminal justice system needs reform,\" said Evans. \"I hear people on both sides mention this from time to time but to be honest with you, they don't have a clue and it's not because they don't care \u2014 you don't have a clue 'til you've been through it yourself and \u2014 and literally, from top to bottom our criminal justice system needs reform. West Virginia Democrats have been excoriating Evans in the months after his arrest and resignation from office. State Democratic Party Chair Mike Pushkin told CBS News, \"Disgraced former Delegate Derrick Evans illegally entered the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. That should be the last time he ever enters that building. I would hope Republican primary voters of West Virginia have a better judgment.\" Veteran West Virginia political reporter Brad McElhinny said, \"It's hard to imagine a candidate with Derrick Evans' background succeeding in a competitive, high-profile political race because of his resignation from the legislature and his felony plea in the Jan. 6 riot. But West Virginia is a state where Republicans are now dominant and former President Trump remains very popular \u2014 so who knows what could happen in a possible run for an open seat in a broad field. Political precedent could fly out the window.\" Evans said he does not regret resigning his state legislative seat after his arrest in 2021.\u00a0 \"I'm not finished in terms of fighting for what I believe in,\" he said. \"Fighting for my constituents and getting back involved in the political arena. So, absolutely all options are on the table moving forward.\" When he sentenced Evans to prison, D.C. District Judge Royce Lamberth said it was important to send a message to Americans to prevent future riots.\u00a0 \"I can't just give you probation. Jan. 6 was a blight on our nation\" Lamberth said.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Seoul, South Korea\u00a0\u2014 North Korea fired a short-range ballistic missile toward its eastern sea on Wednesday, extending a recent barrage of weapons demonstrations including what it described as simulated attacks on South Korean and U.S. targets last week. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile was launched from the western town of Sukchon, north of the capital, Pyongyang, and flew across the country toward waters off the North's eastern coast. \u00a0 The South Korean and Japanese militaries assessed that the missile flew about 155 to 180 miles at a maximum altitude of 18 to 30 miles. The relatively low trajectory seemed to align with the flight characteristics of some of North Korea's newer short-range weapons designed to evade missile defenses. Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said the missile landed in waters outside of the country's exclusive economic zone. He said North Korea's intensifying testing activity was \"significantly heightening\" regional tensions and that Japan had lodged a protest with the North through their embassies in Beijing. South Korea's Foreign Ministry said its nuclear envoy, Kim Gunn, held separate telephone calls with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts to discuss trilateral cooperation to counter North Korea's increasing weapons tests and growing nuclear threat.  South Korean and U.S. officials say the North could attempt to further raise pressure by conducting its first nuclear test since 2017 in the coming weeks.  \"We think they're ready to go. Kim just has to give the thumbs up,\" a senior U.S. State Department official told CBS News late last month, referring to North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. Wednesday's launch came after North Korea fired dozens of missiles last week in an angry reaction to a massive combined aerial military exercise by the U.S. and South Korea that the North described as an invasion rehearsal. \u00a0 Earlier Wednesday, South Korea's military said the recovered debris of one of the North Korean missiles that flew southward last week was determined to be a Soviet-era anti-aircraft weapon that dates back to the 1960s. The North's military said on Monday that its launches last week were simulations to \"mercilessly\" strike key South Korean and U.S. targets such as air bases and operation command systems. \u00a0 It said those tests included ballistic missiles loaded with dispersion warheads and underground infiltration warheads meant for use in strikes on enemy air bases, ground-to-air missiles designed to \"annihilate\" enemy aircraft at different altitudes and distances, and strategic cruise missiles that fell off South Korea's southeastern coast. \u00a0 The North described those launches as an appropriate response to the United States and South Korea's \"Vigilant Storm\" joint air force drills that wrapped up on Saturday and which involved some 240 warplanes, including B-1B supersonic bombers and advanced F-35 fighter jets. \u00a0 This week, South Korea's military has conducted annual command post exercises meant to enhance crisis management and operational capabilities to cope with growing North Korean threat. The four-day training is to last until Thursday. \u00a0 Wednesday's launch also came amid vote counting in the U.S. midterm elections, though the results of those elections around the country were not expected to change significantly the Biden administration's policies on North Korea. South Korea's Defense Ministry said Wednesday that an analysis of a nearly 10-foot-long piece of wreckage fetched from the water near the Koreas' eastern sea boundary on Sunday showed it was one of North Korea's SA-5 surface-to-air missiles. The ministry said a similar missile was used by the Russian military to execute ground attacks during its invasion of Ukraine. \u00a0 Photos released by the South Korean military show what appears to be a mangled rocket engine and wires sticking out from a broken rocket body that is still attached with fins. \u00a0 The missile, which was one of more than 20 fired by North Korea last Wednesday, flew in the direction of a populated South Korean island and landed near the rivals' tense sea border, triggering air raid sirens and forcing residents on Ulleung island to evacuate. \u00a0 The South Korean Defense Ministry \"strongly\" condemned North Korea's firing of the SA-5, which it sees as a violation of a 2018 inter-Korean military agreement on reducing tensions. The dozens of missiles North Korea fired last week also included an intercontinental ballistic missile that triggered evacuation warnings and halted trains in northern Japan. \u00a0 Some experts say it's possible that North Korea reached into the inventory of some of its older weapons to support the expanded scale of last week's launches. \u00a0 The launches added to North Korea's record pace in weapons testing this year as Kim exploits the distraction created by Russia's war on Ukraine to accelerate arms development and ramp up pressure on the United States and its regional allies. \u00a0 \"The North Koreans would want to display their range of missile technologies through these tests, but not all launches have to reveal the latest technological advancements,\" said Soo Kim, a security analyst from California-based RAND Corporation. \u00a0 \"It may be in North Korea's interest to hold some of its modern capabilities in reserve and test them at opportune occasions. Kim, again, is playing a longer game, so to reveal all of his cards \u2013 the different types of missiles and capabilities his country has acquired \u2013 would not work to his favor,\" she said. \u00a0 Nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang have stalled since 2019 over disagreements about U.S.-led sanctions against the North being dropped in exchange for the North taking disarmament steps. North Korea has so far rejected U.S. offers of open-ended talks, insisting that Washington must abandon its \"hostile\" policy first, a term the North mainly uses to refer to sanctions and U.S.-South Korea military drills. \u00a0 The North has also aligned with Russia over the war in Ukraine while also blaming the United States for the crisis, saying that the West's \"hegemonic policy\" has forced Russia to take military action to protect its security interests. However, the North has denied U.S. assessments that it has sent large supplies of artillery shells and other ammunition to Russia to support Vladimir Putin's war efforts, amid what American officials describe as \"severe supply shortages\" in Russia.\u00a0 ___",

            "article_content": "The impending departure of\u00a030 House Democrats who aren't seeking reelection and congressional redistricting after the 2020 Census have created challenging conditions for Democrats hoping to hold onto their slim majorities in Congress in the midterm elections in November. Republicans are confident they'll retake the House, and they have hopes of flipping the 50-50 Senate their way, too. Nonetheless, Congressman Colin Allred, Democrat of Texas, thinks it's too early for his party to give up. \"I recognize that the national kind of, you know, talking point is that the House is going to be lost and that's why so many people are retiring,\" Allred, who represents Texas' 32nd Congressional District, told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast. \"I tend to disagree that that fight is over.\"\u00a0 He believes that despite the high turnover among Democrats even before a vote has been cast, the laws that have been passed to give relief to struggling Americans \u2014 the American Rescue Plan that sent $1,400 checks to individuals and the bipartisan infrastructure bill \u2014 will make a difference when voters hit the polls later this year.\u00a0 President Biden's low approval ratings, the damage caused by the Omicron variant, and record high inflation are not lost on Allred.\u00a0 \"I know folks are frustrated that we're still in this pandemic, that we are still not back to full in normal life and we have to talk about inflation and what people are dealing with,\" Allred said. \"You know, I was raised by a single mother, was a public school teacher. I know every single penny is being counted, you know, at around kitchen tables. We should talk about that. We should talk about how our plans are better to address that than the alternative.\"\u00a0 The former NFL linebacker-turned-Congressman says the Republican Party isn't offering real solutions to America's problems, and it just focuses on \"revenge based\" policies like impeaching President Biden, undoing mask and vaccine mandates, and focusing on what he called \"wokeism\" in America.\u00a0 \"I think this wokeism thing is going to backfire. We're an increasingly diverse country. Every election is the most diverse electorate we've ever had in this country,\" Allred said. \"If the Republicans want to run down this lane of just pursuing a shrinking portion of the electorate and talking about what they're afraid of instead of what they're for, I don't think that's a long-term winning strategy.\"\u00a0 Allred also commented on the rising tensions at the Ukraine-Russia border, with over 150,000 Russian troops around Ukraine and the expectation by the U.S. that an invasion by Russia could be imminent. \u00a0 \"Our intelligence assessments are that we think the Russians have decided to go in, and we're hoping to dissuade them still, but that decision has been reached and it is only a question of when,\" Allred said. He added that he believes Russians are \"miscalculating\" the international response, should Russian President Vladimir Putin choose to invade, and that Putin is \"surrounded by a group of yes men who are not telling him the truth.\"\u00a0 Highlights \u00a0 Russia/Ukraine: \"You know, our intelligence assessments are that we think the Russians have decided to go in and we're hoping to dissuade them still, but that decision has been reached and it is only a question of when\u2026 The Russians, I think, are miscalculating what they think the international response will be\u2026 I think Vladimir Putin is increasingly isolated and surrounded by a group of yes men who are not telling him the truth.\"\u00a0 Will 2022 midterm election results be \"verifiable and acceptable?\"\u00a0\"I think they'll be verified and acceptable, but that doesn't mean that the election will be conducted in a way that was fair and equitable for every voter. And so what we're seeing right now in Texas is extremely high rejection rates for vote by mail applications because of a change to the state law around how you can apply for a vote by mail ballot.\"\u00a0 State of the Republican Party: \"I think that we have to also recognize that this is a different version of the Republican Party\u2026This is not the John Boehner and Paul Ryan crew. This is a group that is extreme and that has already said, you know, I think most of their focus from what they're talking about, what they want to do is revenge based. You know, whether it's Hunter Biden or, you know, trying to impeach President Biden\"\u00a0 House Democrats' midterm prospects: \"It's clear that, you know, we are facing a tough election coming up and that we have to get our very best team on the field. And there are some folks who may feel that, you know, they put so much energy into getting to this point that you know, that they're going to get off here. But you know, we haven't seen anyone, at least, that I'm aware of, except for maybe one or two who are retiring and seats that we will lose because they are no longer there.\" \u00a0 Executive producer: Arden Farhi Producers: Jamie Benson, Jacob Rosen, Sara Cook and Eleanor Watson CBSN Production: Eric Soussanin\u00a0Show email:\u00a0TakeoutPodcast@cbsnews.comTwitter:\u00a0@TakeoutPodcastInstagram:\u00a0@TakeoutPodcastFacebook:\u00a0Facebook.com/TakeoutPodcast",

            "article_content": "North Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters on Wednesday, its neighbors said, a day before U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is to visit South Korea. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the North Korean missiles lifted off 10 minutes apart on Wednesday afternoon from its capital region and flew toward the waters off its east coast. Japanese Vice Defense Minister Toshiro Ino said Japan's military also detected the launches and that the weapons flew in an irregular trajectory. Ino said that \"North Korea's repeated missile firings amid (Russia's) invasion of Ukraine\u00a0is impermissible.\" The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea's provocations would only deepen its international isolation while pushing South Korea and the United States to strengthen their deterrence. The launches follow a missile test by North Korea earlier this week.  Harris is to arrive in South Korea on Thursday for talks with President Yoon Suk Yeol and other officials. She also is to visit the tense border with North Korea, in what U.S. officials call an attempt to underscore the strength of the U.S.-South Korean alliance and the U.S. commitment to \"stand beside\" South Korea in the face of any North Korea threats. U.S. and South Korean navy ships were also conducting drills off South Korea's east coast in a show of force against North Korea. The four-day exercise, which began Monday, involves the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan. It is the first training exercise by the allies involving a U.S. aircraft carrier near the Korean Peninsula since 2017. South Korea-U.S. joint military exercises often draw a furious response from North Korea, which views them as an invasion rehearsal. A short-range North Korean missile launched Sunday was seen as a response to the U.S.-South Korean training.  South Korea and Japan estimated that the North Korean missiles fired Wednesday flew 185-220 miles with a maximum altitude of 19-30 miles. The low trajectories resembled the flight of the missile fired on Sunday, which some analysts said was likely a nuclear-capable, highly maneuverable weapon modeled after Russia's Iskander missile.  In recent years, North Korea has been adding Iskander-like missiles and other solid-fuel weapons to its arsenal. Some experts say the weapons are designed to carry battlefield nuclear warheads to counter the stronger conventional forces of South Korea and the United States, which stations about 28,500 troops in the South. North Korea has dialed up its missile testing activities to a record pace in 2022, launching more than 30 ballistic weapons, including its first intercontinental ballistic missiles since 2017. North Korea's Sunan area where Wednesday's launches occurred was the site of various missile tests this year, including two ICBMs. Earlier this month, North Korea adopted a new law authorizing the preemptive use of nuclear weapons in some situations, as it continues to escalate its nuclear doctrine. U.S. and South Korean officials have also said the North may soon conduct its first nuclear test in five years. North Korea's torrid run of weapons tests this year is seen as exploiting divides in the United Nations Security Council over Russia's war against Ukraine and the U.S.-China rivalry. In May, China and Russia vetoed a U.S.-led bid to impose new sanctions on North Korea over its ballistic missile tests this year, which violate U.N. Security Council resolutions.  Earlier Wednesday, South Korea's spy agency told lawmakers that a North Korean nuclear test could happen between mid-October and early November.  According to some lawmakers who attended the meeting, the National Intelligence Service said if the test occurs, it is likely to come after China, North Korea's last major ally, holds a key Communist Party congress on Oct. 16 but before the United States votes in midterm elections on Nov. 7. The spy service also said North Korea recently began administering COVID-19 vaccines to its people for the first time, Yoo Sang-bum, one of the lawmakers present at the briefing, said without elaborating. Earlier this month, leader Kim Jong Un told his country's rubber-stamp parliament that North Korea would begin its rollout of vaccines. In August, he made a widely disputed claim that his country had overcome its first COVID-19 outbreak and ordered an easing of pandemic-related restrictions.",

            "article_content": "The Kremlin paved the way Tuesday to annex part of Ukraine and escalate the war by claiming that residents of a large swath of occupied Ukraine overwhelmingly supported joining with Russia in stage-managed referendums that the U.S. and its Western allies have dismissed as illegitimate. Pro-Moscow officials said all four occupied regions of Ukraine voted to join Russia. According to Russia-installed election officials, 93% of the ballots cast in the Zaporizhzhia region supported annexation, as did 87% in the Kherson region, 98% in the Luhansk region and 99% in Donetsk. In a remark that appeared to rule out negotiations, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy told the U.N. Security Council by video from Kyiv that Russia's attempts to annex Ukrainian territory will mean \"there is nothing to talk about with this president of Russia.\" The preordained outcome sets the stage for a dangerous new phase in Russia's seven-month war in Ukraine because it is expected to serve as a pretext for Moscow to annex the four areas. That could happen as soon as Friday. The referendums in the Luhansk and Kherson regions and parts of Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia began Sept. 23, often with armed officials going door-to-door collecting votes. The ballots asked residents whether they wanted the areas to be incorporated into Russia. Moscow-backed officials in the four occupied regions in southern and eastern Ukraine said polls closed Tuesday afternoon after five days of voting. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to address Russia's parliament about the referendums on Friday, and Valentina Matviyenko, who chairs the parliament's upper house, said lawmakers could consider annexation legislation on Oct. 4. Meanwhile, Russia ramped up warnings that it could deploy nuclear weapons to defend its territory, including newly acquired lands, and continued mobilizing more than a quarter-million more troops to deploy to a front line of more than 620 miles. After the balloting, \"the situation will radically change from the legal viewpoint, from the point of view of international law, with all the corresponding consequences for protection of those areas and ensuring their security,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday. Many Western leaders have called the referendum a sham, and the U.N. Security Council was scheduled to meet later Tuesday in New York to discuss a resolution that says the voting results will never be accepted and that the four regions remain part of Ukraine. Russia is certain to veto the resolution. The balloting and a call-up of Russian military reservists that Putin ordered last Wednesday are aimed at buttressing Moscow's exposed military and political positions. The referendums follow a familiar Kremlin playbook for territorial expansion. In 2014, Russian authorities held a similar referendum on Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, under the close watch of Russian troops. Based on the voting, Russia annexed Crimea. Putin cited the defense of Russians living in Ukraine's eastern regions, and their supposed desires to join with Russia, as a pretext for his Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Putin has been talking up Moscow's nuclear option since Ukrainians launched a counteroffensive that reclaimed territory and has increasingly cornered his forces. A top Putin aide ratcheted up the nuclear rhetoric Tuesday. \"Let's imagine that Russia is forced to use the most powerful weapon against the Ukrainian regime that has committed a large-scale act of aggression, which is dangerous for the very existence of our state,\" Dmitry Medvedev, deputy head of the Russian Security Council that Putin chairs, wrote on his messaging app channel. \"I believe that NATO will steer clear from direct meddling in the conflict.\" The United States has dismissed the Kremlin's nuclear talk as a scare tactic. The referendums ask residents whether they want the areas to be incorporated into Russia, and the Kremlin has portrayed them as free and fair, reflective of the people's desire for self-determination. Tens of thousands of residents had already fled the regions because of the war, and images shared by those who remained showed armed Russian troops going door-to-door to pressure Ukrainians into voting. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boychenko, who left the port city after the Russians seized it after a months-long siege, said only about 20% of the 100,000 estimated remaining residents cast ballots in the Donetsk referendum. Mariupol's pre-war population was 541,000. \"A man toting an assault rifle comes to your home and asks you to vote, so what can people do?\" Boychenko asked during a news conference, explaining how people were coerced into voting. Western allies sided firmly with Ukraine, dismissing the referendum votes as a meaningless sham. British Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said the ballots were \"a desperate move\" by Putin. French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said while visiting Kyiv on Tuesday that France was determined \"to support Ukraine and its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" She described the ballots as \"mock referendums.\" Ukrainian officials said Paris and Kyiv had moved closer to an agreement that would supply Ukrainian forces with French Caesar artillery systems. Elsewhere, trouble emerged for Putin in the mass call-up he ordered of Russians to active military duty. The order has triggered a massive exodus of men from Russia, fueled protests in many regions and sparked acts of violence. On Monday, a gunman opened fire in an enlistment office in a Siberian city and gravely wounded the local chief military recruitment officer. Scattered arson attacks had been reported earlier on other enlistment offices. One destination of fleeing Russian men is Kazakhstan, which reported Tuesday that about 98,000 Russians have crossed into Kazakhstan over the past week. The European Union's border and coast guard agency says 66,000 Russian citizens entered the 27-nation bloc from Sept. 19 to 25, a 30% increase over the preceding week. Russian officials tried to intercept some of the fleeing reservists on one of the main exodus routes, issuing conscription notices on the Georgian border. According to the state-run TASS agency, an enlistment task force was handing out notices at the Verkhnii Lars checkpoint, where an estimated 5,500 cars were lining up to cross. Independent Russian news sources have reported unconfirmed claims that draft-age men will be banned from leaving after the referendum.",

            "article_content": "Last November, a country with a long, complicated history with the U.S. held its presidential election. Its president was seeking a fourth consecutive term and made sure nothing stood in his way. He changed the country's laws, silenced the media and locked up candidates who planned to run against him.\u00a0 As we first reported last October, Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega is not the fatigue-wearing revolutionary that you may remember. He's now 76 and rarely seen. Still, many Nicaraguans fear he is more dangerous than he's ever been. And tonight, you will hear from two women whose husbands were planning to challenge Ortega for the presidency. Both men were arrested by the regime more than a year ago and their wives haven't seen or spoken to them since. Now, the women are fighting to bring back their husbands and a democracy lost. \"If you're seeing this\u2026 I've been captured.\" Those were the chilling words of Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Chamorro - hours before he was taken from his home by masked police officers in June 2021. Victoria C\u00e1rdenas: Eight police patrols were coming. There was a lot of cars, a lot of noise, a lot of people jumping in our wall. \u00a0 Victoria C\u00e1rdenas is Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Chamorro's wife. Chamorro was planning to run for president against Daniel Ortega and was considered a leading candidate.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Because of that, C\u00e1rdenas says police had been harassing him outside of their home for months, but on June 8 they came in.\u00a0 Victoria C\u00e1rdenas: He was on the floor with his hands up saying, \"I am here. Please don't do anything to my wife.\" We are unarmed. And they jumped the walls. They broke in. And they took him violently.\u00a0 C\u00e1rdenas hasn't seen or spoken to him since. Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Chamorro, a Georgetown-educated economist, is part of a prominent political family in Nicaragua. \u00a0\u00a0 Days earlier, his cousin, Cristiana Chamorro, who coincidentally was also running for president, was about to hold a press conference outside her home when police in riot gear showed up. You can see police push the crowd back. Chamorro was placed under house arrest. Over the next two months, Nicaragua's police force detained dozens of critics of the regime, journalists and ultimately, seven of the leading candidates who planned to run for president against Ortega. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco was a director for Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit advocacy group that's been reporting from inside Nicaragua for decades.\u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi: A lot of dictators will at least go through the motions of pretending there's a legitimate election. He's not. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: Ortega's deliberate and flagrant crackdown against peaceful opposition leaders is something without any precedent in Latin America since the '70s and '80s, when most of the region was under military dictatorship. Sharyn Alfonsi: What makes it unprecedented?\u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: Since Ortega controls Congress, he managed to pass legislation at the end of last year that sanctioned as treason, essentially, any criticism of the government. Sharyn Alfonsi: So if you criticize the government, you can be thrown in jail right now. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: The language that they use is, any damage to the superior interests of the nation. Sharyn Alfonsi: It sounds Orwellian. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: Orwellian. It's completely Orwellian. Last June, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for President Ortega to immediately release the candidates and announced sanctions against members of Ortega's family and inner circle. Until a few years ago, it might have looked like Daniel Ortega had mellowed out with age. A far-cry from the revolutionary President Carter invited to the White House in 1979. Ortega's Sandinista Guerillas were credited with bringing down the Somoza family dictatorship in Nicaragua. Later they fought off the U.S.-sponsored Contras. In 1984, Daniel Ortega was elected president and later sat down with our Mike Wallace. Ortega was voted out of office in 1990, but returned to power in 2006 promising to fight corruption. Instead, he tightened his grip on the country. First, changing the constitution so he could serve more terms, then, making his wife, Rosario Murillo - an eccentric, new-age poet - his vice president.\u00a0 Their children also hold key positions in Nicaragua. Eight of the couple's nine children were made presidential advisers. They oversee a lucrative oil distribution business and most of the country's TV channels. But even as the Ortega family's wealth has exploded, Nicaragua remains the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. In 2018, Nicaraguans revolted. Thousands took to\u00a0 the streets to protest Ortega's proposed cuts to social security for senior citizens. Soon, protestors were calling for Ortega and his wife to step down. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco says it was a turning point for the country. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco:\u00a0 That demonstration was confronted with brutal force by Ortega. Thousands of people were injured. More than 700 were arrested and at least 350 people were killed by police or paramilitary groups supported by the Nicaraguan government. \u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: All of those crimes, all of those atrocities committed by Ortega and his security forces just a couple of years ago, he was able to get away with those crimes. But Vivanco says Ortega also realized that if he lost power he might be imprisoned for what Nicaraguan journalists called a \"massacre\" of protestors. \u00a0 F\u00e9lix Maradiaga at Geneva Summit: Very few people around the world doubt that Nicaragua is a dictatorship.\u00a0 F\u00e9lix Maradiaga, a former cabinet member, was one of Ortega's most outspoken critics. A graduate of Harvard, he addressed world leaders at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy in 2019. F\u00e9lix Maradiaga at Geneva Summit: I come here with the conviction and hope that the world will continue to support the struggle of my people to build a free and open society. F\u00e9lix Maradiaga was teaching non-violent activism to Nicaraguan students when witnesses say he was beaten by Ortega's henchmen in 2018. After the attack, Maradiaga was hospitalized. For the next few years, he was under constant surveillance by the police, according to his wife, Berta Valle. Berta Valle: They watch him, they put patrols in front of his house. The police would tell him that he was not able to go out of the house. Berta Valle: And from December 2020 to February '21, he was under house arrest. Sharyn Alfonsi: So no warrant, but he's not allowed to leave the house? Berta Valle: Exactly. Even so, F\u00e9lix Maradiaga decided he would run for president. One of a group of opposition candidates who, for the first time, had decided to band together to try to defeat Daniel Ortega.\u00a0 Berta Valle: They signed a document saying that they were willing to support the one that could represent the Nicaraguan people. But the opposition never got the chance to put their candidate forward. Most were arrested or fled the country before they could file the paperwork to officially put them on the ballot. On June 8, 2021, F\u00e9lix Maradiaga was summoned to meet with government prosecutors. His family feared he would be arrested during the meeting.\u00a0 Berta Valle: So he went with a lawyer, a friend. And he was interviewed for four hours. Sharyn Alfonsi: So Felix came out, he talked to the independent press. Berta Valle: Exactly. Berta Valle: We were watching this live and we said, \"Oh, thanks, God, he came out, he's okay, he's going to take the car and he's gonna leave.\" His attorney says they were driving away when Maradiaga was dragged out of the car and beaten by police. His wife hasn't seen him since that morning in June.\u00a0 It turns out Maradiaga knew he was in danger. Hours before his arrest, he left his daughter Alejandra a series of videos so she would hear his voice in case he wasn't there for her 8th birthday. \"I'm thinking of you on your birthday,\" he says and tells her, \"I love you.\" She and her mother have been living in the United States for three years because of threats at home and are now applying for asylum. We concealed Alejandra's identity for her safety. In August, we met Berta Valle and Victoria C\u00e1rdenas in Washington where they'd been petitioning U.S. lawmakers to help free their husbands and about 150 other political prisoners in Nicaragua. At that point, the men had disappeared. No one had heard from them or seen them in two months. Sharyn Alfonsi: Do you believe that he's still alive? Berta Valle: That's what I want to believe, you know? We-- we have the hope that-- that he is okay, but we don't know. And that's why we are asking for a proof of life to this point. And this is why we are doing all this effort to come out and to-- to go to the international community. Because there's nothing we can do in Nicaragua.\u00a0 Last September, 87 days after their arrests, attorneys for F\u00e9lix Maradiaga and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Chamorro were allowed to briefly see them at El Chipote, the Nicaraguan prison that's been described by human rights workers as a \"dungeon.\" \u00a0\u00a0 Both men were charged with \"conspiracy to undermine the national integrity\" at a closed hearing in the jail. Attorneys say both Chamorro and Maradiaga have lost significant weight and been subjected to months of interrogations and psychological torture. Victoria C\u00e1rdenas: It's a violation of the basic human rights. It's not only my family who is suffering, it's more than 140 families who have political prisoners who are innocent and are living this awful situation. Victoria C\u00e1rdenas and Berta Valle can not go back to Nicaragua. Because of their appeals for help to Washington and the international community. The women have been charged in absentia with being \"traitors to the homeland\". \u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi: So what would happen if you went back to Nicaragua now? Would you be arrested? Berta Valle: Definitely, yes. Not only arrested, but if they condemn me, that would be life-- life prison. The violence in Nicaragua is fueling an exodus. Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans have fled to Costa Rica and U.S. Customs and Border Protection says about 38,000 Nicaraguans have reached the U.S. border last summer compared to less than 800 people over the same time the year before.\u00a0 In August, the State Department announced more sanctions against members of the Ortega regime. But at the same time, the International Monetary Fund approved sending more than $350 million to Nicaragua that's supposed to help fight hunger and COVID.\u00a0 In September, members of Congress from both parties demanded the IMF reconsider sending more money to Nicaragua and called for stronger sanctions against Ortega. The Pentagon has also warned Congress that Russia has been supplying Nicaragua with millions of dollars in military equipment and training and that Ortega has allowed Russia to build a listening station so close to the U.S. Sharyn Alfonsi: Haven't we heard this story before? This all sounds very familiar. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: It-- it is. Going back 35 years to the-- to the middle of the Cold War, that is unfortunately the scenario we are operating, we're living now. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco says with Russia's continued military and financial support, U.S. sanctions will not be enough to convince Daniel Ortega to change course. \u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: Ortega has decided to stay in power for the rest of his life. Since our story first aired, F\u00e9lix Maradiaga and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Chamorro were tried by the Ortega regime inside the El Chipote prison. They were each sentenced to 13 years in what has been widely criticized as a sham trial. Produced by Oriana Zill de Granados and Emily Gordon. Associate producer, Tadd J. Lascari.

            "article_content": "Palestinian security forces and militants agreed to a truce on Wednesday to end violent clashes in a flashpoint West Bank city, local officials said. The violence highlighted deep disenchantment with the internationally backed Palestinian leadership. For now, the deal to end the clashes eases tensions in the area, which on Tuesday was gripped by some of the fiercest antagonism directed at the Palestinian Authority in years. But the truce failed to address the underlying and widespread opposition to Palestinian security coordination with Israel. The clashes erupted after an arrest raid by Palestinian security against local militants. The two sides exchanged fire as angry residents pelted an armored jeep with objects and chased it away. One man was reported dead. The violence was reminiscent of the way Palestinians typically protest against Israeli troops.  The unrest in Nablus reflected the deep unpopularity of the Palestinian leadership, which is widely seen because of its security ties with Israel as entrenching Israel's 55-year military occupation of the West Bank and its nearly 3 million residents. It has also been beset by corruption and has repeatedly delayed elections. A semblance of normal life returned on Wednesday to Nablus, known as the West Bank's business capital. Shoppers walked around the debris from the clashes as firefighters atop cranes smashed broken glass out of storefront windows bordering the city's main Martyrs Square. Palestinian security forces were deployed in armored vehicles in the city center. A committee of Palestinian factions and other prominent figures said that under the truce, Palestinian security forces would cease to arrest suspects wanted by Israel in the city, unless they broke Palestinian law. Authorities would discuss the release of one of the men arrested in the recent raid. They would also release Palestinians detained in Tuesday's clashes, unless they damaged property or looted.  The Palestinian Authority maintains close security ties with Israel and the two often collaborate against Islamic militants in the West Bank. Israel has prodded the Palestinian Authority to do more to contain militancy, especially in the months following a spate of deadly attacks against Israelis in the spring, which killed 19 people. Israel has instead intensified its own activity in the area, sending troops on nightly arrest incursions into villages, cities and towns, rounding up hundreds of Palestinians and killing some 90 during that time. Israel says the vast majority of those killed were militants, while others have been local youths killed while throwing stones or firebombs at Israeli troops. Some civilians have been killed in the violence, among them a veteran Al Jazeera journalist and a lawyer who inadvertently drove into a battle zone. In May, 16-year-old Palestinian Ghaith Yamin was fatally shot by Israeli soldiers during a clash that took place amid a Jewish pilgrimage to the West Bank, the Palestinian health ministry announced at the time. The northern West Bank, including the areas around Nablus and Jenin, a city that has long been a bastion of armed struggle against Israel, have been focal points in the raids. The Palestinian Authority has less of a foothold there and is viewed with deep suspicion because of its security ties to Israel. That disenchantment, coupled with the soaring tensions driven up by the nightly Israeli raids, boiled over with the clashes on Tuesday. Israel says the raids are aimed at dismantling militant networks that threaten its citizens, and that it makes every effort to avoid harming civilians. Palestinians say the incursions are meant to maintain Israel's military rule over territories they want for a future state \u2014 a dream that appears as remote as ever, with no serious peace negotiations held in over a decade. Israel's occupation of the West Bank is now in its 55th year, with no signs of ending anytime soon. The Palestinians seek all of the West Bank, home to some 500,000 Israeli settlers, as the heartland of a future independent state. In Tel Aviv, police said they found West Bank resident Musa Sarsour, 28, hanged in central Tel Aviv, off a major shopping district on Wednesday. Sarsour was suspected of killing an 84-year-old woman in a suburb south of Tel Aviv on Tuesday. Quoting authorities, Israeli media outlets reported Sarsour's death as an apparent suicide, according to AFP. Security camera footage, which captured the attack, showed the woman being struck repeatedly from behind and falling to the ground. Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid, who was at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, called the killing a \"shocking attack by a despicable and cowardly terrorist.\"",

And this week on Face the Nation: The committee investigating the January 6 attack on Congress says it was the culmination of an attempted coup. (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY (R-Wyoming): President Trump summoned the mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: More than 17 months after supporters of former President Trump assaulted the U.S. Capitol in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results, Thursday's hearing provided new detail and dramatic testimony. (Begin VT) CAROLINE EDWARDS (U.S. Capitol Police Officer): I was slipping in people's blood. I was catching people as they fell. I was -- it was carnage. It was chaos. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: Plus: new insight into the conduct of the former president. (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: And aware of the rioters' chants to hang Mike Pence, the president responded with this sentiment -- quote -- \"Maybe our supporters have the right idea.\" Mike Pence -- quote -- \"deserves it.\" (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: What does the committee hope the American people will take from this fresh look at the riot? And what does it say about the state of our democracy today? (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Tonight, I say this to my Republican colleagues who are defending the indefensible. There will come a day when Donald Trump is gone, but your dishonor will remain. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: We will hear from Illinois Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a member of the panel, and get the latest reporting on upcoming hearings from our CBS Washington team. Then: Thousands rallied across hundreds of cities this weekend demanding tougher gun regulations, as lawmakers in the Senate work to find agreement on even a modest response to gun violence. We will hear from two experts whose research focuses on why and how people decide to commit mass shootings. And gas, grocery and housing costs jump again, yet another record-breaking month of price hikes. Is there any relief in sight? We will ask Mohamed El- Erian, the chief economic adviser at Allianz Capital. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have a lot to get to today, but we want to begin with some news out of Idaho last night, where 31 people were arrested, accused of planning a riot at an LGBTQ pride event in a small town near the border with the state of Washington. Those arrested, who police say came from 11 different states were affiliated, with the white supremacist group Patriot Front and had face coverings shields and an operations plan to disrupt the event. Just last week, a Department of Homeland Security threat bulletin warned that domestic violent extremism remains one of the biggest terrorist threats in the country. And we turn now to the violent extremism that took place on January 6 2021, which will be a topic again this week for the committee looking into that attack. Congressman Adam Kinzinger sits on the committee. And he joins us this morning from Channahon, Illinois. Good morning, Congressman. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER (R-Illinois): Good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: The committee is called the January 6 committee. But it seems, from the first hearing that, in fact, January 6 is encased in a larger argument that you're making, that President Trump made a series of efforts to overthrow the election, and the January 6 attack was just one of them. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Yes, I mean, that's exactly right. So, you know, it is kind of unfortunate we're focused on the day of January 6. We understand why. It was really the visible kind of symptom of everything that led up to it. But what's important and what we're going to delve into this week -- and, on Wednesday, I'm actually leading a hearing specifically talking about the Justice Department moves. But you saw a president that spreads misinformation, tries to install his own people in to Justice to do his bidding, Justice, which is supposed to be representative of all of us, pressures the Vice President. And then, eventually, when he can't get his way, he tries to pressure Congress through just -- not just public pressure, but in a public attack. And so what's very important to notice in that is, it is a whole set leading up to January 6, but I think the thing that's most concerning to me is, nothing has changed. The only thing that has changed since January 6 is now, if they want to run that play again, they're going to put more loyal people into the administration earlier on. So it's important for the American people to see this, to take ownership of this, and make a decision for ourselves what kind of a country we want to live in. JOHN DICKERSON: Who's they, Congressman? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Say that again. JOHN DICKERSON: You said they want to. Who is they? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, look, I mean, I think if Donald Trump gets elected again, there is no doubt in my mind, zero doubt, that he will, instead of screening candidates, like he probably did when he got elected in 2016, for qualifications, he's going to screen people based on their loyalty to him. Now, I don't know if that would go beyond anybody else but him. But I think it's important for us as a country to recognize that, to recognize the importance that the oath to the United States plays. I mean, John, we could pass any law in this country, but if we have people in power, whether it's in politics or law enforcement or the military, if we have any people that are unwilling to put their oath above any loyalty to a person, no law matters. So, what matters and the bottom line is that we as a country recognize, even when we're on the receiving end of politics, even when we don't get our way, if we follow through our oath, that basic compact of self- governance will work. Otherwise, it won't. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about one of the findings on Thursday evening. One of the things we were shown for the first time is several people close to the president telling him there was no widespread fraud, he was going to lose. That's what the numbers showed. How many people do you think in his -- close to him were sending him that message? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, I -- look, we're going to get more into that, but let me just say this. I don't really know many people around him that truly believed the election was stolen, and told him so. JOHN DICKERSON: Do you think... REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: He had a lot of people... JOHN DICKERSON: Do you think there were people... REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: He had a lot of people that told him it wasn't. JOHN DICKERSON: Were there people who knew it was a lie and yet carried on in his inner circle? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Oh, for sure. I mean, look, all you have to do is look at -- he was surrounded by yes- people that want to come and tell him everything that pleases him. And we'll get more into that. I don't want to really kind of spoil the deep dive into some of this stuff. But, look, I think, if anybody truly believed after the -- after what you see, after what the attorney general says, for instance, after what every piece of information comes in, if you truly believed the election was stolen then, if the president truly believed it, for instance, he's not mentally capable to be president. I think he didn't believe it. I think the people around him didn't believe it. This was all about keeping power, against the will of the American people. JOHN DICKERSON: But just to put a fine point on exactly what you're accusing the president of, during COVID, President Trump at the time said it's -- it's like the flu. But, later, we heard Bob Woodward had audio of the President saying, no, it's nothing like the flu. So he was saying something out loud. He was on record in private saying the absolute opposite of. Do you have evidence of that about this? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, no, I won't go into -- again, I don't want to go into the evidence that we haven't put out yet. Let me tell you my belief that I can say right now. The president absolutely tried to overthrow the will of the people. And he tried to do it initially through misinformation, through the Department of Justice, through pressuring the vice president, and then on January 6. And he was told repeatedly by people that he trusted, that he respected people like folks around him that the election wasn't stolen, that there is no corroborating proof of any kind of a stealing or any kind of a corruption that would -- that would change the outcome. And so, yes, I think it's pretty obvious he knew, but he didn't want to lose. JOHN DICKERSON: And let me ask you about pardons. This was another one of the disclosures from the hearing. How many pardons are we talking about? And why were they asking for pardons? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, look, more of that's going to be released this week. In fact, we're going to talk a little about that in my hearing. But why would you ask for a pardon? Let's just say, in general, if somebody asked for a pardon, it would be because they have real concern that maybe they've done something illegal. JOHN DICKERSON: So... REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: I will leave it at that. But I will say that more information will be coming. JOHN DICKERSON: Your colleague Congressman Perry denied that he asked for a pardon. He's one of those ones who was named. \"The notion that I ever sought a presidential pardon,\" said the congressman, \"for myself or other members of Congress is an absolute shameless and soulless lie.\" Is the testimony you have hearsay, or do you have the goods? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, look, like I said, I don't want to tip my hand on this. We'll put out what we need to put out. But we're not going to make accusations or say things without proof or evidence backing it. JOHN DICKERSON: One of the other disclosures in the -- in the hearings on Thursday night was the role of the Proud Boys, quite a lot that -- that was painstakingly put forward. Some people have said, well, one of the things you proved is the Proud Boys were on the march before President Trump gave his speech on January 6. So, if they were already off to march, how could President Trump have incited them? What's your -- what's your response to that comment? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, again, I think what we wanted to do Thursday is show the top lines of what happened with some kind of overall things to be aware of. More information will come out on that. But let's keep in mind, the whole thing on January 6 and the violence wasn't just about the president standing on stage saying what he was saying. It was also about tweets, about this will be wild, January 6 will be wild, come out to January 6, knowing darn well that he was spewing out lies before the American people. So we'll take a look. We'll see. But here's the other thing. We are inundated with people saying, this was the FBI, I mean, that you now see members of Congress, again talking about the Ray Epps conspiracy, that, somehow, he was a informant for the FBI that said a word into somebody's ear, and that led to all these people doing an insurrection. It's garbage, but that's the kind of misinformation that's coming back again. And, by the way, John, I got to tell you, people like Ted Cruz... JOHN DICKERSON: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: ... people like Massie, people like Sheriff Troy Nehls have been repeating this conspiracy. JOHN DICKERSON: Twenty seconds left. Another thing I wanted to get to is, the president has claimed that he, in fact, did reach out to the National Guard. Your testimony showed Mike Pence had to jump in when the president wouldn't. What is your response to the president's claim? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: I think it's very obvious that the president didn't do anything but gleefully watch television while this was going down. He can say anything he wants. The real leader, the only person in charge that made those calls was Mike Pence. And we'll prove that. JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Congressman Kinzinger, thank you so much for being with us. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We now want to welcome a panel of our Washington correspondents, chief White House correspondent Nancy Cordes, chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa, and congressional correspondent Scott MacFarlane. Good morning to all of you. NANCY CORDES: Good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: It's great to be with you, as always. Nancy, I want to start with you. You covered the Hill for a very long time, covered a lot of hearings. What's the purpose of this hearing? NANCY CORDES: There are a couple of main goals here. First of all, John, I think it's important, both for the present time and for posterity, for Americans to have a common understanding of the set of facts of what led up to the day and what happened on that day. You just heard Congressman Kinzinger talked about the fact that there are some powerful politicians out there whose stories about what happened, what led up to it are already changing. And we're heading into a midterm election. It's important to remind people of what actually happened. Beyond that, any time this nation has ever had a major trauma, a major incident, Congress has been the body that takes too big 360 view of what happened, so that we learn what can be gleaned from that experience, how we could do better next time. I mean, imagine, after 9/11, if there had been no 9/11 Commission to examine not just what happened the day that those planes flew into buildings, but also, what were the intelligence gaps that led to these different agencies not talking to one another? That led to the creation of the Department of National Intelligence. JOHN DICKERSON: Bob, I want to -- from the 360-degree view, let's go down to a single moment of testimony We're going to play from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Milley, General Milley. We're going to play some of the testimony, and then I want to get your reaction to it. (Begin VT) GEN. MARK MILLEY (Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff): There were two or three calls with Vice President Pence. He was very animated. And he issued very explicit, very direct, unambiguous orders to Secretary Miller: \"Get the military, get the Guard down here, put down this situation,\" et cetera. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: So, Bob, your book \"Peril\" opens with Milley. Explain why that testimony was important and what it led to. ROBERT COSTA: That testimony in particular showed the entire nation that January 6 was an attack on the Capitol, it was a potential constitutional crisis, in terms of how it was unfolding on Capitol Hill. But that testimony shows us it was also a crisis in the American presidency. Was then-President Trump doing his duty as commander in chief of the U.S. military? There was an attack on the Capitol, the houses of Congress, and he was sitting idle in the Oval Office or in the Dining Room, just a few steps away. And it fell to the vice president to make calls to the National Guard. And it raises real questions about who was in charge in the United States? And the rest of the world, as Bob Woodward and I documented, were on high alert about the stability of the United States. It's something that's almost hard to think about, that the rest of the world was wondering, is the United States stable? JOHN DICKERSON: That's right. And General Milley worried about who was in charge beyond just that moment. Scott, at the end of this -- at the end of the hearing, the chairman, Thompson, said something tantalizing about the Proud Boys and the administration. What did you make of that? SCOTT MACFARLANE: Absolutely struck by how much time was spent Thursday talking about the Proud Boys by this committee. The revelation at the end was that the Proud Boys, according to the committee, was doing reconnaissance the morning of January 6, before President Trump ever spoke, and that they were looking for vulnerabilities, places to lead the mob into the Capitol. Now, the Justice Department has charged the Proud Boys with seditious conspiracy. In fact, they were in court that morning to plead not guilty. That the January 6 Committee is so interested in them is striking. That they were referenced a half-dozen times in the opening hearing is striking, because it's clear this committee is going to draw some kind of line between the Proud Boys and the organizers of the rally, potentially President Trump. We know of two ties already. Famously, President Trump said \"Stand back and stand by\" to the Proud Boys. And they played part of the interviews they had with Proud Boys members Thursday, in which they said that was an incitement to action. But, also, Bob and I have reported about possible combinations and a nexus between the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. We know from the court filings a member of the Oath Keepers, the leader of the Oath Keepers, is accused of trying to call Donald Trump during the riot. JOHN DICKERSON: Nancy, what else struck you in this hearing? NANCY CORDES: I think it was really eye-opening, as someone who was at the Capitol that day, to see these depositions with the president's family members, with his advisers, talking about how strenuously they tried to get him to do something, to make that call, the Department of Defense, to bring in the National Guard, and the fact that he refused to do it. When you -- when you look at those Capitol Police officers who were getting beaten up, when you know that there were lawmakers who were sitting ducks, and this ravenous crowd came within a couple of minutes of actually being able to get to them in the House and Senate chambers, to hear these individuals say, I tried to tell him he needed to act, and he wouldn't do it, that was -- you know, even though we know from Bob's reporting from Scott's reporting, we have known that already, but to hear it from their mouths was really fascinating. And then, beyond that, to know that those same individuals, while behind the scenes, they were telling the president, you need to act, they were also telling him that there was no \"there\" there when it came to the fraud he was talking about. In public, they were still supporting him. They were still standing by him as he spread this misinformation. JOHN DICKERSON: Bob, Nancy talks about hearing it from the mouths of advisers. So, given the central role that Mike Pence played on that day, don't we need to hear from Mike Pence? ROBERT COSTA: Vice -- former Vice President Pence is probably not going to cooperate with this committee. You're not going to see him play some kind of John Dean role with his hand in the air. But we are likely to hear from people who could not be closer to Pence. Greg Jacob, his former counsel, who was part of crafting that statement Pence came up with on the morning of January 6, and also Marc Short, Pence's former chief of staff, they have cooperated extensively with the committee so far. And based on our reporting, they are likely to testify under the -- under a subpoena in the coming weeks. And that will help us fill in the gaps of the intense pressure campaign Pence was under. Recall, it wasn't just that Trump was asking Pence to walk away from the proceedings on January 6. Trump wanted to weaponize the vice presidency to try to stay in power. JOHN DICKERSON: So, we will hear both about how the vice president's office was taking this pressure, but then also what the vice president did in that moment, responding to these riots. Scott, what questions do you want to have answered or hear answered in these remaining, and which ones do you think we will still never have an answer to after the hearings are done? SCOTT MACFARLANE: One million and one questions, John. (LAUGHTER) SCOTT MACFARLANE: Here's this unique challenge for the committee. They have this tidal wave of evidence and records, 140,000 records. And they have to dispense it in these drinking glass-size servings for America. One thing they probably won't be getting to is, did the conspiracy include the person who deposited those pipe bombs outside the RNC and DNC headquarters? Because we are 17 months later, and they are nowhere in the FBI in finding that person. And it was clearly coinciding with the attack on the Capitol. But the bigger question, what legislation do they propose coming out of this? The committee has been unequivocal, they're going to draft new law. Is it just changing the Electoral Count Act to prevent January 6, 2025? If so, the Senate has made some progress on that. JOHN DICKERSON: Bob, we have 20 seconds left. What was -- you were in the room. ROBERT COSTA: In the room. JOHN DICKERSON: What was it like? ROBERT COSTA: Deadly serious. I mean, I thought back to what it must have been like during Watergate during those hearings in 1973, because you realize, this wasn't just about a crime. Watergate wasn't just about a crime. This wasn't just about an attack. It was about systemic shock to the American system. And you could feel it, see it in the testimony that day. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We will have more testimony next week. Thanks to all three of you. We will be right back. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: The investigation into the riots on January 6 take place at a time of fresh challenges to America, testing lawmakers and straining the public's ability to pay attention to the past and the present. But, in a healthy democracy, we must be able to do both. (Begin VT) JOHN DICKERSON (voice-over): President Eisenhower warned that, in managing national affairs, you can't let urgent matters eclipse important ones. The nation's leaders faced a test of that theory this week. In the urgent category is inflation, up 8.6 percent compared to May a year ago, a 40-year high. In the important category, the House hearing about the attempted overthrow of the 2020 election. Eisenhower's advice was aimed at a truth. If you only attend to the urgent, important problems will become urgent soon enough, and you won't be prepared. For example, it was important to knock back Donald Trump's proof-free claim the election was stolen. DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States): We will win this, and we -- as far as I'm concerned, we already have won it. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) JOHN DICKERSON: But that lie became urgent soon enough. CAROLINE EDWARDS: I was slipping in people's blood. I was catching people as they fell. I was -- it was carnage. It was chaos. JOHN DICKERSON: Officer Caroline Edwards testified to what happens when you let important matters slip. CAROLINE EDWARDS: I ran towards the West Front, and I tried to hold the line. JOHN DICKERSON: Edwards wasn't the only one to hold the line. President Trump's lawyer held the line by threatening to resign when Trump pressed the Justice Department to overturn the election. The entire leadership of the Justice Department held the line too. Republican governors in Arizona and Georgia held the line. So did election officials in those states and others. Vice President Pence held the line. The reason these hearings are important enough to be considered at the same time we focus on the urgent matter of inflation is, the hearings redefine what the line is. To hold the line is to put courage and action behind ideas that are true and enduring. We reaffirm the strength of those ideas in public moments like these hearings, reaffirming that, in American democracy, the winner of an election is not determined by anger and force, but by the will of the people, that a presidency cannot be oriented entirely around the maintenance of power, as Donald Trump's was after the November election, that wishes are not facts. And, finally, the hearings reaffirm that concern exclusively for things that are immediately before us risks distancing us from our contact with where the bright lines are, which means, when the moment comes, those of us who lack Officer Edwards' courage will fail to hold the line because we won't know where to find it. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: And we will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And we will be back with more on inflation. Prices for everything, from groceries to rent, have gone up. We will have the analysis coming up. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to Face the Nation. Inflation continues to top the list of Americans' economic concerns. And we learned Friday that they're right to be worried. Prices jumped again at a record-breaking pace last month. CBS News senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann has more. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): Gas prices feel like highway robbery. MAN: Too damn high. It's ridiculous. MARK STRASSMANN: On average, we're now paying more than five bucks a gallon, a record, up 16 cents in one week and almost $2 more than a year ago. Then again: PATRICK DE HAAN (Head of Petroleum Analysis, GasBuddy): For all the complaints that there are out there about gas prices hitting records, few Americans seem to be cutting back much. MARK STRASSMANN: Gas prices help fuel inflation that's at a 40-year high. Take groceries, milk up 20 percent in a year, eggs up 75 percent. Or housing. The average rent costs 15 percent more. Want to get away this summer? Airfare is soaring, up almost 40 percent from a year ago. Still sizzling, just like the economy, America's labor market. Right now, there are roughly two jobs for anyone looking for work. STACEY REECE (Spherion Staffing & Recruiting) You could not hire enough employees to either produce your product, deliver your product, service your product. MARK STRASSMANN: Nearly one-third of small business owners say inflation is now their number one worry, the highest number since 1980. MYCHAL WALKER (Chair, Leadership Council National Federation of Independent Business of Georgia): It's the gas. It's the labor shortage and the wages. So, you get it from all angles when you're a small business. MARK STRASSMANN: And three straight months of inflation not just above 8 percent, but trending in the wrong direction. JANET YELLEN (U.S. Treasury Secretary): I think that bringing inflation down should be our number one priority. MARK STRASSMANN: Expect the Fed to raise interest rates again soon. Mortgage rates have already shot up. A 30-year fixed averages more than 5.5 percent, more than two points higher than January. But make no mistake. Taming inflation will take time, maybe deep into next year. Meanwhile, expect to keep paying more. By August, many analysts believe gas will average $6 a gallon. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: That was Mark Strassmann in Atlanta. We now want to go to Mohamed El-Erian. He's the chief economic adviser at Allianz, a financial services company, and the president of Queens College in Cambridge. Mohamed, good morning. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN (Chief Economic Adviser, Allianz): Good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, let's start with inflation where everybody else is starting. It's the -- reported the highest level in just over 40 years. How did we get here? And are things going to get worse? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: We got here because we got a combination of things happening. Of course, we know about the Ukraine war. We know about the energy transition. Also, the Federal Reserve mischaracterized inflation and fell behind. And all these things came together and are feeding now this everything inflation. The price of nearly everything is going up. And it's making us feel really insecure. JOHN DICKERSON: There was some hope in some quarters -- it may have been motivated reasoning, but there was some hope that inflation might be turning around, might be getting -- the picture might be getting better. So, give us your sense. Was that hope misplaced? Or is this a sign of how hard it is to predict where we are in the economy at this moment? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: It's both. There was hope initially that it is transitory, meaning temporary and quickly reversible. There was hope, as you pointed out, that it had peaked. I never shared those hopes. I think you've got to be very modest about what we know about this inflation process. And I fear that it's still going to get worse. We may well get to 9 percent at this rate. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get back to that point about modesty. But staying on inflation, how much is this a part of what's domestic U.S. issues? You mentioned some of them. How much of it is what's happening overseas? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: It started mainly external, exogenous, if you like, things that we imported, but then the Federal Reserve did not react. It mischaracterized what inflation is, and it fell behind. And the lessons of history is, once you fall behind, you lose the ability of the first, best response. You end up in this awful situation that we're in today, where you need to make a choice. Do you slam on the brakes hard to control inflation and risk a recession, or do you just tap on the brakes and risk inflation lasting much longer than it should? JOHN DICKERSON: So, does that mean the Federal Reserve is in the second best response, or are they in the third or fourth best response? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Well, the problem for us all is, they're far away from the first, best response. I mean, what makes this very frustrating is, it was partially avoidable. This is going to have enormous economic, social -- it hits the poor, particularly hard -- institutional and political consequences. And most of it could have been avoided, had early actions been taken. JOHN DICKERSON: Looking at what the Federal Reserve is doing, raising rates to try to push down on demand, how is that story going? And will these new numbers -- how do you think these new numbers will affect what the Federal Reserve is going to do going forward? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, it's not going well so far, because the Fed has yet to explain to us why it got its forecast so wrong for so long. The European Central Bank, we -- they were in the same position. They have explained why. And that's important, because, until you regain credibility, you cannot get on top of inflation expectations. We should look the Fed to increase by at least 50 basis points this coming week. JOHN DICKERSON: Those expectations, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showed that people's fears about inflation in the future was going up. Is that related to that lack of confidence in the Fed's ability to bring prices down? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: It is. Long-term inflation expectations are now 3.3 percent, the highest we've seen them for 15 years. People are losing confidence in the ability of the Fed to get a handle on this inflation process. JOHN DICKERSON: So, Mohamed, implicit in everything you've been saying and we've been talking about is the murkiness of the picture. Economics is always a little murky. Are we at an extra murky period right now? And does that mean all policymakers are essentially flying, if not blind, they're -- they're -- they're dealing with something we've never seen before and, therefore, humility is even more called for in policy prescriptions? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, humility is totally called for. I was very puzzled when, a year ago, so many people were so confident that inflation was transitory. There was so much we didn't understand about the post-COVID inflation that humility would have been a good idea. Unfortunately, today, there's a few things we know for sure. This inflation is hurting all Americans, and it's hurting the poor particularly hard. That, we know for sure. Second, the longer it lasts, the more it's going to create demand destruction, meaning that the average American not only get hit by higher prices, but they will start worrying about their income. And that is not a situation that we really want to be in. JOHN DICKERSON: If that's what's facing the American consumer or the American public, what's your sense? \"The Economist' had a piece about how CEOs did not come up in an age of hyperinflation, that this is the first time for businesses to deal with -- with an inflationary moment. How does that change the toolkit that businesses have to use to face the economic conditions today? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Well, they've got to be both more resilient and more agile, more resilient and be able to absorb the higher costs, and more agile in knowing how much of this they can pass on. It is also difficult for households. We haven't had to deal with this amount of inflation. So it's putting everybody out of their comfort zone. And that's an additional worry, that we may not know how to react quickly enough, and we may create the problem -- create a deeper problem. That's why policy leadership is so critical at this stage. JOHN DICKERSON: So, I'm going to ask you to do -- give me the darkest picture as you see it, and then perhaps the most optimistic. Let's start with the darkest in terms of how long the economic difficulties might be with us, and what they might look like if things continue to go in a darker direction. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, we're now in a period of stagflation, meaning lower growth and higher inflation. The darkest period is that inflation persists, heads to 9 percent, people start worrying that it's going to go to 10 percent, and next thing you know, we end up in a recession. And that would be tragic if that were to happen, because, again, it is the most vulnerable segments of the population that get hit hard. What's the best is that the Fed regains control of the inflation narrative and we have what's called a soft landing. Inflation comes down without us sacrificing growth too much. Unfortunately, the balance of risks is tilted in the negative way right now. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about stagflation, a word we hear a lot. Feel free to define it a little bit more. And let me ask you this question. I thought that stagflation included also a piece of high unemployment. We don't have high unemployment. So why isn't that a possibly bright sign? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: That's a really good sign. We have a strong labor market. And that's what's keeping us away from a recession right now. That's why a recession is a risk scenario, not a baseline. The one bad thing about our labor market is that we don't have enough labor force participation. We don't have enough workers. We have twice as many jobs that are open than there are workers. And what we need is more workers entering the labor force. That would help tremendously with our economic outlook. JOHN DICKERSON: In terms of options, we've talked about the Fed. What other policymakers or areas of help might come to fix the economic situation that America faces? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, number one is, as we talked about, the Fed regaining control of inflation. Number two is focusing more fiscal support on the most vulnerable segment of the population. Number three are what we call restructuring measures, increasing productivity and labor force participation. And, finally, let's not forget about financial markets. The last thing we want is financial instability to undermine economic prosperity. So we need more focus on financial stability. JOHN DICKERSON: Can I ask you just about the labor force participation piece? What does that mean exactly? MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, for example, better child care would encourage more women to come back into the labor force. Retraining and retooling would allow more people to enter the labor force. We have the people. They are just out of the labor market, either by choice or by necessity. And anything we can do to re-engage them is a win-win. JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Mohamed El-Erian, thank you so much for being with us. We're going to be talking to you again. I'm certain of that. Thanks again. MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Thousands showed up and rallied in hundreds of cities across the country yesterday demanding tougher gun laws. Some of the speakers were mass shooting survivors, including David Hogg, who co-founded March For Our Lives following a shooting at his school in Parkland, Florida, four years ago. The message to lawmakers was direct: Act now or get voted out. (Begin VT) DAVID HOGG (Parkland Shooting Survivor): If our government can't do anything to stop 19 kids from being killed and slaughtered in their own school and decapitated, it's time to change who is in government! (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: In perhaps a sign of the times, there was some brief panic at the rally here in Washington yesterday when a man yelled and threw an object into the crowd, sending people running from the stage. This morning, we have learned that a bipartisan group of senators have reached an agreement on new measures to address gun violence, with an announcement expected later today. This all follows a string of horrific shootings from Uvalde, Texas, to Buffalo, New York. And we now want to go to two researchers who have been studying mass shootings to help policymakers stop the next one, Dr. Jillian Peterson and Dr. James Densley of The Violence Project. Good morning to both of you. DR. JILLIAN PETERSON (Co-Founder and President, The Violence Project): Good morning. DR. JAMES DENSLEY (Co-Founder and President, The Violence Project): Good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: Dr. Peterson, I just want -- I want to start with you. Let's talk -- describe the scope of your work, when it started, and what your research consists of. DR. JILLIAN PETERSON: Yes, we started looking into the life histories of perpetrators of mass shootings about five years ago. And our goal was to try to understand, where is this coming from, why are we seeing this increase, and who are these perpetrators? So we built a database that includes 180 perpetrators who killed four or more people in a public space going back about 50 years. And we coded each of them on over 200 pieces of life history information to try to look for patterns in the data. And we also conducted interviews with perpetrators themselves, people who knew them, victims, and experts in the field to really try to add some data and analysis to understand where this is coming from and what we can do to stop it. JOHN DICKERSON: So, Dr. Densley, what composite were you able to come with -- come up with, or were you, based on all of these data, in terms of what the typical mass shooter is like? DR. JAMES DENSLEY: Yes, I think a lot of people are searching for a profile of a mass shooter. And we instead saw a pathway to a mass shooting. And we outlined that pathway in our in our book called \"The Violence Project.\" So it starts with early childhood trauma. Many of these mass shooters have experienced some pretty horrific things in life early in life. And this is unsettled, unresolved trauma that I think comes back later in life, and is part of what we describe as being a crisis point in these people's lives. Mass shooters are in crisis. These are individuals who are not living their best selves. They are questioning their place in the world. It's often a very sort of suicidal crisis. We see a lot of overlap between suicide and homicide in these cases. A mass shooting is intended to be a final act. And with regard to that, people who perpetrate mass shootings are searching for answers, meaning in life. And so they go searching for the other mass shooters who've done these types of crimes previously. They identify with those individuals. They get radicalized in chat rooms online or reading the manifestos of these individuals. And then, finally, the sort of last step with this is access to a firearm. And that's why we spend, obviously, a lot of time in the policy conversations. But we see all four of those steps as opportunities for intervention. They're inflection points, and they're places where we can intervene and prevent a mass shooting. And that's really the key here. JOHN DICKERSON: So, Jillian Peterson, one of the things you've written is that -- to change the mind-set about the way we think about the shooters, that they are us. So how does that help in these moments of crisis? Where, for example, would you seek a policy intervention, if you change that mind-set, if that's the first step? DR. JILLIAN PETERSON: Yes, I think we tend to think of the perpetrators who do this as just these evil monsters kind of lurking out there. And, of course, what they do is monstrous. But, before they do it, they are our classmates, our nieces or nephews, our neighbors. They're children going to the school. These tend to be insiders, not outsiders. So, the most likely perpetrator of a school shooting is in the classroom. And when we recognize that, I think it kind of shifts our mind-set to make us start noticing some of these signs of a crisis, to notice when people are leaking their plans or talking about this kind of violence or talking about suicide. And so our research really points to things like suicide prevention and crisis intervention training, building crisis response teams in schools and workplaces, and having some of those systems in place to catch people before they do this. JOHN DICKERSON: So, Dr. Densley, then, it's about having therapists in every school? Is that a -- I mean, is that essentially what would be the best way to deal with these moments of crisis? DR. JAMES DENSLEY: I think what's interesting about this is that a lot of the measures that we would take to prevent mass shootings don't just prevent mass shootings. So we're talking about measures with a broad diffusion of benefits. So, this is about trying to capture any student who's struggling in a classroom or anybody in the workplace who is feeling out of place. And so it could be a case of getting therapists or counselors, I mean, we definitely want to improve the student counselor ratio in our schools. The investments in school security tend to be more physical measures. We don't recognize that smaller class sizes or having resources in a school for mental health is also school safety. And so this is a major component of this, because we're trying to prevent not just mass shootings, but also accidental shootings or suicides and other forms of gun violence. We're trying to ensure that people are thriving in their schools and in workplaces. It's all part of the solution to this problem. JOHN DICKERSON: Dr. Peterson, based on the work that you've done, I wonder if you could help me understand a couple of things. One, if these are insiders in these instances, how does that affect these - - the proposals to lock -- basically lock up the schools? Second thing, what does your research show you about these drills, the preparedness drills, as they deal with these students? And also, if these are suicides, how does that affect the idea that a good person with a gun can stop a bad person with a gun? DR. JILLIAN PETERSON: Yes, I think once you recognize that the most likely perpetrator is a student in that school who is actively suicidal, it makes us think twice about some of these measures. So, things like security, I think, make us feel secure. They look secure. It's something kind of tangible, but the reality is, the most likely perpetrator is walking in and out of that security every day. You certainly want to have teachers and students prepared for the worst- case scenario, but the most likely situation is that perpetrator is running through all of those drills along with everyone else. And if the perpetrator is coming in with a goal of being killed in the shooting or killing themselves -- we talked to perpetrators who said: I did the shooting because I wanted to go in and be shot by the school resource officer. So, in that case, the good guy with a gun doesn't become a deterrent. It becomes an incentive in some of those cases. JOHN DICKERSON: Dr. Densley, what should we take from your work as we think about limitations on gun ownership, for example, the perpetrator's age? How is that affected by these bills to raise the age to 21? What other, when we think of the gun restrictions, matches up with what you found in your research? DR. JAMES DENSELY: Yes, it's a great question. It's often such a divisive issue. But I want to make sure that I preface this, that we approach this as researchers, and not as a sort of a partisan issue. And the evidence is actually very clear about this, which is, if you want to have a big impact quickly, then the action is with the firearms. And this is not about an infringement upon Second Amendment rights. It's around some reasonable, commonsense measures. And so some of the things that are being touted right now around age restrictions for accessing an assault rifle, for instance, or safe storage and ensuring that that is enforced, or universal background checks, or doing something around magazine size and magazine restrictions for these firearms, the evidence is really clear that these measures could have prevented some of these mass shootings that have occurred that we have documented in the database, and that they would ensure that these firearms are not falling into the wrong hands. Time and time again, we see, these are individuals who are in crisis. So, something like the red flag laws that are being discussed right now, for instance, are really quite interesting, because, if this is a person in crisis, that's not the time that they should be going out and purchasing a firearm. And this would put a temporary restriction on someone's ability to do that. And, again, it's just temporary, but it gets them the help they need, so that they're not using that gun for the perpetration of a mass shooting or any other sort of situation. JOHN DICKERSON: Jillian Peterson, you studied the shootings where things went wrong. What about instances in which someone was stopped before one of these mass shootings? What have you learned from that? DR. JILLIAN PETERSON: Yes, we also studied cases where somebody planned to do a mass shooting and changed their mind, even cases where the perpetrator actually went into the school with the gun in his backpack and didn't fire it. What's interesting about these cases is, time and time again, it seems to be a human connection, just a bit of hope that gets the person through that crisis point. It's somebody reaching out and connecting with them. I think it's so important that we're talking about gun control and threat assessment and these bigger policies, but then, at the end of the day, sometimes, it's literally just a human connection with another adult or another person that can get them through the moment. JOHN DICKERSON: All right, we've run out of time. Thank you both for your work and for being with us today. And we'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: That's it for us today.

            "article_content": "Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke won an unexpectedly tight race Thursday to become the Republican nominee in the race for a new U.S. House seat representing western Montana, a victory that comes after days of hand-counting ballots in one county. Zinke defeated former state Sen. Al \"Doc\" Olszewski by just over 1,600 votes out of 84,500 cast in the race, or 1.9 percentage points, according to preliminary numbers. Zinke was one of five Republicans on the primary ballot for the open seat, which Montana gained this year thanks to its growing population. In a statement, the former interior secretary said of his victory, \"Thank you Western Montana for your confidence that America can be fixed and for ignoring the political BS,\" and he went on to thank former President Trump, Sen. Steve Daines, and Gov. Greg Gianforte for their endorsements. Zinke served as Interior secretary under then-President Donald Trump, and his rivals have been drawing attention to a troubled tenure that was marked by multiple ethics investigations. One investigation determined Zinke lied to an agency ethics official about his continued involvement in a commercial real estate deal in his hometown. Federal prosecutors declined to pursue criminal charges. Despite Trump's endorsement, Zinke also faced a smear campaign over his military service from the extreme right wing of his party and questions about his residency following revelations that his wife declared a house in California as her primary residence, qualifying her for a tax break. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL, was considered a de facto incumbent since he twice won elections for the state's other House seat before stepping down in 2017 to join the Trump administration. Olszewski, an orthopedic surgeon and hardline conservative, tried to paint Zinke as a \"liberal insider.\" The political dynamics reflect the GOP's sharp right turn that meant Zinke's status as a former Cabinet member wasn't enough for some in his party. They said he was too soft on guns and didn't do enough to build Trump's envisioned wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. His wife's residence declaration boosted long-standing suspicions that Zinke spends most of his time outside Montana. Zinke doesn't deny that his wife is a California resident, and he acknowledges holding fundraisers there. He raised a total of $2.5 million through the end of March, almost as much as all other candidates from both parties combined, about 80% from out-of-state donors. The outcome in the close race was delayed after Lincoln County realized a vendor had printed ballots on the wrong sized paper, meaning they could not be run through a machine tabulator and had to be counted by hand. The hand count began Tuesday and wrapped up late Thursday afternoon. Zinke outpolled Olszewski in Lincoln County by 428 votes in unofficial results. In November, Zinke will face Olympic rower and attorney Monica Tranel, who won the Democratic primary for the U.S. House seat. Aaron Navarro contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Russian Ministry of Defense is in the process of purchasing millions of rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for its ongoing fight in Ukraine, according to a newly downgraded U.S. intelligence finding. A U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the intelligence determination, said Monday that the fact Russia is turning to the isolated state of North Korea demonstrates that \"the Russian military continues to suffer from severe supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and sanctions.\" \u00a0 U.S. intelligence officials believe that the Russians could look to purchase additional North Korean military equipment in the future. The intelligence finding was first reported by The New York Times. \u00a0 The U.S. official did not detail how much weaponry Russia intends to purchase from North Korea. \u00a0 The finding comes after the Biden administration recently confirmed that the Russian military in August took delivery of Iranian-manufactured drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine. The White House said last week that Russia has faced technical problems with Iranian-made drones acquired from Tehran in August for use in its war with Ukraine. \u00a0 Russia picked up Mohajer-6 and Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles over several days last month as part what the Biden administration says is likely part of a Russian plan to acquire hundreds of Iranian UAVs for use in Ukraine. \u00a0 North Korea has sought to tighten relations with Russia as much of Europe and the West has pulled away, blaming the United States for the Ukraine crisis and decrying the West's \"hegemonic policy\" as justifying military action by Russia in Ukraine to protect itself. The North Koreans have hinted interest in sending construction workers to help rebuild Russian-occupied territories in the country's east. North Korea's ambassador to Moscow recently met with envoys from two Russia-backed separatist territories in the Donbas region of Ukraine and expressed optimism about cooperation in the \"field of labor migration,\" citing his country's easing pandemic border controls. \u00a0 In July, North Korea became the only nation aside from Russia and Syria to recognize the independence of the territories, Donetsk and Luhansk, further aligning with Russia over the conflict in Ukraine. \u00a0 The North's arms export to Russia would be a violation of U.N. resolutions that ban the country from exporting to or importing weapons from other countries. Its possible dispatch of laborers to the Russian-held territories in Ukraine would also breach a U.N. resolution that required all member states to repatriate all North Korean workers from their soil by 2019. \u00a0 There have been suspicions that China and Russia haven't fully enforced U.N. sanctions on North Korea, complicating a U.S.-led attempt to deprive North Korea of its nuclear weapons. The provocative move by North Korea comes as the Biden administration has become increasingly concerned about stepped-up activity by North Korea in pursuit of nuclear weapons. North Korea has test-fired more than 30 ballistic missiles this year, including its first flights of intercontinental ballistic missiles since 2017, as leader Kim Jong Un pushes to advance his nuclear arsenal despite U.S.-led pressure and sanctions. The U.S. has frequently downgraded and unveiled intelligence findings over the course of the grinding war in Ukraine to highlight plans for Russian misinformation operations or to throw attention on Moscow's difficulties in prosecuting the war. Ukraine's smaller military has put up a stiff resistance against the militarily superior Russian forces. \u00a0 Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim have recently exchanged letters in which they both called for \"comprehensive\" and \"strategic and tactical\" cooperation between the countries. Moscow, for its part, has issued statements condemning the revival of large-scale military exercises between the United States and South Korea this year, which North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal. Russia, along with China, has called for the easing of U.N. sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear and missile tests. Both countries are members of the U.N. Security Council, which has approved a total of 11 rounds of sanctions on the North since 2006. In May, Russia and China vetoed a U.S.-led bid to impose new economic sanctions on North Korea over its high-profile missile tests this year. Some experts say that Kim could likely bolster his resolve to retain his nuclear weapons because he may think the Russian attack happened because Ukraine had signed away its nuclear arsenal. \u00a0 Relations between Moscow and Pyongyang go back to the 1948 foundation of North Korea, as Soviet officials installed young, ambitious nationalist Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un, as the country's first ruler. Since then, Soviet aid shipment had been crucial in keeping North Korea's economy afloat for decades before the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. \u00a0 Moscow had since established formal diplomatic relations with Seoul as part of its hopes to draw South Korean investment and allowed its Soviet-era military alliance with North Korea to expire. But after his election in 2000, Putin actively sought to restore his country's ties with North Korea in what was seen as an effort to regain its traditional domains of influence and secure more allies to better deal with the United States.",

            "article_content": "Early voting in the Arizona primary is underway as the Republican candidates for Senate faced off in a tense debate Wednesday night.\u00a0 The debate, hosted by conservative TV network Newsmax, just days before former President Donald Trump is scheduled to campaign in the state, featured venture capitalist Blake Masters, businessman Jim Lamon and retired U.S. Air Force Maj.

But more than a third of voters in the poll also said they remain undecided.\u00a0 Lamon said Arizona voters don't want a \"young politician\" in Washington, D.C., an apparent swipe at his 35-year-old opponent Masters.\u00a0 \"Don't send more young politicians and lawyers, guys, send someone who's been through the real rigors of American society and work,\" Lamon said. \u00a0 He also called Masters, who is backed by big tech billionaire and PayPal co-founder Peter Theil, a \"California globalist.\" Masters fired back at Lamon saying, \"I've spent more years of my life in Arizona than Jim Lamon.\"\u00a0 \"You can tell from his accent, he's from a different part of the country. We welcome people here, that's fine,\" Masters said. \"But I am Arizonan, and this is a bulls\u2014 attack.\" Masters repeatedly mentioned his endorsement from Trump as he sought to fend off Lamon's attacks.\u00a0 \"We need to implement these America first policies,\" Masters said. \"President Trump trusts me to do that. He met with Jim Lamon, he thought he was a bozo. I am the America first candidate, that is why I am endorsed.\"\u00a0 While Masters and Lamon spent much of the debate attacking each other, one top-polling candidate was notably missing from the stage. State Attorney General Mark Brnovich was invited, and met the criteria for qualifying, but opted not to attend.\u00a0 A spokesperson for Brnovich told CBS News the attorney general was traveling to Washington, D.C. on official business to \"fight for the people of Arizona and against the Biden Administration's open-border policies.\"\u00a0 This final Republican Senate primary debate, and Trump's looming visit to the state on Saturday, has put Arizona in the political spotlight. It is one the last major 2022 battleground states to hold a primary this cycle.\u00a0 Trump on Saturday will rally for Masters in Prescott Valley, one of the most conservative parts of the state. The former president has inserted himself in several high profile primary battles this year, including in Nevada, Pennsylvania and Georgia.\u00a0 The winner of the Aug. 2 primary will take on Sen. Kelly in November. Kelly announced on Wednesday that he's raised $13.6 million in the second quarter of 2022, and currently has $25 million cash on hand to defend his seat.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the intersection between politics and tech.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump called Russia's invasion of Ukraine \"an atrocity that should have never been allowed to occur,\" but put the blame on President Biden's administration. In his remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, the former commander in chief predicted \"a major war in Europe\" would erupt. Trump, who has already endorsed over 120 local and federal Republican candidates in the 2022 midterm elections, also made a strong suggestion that he is going to run for president in 2024. \"[Democrats] are going to find out the hard way starting on November 8, and then again even more so on November 2024. They will find out like never before. We did it twice. We will do it again. We are going to be doing it again a third time,\" Trump said. Trump was heavily criticized by Democrats and received lukewarm responses from some fellow Republicans for recently calling Russian President Vladimir Putin \"savvy\" and \"smart.\" On Saturday, he doubled down on his comments. \"The problem is not that Putin is smart, which of course he's smart, but the real problem is that our leaders are dumb,\" Trump said to the crowd of more than 5,000 attendees.\u00a0 While Trump's first mention of Ukraine was to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"a brave man,\" he then used the crisis to attack Mr. Biden's policies concerning the southern border with Mexico, taking a similar stance as some other right-wing activists and Congressional candidates. Trump, who instituted controversial initiatives, like the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, said the Biden administration \"has spent months obsessing over how to stop an invasion of a foreign country thousands of miles away. You can't defend western civilization if you would not be able to defend your own civilization.\" He noted other instances of Russian aggression under prior presidents, and again leaned into his baseless claim of the 2020 election being stolen, saying the conflict would not have happened if he was president.\u00a0 Trump, along with many other speakers throughout the weekend, drew comparisons between the Biden administration's reaction to Russia's invasion with the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.\u00a0 Trump also praised controversial GOP Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was criticized for attending a white nationalist event on Friday. \"A person who is very shy does not like speaking her mind. But she does it anyway, Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" he said to cheers from the crowd. Greene told CBS News at CPAC on Saturday that she didn't know Nick Fuentes, a white nationalist who founded the American First Political Action Conference, and was not aware of his views when she agreed to speak at the event. Chair of the national GOP declined to stop and discuss \u2066@RepMTG\u2069\u2019s appearance at a white nationalist conference\u2026. pic.twitter.com/cZM1jKtRhq Trump also took a swipe at Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for allowing Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bill to pass Congress. Trump has repeatedly tried to recruit Florida Senator Rick Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, to run against McConnell for the GOP Senate leadership position. Scott has said he would not challenge McConnell for the role. During a \"Save America PAC\" event prior to his CPAC remarks, Trump told the 150 in attendance that they would be \"very happy\" when they asked when he might be announcing a 2024 presidential bid. As first reported by the New York Times, Trump also said he knew who they \"don't want as your V.P,\" referring to former Vice President Pence. Trump also went out of his way to call McConnell \"weak,\" according to two people in the room. Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "Uvalde, Texas \u2014 New questions are emerging about Uvalde schools Police Chief Peter Arredondo a week after a gunman massacred 19 fourth graders and two teachers at Robb Elementary.\u00a0 In a statement to CBS News Tuesday, the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) said, \"The Uvalde Police Department and Uvalde [school district] Police have been cooperating with investigators. The chief of the Uvalde [school district] Police provided an initial interview but has not responded to a request for a follow-up interview with the Texas Rangers that was made two days ago.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 However, in a statement to CNN on Wednesday, Arredondo said he is \"in touch with DPS everyday.\"   It was Arredondo who ordered officers to remain outside the classroom where the gunman was holed up during the siege. Questions are being asked about why Arredondo was in a position to make that decision and why he chose what he did, CBS Dallas reports. Agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection ultimately breached the classroom area and fatally shot the suspect more than an hour after the shooter entered the building. Texas DPS Director Steven McCraw said that during the time law enforcement was waiting to breach the classroom, children pleaded on the phone with 911 operators to send in police. Arredondo was elected to the Uvalde City Council on May 7 and was sworn in Tuesday. \"Out of respect for the families who buried their children today, and who are planning to bury their children in the next few days, no ceremony was held,\" Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin said in a statement. Following reports that Arredondo wouldn't be sworn in, McLaughlin said in a statement on Monday that \"there is nothing in the City Charter, Election Code, or Texas Constitution that prohibits him from taking the oath of office. To our knowledge, we are currently not aware of any investigation of Mr. Arredondo.\" It wasn't clear whether the law allows Arredondo to hold both posts and whether he would. Meanwhile Uvalde has begun to bury its dead. The first two children who lost their lives were laid to rest Tuesday. Amerie Jo Garza and Maite Rodriguez, both 10, were fourth grade classmates. A funeral will be held Wednesday for one of the two teachers slain in the attack. Irma Garcia will be buried along with her husband, Joe, who died of a heart attack two days after the shooting. Family members say he succumbed to a broken heart. The funeral for 10-year-old Jose Flores will also be held Wednesday.",

            "article_content": "Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said Friday he wants to change the name of a notorious drug-producing area known as \"The Golden Triangle\" to \"The Triangle of Good, Hard-Working People.\" The remote, mountainous area in northern Mexico is where the borders of the three states of Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Durango meet. For decades, drug cartels have used the area to grow marijuana and opium poppies, because much of region is difficult to access and has little police or army presence. But L\u00f3pez Obrador said Friday during a visit to the region that the name unfairly stigmatized residents. \"I don't like it, it bothers me that it is called the Golden Triangle, and hopefully we can all try to find a way to call it 'The Triangle of Good, Hard-Working People' or 'the region of good neighbors,' or something like that,\" he said. \"This has to change already because there is much goodness here, a lot of good, hard-working people, as has been said,\" the president said. L\u00f3pez Obrador has sometimes praised drug cartel leaders and in 2019 ordered the release of Ovidio Guzman, one of \"El Chapo\" Guzman's sons, to avoid bloodshed after Sinaloa Cartel gunmen assaulted the city of Culiacan to try to win his release. In 2021, L\u00f3pez Obrador praised the largely peaceful voting in elections that year and sent a message of recognition to the drug cartels that fuel much of the country's violence. \"People who belong to organized crime behaved very well, in general, there were few acts of violence by these groups,\" the president said. \"I think the white-collar criminals acted worse.\" Mexico has been trapped in a spiral of cartel-related violence that has left more than 340,000 dead since 2006, when the government launched a controversial anti-drug operation with federal troops. Last month, authorities said suspected drug cartel gunmen\u00a0abducted two off-duty female soldiers\u00a0at gunpoint for several hours. That same month, L\u00f3pez Obrador confirmed that\u00a0Mexico had dissolved a special unit\u00a0trained by U.S. authorities to fight drug cartels because it was infiltrated by criminals.\u00a0 In March, L\u00f3pez Obrador accused popular television shows of glamorizing the violent drug trade. He criticized TV series on platforms such as Netflix, saying they presented a rose-colored version of the lifestyles of drug traffickers.\u00a0 He told reporters the shows feature \"gangs of drug traffickers, with actors, men, beautiful women, property, the latest cars, jewelry, designer clothes, power.\" Earlier this month, Mexican authorities announced they\u00a0captured a suspected leader of the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). Francisco Javier Rodriguez Hernandez, known as \"El Se\u00f1or\u00f3n\" or \"XL\" or \"Frank,\" was apprehended in the tourist city of Mazatlan, in the northwest state of Sinaloa, in an operation carried out by navy agents. The Department of Justice\u00a0considers\u00a0the Jalisco cartel to be \"one of the five most dangerous transnational criminal organizations in the world.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 The head of CJNG,\u00a0Nemesio \"El Mencho\" Oseguera, is one of the most wanted drug lords in the world, with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration offering $10 million for his arrest. \"He is the number one priority for DEA and frankly for federal law enforcement in the United States,\" DEA agent Matthew Donahue\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0in 2019.

            "article_content": "On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click\u00a0here\u00a0to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. This week on Face the Nation: In the five days following the massacre of 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, the heartbreak has intensified, as the outrage over the botched police response grows. We're learning more about the missed signals from the troubled 18-year-old shooter and what's now looking like an avalanche of errors on the part of the school district's law enforcement. Our coverage begins at the scene of Tuesday's shooting in Uvalde and CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca. OMAR VILLAFRANCA: The sorrow is overwhelming. People come to this memorial behind me to pray and cry together. But they're also asking for answers and accountability from law enforcement and lawmakers. (Begin VT) OMAR VILLAFRANCA (voice-over): While thousands stopped to pray at the memorial in Uvalde's town square Saturday, even more are asking for answers as to what went wrong with the police response on Tuesday at Robb Elementary. These photos taken outside the school show state and federal officers pulling students and faculty out of the building, the children running to safety, horror clearly visible on their faces. At first, investigators said a school police officer confronted the shooter when he arrived on the scene. Troopers claimed he then ran inside, went on a shooting rampage, then was fatally shot by officers. But in the following days, law enforcement reports changed. On Friday, investigators said a school resource officer never confronted the shooter because the officer was not on campus. Troopers now say the 18-year-old gunman entered the building through a door that had been propped open by a teacher and immediately entered the fourth grade classroom. At one point, 19 officers, including members of a federal Border Patrol tactical unit ready to engage, were outside the classroom for more than 40 minutes, where the gunman was still firing rounds. But, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety, the commanding officer, Uvalde's Unified Schools police chief, Pete Arredondo, made the decision to hold back officers, saying the situation was now a barricaded person, not an active shooter, and required different resources, a decision that investigators now say was the wrong move. STEVEN MCCRAW (Director, Texas Department of Public Safety): Of course it was not the right decision. It was the wrong decision, period. There's no excuse for that. OMAR VILLAFRANCA: The decision is contrary to the state's active shooter response training, which the district went through, that states: \"The best hope that innocent victims have is that officers immediately move into action to isolate, distract or neutralize the threat, even if that means one officer acting alone.\" With officers outside, teachers and students made multiple 911 calls from inside the classroom, begging for police to charge in. QUESTION: You had 911 calls at 12:10, 12:13, 12:16. DIRECTOR STEVEN MCCRAW: Yes. QUESTION: The shooter wasn't killed until 12:50. Did any of those 911 callers survive? DIRECTOR STEVEN MCCRAW: Yes. QUESTION: Did all of them? (CROSSTALK) DIRECTOR STEVEN MCCRAW: I tell you that with certainty, but more than one survived. OMAR VILLAFRANCA: Texas Governor Greg Abbott had to explain why he initially praised the officers' response. GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT (R-Texas): The information that I was given turned out, in part, to be inaccurate. And I'm absolutely livid about that. (End VT) OMAR VILLAFRANCA: Some Texas lawmakers are upset, and they want a federal investigation into what went wrong here. President Biden is expected to visit this memorial and meet with grieving family members -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Omar Villafranca, thank you. We turn now to Uvalde County Commissioner Ronald Garza. Good morning to you, sir. And I know we are all so sorry. RONALD GARZA (Uvalde County, Texas, Commissioner): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We are all so sorry for what your community is going through, not just with this awful massacre, but now these painful revelations about the response. Do you know why the school district police commander was not there when the shooting began? COMMISSIONER RONALD GARZA: I have no idea, Margaret. I'm like a lot of people. We're still in the dark about that. We're still learning of new developments that are coming to light. But my heart goes out to the community. We're emotionally shattered. And we're -- we're just really sad right now. It's a time of mourning and - - in our community. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know. I have read that it's also a time of anger, and that the chief of police for the school district is now under police protection himself. Is that -- is that right? Is that reflective of the feeling in the community right now? COMMISSIONER RONALD GARZA: Well, rightly so. You know, people are asking questions. Parents lost children. They're devastated. And it's -- it's just a sad situation. And I think the community deserves answers. MARGARET BRENNAN: I just want to clarify. I said the police commander. The police officer assigned to the school from the Independent School District was not on site during the shooting. Do you know why? COMMISSIONER RONALD GARZA: I do know that we have multiple campuses here, Margaret. It's -- perhaps he was at another campus when the shooting started. But no, I, -- he could have been at another campus. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I ask you that because what's happened in your community has led to conversations in communities around the country about whether there needs to be more security at schools. Some lawmakers here in Washington are calling for more resources to do that. But, in your district, you have an entire police unit that's dedicated to the school district. What was the problem a lack of security? COMMISSIONER RONALD GARZA: You know, perhaps. Perhaps it was a lack of security, training. I think there's multiple factors that might be involved here. But, right now, it's easy -- it's easy to point fingers right now. It's easy to play the blame game. But our community, I think, needs to focus on the -- on healing right now. And, yes, we do welcome the investigation. I understand Congressman Joaquin Castro is asking the FBI to intervene. And we -- I welcome that, that investigation. I think we need to learn more. As tragic as this may seem, we need to learn from this. And parents deserve answers. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any indication as to the motive of the shooter? I know you know this community. And I have read you knew his family. COMMISSIONER RONALD GARZA: Yes, I have no indication as to why or what the motive was. The family of the shooter is a good family. You know, I have said this before on other networks. They are a family of faith. They value church. They value hard work. I have known them for many years, great-grandparents, grandparents, uncles, aunts. And this should not be a reflection on them. You know, we raise our children, and we try to raise them in the right way, but, sometimes, our children have different thoughts, have different attitudes, personalities. But we do the best we can. MARGARET BRENNAN: In Sandy Hook, the shooter's home and the school itself were destroyed. Is that what's going to happen in Uvalde? COMMISSIONER RONALD GARZA: I'm not sure. I have mixed emotions about destroying the school. Many people, students that I know of -- I went through that school. And my teacher taught my -- I'm sorry -- my dad taught there. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. COMMISSIONER RONALD GARZA: That was his second teaching assignment. My grandkids went through there. And my kids went through there. Those pecan trees that are out there at Robb School, my dad planted them in 1965. Every day after school, he and a few students would water those pecan trees. So, we have very strong ties to the school. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. COMMISSIONER RONALD GARZA: And my opinion is, I hope it's not -- the school is not razed. Yes, do we need a memorial out there? Maybe do we need to section off the area where the shooting took place? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. COMMISSIONER RONALD GARZA: Perhaps. But that -- and, again, that's just my opinion. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Commissioner, thank you for your time this morning. And our condolences. The National Rifle Association gathered this weekend in Houston just 300 miles away from Uvalde. Tensions between protesters and NRA members flared as part of the intensifying national debate over guns, schools and culture. Our Robert Costa reports. (Begin VT) PROTESTER #1: It could be your kids today! ROBERT COSTA (voice-over): High emotions just outside the convention and heated exchanges dotted the weekend in Houston... PROTESTER #2: Nineteen kids are dead! ROBERT COSTA: ... from Senator Ted Cruz being confronted in a sushi restaurant... MAN #1: What about background checks? ROBERT COSTA: ... to members of the Proud Boys, a far right group linked to last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol, confronting protesters on Saturday. MAN #2: They won't let me come over there! (EXPLETIVE DELETED) ROBERT COSTA: Some of those protesters included children making their own pleas for reform. STUDENT: I really shouldn't be having to be scared to go to school. And my mom shouldn't really be having -- shouldn't be scared to send me to school every day. GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM (R-South Dakota): They use the tragic situation to push their agenda. And it is all about control. And it is garbage. Now is not the time to cave to the woke culture. ROBERT COSTA: With gun talks in a divided Washington far from certain to gain traction, it was school security that was a flash point. SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): Fire exits should only open out at that single point of entry. We should have multiple armed police officers, ultimately. As we all know, what stops armed bad guys is armed good guys. WAYNE LAPIERRE (Executive Vice President, National Rifle Association): Our children deserve at least and, in fact, more protection than our banks, stadiums and government buildings. ROBERT COSTA: Many NRA members, including some teachers, called for more instructors to be armed. More guns in schools? WOMAN: I think it wouldn't hurt, if the teachers train and they feel comfortable. ROBERT COSTA: But some parents and teachers union leaders disagreed. BECKY PRINGLE (President, National Education Association): NRA members haven't spent a day in our classrooms. Who are we going to listen to, our teachers, who have trained and worked with our kids for years, and our parents and our communities, or the NRA, who is trying to make money? (End VT) ROBERT COSTA: Advocates for more gun laws have also expressed hope that bipartisan discussions in Congress on red flag laws and expanded background checks will begin to win support. But they know that many Republican lawmakers are wary of breaking with the NRA so close to the midterm elections -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Robert Costa in Houston. Thank you. We turn now to Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, who joins us from Little Rock. Good morning to you, Governor. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON (R-Arkansas): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We've spoken before about this because after Sandy Hook and the massacre in Connecticut, you ran the NRA's task force on how to stop school shootings. So you've thought a lot about this. There was an armed officer assigned to the elementary school in Uvalde. And then you had a police force response, where they did not confront the shooter, who was carrying an AR-15. In Buffalo, the armed guard who was at that grocery store confronted the shooter, but was killed. In Parkland, Florida, there was an armed officer on site who did not intervene. Doesn't this show that this is an insufficient solution to the problem? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, it certainly shows that you have to have multiple layers of security to protect the children. And there's also the factor of human error. And that's the reason that you've got to have different layers. You can't rely upon just one technique. School Safety is something that we all have to focus on coming out of the incredible tragedy that we see in Uvalde. We have to look at how we can better secure our schools. And it is about the single point of entry, that, by blocking it open, allowed the gunman to come in. It is about the mental health issues, where we've got to do better to identify those that are potentially a mass killer. You've got to have our private sector Internet providers to do better in using technology to identify these kinds of dangerous violent communications much quicker. And then, of course, we have to be able to train our officers properly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: I -- we're going to have to learn a lot more facts as to some of the things that happened in Uvalde. Let's be patient. Let's learn from them. But we can't give up on our most precious resource in protecting our children. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think a lot of people would agree with many of the things you just said, but then they would ask, why can't we talk about the weapon? I understand a lot of people may want a long gun to go hunting. But then there's this AR-15-style weapon, semiautomatic, not that good for hunting. The bullets travel three times the speed of sound. They literally blow bodies apart. That's what was used in Buffalo. It was used in Sandy Hook. It was used in Uvalde. Why not raise the minimum age of purchase to 21 from 18? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, you've seen some states actually do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: And you've seen it in Florida. You've seen it in California. In California, the restriction was held as unconstitutional. So there are some constitutional challenges to that. Ultimately, I think the Supreme Court is going to give us guidance on it. But you look at AR-15... MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would endorse that? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: ... and, first of all, each one has to have -- no, I want to give a little bit more history. AR-15s were around for 40 years before they were ever used in any type of mass killing or attack. And so it is about the human heart. It is about identifying the culprits and going after them. And I think it is a discussion you can have. I come down on the point that that's not going to be the solution. And it's going to cause more harm than good. In Arkansas, for example, as you pointed out, the long rifles, we distinguish those, and those you can acquire at 18, because we hunt with those. We -- it's a culture that we start when we're 14 or 15 here in Arkansas. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: And so that's important part of it, and it's a step to go to the AR-15s and how you draft laws that would distinguish those. That'll be a part of the discussion. I come down I don't think that's a solution. And we shouldn't focus on that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the gunman in Texas and in New York legally purchased those AR-15s. They didn't set off any kind of concern, because they didn't have mental health issues that were on record. They didn't have criminal background checks. Are you saying that it was their legal right and should remain the legal right of anyone like them to go in and buy an AR-15? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, an AR-15 is a semiautomatic weapon, just like you have a semiautomatic pistol. It takes a pull of the trigger on each one of those. We ought to outlaw the bump stocks and ways that you can convert that from a semiautomatic to an automatic weapon. That is important to distinguish those two. It is an AR-15-style weapon that has been used lately, but, again, for 40 years, it wasn't. And so why is this happening? I think it's copycats. But are we really going after the heart of the problem, or are we going after what we see is the latest trend? MARGARET BRENNAN: But... GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: And I think it's more important to protect the schools, invest in that. Let's do things.._ MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but why does it have to be either/or? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: ... that we can agree upon now. And I think that... MARGARET BRENNAN: Why does it have to be either or? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: It doesn't have to be either/or. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because I think people do want to look at all those other things you rattled off, like mental health, like school security. Let me ask you about something specific, then. The shooter went into that room, that elementary school in Uvalde with 660 rounds of ammunition, and that AR-15 style weapon. That's more than three times what a U.S. soldier carries into combat. Should a purchase of ammunition of that size set off an alarm bell somewhere? Should there be some kind of screening or limit on high-capacity magazines? Like, what legal justification should there be for an 18-year- old to go in and buy that kind of ammunition? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: It sets off all kinds of alarm bells. Let me emphasize the point you can do either/or. You can have the conversation about both. I think the senators that are coming together in a bipartisan way to talk about what we can agree upon is important. I have communicated with a number of governors. I would like to see a similar bipartisan working group of governors, Democrats and Republicans, seeing, what is it we can agree upon that we can address this and learn from this? So, yes. And whenever you're looking at the alarm bells, whenever you're looking at these very odd purchases, somebody just turned 18, something has to trigger an alarm bell, somebody says let's alert law enforcement to this. This is a concern. I do think we need to look at those type of triggers that can alert law enforcement. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will look at limits on high-capacity magazines and the potential for what you just laid out. Governor, thank you for your time this morning. Face the Nation will be back in a minute, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House did decline our invitation for a member of the administration to come on the show today, saying they were leaving it up to Congress to act. We're joined now by Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat leading bipartisan negotiations over gun reforms in Congress. And he joins us from Hartford, Connecticut. Senator, welcome to the program. You've said in some powerful remarks this week that what you are looking to do is, to use your word, incremental change when it comes to gun safety. You are talking to Republicans about red flag laws, expanding background checks. Can you get ten Republicans to vote with you on either of those two measures? SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY (D-Connecticut): I think we can. I think there is something dying inside the soul of this country when we refuse to act at a national level shooting after shooting. And I do think there's an opportunity right now to be able to pass something significant. I have seen more Republican interest in coming to the table and talking this time than at any other moment since Sandy Hook. It is true Republicans are not willing to support everything that I support, like banning assault weapons. But I really think that we could pass something that saves lives and breaks this logjam that we've had for 30 years, proving to Republicans that, if you vote to tighten the nation's gun laws, the sky doesn't fall for you politically. In fact, you probably will get a lot of new additional supporters. So red flag laws are on the table, background checks expansion, and -- on the table, as well as things like safe storage of guns. I think we can get something done. But we don't have a lot of time. MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't. In those starting points in your talks with Republicans, are you also discussing some of what Governor Hutchinson just laid out as Republican priorities? SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Listen, we're looking for an old-school compromise in which we both tighten the nation's gun laws to make sure that only law- abiding citizens get their hands on these very powerful weapons, but also invest in school security and mental health. I mean, it is true that we should have an all-of-the-above strategy. And that's ultimately the path to 60 votes. So, I'm willing to vote for some things that harden our schools that make me a little uncomfortable, frankly, if Republicans are willing to vote to tighten up the nation's firearms laws in a way that they have been unwilling to do previously. That's the nature of a compromise. And I think, right now, parents in this country and kids are desperate for us to do something. They are frightened.They're anxious. And we will just add to their anxiety if nothing happens again. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about limits on high-capacity magazines? SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: I think it's unlikely that we're going to be able to get 60 votes for that right now. That's a question that'll probably have to be left up to the voters. It's not out of the realm of possibility we might take a vote on that in the Senate, but I don't see that having 60 votes. It's in the category of things I think would save lives. I have always said that I'm not sure that that shooter would have even walked into the school in Sandy Hook if he didn't have an assault rifle and those high-capacity magazines. But I'm not sure that we have the votes right now for that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Murphy, stay with us, please. We're going to continue our conversation in a moment. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR, or we're available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. And we're replayed on our CBS News Streaming Network at noon Eastern. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, including more with Senator Chris Murphy and former Orlando Police Chief and now Congresswoman Val Demings. So, stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to continue our conversation now with Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. Senator, I want to get into the specifics of some of what you are talking to your fellow senators about. But I want to start with something else. I grew up in a town next to Sandy Hook. I know you represented that district when you were a congressman at the time of the shooting. You spoke on the Senate floor quite passionately this week about not just the victims but the survivors, and the PTSD that these little children have just walking back into a classroom and remembering having to walk over bodies. Can you talk a little bit about what this does to a community, to the first responders, and to the survivors? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Especially in these smaller towns. I just think it's important to understand how communities can't come back from this because data says everybody that's killed has 20 people that experienced diagnosable trauma because of that murder. But in these schools, every single kid in Sandy Hook and Uvalde heard those gunshots. They all know the kids that died. Many of them did in Sandy Hook have to walk over and around dead bodies. These are horrific, grizzly stories. And, of course, the same thing can be said of neighborhoods like the one that I live in, in the south end of Hartford. These are neighborhoods where kids fear for their life every single day when they walk to and from school, frankly, for many of these kids. In urban neighborhoods, school is the safe place. Every single day is a trauma because they fear for their lives. So, we need to understand, we are putting on top of kids today, who already are living in an era of social media and pandemics, a level of trauma and fear that makes it very difficult for them to learn when they are in school. I've got two school-aged kids. You've got young kids. And the idea that they have to worry about where they're going to run in their school if a shooter walks in instead of worrying about how they're going to do on a test that day, it only happens in America. And when a shooting like this happens, in a neighborhood or in a school, those communities never, ever recover. That's just the reality. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for that. On the specifics, how would your federal background check have stopped either of these two shooters, in Buffalo and in Texas. Neither of them had criminal records. Neither of them had known mental health issues. New York already had a red flag law. That didn't stop the shooter there in Buffalo. How would these proposals have stopped these cases? CHRIS MURPHY: So, listen, I just don't get into the trap of having to write a law for the last mass shooting that captured the nation's attention. What I know is that on the same day of the shooting in Uvalde, there were 100 plus other people in this country who died, and their mothers and fathers are grieving just as hard as the parents in Uvalde. So, by tightening up the nation's background checks, data system -- data shows us that we will save thousands of lives. And, yes, a federal red flag law, like the one we're talking about in these negotiations, certainly could have helped in Texas. What we also know is that federal funding to help implement these laws, to make law enforcement know how to use them, can help in many states as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. CHRIS MURPHY: So, no one law is going to save everybody, but there's a lot of lives to be saved by the things that are on the table in these negotiations. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator, thank you for your time today. We're going to go now to Orlando, Florida, and Democratic Congresswoman Val Demings. Before serving in Congress, she was the chief of police for Orlando. Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us. REP. VAL DEMINGS (D-FL): It's great to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: As -- as a former police chief, what is the single piece of legislation that you think would be most affective right now? VAL DEMINGS: Well, Margaret, look, 27 years at the police department, served as the chief of police, our primary responsibility was the safety of the people that we served. And I believe that we have a direct obligation. I cannot, like I'm sure millions of Americans across the nation, cannot get the faces of those survives from the classroom in Uvalde. We have a direct obligation to move forward to make sure that they're safe. I believe right now, if the United States Senate -- because the House has done their job -- I believe right now if the Senate would look at passing the background check law, as well as looking at red flags. Right here in Florida, we have almost 6,000 cases where red flag laws have made a difference, at least according to law enforcement and other people involved in those cases. And we have a direct obligation to do what we can when we can. And I believe that those are two pieces of legislation that have overwhelming public support. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. VAL DEMINGS: We can get it done if the Senate has the political will to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think there needs to be more federal money to shore up security at schools? The White House says they've already helped to push about $10 billion out to state for public safety. VAL DEMINGS: I think we also should look at school safety every day. I think there should always be an assessment as technology has changed. We need to use the best, the most state-of-the-art technology. But, Margaret, our children are not in school 24 hours a day. So certainly, let's make sure we make our schools secure. Let's make sure we try to eliminate the human era factor. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. VAL DEMINGS: But what about churches? What about synagogues? What about grocery stores? What about movie theaters? We've got to do a job of keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people. There again, the Senate can take action on that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about this response in Texas because, apart from the shooter, now there's this probe of what the police did with their response that day. You know, after the massacre in Parkland, the school officer who was assigned to protect those kids was later charged with criminal negligence for his inaction. Given what we've learned about what happened in Texas, should we expect the same there? VAL DEMINGS: Well, what we must demand is a thorough and complete investigation. Margaret, I served as a law enforcement officer pre- Columbine. I served as a law enforcement officer post-Columbine. Pre- Columbine, we would respond to an active shooter situation. We would secure the perimeter and then we would wait for the crisis negotiators and the SWAT team. I served as a crisis negotiator for 12 years. We all know post-Columbine there is no time to waste. That the officers on that scene are expected to go into those active-shooter situations. We trained on it at the Orlando Police Department, and every sworn member, including the chief of police, went through the active-shooter training. So, obviously, that did not happen. The other important thing, those early minutes after the shooting, we know that there's a demand for more and more information. But the information that we give, especially when we say an SRO, a school resource officer went in and basically engaged the suspect and ammunition or bullets were fired, and that's not true, the communications -- we have to make sure that it is as clear and as accurate as possible. So, there's a lot of work to do there. We have certainly more questions than answers. And I know that we're going to get to the bottom of it. Look, I know from my years -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Should there be some sort of federal probe or some sort of school shooting safety board at the federal level, or is this all to Texas state police? VAL DEMINGS: Well, what we do know is that there were multiple agencies involved. I personally think the wrong agency was in charge of that scene. But let me say this, I wasn't there on the ground. I know that police officers have a tough job in these active shooter situations, as we've seen time and time again they're usually outgunned. We know that. But we must, Margaret, demand an investigation. And I believe that the FBI -- I mean that would be my vote for a federal investigation. But I do believe, since there were so many agencies involved on the ground, it's important that we know what role every agency played. It's important that we know was there any discussion about going in? Those 19 officers who I'm told were in the hallway, were there any discussions between other commanders from other departments? We must know the answers to those questions. And I think a federal investigation is certainly in order. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you quickly, are you satisfied with the scope of President Biden's executive order on police reform this week? VAL DEMINGS: Well, I certainly think the duty to intervene. And, look, we know that police departments come in different sizes. Some that are 35,000. Some are as small as 10 or six. And so the level of training that they get is different. But duty to intervene the de-escalation training being included in use of force, making sure that the public is aware of criminal -- or, not criminal, but misconduct -- it could be criminal in some cases. I think all of those things are a good start. But, Margaret, that's all they are. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. VAL DEMINGS: I also think we need to look at training across the board with law enforcement and let's standardize the training so the small agencies will have the benefit of good training, just like the larger agencies. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Demings, thank you very much for your time. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The shootings in both Buffalo and Uvalde have brought yet another degree of anguish as we honor those who've died defending America on this Memorial Day weekend. On Saturday, President Biden gave a commencement address in Delaware, where he noted the pain of burying a child. Vice President Kamala Harris attended the funeral for 86-year-old Ruth Whitfield, the last victim to be buried following that shooting in Buffalo just two weeks ago. (BEGIN VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): And as I speak, those parents are literally preparing to bury their children. In the United States of America, to bury their children. There's too much violence, too much fear, too much grief. KAMALA HARRIS (Vice President of the United States): And so this is a moment that requires all good people, all God-loving people, to stand up and say, we will not stand for this. Enough is enough. (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Enough is enough. Certainly something that's been said before. Here's a look at more of what's been said as history seemingly continues to repeat itself. (BEGIN VT) MARGARET BRENNAN (voice over): There is a numbing regularity to each tragic shooting in America. But the mass murder of elementary school children is enough to take our collective breath away. JOE BIDEN: To lose a child is like having a piece of your soul ripped away. MARGARET BRENNAN: As we watch those Uvalde parents, we pray that none of us ever bury our children or count the anguished seconds until we're told whether our child survived, that we never have to resort to DNA samples to identify their body. How can American parents endure that nightmare? How can our kids? In the past decade, there have been 3,500 mass shootings. But how do you measure the collateral damage or the trauma, the anxiety that sits with witnesses and first responders? We promised to protect our kids after Columbine. BILL CLINTON (Former U.S. President): We much do more to reach out to our children and teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts with words, not weapons. MARGARET BRENNAN: And Virginia Tech. GEORGE W. BUSH (Former U.S. President): Schools should be places of safety and sanctuary and learning. MARGARET BRENNAN: The slaughter of 20 first graders in Sandy Hook shocked our conscience. BARACK OBAMA (Former U.S. President): No single law, no set of laws, can eliminate evil from the world or prevent every senseless act of violence in our society. But that can't be an excuse for inaction. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress did not act, but since that time Connecticut and other states signed more than 350 pieces of gun safety legislation into law. The upswell of activism among teens who marched for their lives after the 2018 Parkland shooting did not change federal law. DONALD TRUMP (Former U.S. President): No child, no teacher, should ever be in danger in an American school. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it did lead to modest changes in the state of Florida. Is that enough? As we drop off our own kids at school, the question among many parents remains, how do we protect them? And is this really the best we can do? (END VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined now by two people who lived through similar horrors to what we have seen in Uvalde. Nicole Hockley's son, Dylan, was six years old when he was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Hockley is now the CEO of Sandy Hook Promise Foundation. Jaclyn Corin was the junior class president at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. She and her classmates organized the March for Our Lives in Washington in 2018, and they are planning another march here in just a few weeks. Good morning to both of you. I'm sorry you had to listen to that revisiting of history. I know it is painful. And I thank you both for coming on and speaking so bravely today. I want to ask you, Nicole, \"The Washington Post\" is now reporting that the shooter had a history online of using threatening language, specifically targeting violence against young women in particular. He was described as rage-filled, isolated, into video games. I know you're working to raise awareness of warning signs. Are these common signs? Is this what we need to be looking for? NICOLE HOCKLEY (Co-Founder and CEO, Sandy Hook Promise Foundation): Yes. Unfortunately, in almost every mass shooting or innocence of violence like this, there are signs present. We just need to learn to know what to recognize, how to recognize them, and then how to take action. That's what we teach across the country at Sandy Hook Promise, and it has had tangible impact in the lives saved in school planned -- shooting plans averted. However, you need -- this is -- that's about behavioral change and how do we know what to look for and take action? We also then need legislation to support and enforce those behavior. So, it is -- it's an \"and\" situation and not an \"or.\" But knowing the signs and recognizing them is critical to preventing violence before it happens. MARGARET BRENNAN: What kind of legislation? Is that the sort of red flag law that is being promoted? NICOLE HOCKLEY: Yes. Yes. Extremist (ph) protection orders and background checks, working hand in hand, background checks looking at your history, what -- where have you displayed at-risk behaviors in the past, and should you be responsible for a firearm. And extremist protection orders, or red flag laws is like, what's your current state of mind? Are you going into crisis? Are people worried about you? Should you be temporarily separated from weapons so that you can't move forward but that you can then de- escalate and get the help that you need and then be deemed safe if you have -- should have firearms again. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jaclyn, I know that you are working to organize a protest here in Washington in the coming weeks. What's the goal? What's the specific ask? JACLYN CORIN (Co-Founder, March For Our Lives): Well, the ask is that our elected officials in our U.S. Congress actually do something. I mean, over 150 gun laws around the country have been passed on a state level since 2018, the first March for Our Lives, after the shooting at my high school in Parkland. You know, everything from raising the age to buy a firearms from 18 to 21 in Florida, extremers (ph) protection orders in Virginia, the prohibition of firearms at polling sites in Colorado. But the reality is, is that those state laws is not enough. It wasn't enough to prevent the mass shooting in Buffalo two weeks ago or the mass shooting in Uvalde a couple days ago. So, we're getting back out there and calling on our U.S. Congress to actually care this time around because children are dying. MARGARET BRENNAN: In this elementary school they were children. In your high school, many of your colleagues -- you, yourself, are of voting age now. Is this something that you see real political mobilization around, particularly going into, for example, November, and the midterm races? Is this something that you see a movement forming around? JACLYN CORIN: Absolutely. I mean, the reality is, is that young people are absolutely terrified in this country, and rightly so. I mean getting shot is the leading cause of death among young people now. And we can't even enter the spaces that are supposed to make us feel the safest, the places where we're meant to grow and become educated citizens without fearing that we are going to be shot dead in our seats. You know, I'm four years removed from the shooting at my high school and I still fear that I picked a seat a little to close -- or a little too far from an emergency exit in my college lecture hall. And no student in this country should have to feel that way. In 2018, we saw record youth voter turnout in those elections. About 36 percent of youth voter turnout, which was the highest ever in a midterm election, and I hope that we can push to make that percentage even larger this year in 2022. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nicole, I know your son, Jake, survived the massacre at Sandy Hook. How does a child process trauma like this? NICOLE HOCKLEY: A great question. He's still processing. And sometimes he talks about it, sometimes he doesn't. However, he will be turning 18 on the 4th of July and he knows one of the first things he's going to do is register to vote. This is -- you know, for 10 years this is all he's known is death by firearm and preparing in the active shooter drills for imminent school shootings. This is what this generation has grown up with. And I don't know how you process that because it becomes part of your normal psyche now. This is what they expect. This is what they live with every day. And this is why they are going to be the ones to help create the change that we adults have not been able to deliver for them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do either of you believe that the answer here, or even part of the answer here, is more police presence in schools? JACLYN CORIN: I'll go first on that. NICOLE HOCKLEY: I do not. Sorry, go ahead, Jaclyn. JACLYN CORIN: I mean, I do not. I mean, obviously, it's despicable that it took so long for police to enter in Uvalde. And I remember feeling so angry at the armed school resource officer at my school who refused to enter the building. And that goes to show that evidently having armed security present does not prevent mass shooters from carrying out violence. And the reality is, is if we're talking about what to do once a shooter has access to a school, it's just too late. Police -- more police in schools, arming police officers, arming teachers especially, is not the answer. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you agree with that, Nicole? NICOLE HOCKLEY: I absolutely agree. It's about, how do we get ahead of it. By the time they get to the school, it's too late, and there's not enough evidence to suggest that armed security at the school will be anything other than another casualty or just not helpful at all. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about restrictions on ammunition sales, high- capacity magazines? Those things that the president says should be talked about but are not being discussed in the U.S. Capital right now? NICOLE HOCKLEY: Personally, I am a fan of restrictions on high-capacity magazines because the only purpose of having a high-capacity magazines is to propel as many bullets as possible in a short period of time. There's not really a civilian use, other than target shooting, but you can't hunt with that, you can't -- it's not good for personal self-protection. It is for killing. And, personally, I know that in the Sandy Hook situation, because the shooter had to stop, either because his magazine jammed or because he had to change his ammunition clip, several children were allowed to escape. My son was not one of them, but those few seconds can make all of the difference in terms of saving lives. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jaclyn, thank you, Nicole, thank you, for your time today and for sharing your perspectives. We'll be back in a moment.

            "article_content": "Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas is the lone anti-abortion Democrat left in the U.S House of Representatives. He has survived challenges from the left over the years because of his strong ties to his border district, and his appeal among constituents who share his more moderate approach. But with the Supreme Court now poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, progressives feel they have their best chance yet to defeat him. Voters in the south Texas district will head to the polls Tuesday to choose between Cuellar and his liberal challenger, Jessica Cisneros. The contest is a runoff after neither candidate broke the 50% threshold needed to win outright in March. The race figures to test the strength of the abortion rights movement among more conservative Latino voters. Cuellar, who was the only House Democrat to vote against the Women's Health Protection Act, maintains support from party leadership, despite calls from Cisneros to pull their support. Days after the draft Roe decision leaked, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina went to Texas to campaign with Cuellar. \"I do not agree with Henry Cuellar on everything,\" Clyburn said, referring to Cuellar's stance on abortion. \"We need to sit down with people who we do not agree with and try to find common ground, to do what is necessary to move this country forward.\" But Cisneros has brought out some progressive supporters as well: Sen. Bernie Sanders came to San Antonio to campaign for her on Friday, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came before the primary.\u00a0 \"If you believe, as the vast majority of American people do, that it is women who should control their bodies and not the government, then this election is very important,\" Sanders told CBS San Antonio affiliate KENS 5\u00a0before the rally with Cisneros.\u00a0 South Texas has been a longtime haven for Democrats, but it's one of the areas with a major Latino population that has seen Republicans gain significant ground in recent years. That trend seems to be helping Cuellar's electability pitch in the primary, ahead of what is expected to be a dismal midterm year for Democrats. He led with 48.4% in the March primary, while Cisneros received 46.9%. Cisneros and her supporters see the news over abortion as something to change the dynamic in the race. \"On May 24th, we will defeat the last anti-choice Democrat and South Texas will finally have a representative in their corner that will fight for their health care and freedom,\" she said in a statement on May 4.\u00a0 A recent CBS News poll, following the leaked draft opinion, found that 72% of Hispanic voters want to see Roe kept as is, which is slightly above 64% of Americans who want the landmark decision left alone.\u00a0 If Roe is overturned, 38% of Hispanic voters said they want abortion to be legal in all cases, while 29% said they want it to be legal in most cases, according to that same poll. Thirty-three percent said they would prefer that abortion be illegal in most (21%) or all (12%) cases. White voters were less likely to support legal abortion (61% combined between legal in all or most cases), while Black voters (77%) were more likely to support that.\u00a0 Republicans, though, believe the issue could work in their favor. A recent internal poll by the Republican National Committee showed a similar number of Hispanic voters against abortion without restrictions.\u00a0 Sylvia Bruni is a Democratic county chair for Webb County, a Cuellar stronghold and a predominantly Latino area. She said while the majority of the county's older, more religious Latino voters are against abortion, she's seen public opinion change in recent years and more progressive, pro-choice groups become more vocal and active since the draft opinion leak.\u00a0 She added that there is not a clear cut line between Latinos on where they side on abortion now, as older voters have joined alongside younger groups leading protests against the Supreme Court's impending decisions.\u00a0 \"I've got a bunch of Democrats that are older, just like I am. And they're very much concerned over Roe v. Wade. We're all Catholic, but just like me, I'm very much personally against it. But I don't have the right to tell you what to do. Punto,\" she said.\u00a0 Bruni said while the energy over the issue resides with progressives, which could help Cisneros, she couldn't predict if conservatives would also be energized by the prospect of overturning Roe. After the leak, Cuellar put out a statement that reiterated his anti-abortion rights stance but also said he was against overturning Roe v. Wade. \"I do not support abortion, however, we cannot have an outright ban,\" he wrote, adding that there should be exceptions such as rape, incest and danger to the life of the mother. \"My faith will not allow me to support a ruling that would criminalize teenage victims of rape and incest \u2014 my faith is clear: abortion must be rare & safe.\" Neither Cisneros nor Cuellar agreed to be interviewed for this article. Yvonne Gutierrez, the managing director of Latino Victory, said it's telling that Cuellar hasn't leaned into his anti-abortion stance during the runoffs. If Cisneros goes on to win on Tuesday, she believes their differences on the issue could be the deciding factor. \"We need to give Latino voters more credit, they really do understand what's at stake,\" Gutierrez said. She noted that while some Latinos don't personally support abortion, they are able to put \"their personal beliefs aside for what this means for their communities and their rights.\" The messaging from Gutierrez's group among Latino voters focuses in part on the disproportionate impact the overturning of Roe could have among people of color. \"We know the vast majority of Latinas are employed, many are head of households, mothers already, and when you think about the impact already, with the economy as it is, everyone is working hard to put food on the table, support their families with higher cost of living,\" she said. \"When you look at these barriers at accessing care, they multiply.\" Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of the progressive Indivisible Group, said Cuellar was \"hedging\" with his statement and noted an ad by \"Mainstream Democrats,\" a PAC funded by LinkedIn cofounder and billionaire Reid Hoffman, that highlights how Cuellar \"opposes a ban on abortion.\" \"That really speaks volumes about who perceives this issue to be a vulnerability for them,\" Greenberg said. \"A lot of people may feel nuanced about abortion while being concerned about and opposed to extremist bans that fully take the choice out of the hands of actually concerned people.\" \"While there are often folks who may have mixed personal opinions on abortion, the overall popularity of the extremism that the GOP is advancing is clearly not [high],\" she added.\u00a0 Eileen Diaz McConnell, a sociologist and demographer at Arizona State University, said the nuance in how the Latino attitudes toward community feels about abortion is similar to the diversity of opinions among non-Hispanic White Americans. She said it often depends on factors like their gender, religious identity or how many generations they've been in the country, but that generally, a majority of Latinos support abortion in most or all cases.\u00a0 \"I don't know that we know enough to say, if we did apples \u2014 apples, White women \u2014 do they think exactly like Mexican women or Puerto Rican women or Cuban women?\" she said. \"So, I think they look somewhat similar, because in the aggregate [of Latino voter data], it's getting rid of all that internal diversity. Of which there is quite a bit.\" Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 On a Tuesday afternoon in early February, Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, participated in an event with the Philadelphia Inquirer from the inside of a vehicle parked outside the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0 But at the same time, his colleagues were in the House chamber, casting votes on a bill to name a post office in Slatersville, Rhode Island. A review of the roll call vote shows Khanna supported designating the facility as the \"Specialist Matthew R. Turcotte Post Office,\" even though he was not physically present to vote \"yea.\" Instead, he enlisted Rep. Jimmy Gomez, a fellow Democrat from California, to vote for him, citing in a letter to the House clerk the \"ongoing public health emergency\" as his reason for being unable to participate in the proceedings in-person. Weeks earlier, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the No. 3 House Republican, cast two votes in the House on the afternoon of Jan. 11, but posted photos to Twitter that night showing her alongside former President Donald Trump at his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, where she attended an event with the 45th president. Like Khanna, Stefanik said in a letter to the House clerk she was unable to physically attend the proceedings \"due to the ongoing public health emergency,\" and tapped GOP Rep. Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania to vote in her stead. The instances involving Khanna and Stefanik are just two examples of House members using proxy voting to do their day jobs in Washington without actually being in the Capitol. Congress is approaching the two-year anniversary of approving a resolution that allowed House members to vote remotely by designating another lawmaker as their proxy. Implemented to keep the wheels of government turning during the COVID-19 pandemic without requiring all 435 House members to gather on the floor together, the practice was initially maligned by GOP members \u2014 so much so they sued to stop it \u2014 but has come to be embraced by Democrats and Republicans alike. \"We accommodate to the necessities that confront us in life, and proxy voting and virtual work is accommodating to issues that we confront in life,\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, told CBS News.\u00a0 While proxy voting began as a mechanism for lawmakers to remain safe during the pandemic without missing votes, reasons for the remote participation have morphed over the span of the pandemic from concerns about the public health emergency to overt participation in political activities. In late February 2021, for example, nearly a dozen GOP lawmakers authorized colleagues to cast votes for them, citing the \"ongoing public health emergency,\" only to appear at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida.\u00a0 Four months later, in June, a group of Republicans appeared alongside Trump in South Texas for a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border while still voting in Washington by proxy. Democrats, meanwhile, have taken advantage of the absentee voting policies to appear alongside President Biden in their home states, while simultaneously fulfilling their voting obligations in Washington.\u00a0 When Mr. Biden visited Michigan in May, for example, he was greeted at the airport in Detroit by Reps. Debbie Dingell and Rashida Tlaib, and by other Democrats in the Michigan delegation at the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn. All had voted by proxy, according to letters submitted to the House clerk. And Rep. Kai Kahele, a Democrat from Hawaii, recently came under scrutiny for his extensive use of proxy voting, employing the practice for 120 of the 125 roll call votes so far this year. His office, though, defended his record of voting-by-proxy, saying in a statement that staff has tried to reduce his cross-country travel to limit his exposure to COVID-19 \"while ensuring he fulfills all of his responsibilities in Congress.\" Three Democrats have not voted in person at all this year, voting records show. \"Members miss votes, that's a fact of the House,\" Molly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who analyzed the use of proxy voting. \"Now we have this situation where instead of having to choose between missing a vote and not doing something else, they can do the other thing and use proxy voting.\" \u00a0 Reynolds found there are several categories of reasons members vote-by-proxy: Some lawmakers choose to engage in political activities, while others find themselves in circumstances where they need workplace accommodations, such as when GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas used proxy voting after undergoing emergency eye surgery last year that restricted his ability to travel. And while there are few questions as to what constitutes an abuse of the pandemic-related voting procedures, other uses by lawmakers \u2014 Democratic Rep. Colin Allred of Texas voted by proxy while on leave after the birth of his son \u2014 make it difficult for congressional leaders to draw clear lines of what is permissible and have exposed flaws in Capitol Hill as a workplace. \"As we consider the future of proxy voting \u2014\u00a0 when we no longer live in a world where there are acute COVID concerns or get to a point where COVID isn't as acute of a concern \u2014 Congress would certainly not want a system that continues to let people vote while going to political fundraiser, but the House might want a way to let members participate remotely for a defined reason for short period of time,\" Reynolds said. \"And figuring out what it looks like is hard for a legislative body, particularly in the current political environment.\" Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat from California, said she believes the ability for lawmakers to take family leave should be written into House rules. \"Life happens,\" Speier told CBS News, adding \"if you extend remote voting for extreme circumstances, emergency circumstances, I think that serves the House well, it serves the individual members well, and it's part of being in the 21st century.\" She noted, though, there are clear differences in the reasons for voting by proxy that should be allowed. \"It's one thing to use it when you have a family emergency or you're giving birth or a family member's died,\" Speier said. \"It's another thing to use it to go to a political event.\" Since the House first passed the resolution authorizing proxy voting in May 2020, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has extended the procedure several times, most recently through mid-May. GOP lawmakers at first lambasted the use of proxy voting, and 160 members of the House Republican conference signed on to a lawsuit brought in federal court challenging the absentee voting procedures. In fact, until December 2020, no GOP lawmaker voted by proxy, according to the analysis conducted by the Brookings Institution. But as the COVID-19 pandemic continued, now in its third year, many of those same Republicans have taken advantage of the ability to cast votes in Washington without actually being physically in the House chamber. And as the suit against Pelosi spearheaded by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy weaved through the federal judiciary last year, the number of GOP lawmakers listed as plaintiffs waned.\u00a0 By the time the dispute landed before the Supreme Court in September, only McCarthy and Texas Republican Congressman Chip Roy remained as plaintiffs. The high court ultimately rejected the GOP lawmakers' appeal of a lower court decision tossing out the case, leaving the proxy-voting process in place. An analysis of the practice conducted by the Ripon Society, a center-right think tank, found that of the proxy votes cast during the first session of the 117th Congress, across 2021, 72% were cast by Democrats, while 27% were from Republicans. Of the 225 Democratic House members, 202 voted by proxy, while 137 of the 215 Republicans used the procedure last year. Just 65 lawmakers did not engage in proxy voting at all, neither serving as a proxy nor tapping another member to vote for them, the Ripon Society found. The Brookings analysis published in January found the typical GOP lawmaker had an open proxy letter for an average of 13 days as of mid-December, while the typical Democrat has had an open proxy letter for an average of 19 days. Even as Republicans continue to make use of their ability to cast proxy votes, GOP leaders have pledged to do away with the practice, should the party retake the majority after the November midterm elections. \"Our very first day is rules, OK? We're no longer going to do proxy voting,\" McCarthy previewed to reporters of Republicans' first action at the start of the next Congress if they regain power. Reynolds, of Brookings, agreed there are some pitfalls of proxy voting, including that members are not physically present on the House floor to speak, offer amendments or make motions. \"In lots of situations, the process in the House is locked down, but if we aspire to a more deliberative House floor, that'll be incompatible with widespread proxy voting,\" she said. But there are less direct consequences, such as members losing the direct engagement with one another. \"If you've watched the House floor during a regular vote, there are important conversations that happen in person, and not just whipping votes, but all kinds of in-person interactions that have shaped and driven the culture of the House,\" Reynolds said. \"It's harder for members, not impossible, to build relationships.\"\u00a0 Hoyer agreed that being in-person for House proceedings is \"the ideal, particularly for an institution that relies on the kind of give-and-take in debate that democracy flourishes under.\" But he noted that technology has extended the bounds of what Congress can accomplish without being physically present. \"I think that what our constituents elected us to do is to represent them. How do we do that? We vote and we speak, but we don't have to speak in this room, that room, in the other room, or vote at that machine, that machine or the other machine,\" he said. \"We can do so virtually and with using technology and affecting the same result.\"",

            "article_content": "Gunmen burst into a home just north of Mexico City and killed eight members of a family, including four children, as the country continues to be plagued by a wave of brutal violence. Prosecutors in the State of Mexico, which borders the capital, said the shootings occurred in the township of Tultepec. The shootings happened between late Sunday and early Monday. Seven people died at the scene, and one woman died later at a hospital. There was no immediate information on a possible motive. Tultepec is known for its fireworks workshops, both legal and illegal, and it's notorious for deadly fireworks accidents. The latest violence in Mexico comes as President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador on Sunday easily won a divisive referendum he promoted on whether he should step down or complete his term \u2014 an election marked by low turnout. L\u00f3pez Obrador took office in 2018 championing a \"hugs not bullets\" strategy to tackle violent crime at its roots by fighting poverty and inequality with social programs, rather than with the army. But Mexico continues to see brazen mass killings across the country. Earlier this month, at least three people were killed in a shooting and a subsequent chase by police officers at a beachside restaurant in Mexico's Pacific coast resort of Acapulco. That shooting came just days after the\u00a0severed heads of six men\u00a0were discovered on top of a Volkswagen in the town of Chilapa de Alvarez, in Guerrero state. Last month, \u00a020 people were shot dead at a\u00a0venue used to host cockfights\u00a0in the town of Las Tinajas, in Michoac\u00e1n state. An\u00a0American mother, Melissa Silva, was among the victims.\u00a0 Also in March, gunmen killed nine people in an attack on a house in central Mexico \u2014 an\u00a0\"execution\" of six men and three women\u00a0that shook a middle-class area of the usually peaceful town of Atlixco. And authorities in Michoac\u00e1n said a\u00a0suspected massacre of about a dozen men\u00a0seen lined up against a wall by drug cartel gunmen in February may have been a shootout between rival factions of the same cartel. Across the country, more than 340,000 people have been killed in a wave of bloodshed since the government deployed the army to fight drug cartels in 2006.",

            "article_content": "Beijing\u00a0\u2014 Beijing and Moscow advanced a vision of a new world order Wednesday as Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made his first visit to key ally China since his country launched its invasion of Ukraine. Moscow's top diplomat landed in the eastern city of Huangshan early Wednesday for a series of meetings about the future of Afghanistan, but Russia's bloody assault on its neighbor was likely to loom large over proceedings.  Beijing has refused to condemn the invasion and has provided a level of diplomatic cover for an increasingly isolated Russia.  U.S. officials have accused China of signaling \"willingness\" to provide military and economic aid to Russia, while President Joe Biden has compared the invasion of Ukraine to China's crushing of protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. But on Wednesday, Lavrov painted a picture of a new \"world order,\" saying the world was \"living through a very serious stage in the history of international relations.\" \"We, together with you, and with our sympathizers will move towards a multipolar, just, democratic world order,\" Lavrov said in a video released by the Russian foreign ministry ahead of a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.  The two ministers were shown on Chinese state TV in face masks bumping elbows in front of their national flags.  A readout from the Chinese foreign ministry quoted Wang Yi as saying \"China-Russia relations have withstood the new test of the changing international situation, maintained the correct direction of progress and shown tenacious development momentum.\" Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told reporters earlier that Moscow and Beijing would continue efforts in \"advancing global multipolarity and the democratization of international relations.\" Wang added that \"China-Russia cooperation has no limits\", repeating a line used by President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to characterize ties. \"Our striving for peace has no limits, our upholding of security has no limits, our opposition towards hegemony has no limits,\" Wang said. Lavrov will attend a series of meetings hosted by China to discuss ways to help Afghanistan, with diplomats from the United States and the Taliban-led country's neighbors also expected to attend. China shares only a sliver of a border with Afghanistan, but Beijing has long feared its neighbor could become a staging point for Muslim Uyghur separatists from Xinjiang. The meetings follow a visit by Wang last week to Kabul, his first trip to Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power.  China and Russia have become closer in recent years, with Putin notably attending the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics last month only days before the invasion of Ukraine. The strongman leader and China's Xi signed energy deals worth billions of dollars during Putin's trip. Putin met privately with Xi before the opening ceremony in Beijing and the leaders issued a joint statement afterward showing a united front in the face of Western criticism. The statement, posted on the Kremlin's website, sought to portray Russia and China not as challengers of democracy and freedom on the world stage, but as purveyors of it. Without naming any adversaries explicitly, the message even then was clear: The world is changing, and China and Russia won't be held back. \"Some forces representing a minority on the world stage continue to advocate unilateral approaches to solving international problems and resort to power politics, practice interference in the internal affairs of other states, damaging their legitimate rights and interests, provoking contradictions, disagreements and confrontation,\" the February statement said. \"Democracy,\" they declared, \"is not built on stencils. Depending on the socio-political structure, history, traditions and cultural characteristics of a particular state, its people have the right to choose such forms and methods of implementing democracy that correspond to the specifics of this state. The right to judge whether a state is democratic belongs only to its people.\" The message, at face value, may be easy for the democratic West to dismiss: Russian and Chinese people do not \"have the right to choose such forms and methods of implementing democracy\" as they wish, as neither country\u00a0has free and fair elections, and speaking out against the existing \"forms and methods\" of governance often ends in imprisonment for those who try it. China and Russia made it a point of saying in their joint statement early this year that they had reaffirmed, \"their firm mutual support in protecting their fundamental interests, state sovereignty and territorial integrity, and oppose the interference of external forces in their internal affairs.\"",

The North Korean patrol boat crossed the so-called Northern Limit Line on Tuesday morning while pursuing the vessel in waters near South Korea's Baekryeong island and retreated after a South Korean naval ship fired warning shots, according to Seoul's Defense Ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff.  South Korean military officials seized the North Korean vessel being chased by the patrol boat and were questioning its seven crewmembers. South Korea's navy has often fired warning shots to repel North Korean vessels crossing the countries' poorly marked sea border, but there also have been some deadly clashes over the years. South Korea blamed North Korea for an attack on a South Korean warship that killed 46 sailors in 2010, but the North has denied responsibility.  South Korea has patrolled waters around the Northern Limit Line for decades after it was drawn up by the U.N. command at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea doesn't recognize the line and insists upon a boundary that encroaches deeply into waters currently controlled by the South.  Tuesday's incident came amid renewed tensions created by North Korea's accelerating missile tests this year, including a launch on Saturday that the North said tested technologies for a spy satellite it is developing.  It came a day before South Koreans vote in a hotly contested presidential election. The bitter campaign has been marked by clashes between major candidates over whether South Korea should continue pursuing engagement with rival North Korea or take a harder line to check its nuclear threat.  Nuclear negotiations between the United States and North Korea have been stalled for three years because of disagreements over a relaxation of crippling U.S.-led sanctions on North Korea in exchange for steps toward its nuclear disarmament.",

            "article_content": "Republican lawmakers and candidates are largely united in their belief that President Biden's response to Russia's invasion of\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0has fallen short \u2014 in fact, it's former President Donald Trump's remarks on Vladimir Putin and Ukraine that are revealing fissures in the Republican Party over the scope of U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts. The varied and at times conflicting Republican reactions, both on the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill, underscore how the party remains deeply influenced by Trump, who praised Vladimir Putin as \"savvy\" after the Russian president recognized the independence of two Russian separatist-controlled areas in Eastern Ukraine. As Russia began its full-scale invasion later Wednesday, Trump told Fox News that \"This all happened because of a rigged election.\" At a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser Wednesday evening, he continued his praise of Putin, calling him \"pretty smart\" in \"taking over a country for $2 worth of sanctions.\" (Video of the remarks\u00a0was circulated on Twitter by American Bridge, a national Democratic super PAC.)\u00a0 While most Republicans have balked at Putin's moves in Ukraine and called for swift and steep sanctions, others aligned with Trump have echoed the former president and adopted a far less hostile view of the Russian leader and been more circumspect about any U.S. military action in Europe. That sentiment has been bolstered by Trump allies on prominent media platforms, many of whom been framing Washington's alarm about Russia as an establishment, even elitist, concern. \u00a0 Republicans have largely been united, however, on hitting Biden for the conflict in Eastern Europe without having to be accountable for a congressional vote, with key figures across the party criticizing the president's leadership.\u00a0 Still, the GOP's own muddled foreign policy stance has different blocs competing for political capital and sway with core party voters. \u00a0 The foreign policy debates, and the way in which once long-held Republican beliefs on America's role in the world dramatically evolved in the Trump era, will be on display at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an annual activist gathering that opened Thursday in Orlando, Florida. Trump is scheduled to speak, along with some more traditional GOP voices. \u00a0 Trump called Putin \"smart\" in a\u00a0radio interview\u00a0with \"The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show\" on Tuesday, after the Russian president gave a speech that laid out his justification for Russia's move into Ukraine. \"I said, 'This is genius.' Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful. So Putin is now saying it's independent, a large section of Ukraine. I said, 'How smart is that?' And he's going to go in and be a peacekeeper.\"\u00a0 The comments were reminiscent of Trump's notorious\u00a02018 summit with Putin in Helsinki, in which he took the Russian president's word over U.S. intelligence agencies. Throughout his first presidential campaign and his presidency, Trump criticized NATO and allied countries for not paying their fair share when it comes to joint defense.\u00a0 At CPAC, Texas Senator Ted Cruz declined to comment directly on Trump's recent remarks, though he did\u00a0say in an interview that \"with some regularity,\" he disagrees with the former president's rhetoric but thinks that on Russia-related policy, Trump was superior to Mr. Biden.\u00a0 \"The way to stop the invasion is for Russia to believe that they will not be able to get their gas to Europe if they continue this invasion. And the only way to do that is impose the sanctions, and Joe Biden just did that, finally, but now the problem is Putin doesn't believe those sanctions will stay,\" Cruz said.\u00a0 Years later, Republicans with ambitions for higher office have praised Trump's handling of Russia, with some appearing to offer similar views of Putin. Mike Pompeo, who served as secretary of state and CIA director in the Trump administration,\u00a0told\u00a0Fox News Sunday last month that Putin is a \"very talented statesman. He has lots of gifts. He was a KGB agent for goodness sakes. He knows how to use power. And we should respect that.\"\u00a0 Earlier this week, Pompeo took a less laudatory approach tweeting, \"Vladimir Putin is the aggressor. The Ukrainians are the victims.\" But in television interviews and on Twitter, Pompeo has argued that Trump's approach to Russia was successful. \"Vladimir Putin is the same person he was during our administration. The only thing that has changed is American leadership,\" he said.\u00a0 Speaking in Iowa on Wednesday hours before the invasion began, Pompeo stepped up his criticism of Putin, calling him \"evil\" and an autocrat who has \"wanted to recreate this notion of the greater Russia or the Soviet Union for a long time.\" Former Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is a possible 2024 presidential contender, has shown an eagerness to engage in the conversation about Russia. She has focused her comments on the Biden administration, while giving a nod to Trump, tweeting, \"Vladimir Putin is on the verge of recreating the Russian Empire, if not the Soviet Union. It wasn't so long ago that the leader of the free world prevented that from happening. Today, under Biden, our weakness is teasing Russian aggression.\"\u00a0 The fissures are also evident on the campaign trail. In the primary for retiring Senator Rob Portman's seat in Ohio, for example, GOP candidate Jane Timken joined other Republicans in calling for harsher sanctions. She invoked both Reagan and Trump, saying \"America First means peace through strength. President Trump proved for four years that we can have a secure Southern Border AND stand up to our enemies.\" \u00a0 J.D. Vance, one of her rivals, made a non-interventionist case, arguing that the invasion \"has nothing to do with our national security\" and it is \"distracting our idiot 'leaders' from focusing on the things that actually do matter to our national security, like securing the border & stopping the flow of Fentanyl that's killing American kids. He accused Timken of being a \"Cheney Republican.\"\u00a0 Timken, who released an ad last week tying herself to Trump, fired back at Vance by noting Ohio is home to 80,000 Ukrainian-Americans.\u00a0 A CBS News\u00a0poll\u00a0earlier this month found that Republicans would rather the U.S. stay out of the conflict, and they overwhelmingly disapprove of how he is handling Russia more broadly. \u00a0 On Capitol Hill, Republicans have taken a more hawkish approach and pushed Biden to issue tough sanctions. Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton has criticized the administration for waiting to impose sanctions until after Russia invaded Ukraine. \"There is not a minute to lose,\" Cotton tweeted earlier this week. \u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also called for faster and more sweeping sanctions, and urged the halt of the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. (The Biden administration issued sanctions against the company building the pipeline on Wednesday.)\u00a0 With the invasion well underway on Thursday, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a close ally of Trump, issued a statement that was notable for not mentioning the current administration or the previous one. \"Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine is reckless and evil. The United States stands with the people of Ukraine and prays for their safety and resolve,\" he said. \"Putin must be held accountable for his actions.\" \"I think this is the moment to indicate American strength. Both Vladimir Putin and President Xi of China took the wrong message out of our precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan. It looked not only chaotic, but it looked weak,\" McConnell\u00a0said\u00a0in a talk with Kentucky business leaders this week. \"And so they are pushing the limits everywhere in reaction to the perception of American weakness and loss of resolve.\"\u00a0 Aaron Navarro contributed to this report.\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Beijing on Friday to attend the Winter Olympics opening ceremony, but also to meet with China's leader, Xi Jinping. China and Russia have grown much closer in recent years as they've become more estranged from the West, and more at odds with the U.S. The two leaders met just days after Putin dug his heels in more deeply in his high-stakes standoff with the U.S. and NATO over Moscow's buildup of troops and weapons along Ukraine's borders. The U.S. accused Putin on Thursday of plotting a so-called \"false-flag\" operation in Ukraine, alleging that covert operatives were already in place and working to create a fake video depicting an attack that Russia could use as a pretext to invade its neighbor.  The Biden administration did not provide any direct evidence of the plot for public consumption, but insisted that intelligence gathered by the U.S. and its partners shows Russia is working with \"crisis actors\" inside Ukraine to create such a video. State Department spokesman Ned Price told an Associated Press reporter, who suggested the U.S. government's assertion alone wasn't enough, that if he wanted to question \"the credibility of the U.S. government, the U.K. government and other governments and find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do.\"  Ukrainian and American officials have warned for weeks that Russia could use such tactics \u2014 which may include cyberattacks and staged violence inside Ukraine intended to create chaos and erode confidence in its government. Russia is known to favor these secretive methods, and it has used them before, including in Ukraine. Officials in Kyiv said on Friday that the Biden administration had shared its intelligence on the purported Russian plot to stage a propaganda video, and that they were waiting to learn more.  The Biden administration said it went public with the information in the hope of deterring Russia from using such tactics.\u00a0 If Putin did decide to attack Ukraine \u2014 despite his government insisting daily that it has no plans to do so \u2014 China's support could be crucial to Russia, says CBS News senior foreign correspondent Holly Williams.  The U.S. has threatened to respond to any Russian invasion of Ukraine with swift and severe sanctions. China, with its giant economy, could help offset the impact of international sanctions on Russia, whether they target banks or the country's supply chains. China has also been increasingly at odds with the U.S. over its human rights record, its mounting intimidation of Taiwan and other smaller neighbors, and its crackdown on what had been, until about a year ago, the semi-autonomous, democratic enclave of Hong Kong. Putin met privately with China's Xi Jinping before the opening ceremony in Beijing, and the leaders issued a joint statement afterward showing a united front in the face of Western criticism. The statement, posted on the Kremlin's website, sought to portray Russia and China not as challengers of democracy and freedom on the world stage, but as purveyors of it. Without naming any adversaries explicitly, the message was clear: The world is changing, and China and Russia won't be held back. \"Some forces representing a minority on the world stage continue to advocate unilateral approaches to solving international problems and resort to power politics, practice interference in the internal affairs of other states, damaging their legitimate rights and interests, provoking contradictions, disagreements and confrontation,\" the statement said.\u00a0 The joint message on democracy came from two countries where dissidents are persecuted for voicing opposition to the government. \"Democracy,\" they declared in unison, \"is not built on stencils. Depending on the socio-political structure, history, traditions and cultural characteristics of a particular state, its people have the right to choose such forms and methods of implementing democracy that correspond to the specifics of this state. The right to judge whether a state is democratic belongs only to its people.\" The message, at face value, may be easy for the democratic West to dismiss: Russian and Chinese people do not \"have the right to choose such forms and methods of implementing democracy\" as they wish, as neither country has free and fair elections and speaking out against the existing \"forms and methods\" of governance often ends badly for those brave enough to try it. But putting aside the rhetorical flourish, there was a far more literal message in the joint statement from China and Russia. The two nations, it said, \"reaffirm their firm mutual support in protecting their fundamental interests, state sovereignty and territorial integrity, and oppose the interference of external forces in their internal affairs.\"  Tucker Reals is the CBSNews.com foreign editor, based at the CBS News London bureau.",

            "article_content": "Moscow \u2014 A senior Russian diplomat wouldn't rule out the possibility of his country placing military infrastructure in Cuba or Venezuela, as the Kremlin called two recent rounds of talks with the U.S. and NATO\u00a0\"unsuccessful.\" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov, who led negotiations with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman in Geneva this week, said Thursday that he didn't want \"to confirm anything, [but] won't exclude anything here either,\" when asked whether Russia might consider establishing a military presence in America's backyard. \"It depends on the actions of American colleagues,\" Ryabkov said Thursday in an interview with the RTVI channel, adding that Russia could also undertake unspecified \"measures\" involving its navy. It was a significant ratcheting up of the tension between the U.S. and Russia in a week that many hoped would put diplomacy front and center. The current standoff between Moscow and Washington has been casually framed as a contemporary echo of the Cold War for weeks, but Ryabkov's remarks were sure to resonate loudly in the ears of Americans either aware of or old enough to remember the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. There was no immediate reaction from Russia's allies in Havana or Caracas to Ryabkov's remarks. A few weeks ago, Moscow sent Washington a list of \"security guarantees\" demanding that NATO halt its eastward expansion and, most importantly, close the door for Ukraine to join the alliance. Following high-stakes talks in Geneva and Brussels this week, Sherman called some of Moscow's demands \"simply non-starters.\" \"We will not slam the door shut on NATO's open-door policy,\" she told reporters on Wednesday. \"We are not going to agree that NATO cannot expand any further.\" Russia's military has massed about 100,000 troops along its border with Ukraine, stoking fears that it could be preparing for another invasion of the country as it did in 2014, when Vladimir Putin sent in his forces and annexed the Crimean Peninsula. U.S. officials have said an invasion could begin as soon as January or February and involve as many as 175,000 Russian troops. Russian officials have sent mixed signals on whether Putin indeed plans to attack Ukraine, denying any intention to do so outright, but stressing that all options remain on the table in the standoff, including military action to \"counter threats\" if the West refuses to agree to its demands. \"The jury's out on which path Vladimir Putin is going to choose,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told MSNBC on Thursday. \"Is he going to choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue to resolve some of these problems or is he going to pursue confrontation and aggression?\" Moscow has seen Ukraine as a potential security threat since elections there ushered in new leadership that severed longtime close ties with Russia and instead shifted the country's alliance to the West. Ukraine is actively seeking NATO membership. In talks with NATO on Wednesday, Russia said that if the Western security alliance wants to \"deescalate\" the situation around Ukraine, it must \"abandon all military assistance to Ukraine and stop supplying weaponry.\" Earlier on Thursday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called the Russian-U.S. talks over Moscow's demanded security guarantees \"unsuccessful,\" and slammed the U.S. over new sanctions drafted in Congress targeting senior Russian officials amid the push for diplomatic d\u00e9tente.  \"We view such documents and such statements in an extremely negative way \u2014 especially against the backdrop of continuing negotiations, which may be unsuccessful but are still talks,\" Peskov said during a daily briefing call with reporters. The proposed package of sanctions submitted by U.S. senators on Wednesday, with support from the White House, is intended to \"devastate\" the Russian economy should Moscow attack Ukraine. The measures include personal sanctions against Putin and several other top officials, including Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. \"Introducing sanctions against the head of the government or the head of Russia is an extreme measure which is comparable to severing relations,\" Peskov said. According to the draft, the U.S. government would also have to investigate and present a report on Putin's personal wealth and assets held by his family members, or any other people who may be holding them on his behalf. The last round of talks between Russia and the West, this time under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), was to wrap up on Thursday. As Poland begins its year-long chairmanship of that security organization, the country's Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau warned that the risk of war in Europe was \"now greater than ever before in the last 30 years.\" \"For several weeks we have been faced with the prospect of a major military escalation in Eastern Europe,\" Rau said, addressing the 57-member alliance of nations. \u00a0 Russia's Ryabkov said that Moscow would decide on its next actions after it receives a written response to its demands, which it expected next week.",

            "article_content": "New York Republican John Katko announced his retirement on Friday, becoming the third House Republican who voted to impeach former President Trump to forgo a reelection campaign.\u00a0 Though his seat has been a frequent target for House Democrats, Katko had held his swing upstate New York district for the past seven years. He ran ahead of Trump in 2020 by nearly 20 points.\u00a0 \"My conscience, principles, and commitment to do what's right have guided every decision I've made as a Member of Congress, and they guide my decision today,\" Katko said in a statement, adding that he wanted to spend more time with family, after the recent deaths of his parents. Katko was one of 10 House Republicans to vote for Trump's impeachment after the January 6 attacks. Before his vote in January 2021, Katko said that \"Trump encouraged this insurrection, both on social media ahead of January 6, and in his speech that day\u2026 to allow the president of the United States to incite this attack without consequence is a direct threat to the future of our democracy.\" Two other House Republicans who voted for Trump's impeachment, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, announced their retirement in 2021.\u00a0 \"Great news, another one bites the dust. Katko, from Upstate New York, is gone!\" Trump said in a statement Friday. Katko worked with Democrat Bennie Thompson to create a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6 attack. After House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy rejected that deal, and the commission failed to pass in the Senate, Katko criticized the version of the commission pushed through by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0 His Syracuse metro district was likely to become an even more challenging district after redistricting. New York's Democratic-led legislature will take over the redrawing process if they reject the next set of proposals from the state's redistricting committee. The last Democratic proposal from the commission put Katko in a seat that favors Democrats by double digits. Katko is known as a moderate Republican. A ranking member of the House committee on Homeland Security, Katko worked with Democrats on addressing the influx of migrants at the border. He had the third highest bipartisan index score in 2020, according to Georgetown University. He's the 15th House Republican to retire or run for another office this cycle.\u00a0 All six of the seven remaining House Republicans that voted for Trump's impeachment, Liz Cheney of Wyoming, Tom Rice of South Carolina, Jamie Herrera-Beutler and Dan Newhouse of Washington, Peter Meijer of Michigan and David Valadao of California, have announced their runs for re-election in 2022.\u00a0 The seventh House Republican, Congressman Fred Upton, of Michigan, said in December 2021 after Michigan's new congressional map passed, that he's been \"strongly encouraged\" to run for another term.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "There's at least one thing that Donald Trump's critics and supporters can agree on about his presidency, according to Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University: \"He came in to be a disrupter, and of all of his accomplishments, I think it's very easy to say that he accomplished that one.\" Engel is one of a group of historians from leading universities around the country who convened via Zoom last March. Their mission: assessing one of the most unusual presidencies in American history.  During the call, Timothy Naftali of New York University remarked, \"His concept of a national interest was identical with his concept of his own interest.\" Daniel C. Kurtzer, of Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs, said, \"Trump inherited a mess. It was not that he created a mess; the Middle East was in very bad shape.\" Julian Zelizer of Princeton assembled the panel, which will soon publish a book of essays on Mr. Trump's time in office \u2013 a presidency he described as \"one of the most unstable, unconventional.  \"One thing that historians who've lived through the moment have, that historians 200 years from now won't have, is a sense of what it felt like to live in the moment,\" Zelizer told correspondent Rita Braver. \u00a0 It will be the third volume in a series which offered mixed assessments of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. But unlike his predecessors, former President Trump requested to meet via Zoom with the historians.  They shared a video of that July session with \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I have great respect, and I thought of you writing a book, it would really be nice if we had an accurate book,\" Mr. Trump said.  Braver spoke with four of the historians on the panel, who all agree that history's judgement of President Trump is likely to focus on two major events: his response to the coronavirus pandemic (one he said was \"going to disappear \u2026 one day, it's like a miracle it will disappear\"), and his role in the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol (at which he told the assembled crowd, \"We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore\").  We'll get back to those in a moment. But first, during his one-hour session with the group, Mr. Trump focused on what he sees as his administration's major accomplishments, for example, generating a strong economy early in his term: \"Prior to the pandemic we were setting records in every way,\" he said.  He touted his building of at least part of a wall between the U.S. and Mexico (\"We did a great job on that, and we got, we did a very, we did the wall that Border Patrol wanted\").  And he proudly talked of upending U.S. policy toward China: \"China was very bad on trade, you know that I did tariffs and everything else and really had a big impact.\"  It's a policy shift that President Biden has continued.  Jeffrey Engel said, \"Trump, I think, helped most Americans recognize that China needed to be stood up to.\" And then there were Mr. Trump's three Supreme Court appointees, likely to tilt the Court to the right for decades. But when it comes to the full assessment of the Trump Presidency, historians point out that his accomplishments were often eclipsed by behavior never before seen in a U.S. president. He frequently commended himself (\"I'm, like, a really smart guy\"). And then there was his use of social media \u2013 firing people or announcing appointments via Twitter. \"Major policies were announced on Twitter, often causing real confusion and chaos,\" said Nicole Hemmer, of Columbia University. She also points to Mr. Trump's extensive record of making false claims, beginning when he insisted he had record-breaking crowds at his inauguration (\"It looked, honestly, it looked like a million-and-a-half people!\").  Hemmer said not all presidents tell the truth all the time, but this one had a singular strategy: \"It is about lying as a test of loyalty,\" she said. \"Everyone can see that the crowd size is smaller. But if you are a Trump supporter, you will have to side with him. And that's a very different use of lies.\" Previous presidents sought to unify the country: During a Fourth of July speech in 1986, President Ronald Reagan said, \"Republican and Democrat, we are all Americans.\" But the historians point out much of President Trump's rhetoric encouraged a divide: his people versus everybody else. Mr. Trump told a rally in North Dakota, \"You work harder, but you are indeed smarter than them. Let's call ourselves, from now on, the super-elite. We're the super-elite.\" Braver asked, \"On the one hand, you had him speaking to people who legitimately felt like they'd been forgotten. And on the other hand, you had people say that he emboldened White nationalists and racists with this very same rhetoric. Which was it?\" \"Oh, it was absolutely both,\" Hemmer replied. \"That he was able to speak to people who didn't feel heard was true. But as somebody who studies White nationalist and White power movements, those movements also heard something in what Donald Trump was saying that appealed to them.\" The historians say that connection with White nationalists was on display after they clashed with counter-protestors in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017. Mr. Trump responding by saying there were \"very fine people, on both sides.\" Julian Zelizer said, \"It was a march fueled by this White rage and White backlash, and the president was unable to firmly just announce it.\" Still, many voters were willing to overlook Mr. Trump's provocative behavior.  Then, COVID hit, and polls showed disapproval of his handling of a pandemic that has now killed more than 800,000 Americans. From the very beginning, in January 2020, Mr. Trump said in a CNBC interview, \"We have it totally under control. It's one person coming from China.\" In his talk with the historians, the former president acknowledged no mistakes \u2013 instead lauding his own handling of the crisis: \"And so, we got to work and we did an incredible job,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We had to go buy from everybody all over the world, and it was tough because everybody else wanted to buy, too, the masks and all of it.\" Braver asked Merlin Chowkwanyuan, a historian at Columbia University's School of Public Health, \"How did Donald Trump do with answering the challenge of COVID?\"  \"Overall, I think Donald Trump not only didn't do bad, he did pretty terribly,\" Chowkwanyuan replied. \"There were many opportunities where he could have taken decisive federal action, and [he] passed them up.\" Chowkwanyuan said that despite Mr. Trump's claims, he failed the country in major ways, including \"on the rhetorical stage, where a president gets to use the pulpit. He instead used it to flout scientific expertise.\"  As when Mr. Trump suggested treating COVID patients with disinfectant: \"And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside?\" Chowkwanyun acknowledges that Mr. Trump does deserve some credit for the quick development of COVID vaccines. The former president himself said, \"There are some people that say my greatest achievement was getting the vaccines.\" But Chowkwanyun adds that Mr. Trump's follow-through on promoting and distributing the vaccines was weak.  Braver asked, \"If you had to give this president a grade on how he handled COVID, could you give him one?\" \"Probably go with a D,\" Chowkwanyun replied. \"You get that extra letter grade for some of the vaccine contributions, but yeah, a D.\" And with the country reeling from COVID, Mr. Trump lost his bid for re-election. That's when he started down the path that historians say ultimately led to the other defining moment of his presidency:\u00a0 insurrection and assault on the U.S. Capitol, as his followers responded to his repeated false claims of fraud, believing what's come to be known as the \"Big Lie.\" \"That was a rigged election,\" Mr. Trump said last January, \"but we're still fighting it.\" Engel said, \"This was a president who did not like the results of an election, did not like the fact that he was being voted out, and decided that his personal interests were more important than the constitutional process.\" Hemmer said it was part of a pattern that began with lying about those inaugural crowds: \"I think that when historians look back over the course of the Trump Presidency, they'll say that 'Little Lie' at the beginning was buy-in for the 'Big Lie' at the end, because that insurrection seemed to be the culmination of so many of the things that we saw as unique, bizarre, bad about his presidency.\" Mr. Trump told the assembled insurrectionists before their march on the Capitol, \"We will never give up.\u00a0 We will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.\" Zelizer said, \"It was terribly destabilizing and dangerous, to have members of Congress and the vice president under threat in part of a mob that's being instigated by the president.\" In his Zoom call with the historians, Mr. Trump denied that allegation. \"It was very modest in many ways,\" he said, \"and it was a very peaceful speech. And there was a lot of love out there. There was tremendous love.\" Mr. Trump did not discuss the fact that he was impeached for his role in inciting the riot, becoming the first president in history to be impeached twice \u2013 the first for his efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens \u2013 though he was never convicted in the Senate.  He's not the first president with a troubled term in office, but still, asked Braver, \"In the listing of American presidents, is Donald Trump going to be at the bottom, the middle, the top?\" \"Yeah, many people believe he's closer certainly to Herbert Hoover or James Buchannan,\" said Zelizer, \"presidents who left the country in a bad moment. And the presidency did end with economy incredibly fragile and unstable. It ended with the pandemic raging. And it ended with a country more divided than united from when he started.\" Braver asked Hemmer, \"If you had to give him a grade, what would it be?\" \"I don't think that a presidency that ends without a peaceful transfer of power can be considered anything other than a failure, because of Donald Trump's culpability in that moment,\" she replied.  But Mr. Trump still has strong influence in the Republican Party, while teasing a possible White House run in 2024. Nevertheless, the historians \"Sunday Morning\" spoke to, along with those in a recent C-Span survey, predict that in the long run, Donald J. Trump will be relegated to the bottom tier of American presidents.\u00a0  As Jeffrey Engel said, \"Donald Trump has a unique distinction \u2013 it's the only president who refused to honor democracy. Stop and think about that sentence: It makes my mouth say, How can you say these words? And yet, I don't think they're wrong.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Story produced by Dustin Stephens. Editor: Emanuele Secci.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Last February, Americans watched Congressman Jamie Raskin manage the impeachment trial of former President Trump. \"This trial is about who we are,\" he said. And they now see him on the Committee investigating the January 6 Capitol assault: \"We have a duty to collect all of the evidence we need to report back to Congress and to the American people.\" But many viewers may not know that Raskin has carried out these duties under circumstances most of us could not even imagine.  After all, Raskin seems to have lived a charmed life, since 2017 representing a Maryland Congressional District that shares his pragmatic-progressive ideals. He told correspondent Rita Braver, \"This is a community of activists and dreamers and visionaries, and it always has been.\"  He met his wife, law professor Sarah Bloom Raskin (a former Deputy Treasury Secretary and Federal Reserve Board member), when they were both students at Harvard Law School.  Braver asked Sarah, \"So, why did you marry him?\" \"Well, I knew life would really, really deep and beautiful with Jamie,\" she replied.  Jamie Raskin's Mom, Barbara, was a bestselling novelist; his Dad, Marcus, an anti-Viet Nam War activist who ended up on President Richard Nixon's \"enemies list.\" \"It certainly gave me sensitivity to people who get into high office, or the highest office, of the presidency, and then abuse it for their own political purposes,\" Jamie said. When Raskin, a longtime professor of Constitutional law at American University, decided to enter politics, his family was all-in: Sarah, daughters Hannah and Tabitha, and especially son Tommy.  \"Tommy was pure magic; he just was,\" said Raskin. \"He was always writing plays. He was always writing poems. He was exuberant. Everybody wanted to be around him.\" Braver asked, \"As gifted as he was, he also, as he went into adolescence and beyond, started to have some problems with anxiety and other mental issues?\" \"Yeah, he did. Like so many kids today, he had a struggle with mental health.\" During the pandemic, Tommy took his Harvard Law School classes remotely, from the Raskins' Maryland home. He was shaken by both George Floyd's death, and President Trump's false election claims.  Raskin said, \"The darkness of the time overcame him.\" And on the night of December 30, 2020, Tommy Raskin would take his own life. His father was was the one who found him the next morning.  Braver said, \"I can't even imagine what that must have felt like.\" \"Like the end of the world,\" said Raskin.  Tommy left a note, which read: \"Please forgive me. My illness won today. Look after each other, the animals and the global poor for me. All my love, Tommy.\" Raskin said, \"For him to ask forgiveness of us, means that we can ask forgiveness from him.\" But Raskin's new book, \"Unthinkable,\" is not only about the tragedy of his son's suicide, but also about the tragedy that befell the whole nation just a few days later.  On January 6, Raskin felt duty-bound to be in the House chamber when Congress was to certify Joe Biden as the next president. Raskin breathed a sigh of relief when Vice President Mike Pence refused Mr. Trump's demands to reject some electoral votes.  Braver asked, \"Was Mike Pence a hero?\" \"On that day, he was a hero,\" Raskin replied. \"And this is a guy who, I felt, went along with way too much during the Trump administration.\u00a0 But on that day, he was a constitutional patriot.\" Once the proceedings began, Raskin got up to speak, thanking his colleagues \"for all your love and tenderness, which my family will never forget.\" \"Everybody was in a standing ovation,\" he recalled. \"And I was absolutely overcome with emotion. And, for a second, a split-second, I thought, maybe, because of Tommy, the two sides aren't gonna fight tonight.  \"But, that was a bit of a fantasy.\" In fact, within a few minutes, after a rally where President Trump repeated the \"Big Lie\" that the election had been stolen from him, Trump supporters were soon storming the Capitol, trying to break into the House chamber.  \"Boom! Boom! Boom!\" said Raskin. \"And at that point it was pandemonium and chaos.\" Raskin and other members found themselves running through the hallways, trying to find a safe place to shelter.  Braver asked, \"Were you terrified?\" \"I didn't feel any fear the entire time,\" Raskin said. \"And I think that was because of Tommy. The very worst thing that has ever happened me has already happened. And then I felt, Rita, like Tommy was in my chest. I felt him by my heart. He was giving me strength.\" Last February, after the House voted to impeach Mr. Trump for \"incitement of insurrection,\" Raskin became the lead House manager in the Senate Trial. But the Democrats could not get the two-thirds majority they needed to convict.  Braver asked, \"Did you ever honestly think that impeachment would carry the day?\" \"I believed from the beginning, up until the moment when the roll call was called, that we could get 100 votes,\" Raskin replied. \"I thought it would be 100-0.\"  Undaunted, Congressman Raskin agreed to serve on the January 6th committee, methodically trying to uncover what he now sees as a plot to stage a coup. He said, \"There was a plan, essentially, to set aside the presidential election of 2020, despite the fact that Joe Biden won by more than seven million votes, set it aside and them implant a new presidency.\"  Braver asked, \"Given your own personal tragedy, why do you stay in the fight?\" \"Look, I've already lost my son, the thing most precious to me,\" said Raskin. \"But I'm not gonna see American democracy go down the tubes.
