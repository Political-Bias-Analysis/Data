            "article_content": "This week, CBS News and The Washington Post revealed that internal White House records from January 6, 2021 showed a more than seven-hour gap between President Donald Trump's phone calls. From 11:17 a.m. to 6:54 p.m., a time period that included the president's address at a \"Stop the Steal\" rally near White House grounds and the violent assault on the U.S. Capitol, the minute-by-minute record of the president's activities reflects no evidence of Trump making or receiving calls.\u00a0 In fact, there is no record of any activity between 1:21 p.m. and 4:03 p.m., when violence on Capitol Hill peaked. It has been widely reported that Trump spoke with allies like Senators Mike Lee and Tommy Tuberville and with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy during the attack. By law, the president and White House officials are required to \"adequately document\" and maintain records of the president's \"activities, deliberations, decisions, and policies.\" This responsibility was established in the Presidential Records Act of 1978.\u00a0 Typically, a president's calls and actions throughout the day would be recorded in\u00a0 the Presidential Daily Diary (PDD), a document compiled by White House diarists who rely on a variety of sources. The diarists are almost never eyewitnesses to presidential happenings, so their work is an amalgamation of the phone records provided by the White House switchboard operator, handwritten notes from the president's closest aides, Secret Service logs, and a detailed, classified version of the president's schedule. White House diarists have a top-level security clearance. They are paid by the National Archives, but are considered nonpartisan career White House staff who often work across Republican and Democratic presidencies. The people Mr. Trump spoke with on January 6, 2021 and what they discussed has become a key focus for members of the bipartisan House select committee charged with investigating the Capitol riot. Chairman Bennie Thompson told CBS News Tuesday the committee had not received any additional records about the seven hours that are unaccounted for. \"We just have to find them,\" he said. The January 6 call log indicates Trump placed several calls through White House switchboard operators in the morning \u2014 before the attack on the Capitol. He made more calls later that evening. But it is not clear why there are no phone records from Trump on the afternoon of January 6. If Trump used the White House switchboard to connect with individuals, the call logs from the White House operators would have been sorted into classified and non-classified records that are given to the diarists at the end of the day, raising questions about whether the full call logs from the afternoon were received by\u00a0 the diarists that day.\u00a0 Former White House officials told CBS News the president routinely used his own cell phone or took calls on the cell phones of his close aides, like deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino and personal assistant Nick Luna. \u00a0 Luna appeared before the panel for questioning earlier this month, according to reports. Trump's possible use of non-governmental or aides' phones \u2014 or even unregistered \"burner phones\" \u2014 on Jan. 6 has prompted the committee to probe whether Trump made or received some calls with the intention of avoiding notation in the official presidential records provided to the diarists, according to two people with knowledge of the investigation.\u00a0 The former president claimed in a statement that he had no idea what a \"burner phone\" was, but John Bolton, who served as Trump's national security adviser, told CBS News that he and Trump had spoken about how people have used \"burner phones\" to avoid having their calls scrutinized. On Monday, the House select committee recommended holding Scavino in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with\u00a0 the panel's subpoena. Scavino, Trump's longtime social media aide and confidant, has refused to cooperate with the committee, citing Trump's claim of executive privilege. \u00a0 A former Trump administration official described the recordkeeping process within the Trump White House this way: Most days, if the president spoke with someone on a call not routed through the White House switchboard, his executive assistant would make a handwritten note on his private schedule. At the end of the day, that annotated schedule, with any notes on additional activity, would then be passed to the White House staff secretary. The documents were then handed to a White House records management official and from there turned over to the diarist to add to the PDD. If there were additional presidential calls on the afternoon of Jan. 6, it's not clear if they were lost in the records chain of possession \u2013 or if they were never noted.\u00a0 \"For sure, things got missed,\" a former Trump White House official familiar with the records process said, adding that sometimes the handwritten notes would be sent directly to the diarist. This official, like others interviewed for this story, requested anonymity to speak candidly about their time in the Trump administration. Another former official said \"there is no way \" that these calls \"were tracked accurately\" but could not say whether that was intentional. \"It was messy.\" During the final months of the administration, Molly Michael served as Trump's executive assistant and sat just outside the Oval Office. Derek Lyons, the staff secretary, had announced his intention to leave the White House before January 6. Phillip Droege was the top records management official.\u00a0 Neither Lyons nor Droege responded to requests for comment. A lawyer for Michael also did not respond to a request for comment. Axios reported Michael was not at work for most of the day on Jan. 6.\u00a0 The records of the calls \u2013 either from the White House switchboard operators or the handwritten notes from a Trump assistant \u2013 are given to White House diarists at the end of the day, along with other information. In previous administrations, the only people with access to this documentation intended for the diarists were the president, the chief of staff, and the staff secretary, a former White House diarist told CBS News. It is unclear who was given\u00a0 access in the Trump White House.\u00a0 The former diarist told CBS News a PDD could be 30 pages or longer, with entries including who the president met or spoke with, where he was and who else was present. \"Literally every minute was accounted for,\" the former diarist said. The details \"were excruciatingly painful.\" Trump's Jan. 6 PDD appears to be just five pages, based on what was provided to the National Archives and then to the Jan. 6 committee. In addition to the lack of documentation of any calls in the afternoon of Jan. 6, the PDD \u2013 usually compiled and finalized by diarists over the next few days \u2013 does not reflect who Trump was with in the afternoon.\u00a0 After the president returned from speaking at the rally, which was close to the White House, the detail in the PDD is sparse. The daily diary notes Trump entered the Oval Office at 1:19 pm., spoke with his \"Valet\" at 1:21 p.m., and then went to the Rose Garden two hours and 42 minutes later.\u00a0 It is unclear whether no one took notes on who was with Trump or whether notes were taken but not turned over for inclusion\u00a0 in the daily diary.\u00a0 Potentially complicating any efforts to complete the Jan. 6 daily diary was the handover of power that would take place later that month, on Jan. 20.\u00a0 White House diarists are required to cross-reference and finalize the events of the day, the former White House diarist explained, so if there are unknown gaps of time during a president's day, the diarist would likely search for the information later so that the gaps can be filled, a process that can take days. Even if the diarists were not able to obtain all of the information necessary to complete the Jan. 6 diary by the time President Biden was inaugurated on January 20, they would still have been required to submit the diary as it stood, along with all the Trump White House documents transferred to the archives. The former diarist said it would be difficult to imagine a scenario in which no records exist because there are always several different entities at the White House simultaneously\u00a0 logging what the president does throughout the day. The former diarist suggested that purposefully hiding records would likely require coordination with several entities \u2014 \"Secret Service go along with you, that means the White House operator has to go along with you, that means that the Usher's office has to go along with you.\"\u00a0 CBS News contacted some of the aides and allies listed in the daily diary who spoke with Trump before and after the seven-hour gap in the phone records. He talked to Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia, about the Georgia Senate runoff election, according to a source familiar with their call. Perdue had lost the runoff to Raphael Warnock a day earlier, on Jan. 5. The president tried to reach Senator Josh Hawley, but they did not connect that day.\u00a0 Later that evening, he spoke with outside attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Cleta Mitchell, both working to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Peter Navarro, who served as a top White House trade adviser to former President Donald Trump, claimed Monday that he received a subpoena from the top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., to testify before a grand jury and turn over documents related to the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. Navarro revealed he received the grand jury subpoena in a draft lawsuit obtained by CBS News, which he said he officially filed with the federal district court in Washington on Tuesday. He names as defendants House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the members of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack, and Matthew Graves, the U.S. attorney in Washington.\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0was the first to report Navarro received the grand jury subpoena. The former Trump adviser claims that he received the subpoena in the \"early morning hours\" May 26, when two FBI agents \"banged loudly\" on the door of his home, according to his suit. The subpoena summons Navarro to testify before a grand jury on Thursday and turn over documents about the events leading up to the Jan. 6 insurrection, including \"any communications\" with Trump. Navarro argues the grand jury subpoena \"pointedly ignored all claims of executive privilege and testimony immunity,\" and is \"unlawful and unenforceable.\" He repeatedly refers to the subpoena as a \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" and is requesting a federal judge block its enforcement. The House Select Committee examining the Jan. 6 attack and the events leading up to it first issued a subpoena to Navarro for records and testimony in early February. Investigators believe Navarro worked with Steve Bannon, a close ally of Trump's and former White House adviser, and others to craft a plan to change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. The February request from the House committee also notes that in his book, Navarro described the plan as the \"Green Bay Sweep\" and wrote it was \"the last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\" Navarro refused to comply with the select committee's subpoena, and in April, the House voted to refer criminal contempt charges against him and former White House aide Dan Scavino to the Justice Department for failing to cooperate with the panel's demand. According to Navarro's lawsuit, the grand jury subpoena commands him to comply with the separate subpoena issued by the House panel in February. But he challenges the legality of the original subpoena, claiming the select committee is \"neither duly authorized nor properly constituted,\" and the subpoena, together with the House resolution finding him in contempt of Congress, represents legislative acts \"that violate the principle of separation of powers in their simultaneous and unlawful pursuit of a judicial function.\" Navarro goes on to argue the U.S. attorney in Washington must negotiate his appearance before the grand jury with Trump and his attorneys, as he is bound by executive privilege invoked by the former president over information related to the Jan. 6 assault. Trump himself has sought to block the release of White House records related to the Jan. 6 insurrection from the National Archives and Records Administration, citing executive privilege. But in January, the Supreme Court rejected the former president's request to withhold the materials. President Biden has waived executive privilege over a slew of White House documents sought by the House select committee, but Navarro plans to ask the federal district court in Washington to declare the president does not have the legal authority to do so. While Navarro claims there was an \"abundance of fraud and election irregularities\" in the 2020 presidential election, dozens of legal challenges to election results in key battleground states were rebuffed by federal judges. The Supreme Court also spurned efforts by Trump and his allies to reverse the outcome of the election. While the Justice Department has charged more than 800 people for their roles in the Capitol assault, Attorney General Merrick Garland has come under pressure for not taking action against political leaders whose baseless claims of widespread voter fraud fomented the rioters who breached the Capitol building on Jan. 6 in hopes of stopping Congress from reaffirming Mr. Biden's victory. Garland, though, has vowed the Justice Department is committed to \"holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law \u2014 whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.\"\u00a0 Sara Cook contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ordered John Eastman, a conservative lawyer who devised the legal strategy to keep former President Donald Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election, to turn over 159 documents to the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. U.S. District Judge David O. Carter, who has been overseeing the records dispute between Eastman and the House panel, said the latest tranche to be disclosed are not covered by attorney-client privilege or protected work product, as the conservative lawyer asserted. The 159 documents were part of a broader batch of nearly 600 documents that Eastman fought to shield from the committee, 440 of which Carter said were privileged and protected from disclosure. Carter, who sits on the federal district court in Santa Ana, California, gave Eastman until 5 p.m. Wednesday to give the 159 documents to the select committee, ensuring House investigators will have access to the records before their prime-time public hearing Thursday. Charles Burnham, Eastman's lawyer, said in a statement he \"remains of the view that seeking to influence action by Congress in order to address the significant evidence of illegality and fraud in the election \u2014 evidence that only grows by the day \u2014 is not only not criminal, but is fully protected by the First Amendment's Freedom of Speech and right to petition the government for redress of grievances.\" Among the documents to be handed over to the select committee are 10 that Carter found are \"closely tied\" to its investigation. The records, he wrote, relate to three meetings held in the first two weeks of December 2020 by a group of Trump's supporters, which had a \"high-profile leader,\" and included discussions about efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Four of those 10 documents pertain to a meeting on Dec. 8, and five others include the agenda for a meeting Dec. 9, which include a section entitled \"'GROUND GAME following Nov 4 Election Results,' during which a sitting Member of Congress discussed a '[p]lan to challenge the electors in the House of Representatives,'\" according to Carter's order. The 10th document contained the agenda for a Dec. 16 meeting. \"The select committee has a substantial interest in these three meetings because the presentations furthered a critical objective of the January 6 plan: to have contested states certify alternate slates of electors for President Trump,\" Carter wrote, adding that in the weeks before the December meetings, Eastman sent memos to \"high-level White House staff\" about the plan to overturn the election results. The conservative attorney also contacted \"sympathetic state legislators\" in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona, key battleground states Trump lost, urging them to decertify presidential electors for President Biden and instead certify an alternate slate of pro-Trump electors, according to the court's order. \"Dr. Eastman's actions in these few weeks indicate that his and President Trump's pressure campaign to stop the electoral count did not end with Vice President Pence \u2014 it targeted every tier of federal and state elected officials,\" Carter said. \"Convincing state legislatures to certify competing electors was essential to stop the count and ensure President Trump's reelection.\" Carter also indicates in his order that Eastman's documents confirm the plan for Vice President Mike Pence to reject or delay the counting of state electoral votes during the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress was established \"well before\" lawmakers convened to reaffirm Mr. Biden's victory over Trump. Those proceedings were temporarily disrupted when the mob of Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol to stymie the counting of state electoral votes. In one email from Dec. 22, an attorney with Trump's legal team referenced the \"January 6 strategy\" as a plan known to eight others. Two days later, Eastman \"explained that the worst case for the plan was receiving a court decision that constrained Vice President Pence's authority to reject electors,\" according to Carter's order.\u00a0 \"Dr. Eastman and President Trump's plan to stop the count was not only established by early December, it was the ultimate goal that the legal team was working to protect from that point forward,\" he wrote. In examining the trove of documents contested by Eastman, Carter found one email, dated Dec. 22, may have been in furtherance of a crime. In that message, an attorney \"goes beyond strategizing litigation outcomes\" and considers whether to bring a case to shed light on the interpretation of the Electoral Count Act and the Jan. 6 proceedings of Congress. \"Because the attorney concluded that a negative court ruling would 'tank the January 6 strategy,' he encouraged the legal team to avoid the courts,\" Carter said. \"This email cemented the direction of the January 6 plan. The Trump legal team chose not to seek recourse in court \u2014 instead, they forged ahead with a political campaign to disrupt the electoral count. Lawyers are free not to bring cases; they are not free to evade judicial review to overturn a democratic election.\" The decision from Carter is the latest in a long-running battle between the House select committee and Eastman, a former law professor, over communications using his Chapman University email account. The Jan. 6 panel issued a subpoena to the school in January for records related to the presidential contest or the Capitol assault, but Eastman sued to block their disclosure, arguing the documents included information protected under attorney-client privilege and attorney work-product privilege. In a blockbuster decision in March, Carter ordered Eastman turn over 101 emails exchanged between Jan. 4 and Jan. 7, a more narrow batch involving a crucial period for House investigators. In his decision, the judge found it \"more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct\" congressional proceedings on Jan. 6. \"Dr. Eastman and President Trump launched a campaign to overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history,\" he wrote. \"Their campaign was not confined to the ivory tower \u2014 it was a coup in search of a legal theory.\"",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois that aired Sunday, March 27, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: We go now to Illinois Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. He's a member of the panel investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol and he's in Houston this morning. Congressman, welcome. U.S. CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER: Thank you. Good to be with you. JOHN DICKERSON: Let's start- before we go to the January 6 committee, let's start with Ukraine. President Zelenskyy called for more planes and tanks from NATO, as you heard us just discuss. He said, I've talked to the defenders of Mariupol today, if only those who have been thinking for 31 days on how to handle- handover dozens of jets and tanks had 1% of their courage. You have advocated for a no-fly zone. What's your feeling about giving planes and tanks to the Ukrainians? REP. KINZINGER: Look, I mean, I've talked to Ukrainian members of parliament, those out, you know, advocating for what's needed on the ground as well. And they say they need these. I mean, we can have the Pentagon all they want say, well, we don't think they have the pilots for the MiGs. They do. They have pilots trained and waiting. We can have the Pentagon say, well, we think this is escalatory. Well, if you don't think, you know, javelins that are killing thousands of Russian soldiers are escalatory, but then sending an airplane, you know, and frankly, Ukraine has already flown some airplanes is the, like, escalatory thing, that's just wrong. And I think it's sending the wrong message. We have to give them everything they need to win this war because we've made it clear we're not going to intervene directly. And I don't think we should at this point. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We're going to move on, Congressman, to the January 6 committee. Bob Costa and Bob Woodward, who are both on with me a little bit later, reported on texts to the committee this- that the committee has from the wife of Clarence Thomas. And I just want to read a little excerpts of them. They are to the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, urging efforts to overthrow the election. Mr. Thomas wrote 'Do not concede,' And then in another she wrote, 'The majority knows Biden and the left is attempting the greatest heist of our history.' Where are these significant? REP. KINZINGER: Well, look, I can't, as a member of the committee, confirm, deny the existence of those. I'll tell you, though, we have thousands of text messages from lots of people. We have a lot of documents. And we are going to, in a methodical, fact-driven way, get to the answers here. We'll- we'll call in whoever we need to call in. I think the bottom line for the committee is this, was there an effort to overturn the legitimate election of the United States? What was January 6 in relation to that? And what is the rot in our system that led to that and does it still exist today? You know, with conspiracy theories, as we've seen, you know, reported this idea of releasing the kracken or that the CIA attacked the DOD or was attacked by the DOD in Germany. John, like half of the country at one point believed some of that stuff. And this is a roadmap for how to overturn a legitimately elected government. So this is important. We're going to get to the bottom of this. And as we're seeing in Ukraine, people are willing to die for democracy. We at least have to be willing to put careers on the line for the same cause. JOHN DICKERSON: So no one's disputing the authenticity of these texts. Which leads to the question: will the committee subpoena Mrs. Thomas and question her? REP. KINZINGER: Look, I think, again, we want to make sure that this isn't driven, even though it's in the political realm, it's not driven by a political motivation, it's driven by facts. So when it comes to any potential future calling in of Ms. Thomas, we'll- we'll take a look at what the evidence is and we'll make a decision and you all will know as soon as we do. What I don't want to do is get into speculating too much, because I think it is important that we have answers for the American people in a factual way here. JOHN DICKERSON: You talked about rot in the system. Does the rot reach the Supreme Court? REP. KINZINGER: Look, again, I'm not going to say that. I'm not going to say that it does or doesn't. We're just going to present the American people what the answer is. And the Supreme Court handles their own ethics. They handle their own internal stuff. But what we need to do is present to the American people where they've been lied to, where they've believed lies, where there are bad actors out there, for instance, that are sympathetic to Vladimir Putin. That kind of stuff is very important so that in five or ten years when kids are reading in the history books about January 6th, they're not buying into any of these conspiracies. They're getting the truth. JOHN DICKERSON: What is wrong with- you said the Supreme Court has its own ethics, so we'll let them handle that. Why can't a private citizen send texts, as zany as they may be, to the White House chief of staff, what's- what's wrong with that? REP. KINZINGER: Well, again, we're in a position where we're not confirming or denying, you know, what's been reported by Costa and Woodward. But if they're- you know, look, in any case, if a- if a private citizen has a conversation, of course, we have a freedom of speech- speech in this country. The question for the committee is this or any exchange, was there a conspiracy or an attempt to come up with a reason or how close did we get to overturn an election. Look, we are not as the committee out to, you know, to throw people in jail. We can have criminal referrals like we do against Mark Meadows because he has denied legitimate requests from Congress to come in repeatedly. So that's in DOJ. Our job is just to get answers to the American people and then they can decide. JOHN DICKERSON: Before- these texts drop off. They go away in December and January, given the passion with which Mrs. Thomas was texting. Do you- are you confident that Meadows has handed over all of his texts? REP. KINZINGER: I'm not confident that- that Meadow's handed over everything at all. I mean, he was cooperating with us for a little bit, and then in an attempt to make Donald Trump happy, he stopped cooperating. We gave him plenty of space to come back to resume that. He has not. And in fact, he's waived executive privilege, you know, a thousand times by-by presenting us what he already has. So, no, I'm not convinced he's handed over everything to us. And that's why it's in the DOJ's hands now, whether to prosecute him for contempt. He has contempt not just for Congress, for his old institution of Congress, and thereby for the American people. I hope DOJ does the right thing and I hope we get all the information that- not- it's not Congress that the American people deserve, John. The American people deserve these answers. JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Congressman Kinzinger, thank you so much for being with us. We'll see you again. And we'll be right back with a lot more on FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014\u00a0Donald Trump's top White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, rejected a plea offer extended to him by the government in his ongoing contempt of Congress criminal case, prosecutors said Friday.\u00a0 Navarro was indicted earlier this year on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress after refusing to comply with demands from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack that he hand over pertinent documents and sit for a deposition.\u00a0 The plea deal that Navarro rejected stipulated that he admit to one of the two charges brought against him and comply with the House subpoena in a manner satisfactory to the Justice Department. In exchange, according to federal prosecutors, the government would limit its sentencing request for Navarro to a maximum of 30 days in prison. Each of the misdemeanor counts carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison if convicted.\u00a0 The select committee first subpoenaed Navarro for records and testimony in early February. Investigators believe Navarro worked with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and others to craft a plan to change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. The February request from the committee also notes that in his book, Navarro described the plan as the \"Green Bay Sweep\" and wrote it was \"the last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\" Navarro refused to comply, citing executive privilege and his role as former senior adviser to the one-time president and was subsequently charged with criminal contempt of Congress.\u00a0 In court on Friday, Navarro's defense team characterized the prosecution, set to go to trial in November, as a case of \"first impression,\" arguing there is neither a historic nor legal basis for contempt charges against a former White House aide. Navarro's lawyers also alleged a certain \"degree of animus\" by the Justice Department after the defendant was arrested last month at a D.C.-area airport, where he planned to board a flight to Nashville for a TV appearance.\u00a0 After his arrest, Navarro criticized the law enforcement response, accusing investigators of rebuffing his attempts to negotiate with an attorney and instead placing him in handcuffs and leg irons.\u00a0 His attorneys again raised what they characterized as the government's \"outrageous\" treatment of Navarro at the time of his arrest on Friday to Judge Amit Mehta, the federal judge overseeing the case and said they plan on asking for more evidence about the nature of his arrest.  \"It seems curious to me\u2026why the government treated Mr. Navarro's arrest in the way that it did,\" Mehta concurred in court on Friday. Prosecutors have maintained in court filings that Navarro made \"numerous misrepresentations\" about his arrest.\u00a0\u00a0 The U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C. declined to comment.\u00a0 On Monday, another top Trump aide, Steve Bannon, will be the first defendant accused of criminally ignoring a Jan. 6 committee subpoena to go to trial. Navarro pleaded not guilty to both counts and recently hired two attorneys to represent him after initially representing himself in court.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol is asking former President Trump's daughter and adviser Ivanka Trump to speak with them.\u00a0 In\u00a0a letter to Ivanka Trump requesting the interview, the committee chairman, Congressman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, notes that she was with her father in the White House on January 6 and was present in the Oval Office during a phone conversation he had with Vice President Mike Pence that morning. Thompson told reporters before the letter was released publicly that \"you will anticipate the committee inviting some people to come talk to us.\" Asked whether those requests would be made to lawmakers, Thompson said, \"not lawmakers right now. Ivanka Trump.\" A spokesperson for Ivanka Trump said in a statement she \"just learned that the January 6 Committee issued a public letter asking her to appear. As the committee already knows, Ivanka did not speak at the January 6 rally. As she publicly stated that day at 3:15pm, 'any security breach or disrespect to our law enforcement is unacceptable. The violence must stop immediately. Please be peaceful.'\" The letter cites a phone conversation Trump had with Pence on the morning of January 6 in the Oval Office, for which Ivanka Trump was present. Thompson said Keith Kellogg, Pence's national security adviser, was also there for the call and he told the select committee he recalled the former president encouraging Pence to reject states' electoral votes during the joint session of Congress or delay the counting of votes. Kellogg, according to Thompson's letter, testified that Ivanka Trump turned to him at the end of the call and said, \"Mike Pence is a good man.\" Trump's call with Pence is among the items the committee said it wants to discuss with Ivanka Trump, as well as other conversations she may have witnessed or participated in regarding her father's plan to \"obstruct or impede the counting of electoral votes.\" Thompson also said House investigators have documents suggesting Trump's White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, \"may have concluded\" that Pence rejecting or delaying the counting of state electoral votes \"would violate the Constitution or would be otherwise illegal.\" \"Did you discuss those issues with any member of the White House counsel's office? To your knowledge, were any such legal conclusions shared with President Trump?\" the chairman asked. He also referenced a message from an unnamed member of the House Freedom Caucus, a coalition of conservative lawmakers, sent to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows before January 6 that warned \"If POTUS allows this to occur \u2026 we're driving a stake in the heart of the federal republic.\" \"Did you discuss that or similar concerns with the White House chief of staff?\" Thompson wrote to Ivanka Trump. \"Or with the vice president or his staff?\" Shifting to Trump's response to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, Thompson said House investigators are seeking to glean more information about discussions inside the White House and with the president before and after a tweet claiming, \"Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our Constitution.\" Thompson said the panel obtained testimony indicating White House staff sought Ivanka Trump's assistance several times \"to intervene in an attempt to persuade President Trump to address the ongoing lawlessness and violence\" at the Capitol.\u00a0 Kellogg also told the committee that White House staff wanted Trump to \"take some immediate action to quell the unrest,\" according to Thompson's letter, though the president was \"stubborn\" and staff believed his daughter could push him to act, according to one account. Thompson referenced testimony in which Ivanka Trump agreed to speak with the president but was forced to make multiple attempts to persuade him. According to one text exchange with an unnamed White House staff member obtained by the committee, the aide received a message asking, \"Is someone getting to potus? He has to tell protestors to dissipate. Someone is going to get killed.\" The White House staff member replied: \"I've been trying for the last 30 minutes. Literally stormed in outer oval to get him to put out the first one. It's completely insane.\" \"We are particularly interested in this question: Why didn't White House staff simply ask the president to walk to the briefing room and appeal on live television \u2014 to ask the crowd to leave the Capitol?\" Thompson told Ivanka Trump in the letter. Kellogg told the committee he advised against Trump appearing in the White House briefing room, as \"press conferences tend to get out of control, and they want to control the message,\" according to the January 6 panel. \"Apparently, certain White House staff believed that a live unscripted press appearance by the president in the midst of the Capitol Hill violence could have made the situation worse,\" Thompson wrote. The select committee is also examining whether Trump gave an order to deploy the National Guard to assist with responding to the violence at the Capitol on January 6, the chair said. Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller told the panel under oath that the president never contacted him at any point on January 6th, and never issued him any order to deploy the National Guard. Miller said he did speak with Pence that day, Thompson's letter said. \"The committee has identified no evidence that President Trump issued any order, or took any other action, to deploy the guard that day,\" he told Ivanka Trump. \"Nor does it appear that President Trump made any calls at all to the Department of Justice or any other law enforcement agency to request deployment of their personnel to the Capitol.\" Regarding Trump's activities following the Capitol assault, Thompson said the select committee has information indicating White House staff and others were trying to get the president to stop making statements about a \"stolen election\" and working with allies of the president outside the White House to buoy their efforts. According to text messages from Fox News host Sean Hannity obtained by the committee, Hannity texted White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on January 7 laying out a multi-pronged approach for conversations with Trump. McEnany spoke to the committee earlier this month.\u00a0 The first two items of Hannity's plan were: \"1-No more stolen election talk\" and \"2-Yes, impeachment and 25 th amendment are real, and many people will quit. \u2026\" Thompson revealed in his letter to Ivanka Trump. McEnany replied, \"Love that. Thank you. That is the playbook. I will help reinforce.\"\u00a0 Hannity, according to documents obtained by the January 6 panel, also texted McEnany \"Key now. No more crazy people,\" to which she replied, \"Yes 100%.\" \"The select committee would like to discuss this effort after January 6th to persuade President Trump not to associate himself with certain people, and to avoid further discussion regarding election fraud allegations,\" Thompson told Ivanka Trump in the letter.\u00a0 Earlier this week, Thompson confirmed the committed had requested \"certain data records\" from Trump's son Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.'s fianc\u00e9e Kimberly Guilfoyle but he stopped short of calling it a subpoena.\u00a0 Guilfoyle's attorney responded that they \"know nothing of a subpoena, but it is of no consequence to her because she has absolutely nothing to hide or be concerned about.\"\u00a0 The committee issued subpoenas this week to top Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, Sidney Powell and Boris Epshteyn, who all sought to overturn the 2020 election results. Thompson said \"we are optimistic that more cooperation from witnesses will be coming\" in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision Wednesday not to block the release of records from the Trump White House, which are held by the National Archives, to the committee. Thompson said last week the committee has issued more than 80 subpoenas, including to Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege. Two top Trump allies, Bannon and Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon. Both said they are following instructions from Trump, who has claimed executive privilege.\u00a0 The House select committee, created by Speaker Nancy Pelosi last year, is investigating the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol during the Stop the Steal rally, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 assault on U.S. Capitol on Tuesday issued subpoenas to former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and three others who challenged the 2020 election results.\u00a0 In addition to Giuliani, the committee is demanding documents and testimony from Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell, two lawyers who worked to promote the president's false claims about the election, as well as Boris Epshteyn, a former Trump White House aide. \"The four individuals we've subpoenaed today advanced unsupported theories about election fraud, pushed efforts to overturn the election results, or were in direct contact with the former President about attempts to stop the counting of electoral votes,\" the panel's chairman Bennie Thompson said in a statement.\u00a0 All four witnesses were asked to turn over documents by February 1, and appear for depositions on February 8.\u00a0 The four figures participated in a November 19, 2020 press conference that featured outlandish claims the election had been stolen and that Trump had won in a \"landslide.\" But the batch of subpoenas also shows how the committee \u2013 which has spoken with nearly 400 witnesses \u2013\u00a0 is now closing in on the former president's inner circle. CNN cited sources Tuesday as saying the panel has subpoenaed and obtained records of phone numbers associated with one of Trump's sons, Eric Trump, and of Donald Trump Jr.'s fiance, Kimberly Guilfoyle. Eric Trump tweeted Tuesday night that, \"The witch-hunt continues. This partisan committee is welcome to review my phone records - I have absolutely nothing to hide.\" In the weeks following the November election, Giuliani was among the loudest voices promoting Trump's false claims of electoral fraud and meeting with state legislators to persuade them to ignore the 2020 results. But according to a letter addressed to Giuliani, the committee also believes from witness testimony that the former New York City mayor urged Trump in December 2020 to direct the seizure of voting machines across the country, even after being told the Department of Homeland Security lacked that authority. Since the 2020 election, Rudy Giuliani's law license has been suspended in New York and Washington D.C. .\u00a0 Meanwhile, the committee is interested in asking Ellis about two publicly reported memos she prepared and circulated after the election, claiming that former Vice President Mike Pence could delay the counting of certain states' electoral results. In a letter addressed to Powell, Thompson said the committee is seeking evidence the former federal prosecutor relied on promoting baseless allegations of electoral fraud. The letter also cited public reporting that Powell may have also been involved in efforts to urge Trump to direct the seizure of voting machines. Powell attorney Howard Kleinhendler issued a statement on her behalf saying in part that she \"looks forward to appearing before the Committee to answer questions, walk through the evidence, and present a full picture of the fraud and other misconduct that took place during the 2020 Election, including the myriad of election fraud allegations only now being examined by state officials in Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere.\" Epshteyn is of interest to the committee in part because of reports that he was at meetings held at the Willard Hotel in Washington in the days leading up to January 6, where Giuliani and other Trump allies met and coordinated as part of the effort to stop the certification of President Biden's victory. In a letter to Epshteyn, Thompson also pointed to a report that said Epshteyn participated in a call with Trump on the morning of January 6. In a statement on Twitter on Tuesday, Epshteyn called it \"no surprise whatsoever\" that he was subpoenaed by the \"January 6th Unselect Committee.\" He continued with his baseless claim that he is \"happy to share\" information about \"overwhelming fraud that permeated the 2020 election in Arizona, Wisconsin, Georgia, Pennsylvania and beyond.\" Thompson said last week that the committee has issued about 85 subpoenas, including Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege. Two top Trump allies, Bannon and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday\u00a0spurned a request from former President Donald Trump to block the release of documents from the Trump White House to the House select committee investigating the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0 The order from the high court clears the way for the National Archives to turn over to House investigators records they requested related to the breach of the Capitol by scores of Trump's supporters. President Biden waived executive privilege over the documents.\u00a0 Only Justice Clarence Thomas noted that he would have granted Trump's request. Trump asked the high court last month to stop the transfer of records to the select committee after a federal appeals court in the District of Columbia rejected his efforts to shield the documents from lawmakers. At issue in the legal fight between the former president and the House select committee are reams of records related to the events of January 6, including presidential diaries, visitor logs, handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, binders from then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and a draft executive order on election integrity, according to a filing from the National Archives. Trump asserted executive privilege over more than 750 pages of these documents, which are at the crux of his lawsuit against the National Archives and select committee. But Mr. Biden declined to uphold the former president's claims of executive privilege over the documents sought by the panel, and Trump filed suit in October to prevent their disclosure. In an unsigned opinion, the Supreme Court said \"the questions whether and in what circumstances a former president may obtain a court order preventing disclosure of privileged records from his tenure in office, in the face of a determination by the incumbent president to waive the privilege, are unprecedented and raise serious and substantial concerns.\" Still, the high court noted that because the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found Trump's privilege clams would have failed even if he were the incumbent president, \"his status as a former president necessarily made no difference to the court's decision.\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a separate statement respecting the court's decision that he believes a former president should be able to successfully shield communications from his presidency, even if the sitting president does not support the privilege claim. \"Concluding otherwise would eviscerate the executive privilege for presidential communications,\" Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under President George W. Bush, warned. He further said there would be \"severe\" consequence for the presidency if presidents and White House advisers thought their privileged communications could be released when the president left office. In asking the Supreme Court to reverse the lower court rulings against the former president and stop the National Archives from handing the records over to the committee Trump's attorneys argued investigators' request is \"strikingly broad\" and \"untethered from any valid legislative purpose.\"\u00a0 \"While the protections of executive privilege and restrictions on access to presidential records are qualified, it is critical that future presidents and their advisers understand the contours and perimeters of that privilege \u2014 and its exceptions \u2014 after the conclusion of a presidential term,\" they argued. \"Otherwise, the deliberative process of advising presidents will be chilled, as advisers will doubtless understand the audience of their deliberations is not simply the president in whose administration they serve but also Congress and their political rivals. The frankness of their advice will necessarily be chilled \u2014 to the nation's detriment.\" But lawyers for the House select committee said in a filing that involvement by the Supreme Court would \"delay a co-equal branch's urgent investigation into an unprecedented assault on Congress itself\" and warned halting the release of the documents, even temporarily, \"would result in an unprecedented intrusion by this court into the ongoing process of accommodation between the legislative and executive branches. \"It would cause irreparable harm to the select committee by denying it the records it urgently needs to inform its ongoing investigation, including upcoming interviews of scores of witnesses,\" they argued. \"Obtaining this information promptly is necessary to fulfill the select committee's responsibility to understand the events of January 6, and recommend timely legislative changes designed to ensure that those events never recur.\" The January 6 select committee has requested documents and testimony from a slew of White House aides, Trump allies, at least two members of Congress and organizers of the January 6 rally outside the White House. Some of the requests have spurned numerous legal challenges, as former White House aides have refused to turn over the documents, citing the former president's claims of executive privilege. Meadows last month filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to nullify subpoenas issued by the House committee for testimony and phone records, as did Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser. Both Meadows and Flynn claimed the subpoenas issued by the select committee are overbroad and lack a legislative purpose. Trump himself has looked to the Supreme Court in past efforts to shield his financial records from congressional investigators and the Manhattan district attorney. The former president appointed three justices to the high court, expanding its conservative majority to 6-3.",

            "article_content": "The House Committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol will meet Monday to consider recommending that the House hold former Trump aides Peter Navarro and Daniel Scavino in contempt for defying congressional subpoenas.\u00a0 If the committee recommends a contempt vote and the full House approves the resolution \u2013 a likely outcome, given it is made up of Democrats and only two Republicans, who both support investigating the former president's role in the attack \u2013 the pair could be referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for prosecution. The committee issued a subpoena for records and testimony from former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in February, alleging he developed plans to change the outcome of the election.\u00a0 In the weeks leading up to January 6, Navarro promoted a document he called the \"Navarro Report\" that asserted baseless and discredited claims of election fraud.\u00a0 In a statement on Thursday, Navarro called the possible contempt vote \"an unprecedented partisan assault on executive privilege.\" Navarro, along with other Trump allies who have been subpoenaed, have said they cannot overrule Trump invoking executive privilege. President Biden, meanwhile, has rejected the claims of executive privilege.\u00a0 \"Until this matter has been settled at the Supreme Court, where it is inevitably headed, the Committee should cease its tactics of harassment and intimidation,\" Navarro said in the statement. \"I would be happy to cooperate with the committee in expediting a review of this matter by the Supreme Court and look forward to arguing the case.\" In a book published last year, Navarro wrote that he and other Trump advisors constructed a plan called the \"Green Bay Sweep\" as the \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\"\u00a0 He described the scheme, which was done in coordination with Steve Bannon, in interviews with The Daily Beast late last year and MSNBC last month. In his appearance on MSNBC, he told host Ari Melber that they had lined up \"over 100\" congressmen and senators to help challenge the election results in six battleground states that had been won by Joe Biden. \"These were the places where we believed that if the votes were sent back to those battleground states and looked at again, that there would be enough concern amongst the legislatures that most or all of those states would decertify the election. That would throw the election to the House of Representatives,\" Navarro said, arguing the plan was legal. In a statement to CBS News at the time of the subpoena, Navarro accused the January 6 committee of being \"domestic terrorists\" and called their efforts a \"partisan witch hunt.\" He said that since Trump has invoked executive privilege, the committee should \"negotiate any waiver of the privilege with the president and his attorneys directly, not through me.\" Scavino, the former White House communications director, was subpoenaed for documents and testimony in September, along with former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former Senior Counselor Steve Bannon, and former Pentagon Chief of Staff Kashyap Patel. The committee sought his testimony about Mr. Trump's activities and communications in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol, citing both his presence in the White House that day as well as his more than a decade of work for the former president. Scavino sued Verizon late last year in an attempt to block the company from handing over his phone records in response to a separate subpoena from the committee.\u00a0 The House has already voted to hold Bannon and Meadows in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas from the committee. The Justice Department has yet to take action in Meadows' case after the House vote in December. Bannon was indicted for contempt in November and has pleaded not guilty. The committee has issued more than 90 subpoenas, including ones to Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee last year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory.

            "article_content": "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Representative Liz Cheney that aired Sunday, January 2, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We now turn to the Congressional Committee investigating Jan. 6, Republican Liz Cheney of Wyoming is the vice chair of the committee, and she joins us now from Capitol Hill. Good morning to you. REP. LIZ CHENEY: Good morning, MARGARET. Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We know Democrats are planning a vigil. We know the former president is planning a news conference. Are you concerned about the country being at risk of political violence this week and in the years ahead? REP. CHENEY: Look, I think that if- if what he has been saying since he left office is any indication, former President Trump is likely again this week to make the same false claims about the election that he knows to be false and the same false claims about the election that he knows caused violence on Jan 6. I think that it is indeed very concerning, given what we know happened in the lead up to the sixth and what the committee is finding out about the events of that day. But I think that it- it's not surprising. But again, he knows these claims caused violence and we've seen now people who were in the Capitol, people who've been arrested because of their activities on that day, they themselves have told us in court filings, they've told us on social media, we've seen it on videos; that they were here because Donald Trump told them to be here. And so, he's very- he's doing this press conference on the sixth. Again, if he makes those same claims, he's doing it with complete understanding and knowledge of- of what those claims have caused in the past. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've raised in the past the possibility of criminal culpability for the president. Is that the consensus view of the committee? REP. CHENEY: Look, the committee is obviously going to follow the facts wherever they lead. We've made tremendous progress. We have had now- if you just think about, for example, what we know now about what the former president was doing on the 6th while the attack was underway. The committee has firsthand testimony that President Trump was sitting in the dining room next to the Oval Office, watching on television as the Capitol was assaulted as the violence occurred. We know that that is clearly a supreme dereliction of duty. One of the things that the committee is looking at from the perspective of our legislative purpose is whether we need enhanced penalties for that kind of dereliction of duty. But we've certainly never seen anything like that as a nation before. MARGARET BRENNAN: But one of the things that we've seen in CBS polling is that there is just a hard percentage of the population that believes what the former president is claiming. Eight million people believe in violence to restore him to office. Seven out of 10 Republicans still believe President Biden's illegitimate 66% believe there was widespread voter fraud. So, these numbers are pretty hard here. Why hasn't this conviction abated within your party? REP. CHENEY. Look, I think that- that we are in a situation where people have got to understand the danger of President Trump and the danger that he posed on that day. You know, if you think MARGARET, he- he could have simply walked a few feet to the White House briefing room, he could have gone immediately on live television and asked his supporters to stop what was happening, ask them to go home. He failed to do that. He- he instead, we know, had the motivation, at the same time, the violent assault was happening, he's watching television, he's also calling at least one senator urging delay of the electoral vote. So, this is a man who has demonstrated that he is at war with the rule of law. He's demonstrated that he's willing to blow through every guardrail of democracy, and he can never be anywhere near the Oval Office again. He's demonstrated a complete lack of fitness for office. I think one of the really important things that our committee has to do is lay these facts out for the American people so that they really have a sense of the truth of what happened that day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REP. CHENEY: --And so that they inform us in terms of our legislative activity going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: That assumes facts can actually persuade. What happens with this committee if Republicans take the majority in 2022? Have you asked Kevin McCarthy to keep it? REP. CHENEY: Look, Leader McCarthy has said a variety of things. He has both acted to obstruct the operations of the committee, but he's also, on a couple of occasions, said that he's willing to come talk to the committee. I think that the- the American people again and particularly the Republican Party, you know, we as Republicans, have a choice to make. I am a conservative Republican. I believe strongly in the policies of low taxes and limited government and a strong national defense. I think the country needs a strong Republican Party going forward, but our party has to choose. We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the Constitution, but we cannot be both. And right now, there are far too many Republicans who are trying to enable the former president, embrace the former president. Look the other way and hope that the former president goes away, trying to obstruct the activities of this committee. But we won't be deterred. At the end of the day, the facts matter, and the truth matters. MARGARET BRENNAN: It goes beyond the former president, in a number of state capitals around the country in 19 different states, election laws are being changed and in some there is concern that Republican controlled legislatures could be able to change certification of an election if they don't like the outcome of it. This is undermining confidence among some in the public about the integrity of our elections. Would you ask your fellow Republicans in states around the country to stop trying to do that? REP. CHENEY: Absolutely. I think that again, you know, as a nation, we've got to be founded on the rule of law. We've got to be founded on fidelity to the Constitution. And when you look at what former President Trump continues to do to this day in terms of trying to undermine our belief in our democratic process, in terms of trying to undermine the rule of law, in terms of trying to find local officials who will help him do that. One of the really important lessons we learned on January 6th was how important it was that we had a few individuals who stood up. We had individuals at the Department of Justice before Jan. 6 who stood up to the president who said, absolutely not, we will not claim that this election was stolen, who told him the truth. And we had local officials in the party, the Republican Party, who did the same. And so, I think for people all across the country, they need to recognize how important their vote is, how important their voice is. They've got to elect serious people who are going to defend the Constitution, not simply do the bidding of Donald Trump. MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is happening in 19 different states. As we mentioned there, there are efforts underway, but I want to come to the future in 2022 as we face elections, this isn't just about the presidential election, right? We have congressional races in 2022. You yourself are running out in Wyoming. We know the former president endorsed your primary opponent. He's promised to help campaign against you. You have one of his biggest donors, Peter Thiel, a billionaire throwing money behind your primary opponent. This is a direct challenge here. Given how red your state is, how do you expect to win that primary? REP. CHENEY: Look, I am absolutely honored and privileged to be able to represent the people of Wyoming in Congress. I absolutely anticipate that we will have a very energetic and hard-fought campaign this year. But at the end of the day, I am also incredibly privileged to be able to stand up and defend the Constitution of the United States, and I'm confident that the people of Wyoming will not choose loyalty to one man. One man as dangerous as Donald Trump is, you know, imagine a man who, while the violent assault was underway, while he was watching television, watching it unfold, not telling his supporters to stop and go home instead was sending out a tweet saying that Mike Pence was a coward. This is a man who is simply too dangerous ever to play a role again in our democracy, and I look forward to the opportunity to continue to help the American people see the facts about what happened and to continue to make the case at home about the kind of representation that we need in Washington for the people of Wyoming. MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you be willing to run against him in 2024? REP. CHENEY: I'm very focused right now on my re-election and on the work of the select committee, and I can tell you that that the single most important thing, though, is to ensure that the Donald Trump is not the Republican nominee and that he certainly is not anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Cheney, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back with the Chair of the House Intelligence Committee.\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: Thank you, MARGARET. Good to be with you.",

            "article_content": "The House on Wednesday voted to refer criminal contempt charges against two former Trump aides who haven't complied with subpoenas from the committee investigating the January 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol. The vote was 220 to 203, largely along party lines.\u00a0 The motion refers contempt charges against\u00a0Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino\u00a0to the Justice Department, after the former aides refused to comply with subpoenas to appear before the committee. Other contempt votes for\u00a0Steve Bannon\u00a0and\u00a0Mark Meadows\u00a0have already passed the House. \"To run into this kind obstruction ... as we investigate a violent insurrection is just despicable,\" said the committee's chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, ahead of the vote. \"It can't stand.\" Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the House January 6 committee, said ahead of the vote that by refusing to comply with the subpoena, Scavino showed \"contempt for the law and contempt for Congress.\" It will be entirely up to the DOJ to decide what to do with the referrals. The Justice Department charged Bannon in November with two counts of contempt of Congress, and his trial is set to start in July. The Justice Department has not yet moved on charges against Meadows.\u00a0 In a recent report, the January 6 committee accused Navarro, a former top trade adviser for Trump, of working with Bannon and others \"to develop and implement a plan to delay Congress' certification and ultimately change the outcome of the November 2020 presidential election.\" Scavino was the ex-president's social media guru and deputy chief of staff, and a longtime assistant to the president even before the White House. The committee claims they have \"reason to believe that Mr. Scavino was with then-President Trump on January 5 and January 6 and was party to conversations regarding plans to challenge, disrupt, or impede the official congressional proceedings.\"\u00a0 Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the committee, said ahead of the vote that, \"Election claims made by Donald Trump were so frivolous and so unfounded that the president's lead lawyer did not just lose these cases, he lost his license to practice law. The New York Supreme Court found, quote, 'there is uncontroverted evidence that Mr. Giuliani communicated demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public at large in his capacity as lawyer for Donald J. Trump and the Trump campaign in connection with Trump's failed effort in 2020.'\" Scavino and Navarro have cited executive privilege for why they can't appear, something President Biden has rejected. Thompson also has said executive privilege can't be claimed without at least showing up. Navarro countered in a statement that, \"President Trump has asserted executive privilege, it is not my privilege to waive, and the appropriate course of action would have been for the Committee to negotiate this matter directly with the president as I directed them do. \u00a0Instead, the Committee has colluded with the Biden White House in a futile effort to strip Donald Trump of executive privilege so it can coerce me into cooperating with their witch hunt. \u00a0This dog of a witch hunt won't hunt at the Supreme Court, and I look forward to arguing the case there.\" Some Democratic lawmakers have begun to express frustration with the Justice Department and Attorney General Merrick Garland for not following through on indictments against Trump allies related to January 6. \"Attorney General Garland, do your job so we can do ours,\" said Rep. Elaine Luria, a Democrat from Virginia and a select committee member, last week. \u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The National Archives said it plans to release a group of disputed Trump White House documents to the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol on Wednesday evening, barring intervention from the federal courts. This group of documents is not specifically identified in the ongoing lawsuit between former President Donald Trump and the committee, which pertains to three additional collections of his White House records, so the Archives said the documents can be turned over.\u00a0 \"Absent an intervening court order, the Archivist intends to release records from the fourth tranche to the Committee at 6:00 pm tomorrow,\" the National Archives wrote the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals late Tuesday night.\u00a0 According to the letter and other filings, the handout includes just four pages of documents from the Office of Records Management, records the former president has attempted to shield from the committee.\u00a0 \"As this Court observed, the former President asserted executive privilege over six pages of documents from the fourth tranche and President Biden declined to uphold that assertion,\" the filing to the court read. \"Because two of the six pages are similar to pages that are contained in the first three tranches and subject to this Court's administrative injunction, the Archivist intends to produce only the remaining four pages.\" The Appeals Court panel to which the letter was addressed already ruled that three initial tranches of documents could be handed over to the House committee, finding that a former president does not have the right to exert executive privilege if a current president disagrees. \u00a0 However, to give Trump's team time to bring the question before the Supreme Court, the judges paused the enforcement of their ruling by issuing an administrative injunction.\u00a0 \"This Court specifically stated in its December 9, 2021 decision,\" Tuesday night's filing explains, \"that its administrative injunction encompassed only records from the first three tranches, which were the only tranches at issue in the appeal.\"\u00a0 The Archives, represented by Justice Department lawyers, noted in its filing that President Biden refused to exert executive privilege of the documents, but ordered the document transfer to be delayed 30 days longer than stipulated to give his predecessor time to ask a court to stop it.\u00a0 \"Despite that opportunity, the former President did not move for a preliminary injunction in district court with respect to records from the fourth tranche or even amend his complaint to seek relief with respect to any such records. Nor did he seek clarification or further relief from this Court,\" the Archives explained.\u00a0 Trump did, however, attempt to preempt any future disclosure in his initial appeal to the Supreme Court by asking the justices to issue a blanket pause on any document transfers.\u00a0 \"There will be forthcoming tranches over which President Trump intends to assert privilege,\" his lawyers said. \"For the sake of judicial efficiency and to preserve the status quo, President Trump asks that Respondents be enjoined from producing any potentially privileged or restricted records until the petition for a writ of certiorari matter is resolved by the Court.\" \"To date, the former President has not sought such an order from the district court or this Court,\" Tuesday's letter from the Archives stated. In response to Tuesday's letter, Trump's legal team said the Archives' notice \"is nothing more than an attempt to proactively build a defense to prospective contemptuous conduct.\" \"The government has the burden backwards: President Trump is under no obligation to seek another injunction to prevent an act squarely prohibited by an injunction already granted him,\" they said. \"Instead, it is the government's obligation to seek relief if it wishes to release said documents. Should the Government ignore its obligations under that order, then President Trump will promptly bring an appropriate motion before the Court.\" The Department of Justice and the National Archives maintained that Wednesday's release \"will not violate any order of any court,\" as the Supreme Court has yet to rule. Since the former president filed his lawsuit, the National Archives has revealed that it identified more than 1,500 pages pertinent to the committee's request in the first three tranches. These include daily presidential diaries, the files of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, multiple binders belonging to then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and White House talking points alleging voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. Trump has exerted privilege over more than 700 of these pages.\u00a0 The letter came after Trump's attorneys wrote to the Supreme Court, arguing the House Committee \"will not be harmed by delay\" in the document transfer from the first three tranches.\u00a0 \"Despite their insistence that the investigation is urgent, more than a year has passed since January 6, 2021. Years remain before the next transition of power. The Committee and the Court have time to make a swift but measured analysis of these important issues and make sure that in the rush to conduct its investigation, the Committee does not do irreparable structural damage in the process,\" the former president argued in the also attached docs.\u00a0 The Supreme Court has yet to rule or issue any notice on the former president's request.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away former President Donald Trump's legal fight with the House select committee investigating the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, bringing an end to the former president's quest to stop investigators from accessing reams of documents from his final weeks in the White House. Trump asked the high court in December to take up his appeal of a decision from the federal appeals court in the District of Columbia, which rejected his efforts to shield the documents from lawmakers and found Trump provided \"no basis\" for it to override President Biden's decision not to uphold his predecessor's claims of executive privilege over the records.\u00a0 In rejecting the former president's request, the decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remains in place. In addition to asking the Supreme Court to review the lower court's decision, the former president requested the justices stop the transfer of records from the National Archives and Records Administration to House investigators. They\u00a0declined to do so last month, and the select committee received more than 700 pages of records sought by the panel earlier this month. At issue in the legal fight between the former president and the House select committee were reams of records related to the events of January 6, including presidential diaries, visitor logs, handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, binders from then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and a draft executive order on election integrity, according to a filing from the National Archives. Trump asserted executive privilege over more than 750 pages of these documents, which were at the crux of his lawsuit against the National Archives and select committee. But Mr. Biden declined to uphold the former president's claims of executive privilege over the documents sought by the panel, and Trump filed suit in October to prevent their disclosure. Since its formation last year, the committee examining the events surrounding the January 6 attack on the Capitol has interviewed more than 475 witnesses and obtained over 60,000 documents, according to an aide to the panel. Investigators have issued dozens of subpoenas as part of their probe, including ones to Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege. Two top Trump allies, Steve Bannon and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon. Both cited Trump's claims of privilege for not complying.\u00a0 Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois who sits on the panel, told \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday he expects the committee will begin public hearings in the spring or summer.",

            "article_content": "On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click\u00a0here to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN, HOST: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation, we begin our third year of COVID-19 with a massive spike in Omicron cases and a still fragile democracy, as we near the first anniversary of the January 6 Capitol attack. America is kicking off 2022 with a repeat from last year, a coronavirus crisis that's going to get worse before it gets better. The Omicron variant, fueled by holiday gatherings and spreading with breathtaking speed, particularly among younger Americans, is frustrating and worrisome to a nation that has had enough. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): We have to do more. We have to do better. And we will. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But what else can be done, with nearly 15 percent of eligible adults still refusing to get vaccinated? We will talk with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. And as students head back to school after winter break, what's being done to keep them safe? Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will weigh in. Then: We're coming up on a year after the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, that devastating day for democracy. Is the Capitol still as much of a target now as it was then? Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger says, yes, even more so. (Begin VT) TOM MANGER (U.S. Capitol Police Chief): The threat level is much higher than it was a year ago. It's exponentially higher than it was five years ago. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Wyoming Republican Liz Cheney shares few political views with California Democrat Adam Schiff, but they are working together on the committee tasked with investigating the January 6 attack. We will hear from both of them. Plus, Americans weigh in on our democracy in a new CBS News poll. We will also talk with the University of Chicago professor Robert Pape. His latest study on political violence has some surprising findings about those arrested for their role in the insurrection. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Two years and two days ago, the WHO received the first formal word from China about a mysterious new virus circulating in Wuhan. We have made a lot of progress fighting that virus since those terrifying early days of the global pandemic. And we are learning to live with masks and restrictions designed to protect our health. But we're starting a third year of COVID, with new concerns and confusion about the Omicron variant. Mark Strassmann begins our COVID coverage from Atlanta. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): A new year in our COVID chronicles welcomed by maskless Floridians with this super-spreaders jamboree, risky behavior, even reckless. Like many New Year's resolutions, COVID records get broken daily. GOVERNOR PHIL MURPHY (D-New Jersey): The speed at which Omicron is spreading is staggering. MARK STRASSMANN: Take these jarring U.S. numbers, a new average of 356,000 new cases a day. That's four more cases every second. On Thursday, 16 states reported their highest total ever. WOMAN: The numbers we're seeing, put that mask on, and keep it on through January at least, honestly. MARK STRASSMANN: More ominously, those numbers could be fractional, driving this epidemic, people who are undiagnosed, either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but untested. WOMAN: This place is so busy. It's so packed. We have patients coming in all the time. MARK STRASSMANN: More worry spots, hospitals overwhelmed by sick patients and sick staff. WOMAN: The majority of these people are not vaccinated. I can't get them out of the fricking waiting room. I can't get the sick people out of the waiting room to get them away from these people with COVID. MARK STRASSMANN: Many doctors say avoid going to the E.R., often a COVID hotbed, especially for children. MAN: If you're going to have people getting together, and you have children that are unvaccinated, they will be the bullseye for Omicron. MARK STRASSMANN: Across COVID America last week, almost 400 children a day were hospitalized for the virus. That's a 66 percent increase from the week before. MAN: I'm probably seeing four to five times the number of children who are currently in my ICU. MARK STRASSMANN: Schools another worry. Millions of children head back to class tomorrow. Parents spend hours in line for testing, often confused about school guidance and protocols that vary district to district, even school to school. Many parents also worry their kids are soft targets. WOMAN: They got to use the same bathroom, the same lunchroom. So, you are still exposing back everybody to COVID. MARK STRASSMANN: More than 2,000 K-12 schools have already closed or will offer remote learning. But most of America's major school systems will resume this week by teaching in person, while they can. WOMAN: If the teachers we have are coming down with the virus, who's going to teach the students? (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Here in Georgia, testing now shows the positivity rate now pushes 40 percent. It's so high, Atlanta Public Schools just decided to hold virtual classes this week, when the kids come back on Tuesday -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann, thank you. And we go now to former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who also sits on the board of Pfizer. Good morning, and happy new year. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is not how we wanted to start the new year, of course. Doctor, how far out are we from the Omicron peak? And do we need to focus on the infection rate or the hospitalization rate? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, we clearly need to focus on the hospitalization rate and how many people are becoming severely ill. There is a very clear decoupling between cases at this point and hospitalizations and ICU admissions. This does appear to be a milder strain of coronavirus. And we also have a lot of immunity in the population. I think places that have been hard-hit early, like the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast, New England, Florida, parts of the Pacific Northwest, may be two weeks away from peaking, but the rest of the country probably faces a hard bmonth ahead of us. I don't think you're going to start to see a national peak until we get into February, because there's parts of the country that really haven't been hard-hit by Omicron yet. And the virus will spread around the country. There's a very clear, as I said, decoupling between cases and hospitalizations. And it does appear now, based on a lot of experimental evidence that we've gotten just in the last two weeks, that this is a milder form of the coronavirus. It appears to be a more of an upper airway disease than a lower airway disease. That's good for most Americans. The one group that that may be a problem for is very young kids, very young children, toddlers, who have trouble with upper airway infections. And you're, in fact, seeing more croup-like infections and bronchiolitis in New York City among children. So, that could be a challenge for young kids, and we are seeing rising hospitalizations among that pediatric segment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, obviously, a huge point for parents of young children like me. I have been looking at pediatric hospitalizations at this record high and concerned about sending my son back into a preschool even with a mask on. What do you tell parents? Are cloth masks just not good enough anymore? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Cloth masks aren't going to provide a lot of protection. That's the bottom line. This is an airborne illness. We now understand that. And a cloth mask is not going to protect you from a virus that spreads through airborne transmission. It could protect better through droplet transmission, something like the flu, but not something like this coronavirus. We have to recognize this has not been a benign disease in young children. There's a perception that young children haven't been hit hard to date from coronavirus. That's just not true. We've recorded more than 600 pediatric deaths from COVID over the last two years. To put that in perspective, we have one death from flu and the pediatric population last year and so far two this year. So, over a period of time when we've done a very good job protecting children generally from respiratory infections. We've recorded more than 600 deaths from COVID against three deaths from flu. So, this is affecting children, and particularly young children. And this new strain could have a predilection, again, for the upper airway, which could be a bigger challenge in young kids because of the way that it binds to the airway cells. In terms of going back to school, I think the prerogative clearly is to try to get schools reopened. We shouldn't be doing preemptive school closures, in my opinion, but there will be situations where we have reactive school closures, when there are large outbreaks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and we also know that there are staff shortages because people are actually getting sick, right? That's where the infection rate matters. People can't go to work, teachers, or kids have to stay home from school. Given the test-to-stay policies now, can we be confident that antigen tests are catching the virus and that, if your kid takes one, they can safely go to school? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, the manufacturers feel very confident that their tests, the major market tests, are detecting this virus. There was some experimental evidence that the FDA put out about a week ago showing that, in laboratory studies, there appeared to be decreased sensitivity in terms of the test's ability to detect this virus. But that doesn't correlate well with real-world settings, per se. So, we really don't know whether or not that experimental evidence is suggestive that these tests may not be as sensitive at picking up the virus. But they do appear to be detecting Omicron at pretty high rates. And I think you can be reasonably confident. Once again, if you're using the antigen test to protect a high-risk setting, the best approach is to do serial testing over a period of time. While any individual test could miss the infection, if you're doing serial testing, you're likely to pick it up. And we need to get tests into schools. We still don't have tests widely available to the schools, so that they can use these tests for tests-to- stay policies to prevent large quarantines when are cases diagnosed in the classroom. MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen even some universities move to remote learning for like a month or so. Should people plan to be back in the office and back in university settings in a month? Is that a clear time frame? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think, certainly, the February time frame is appropriate in terms of when we're going to pass through this Omicron wave across the United States. Now, this is a big country. This will affect different parts of the country at different points in time. But if the UK is any guide, London's already peaking. If South Africa is any guide, this is about a two-month epidemic wave from start to finish. And so, parts of the country that were affected earlier, like New York, probably are going to start to peak in the next two weeks, other parts within the next four weeks. So, I think certainly, by the end of February, we will be through this, if businesses need a guide of when prevalence is going to start to decline. In terms of school, I think the imperative needs to be to try to open schools. What you're saying by closing schools preemptively, and even colleges, is that you can't possibly control outbreaks in those settings. And I just don't think that that's the case. I think, with the tools we have, with prudence, with the knowledge we have about how to control this infection in those settings, you can do pretty -- a pretty good job of trying to control large outbreaks, certainly within the classroom. MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to button up what you said earlier, though, that your -- your teachers and your kids need to be wearing high-quality masks, not cloth ones. You made that point. If the FDA does go ahead... DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think that's -- yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Oh, no, I was -- that's the bottom line. And we haven't done a good job of getting high-quality masks to people. The question is, do people have the tools they need? And the answer is, in many cases, they still don't. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right. Well, some states like Connecticut are sending out N95 masks. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that hasn't happened elsewhere. The FDA is expected to green-light these booster shots for 12-to-15-year- olds and the immunocompromised in the younger age group. Should schools mandate them? Do you recommend them? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I certainly don't think schools should be mandating boosters. I think this should be left up to the discretion of parents and their physicians. You know, it's going to depend on the individual circumstance. What is the risk that the child's facing? Are they in a setting where they're more likely to come into contact with the infection? Do they have some underlying health conditions that put them at increased risk of bad outcomes? We've seen that the durability of the vaccines in young children, particularly 12 to 16, has been more robust than what we've seen in adults. In the studies, at six months, there was 100 percent protection in that 12-to-16 cohort. And that's likely because kids are getting a more robust response from the vaccines more generally. And, remember, they're -- they're at less risk overall from the infection. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. So, talk to your doctor. All right, Dr. Gottlieb, thank you very much. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the secretary of education, Miguel Cardona, who joins us from Meriden, Connecticut. Good morning to you, and happy new year. MIGUEL CARDONA (U.S. Education Secretary): Good morning, Margaret. Happy new year to you as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: You told me back in November that there is no excuse for schools to be anything but in person. Do you stand by that statement now? MIGUEL CARDONA: I know we've had an Omicron surge, but I still believe very firmly and very passionately, not only as an educator, but as a parent, that our students belong in the classroom, and we can do it safely. We have better tools than we had in the past to get it done. We know what works, and I believe, even with Omicron, our default should be in person learning for all students across the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: But then you are seeing school districts already go through closures, more than 2,000 so far, according to Burbio. Teachers unions, including the largest one in your home state of Connecticut, have said they want a delayed return because they don't have access to testing. They are concerned about infections among young children. So, it seems some of the educators disagree with you. MIGUEL CARDONA: Right. You know, the goal is to have students and staff be safe in their classrooms with the use of the mitigation strategies, with a whole host of strategies that we have now that we didn't have when we were having these conversations in March 2020 and to open the school year the previous year. We have access to vaccinations for students ages 5 and up. We have testing that's a different pool of tests than what we're seeing now, where we see people scrambling for tests. When the American Rescue Plan passed, there was $10 billion for surveillance testing for our districts. And we're seeing districts implementing strategies now to do surveillance testing to ensure that classrooms are safe. We understand there may be bumps in the road tomorrow. Superintendents today are getting phone calls, learning that some of their schools may have 5 to 10 percent of their staff not available due to COVID-19. So, we recognize that temporary emergency closures may be necessary to keep children safe. MARGARET BRENNAN: How widespread is that? MIGUEL CARDONA: But it's the expectation that, through the use of American Rescue Plan funds, we address some of the shortages in staffing for the long-term benefit of our students and our families. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I understand the $10 billion that was allocated in the American Rescue Plan. That was months ago. But, today, school districts are saying they don't have the tests. MIGUEL CARDONA: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Whose fault is that, if the money was allocated? MIGUEL CARDONA: Right. Well, we know that this Omicron came quickly, and, in many districts, there aren't systems set up yet. We're working closely with those systems. We've partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation to help develop contracts. And we're seeing in many large districts across the country that they do have them. That, coupled with what we know is going to help, having a shorter quarantine period, we do believe our schools can remain open. We have to stay vigilant. We have to stay focused and those mitigation strategies that work. And we have to continue to work together to give our students a chance to learn in the classroom. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you say now the testing is being set up. So are you saying that the federal government can ensure that every school district in the country has an adequate supply of testing this week? MIGUEL CARDONA: What I'm saying is that we are working with districts to set up systems that maybe were not set up when there was a dip in spread. But we're working closely now to make sure that they're being set up. We're working really hard to make sure that they have access to tests and that they have resources to provide testing. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we know remote learning has hurt children. Emotionally, we are seeing the impacts of that as well. But you have teacher shortages also due to a hit to morale. People don't want to go into that classroom, many of them. Have you gotten on the phone and asked the teachers unions to still show up in person? MIGUEL CARDONA: Since the beginning of the pandemic, even before I was secretary of education, when I was serving as commissioner here in Connecticut, we worked together. And we had to communicate the importance of in-person learning, but also in making sure that our educators are safe and have the support that they need. That's why it was critically important with the American Rescue Plan to have funds available to provide that safety that they needed. Vaccinations for educators was early. I mean, the president announced that -- I believe it was in March. And we had over 90 percent of our educators vaccinated by the summer. That shouldn't stop. Our educators -- it doesn't take a pandemic for us to appreciate what teachers can do. We need to continue to support them, not only during the pandemic, but beyond. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But that's why I'm asking what you've asked the teachers union to do, because, out in Chicago, in Massachusetts, in Connecticut, you have teachers saying they don't feel safe. MIGUEL CARDONA: Well, the message hasn't changed. We need to make sure we're following mitigation strategies, that we're supporting our educators by providing a safe learning environment, we're providing vaccination for our students as young as 5, so that the whole school community is safe, and we're providing surveillance testing to make sure that, if someone is sick, that they stay home. So those are the things that we can do to provide a safe school environment. And we need to double down now that Omicron is higher to make sure that we're doing that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MIGUEL CARDONA: But it works. You know, we went from 47 percent of our schools open in person in January of last year to 99 percent in December. We know what works. We have to stick to it. We have to support our educators, our families. And, most importantly, we have to support our students. MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House said that the unvaccinated faced a severe winter of death. Children under 5 cannot be vaccinated. What is your message to the parents of a kindergartner or a preschooler when they send their child into the classroom? What are they supposed to think about that? MIGUEL CARDONA: Right. And I think about those parents regularly. I remember having to reopen schools before we had vaccines for any children and before we had the science that we have now. So, I remember how difficult that was, as a parent myself. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but I'm talking about now and White House language about now. MIGUEL CARDONA: Right. So, my message to those parents is the same message. And this is why I was mentioning that -- is the same message I have had to parents for the last year-and-a-half. Mitigation strategies work. When we have masks and when we're ensuring that, if students are sick, they stay home, when we ensure that the people round them are vaccinated, we're protecting those children as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, and good luck to you, Mr. Secretary. We will be right back a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: A year after the violent attack on the Capitol by hundreds of Americans determined to stop the certification of the 2020 election,a new CBS News poll finds that day still has a lingering effect on the national psyche. Sixty-eight percent think it's a sign of more violence to come, and two- thirds think democracy itself is threatened. Joining us now is CBS News director of elections and surveys Anthony Salvanto. Anthony, good morning to you. This is an incredible number; 68 percent of Americans believe the country is at risk of violence? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret. It is. Let's try to understand what's driving that a little bit. First, look back on that day at the Capitol. And I should start by saying there's overwhelming disapproval of what happened. But there are 17 percent now that do approve of what happened. Over the course of the year, we have seen some movement among Republicans within those who disapprove, a little bit of softening of that, from the strongly disapprove, a little more into this somewhat disapprove category. And then let's look forward, because what's so important isn't just what people anticipate. It's that democracy depends on not just folks following the norms, but thinking that other people will. Well, in future presidential elections, do you expect there to be more violence by the losing side? And you get 62 percent who say, yes, that could happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that amount to an endorsement of political violence? And who are these Americans? ANTHONY SALVANTO: It does not. And what we want to emphasize here is that it's not that people say that they themselves would undertake it, but whether they might be OK with it if other people did. Let's start by looking back at what people think happened that day. Well, there's a lot of folks on the Republican side, four in 10, who think that, rather than Trump supporters who entered the Capitol, that it was left- leaning groups pretending to be Trump supporters. So, then you look at people who believe in conspiracy theories, in QAnon. They are much more likely than Americans overall to approve. So it all starts perhaps with what they believe to be the case. Now, we tackled this head on. We asked, OK, what do you want former President Trump to be doing now? And there's 12 percent of the country that say he should be fighting right now to get back into the office before the next election. Now, you take a subset of them who say that, if necessary, force could be used to do that. Now, that's 4 percent of the country. We don't often talk about numbers that small, but what we have seen here is that it doesn't take large numbers of people to feel that way, and then that in turn leads to that lessening confidence or that anticipation that more violence might arise, because they know that those folks are out there -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: An important point. But we are seeing radicalized politics outside the United States, too. From what you see here at home, is all of this about the former president, or is something else driving it? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes, we asked about a range of issues, not just elections, and asked, well, are these important enough that violence could be justified, again, if undertaken perhaps by others? And you get a range, from civil rights, to gun policies, to labor issues, among others, where you get 20-odd percent, even 30-odd percent who say that it might be justified. And then you look at, well, is it justifiable for candidates or elected officials to do things like call for violence? And that's 14 percent, again, not an overwhelming number, but it is some. Now, one of the things you want to look at, Margaret, is why they think that might be justified. It's not so much that people think that violence can itself be acceptable, but they fear that their opponents might do that, or worse. So, it's a sign of that underlying mistrust. However, it's a new year. I want to show you something besides these very sobering things. You look at whether people think, in the abstraction, that the U.S. should divide into red and blue states. And there are not many people who feel that way. The overwhelming number of people would like the country to stay together. MARGARET BRENNAN: A note of optimism. Anthony, thank you. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back in a moment with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We now turn to the congressional committee investigating January 6th. Republican Liz Cheney of Wyoming is the vice chair of the committee, and she joins us now from Capitol Hill. Good morning to you. REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY): Good morning, Margaret. Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: We know Democrats are planning a vigil. We know the former president is planning a news conference. Are you concerned about the country being at risk of political violence this week and in the years ahead? LIZ CHENEY: Look, I think that if -- if what he has been saying since he left office is any indication, former President Trump is likely, again this week, to make the same false claims about the election that he knows to be false, and the same false claims about the election that he knows caused violence on January 6th. I think that it is, indeed, very concerning given what we know happened in the lead-up to the 6th, and what the committee is finding out about the events of that day. But I think that it is not surprising, but, again, he knows these claims caused violence. And we've seen now people who were in the Capitol, people who have been arrested because of their activities on that day, they themselves have told us in court filings, they've told us on social media, we've seen it on videos, that they were here because Donald Trump told them to be here. And so he's very -- he's doing this press conference on the 6th. Again, if he makes those same claims, he's doing it with complete understanding and knowledge of what those claims have caused in the past. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've raised in the past the possibility of criminal culpability for the president. Is that the consensus view of the committee? LIZ CHENEY: Look, the committee is -- is, obviously, going to follow the facts wherever they lead. We've made tremendous progress. We have had now - - if you just think about, for example, what we know now about what the former president was doing on the 6th while the attack was underway. The committee has firsthand testimony that President Trump was sitting in the dining room next to the Oval Office watching on television as the Capitol was assaulted, as the violence occurred. We know that that is clearly a supreme dereliction of duty. One of the things that the committee is looking at, from the perspective of our legislative purpose, is whether we need enhanced penalties for that kind of dereliction of duty. But we've certainly never seen anything like that as a nation before. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things that we've seen in CBS polling is that there is just a hard percentage of the population that believes what the former president is claiming. Eight million people believe in violence to restore him to office. Seven out of 10 Republicans still believe President Biden's illegitimate, 66 percent believe there was widespread voter fraud. So these numbers are pretty hard here. Why hasn't this conviction abated within your party? LIZ CHENEY: Look, I think that -- that we're in a situation where people have got to understand the danger of President Trump and the danger that he posed on that day. You know, if you think, Margaret, he could have simply walked a few feet to the White House Briefing Room, he could have gone immediately on live television and asked his supporters to stop what was happening, ask them to go home. He failed to do that. He -- he, instead, we know, had the motivation, at the same time the violent assault was happening, he's watching television, he's also calling at least one senator urging delay of the electoral vote. So, this is a man who has demonstrated that he's at war with the rule of law. He's demonstrated that he's willing to blow through every guardrail of democracy. And he can never be anywhere near the oval office again. He's demonstrated a complete lack of fitness for office. I think one of the really important things that our committee has to do is lay these facts out for the American people so that they really have a sense of the truth of what happened that day, and so that they inform us in terms of our legislative activity going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That assumes facts can actually persuade. What happens with this committee if Republicans take the majority in 2022? Have you asked Kevin McCarthy to keep it? LIZ CHENEY: You know, Leader McCarthy has said a variety of things. He has both acted to obstruct the actions of the committee, but he's also, on a couple of occasions, said that he's willing to come talk to the committee. I think that the American people, again, in particular the Republican Party, you know, we, as Republicans, have a choice to make. I am a conservative Republican. I believe strongly in the policies of low taxes and limited government and a strong national defense. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. LIZ CHENEY: I think the country needs a strong Republican Party going forward. But our party has to choose. We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the Constitution, but we cannot be both. And right now there are far too many Republicans who are trying to enable the former president, embrace the former president, look the other way and hope that the former president goes away, trying to obstruct the activities of this committee. But we won't be deterred. MARGARET BRENNAN: In a number of state capitals around the country, in 19 different states, election laws are being changed. And in some there is concern that Republican-controlled legislatures could be able to change certification of an election if they don't like the outcome of it. This is undermining confidence among some in the public about the integrity of our elections. Would you ask your fellow Republicans in states around the country to stop trying to do that? LIZ CHENEY: Absolutely. I think that, again, you know, as a nation we've got to be founded on the rule of law. We've got to be founded on fidelity of the Constitution. And when you look at what former President Trump continues to do to this day in terms of trying to undermine our belief in our Democratic process, in terms of trying to undermine the rule of law, in terms of trying to find local officials who will help him do that, one of the really important lessons we learned on January 6th was how important it was that we had a few individuals who stood up. We had individuals at the Department of Justice before January 6th who stood up to the president, who said absolutely not, we will not claim that this election was stolen, who told him the truth, and we had local officials in the party, the Republican Party, who did the same. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have congressional races in 2022. You, yourself, are running out in Wyoming. We know the former president endorsed your primary opponent. He's promised to help campaign against you. You have one of his biggest donors, Peter Thiel, a billionaire, throwing money behind your primary opponent. This is a direct challenge here. Given how red your state is, how do you expect to win that primary? LIZ CHENEY: Look, I am absolutely honored and privileged to be able to represent the people of Wyoming in Congress. I absolutely anticipate that we will have a very energetic and hard-fought campaign this year. But at the end of the day, I am also incredibly privileged to be able to stand up and defend the Constitution of the United States. And I'm confident that the people of Wyoming will not choose loyalty to one man, one man as dangerous as Donald Trump is. You know, imagine a man who, while the violent assault was underway, while he was watching television, watching it unfold, not telling his supporters to stop and go home, instead was sending out a tweet saying that Mike Pence was a coward. This is a man who is simply too dangerous ever to play a role again in our democracy. And I look forward to the opportunity to continue to help the American people see the facts about what happened, and to continue to make the case at home about the kind of representation that we need in Washington for the people of Wyoming. MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you be willing to run against him in 2024? LIZ CHENEY: I'm very focused right now on my re-election and -- and on the work of the select committee. And I can tell you that -- that the single most important thing, though, is to ensure that -- that Donald Trump is not the Republican nominee, and that he certainly is not anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Cheney, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back with the chair of the House Intelligence Committee. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to a Democrat on that January 6th committee, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff. He wears both hats. Good morning to you, Congressman. REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: When will you begin public hearings, and what is the purpose of them? ADAM SCHIFF: We should begin them, I hope, in a matter of weeks, if not a couple of months from now. And what we expect to do is to lay out what we've been learning for the American people. There were several lines of effort to overturn the election. There was, of course, the lies being promulgated by the former president, but also efforts with local elections officials and state legislators, efforts at the Justice Department, and, of course, the violent attack on January 6th. And we hope to be able to tell the story to the country so that they understand it isn't just about that one day, January 6th, but all that led up to it, what happened on that day, and the continuing danger going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: So exactly what degree of coordination have you seen so far? Particularly between those within the Trump White House, political operatives, and the 725 people that the -- that have been charged by the Justice Department? ADAM SCHIFF: Well, this is really a focal point of our investigation, and that is, what was the role of the former president? What was the role of his aides and advisors? Certainly they were indicatively involved in many of those lines of effort. In terms of the actual violent attack on the Capitol, how much expectation of violence was there, how much was that part of the plan, either spontaneously or in terms of any predisposition towards violence that day, that is still a matter under deep investigation. But we intend to use every effort to get out the full facts and expose them to the American people and -- and take legislative action to protect the country going forward. But that issue, that is, what was the White House's role in what happened on the 6th that led to the first violent attack in a century and a half, if not longer, is at the core of our investigation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Because you have oversight in your intelligence committee role, I want to know to what degree you think this was an intelligence failure? Was there just a failure of imagination in terms of too much focus on militias and organized groups versus sort of a defused threat of political violence? Why was this missed? ADAM SCHIFF: Well, you know, I think that in part it is an intelligence failure. That is, the failure to see all the evidence that was out there to be seen for the propensity of violence that day. A lot of it on social media. Now, there are answers for why the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security failed to see it as cheerleader as they should have, and we're looking into that. But we shouldn't be distracted from the fact that, yes, while there were things that could and should have been done to protect the Capitol that day, the primary lever, instrument, the cause of that violence was the promulgation of a big lie by the former president. As his supporters said, who came and attacked the Capitol that day, they felt like they were following the president's instructions. So, it's -- it's important to lose -- that we don't lose sight of the real motivating cause here and -- and not just focus on the security of the building. It's also vital we understand that this was an attack inspired by the commander- in-chief. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. This is going to go to the Supreme Court in terms of determining whether some of the records from the Trump administration will be released to your committee. If there is a lengthy delay, if the Supreme Court hears this out, how negatively will that impact your work? And how badly do you need those documents? ADAM SCHIFF: Well, we have gotten tens of thousands of documents and have hundreds of witnesses, so we're trying to get information in various means and forms so that we're not solely dependent on that litigation. But, of course, it's the hope of Donald Trump and his acolytes that they can delay until they can deny justice. I don't think they'll be successful. I think the court understands, and the courts have been moving with great alacrity, that really delay is the strategy. It's not about the merits of litigation so much as it is depriving Congress and the American people of information they believe I assume would be incriminating to them. But when it does go before the Supreme Court, we well get a sense of whether that court is a conservative court or whether it has become just a bipartisan court. If it's a conservative court, it will not disturb the decisions below, which I think have clearly held that Congress has a right to this information under these circumstances. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ADAM SCHIFF: You have the executive branch represented by Joe Biden, and the legislative branch in a court. It would be extraordinary for the judicial branch to differ with both other branches of government. MARGARET BRENNAN: In your Intel Committee role, I want to ask you about Russia. What specifically would stop Vladimir Putin from his aggression? Do you need to cut that country off from the global financial system, to sanction him personally? ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think that it would require enormous sanctions on Russia to deter what appears to be a very likely Russian invasion of Ukraine again. And -- and I think our allies need to be solidly on board with it. Russia needs to understand, we are united in this. I also think that a powerful deterrent is the understanding that if they do invade, it is going to bring NATO closer to Russia, not push it farther away. That we will move more NATO assets closer to Russia, that it will have the opposite impact of what Putin is trying to achieve. So the combination, I think, of very strong sanctions, and I certainly have no problem of going after Putin personally, but I think more that the sector- sized sanctions will be the most important. But -- but beyond that, the knowledge that, in fact, we will move more NATO assets closer to Russia, not further away, if they once again bring war to Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Very quickly, do you fear these diplomatic talks are just building a pretext for Russia to say they have no choice but to invade? ADAM SCHIFF: I fear that -- that Putin is very likely to invade. I still, frankly, don't understand the full motivation for why, why now he's doing this, but he certainly appears intent on it, unless we can persuade him otherwise. And I think nothing other than a level of sanctions that Russia has ever seen will deter him, and that's exactly what we need to do with our allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. All right, Congressman Schiff, thank you for your time. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look now at the 725 people who have been charged for their roles in the attack on the Capitol. Who are these individuals, and what can we learn from their backgrounds that can help us understand the political violence that we saw that day on January 6th? Joining us now is Professor Robert Pape of the University of Chicago. Professor, I know you've studied insurgencies in war zones. You're working with the Pentagon now. I mean you're looking at what is happening in the United States. And one of the things that was chilling to me was that you found the majority of those who attacked were not affiliated with any organized militia, they were everyday people. ROBERT PAPE, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO: Exactly right, Margaret. What we're seeing is a movement that is a mainstream movement, not simply confined to fringe elements. And this is important because we're so used to thinking of right-wing extremism or really extremism in general, as part of the fringe. They're just a tiny fraction of America, less than 1 percent. And they come from people that are economically destitute, many often unemployed. Well, that's not what our studies of the January 6th -- those who broke into the Capitol on January 6th shows, or the -- our studies of the insurrectionist sentiments in the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: And what you found is that some of these people were -- were business owners. They were employed. These were people who had something to lose. They were putting things at risk when they went to Washington and carried out this violence? ROBERT PAPE: Absolutely. Very strikingly finding is their economic profile. Over half of the 700 who broke into the Capitol, who have been arrested so far for breaking into the Capitol, are business owners, CEOs, from white- collar occupations, doctors, lawyers, architects, and accountants. Only 7 percent were unemployed at the time of their January 6th insurrection, nearly the national average. This is very different than we're used to seeing from right-wing extremists where typically 25 percent, 30 percent of right-ring violent offenders are unemployed, and virtually none are CEOs or business owners. Further, if we look at their relationship to the militia groups, so only 13 percent of those who broke into the Capitol on January 6th were members of militia groups, like the Oath Keepers, or extremist groups like the Proud Boys. That means nearly 90 percent were not. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if these people believed in what they were doing, who are they getting their information from? How could they truly put everything on the line and carry out this violence? Like, who is telling them what to do? ROBERT PAPE: Well, we can see their media consumption from surveys that we've done after our studies of who broke into the Capitol. We find that only 21 million people believe two radical beliefs in America today. One, that Joe Biden is an illegitimate president, and, two, that the use of force to restore Donald Trump to the presidency is justified. And their media sources of those 21 million, they come from -- 42 percent of the 21 million, their main media source is Fox News, Newsmax, and One America. That is mainstream, conservative news. Their second most prominent news source is actually liberal and centrist media, like CNN, NPR, CBS. And you might say, well, how could that be? It's because often when people watch ideas they disagree with, that makes them angry. Only 10 percent of the 21 million are getting their news mainly from right-wing social media, like Gab or Telegraph. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden has said that -- that he believes racism was a key part of the attack on the Capitol on January 6th. Have you seen anything that bears that out to be true? ROBERT PAPE: Race is an element, and race is a driver. So when we look at the counties that the 700 who broke into the Capitol came from, where they live, what we see is over half live in counties that Joe Biden won. They don't mainly come from the reddest parts of America. They're coming from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City, Philadelphia, Houston and Dallas. Further, when we look at the key characteristic of why some counties and not others, what we see is the counties that sent the insurrectionists are the counties losing the most white population. Well, that dovetails with this right-wing conspiracy theory that used to be part of the fringe called the great replacement. The idea that whites are being replaced. This idea is also that the Democratic Party is doing this deliberately. Well, that idea now is voiced by mainstream political leaders, by mainstream media figures, embraced full throttle. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what are the triggers that you are watching? Because I know you have said in the past, this isn't just about violence in Washington. You could see sparks of violence in Atlanta, Georgia, in other major cities. What is the trigger? ROBERT PAPE: That's exactly right. So what we're seeing in our surveys, our national surveys, of the 21 million in the insurrectionist movement is a mass of combustible material. Think of it as like dry wood that could be set off like -- from a lightning strike or a spark, as in wildfires. Well, we're moving into a highly volatile 2022 election season, where there could be many sparks at the local levels. And a lot of our election laws, say Georgia or Texas, the counting of the vote has been more politicized than ever before. What that does is it creates a very dangerous season. Which means, as we go through the 2022 elections season, it's crucial to have dialogue with our political leaders, our community leaders, especially the White House, over this new empirical reality. MARGARET BRENNAN: Professor, important work. Thank you for sharing it with us. ROBERT PAPE: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Be sure to join us next Sunday when we talk exclusively to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday issued a subpoena for\u00a0Peter Navarro, a former top White House trade adviser and ally of former President Trump who, the committee alleges, developed plans to change the outcome of the election. The committee's chairman, Congressman Bennie Thompson, said lawmakers are seeking records and testimony from Navarro. Members of the committee say Navarro wrote in his book and gave interviews describing the plan to thwart the certification of the election results. \"Mr. Navarro appears to have information directly relevant to the Select Committee's investigation into the causes of the January 6th attack on the Capitol,\" Thompson said in a statement. \"He hasn't been shy about his role in efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and has even discussed the former President's support for those plans. More than 500 witnesses have provided information in our investigation, and we expect Mr. Navarro to do so as well.\"\u00a0 In the weeks leading up to January 6, Navarro promoted a document he called the \"Navarro Report\" that asserted baseless and discredited claims of election fraud.\u00a0 In a book published last year, Navarro wrote that he and other Trump advisors constructed a plan called the \"Green Bay Sweep\" as the \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\"\u00a0 He described the scheme, which was done in coordination with Steve Bannon, in interviews with The Daily Beast late last year and MSNBC last month. In his appearance on MSNBC, he told host Ari Melber that they had lined up \"over 100\" congressmen and senators to help challenge the election results in six battleground states that had been won by Joe Biden. \"These were the places where we believed that if the votes were sent back to those battleground states and looked at again, that there would be enough concern amongst the legislatures that most or all of those states would decertify the election. That would throw the election to the House of Representatives,\" Navarro said, arguing the plan was legal. In a statement to CBS News, Navarro accused the January 6 committee of being \"domestic terrorists\" and called their efforts a \"partisan witch hunt.\" He said that since Trump has invoked executive privilege, the committee should \"negotiate any waiver of the privilege with the president and his attorneys directly, not through me.\" Navarro became a household name amid the COVID-19 pandemic, when he became the policy coordinator of the Defense Production Act. The congressional committee investigating the Trump White House's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has also subpoenaed him for failing to respond to document requests. There were reports that Navarro wrote memos to the White House\u00a0in January 2020 warning of the devastating impact COVID-19 could have on lives and the economy. Trump claimed during a coronavirus briefing in April 2020 that he had learned about those memos by reading about them in news reports.\u00a0 Navarro is the latest among dozens of Trump allies from whom the panel has sought testimony.\u00a0 Navarro's subpoena comes the same week that Sarah Matthews, a former White House deputy press secretary who resigned in the wake of the January 6 attack on the Capitol, testified voluntarily before the House January 6th Committee, a source familiar with the investigation told CBS News.\u00a0 Matthews was among more than a dozen cabinet secretaries, political appointees and staff who\u00a0resigned\u00a0after the assault on the Capitol, with many citing Mr. Trump's conduct that day.\u00a0 Thompson told reporters that two former press aides testified before the committee on Tuesday, with more depositions scheduled for later this week. The committee has interviewed more than 500 witnesses for their investigation, including Kayleigh McEnany, who was Mr. Trump's press secretary. In addition to the hundreds of interviews already conducted, the committee has issued dozens of subpoenas, including ones to Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege. Two top Trump allies,\u00a0Bannon and Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon. Both said they are following instructions from Trump, who has claimed executive privilege. \u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee last year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step, affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Sara Cook and Zak Hudak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The prosecution and defense made their statements in the criminal contempt case against top Trump adviser Steve Bannon Tuesday \u2014 blocks away from the Capitol, where the House Jan. 6 select committee is preparing for a primetime hearing Thursday focusing on former President Donald Trump's alleged inaction during the assault on the Capitol. Bannon is charged with two counts of criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a September 2021 subpoena from the select committee, which had demanded he sit for a October deposition and hand over documents relevant to its probe by Oct. 7.\u00a0 \"Congress was entitled to the information it sought. It wasn't optional. It wasn't a request. And It wasn't an invitation. It was mandatory,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Amanda Vaughn told the Washington, D.C., jury. \"The defendant decided he was above the law ... and that is why we are here today.\" Prosecutors characterized Bannon's alleged crimes as a simple refusal to comply with a lawful request from Congress, free of the chaos and drama of the Jan. 6 attack itself. \"This case is not about what happened on Jan. 6,\" Vaughn said. \"This case is about the defendant thumbing his nose at the orderly processes of our government.\" \"By that 10 o'clock in the morning deadline on Oct 7, 2021,\" prosecutors alleged, \"the committee had not heard a word from the defendant. That deadline came and went, and he ignored it.\"\u00a0 Vaughn said Bannon was warned again, later in October, that if he did not comply with the committee's requests, he could face criminal prosecution.\u00a0 \"He's innocent of the charges,\" Bannon attorney Evan Corcoran responded in his opening statement, arguing the case wasn't as clear as the government described it.\u00a0 Corcoran contended negotiations between the committee and Bannon's other attorney, Robert Costello, were still underway at the time of the alleged default.\u00a0 \"No one believed that Steve Bannon was going to appear on Oct. 14, 2021,\" Corcoran said, adding Bannon thought the subpoena deadline was flexible and subject to further discussion.\u00a0 \"Politics is the lifeblood of the House of Representatives,\" Corcoran said, later suggesting politics, not law, was at play in the courtroom. Bannon, who was a private citizen at the time of the Jan. 6 committee's inception last year, was charged after the the House of Representatives referred his noncompliance to the Justice Department, which later brought an indictment against him. Bannon's attorney said at the time his client was merely following the direction of former President Trump's legal team to not provide documents or testify due to executive privilege, although several courts have said Trump is not entitled to claim executive privilege. Bannon was also not employed by the White House on Jan. 6, 2021. Bannon pleaded not guilty to both counts.\u00a0 Tuesday's opening statements were presented to a jury of 14 Washington, D.C., residents who were selected following a relatively intense and drawn-out process that began on Monday.\u00a0 The jurors include an appliance worker who watched part of the first Jan. 6 committee hearing, a parks and recreation employee and a\u00a0 D.C. city employee with apparently vast experience serving on juries. \"They call me once every two years,\" she told the judge Monday.\u00a0 A NASA contractor, an architect, a COVID-19 testing contractor and an online art dealer rounded out the group in a nearly two-day waiting game after the judge and attorneys from both sides probed 40 individuals about their jobs, opinion on the House Jan. 6 Committee, and Bannon's work with Trump over the years.\u00a0 The group of 14 \u2014 two of whom will act as alternate jurors \u2014\u00a0 was empaneled after prosecutors and Bannon struck a total of six individuals at their own choosing.\u00a0 Tuesday's proceedings were delayed and the prospective group of jurors left waiting after Bannon's team asked the court to exclude three letters exchanged between the House Jan. 6 committee and Bannon's attorney, Robert Costello. The letters, Bannon's team argued, were \"classic inadmissible hearsay\" and not admissible in court. They also said the correspondence could open the door to information on Bannon's views of executive privilege and advice of counsel, arguments he has tried to use as a defense that the judge previously ruled were inadmissible during trial. Prosecutors disagreed, arguing that the letters demonstrated that Bannon had willfully ignored Congress' demands after unsuccessfully trying to get the committee to stand down. The government tentatively agreed to submit the letters with redactions.\u00a0 An hourslong back-and-forth between prosecutors, Bannon's attorneys and Judge Carl Nichols over exactly what was admissible ensued. Bannon's team unsuccessfully asked to delay the trial for 30 days to reshape its arguments. Just last week, Bannon told the Jan. 6 committee in an about-face that he is willing to testify \u2014 publicly. \"While Mr. Bannon has been steadfast in his convictions, circumstances have now changed,\" Costello wrote in the letter obtained by CBS News. Bannon's lawyer also said that while Trump has invoked executive privilege over his testimony and documents, the former president \"has decided that it would be in the best interests of the American people to waive executive privilege for\" Bannon, allowing him to comply with the subpoena. Prosecutors convinced Judge Nichols to exclude this new stance from testimony at the criminal trial, but in court on Tuesday, Bannon's defense team once again argued his change of heart was relevant to the jury, since prosecutors had argued that Bannon continually thought he was \"above the law\" in refusing to comply.\u00a0 The government called its first witness, Kristin Amerling, the House Jan. 6 committee's deputy staff director and chief counsel, who discussed the formation of the panel and its mission, mandate and powers.\u00a0 Amerling told the jury that congressional subpoenas are not optional. \"We have a limited about of time in which to gather information,\" she said. \"The threat to our democratic institutions continues.\" Amerling said she advised the committee on Bannon's subpoena for testimony and documents after public reports indicated he \"played multiple roles\" in the lead-up to Jan. 6, like persuading the public that the election was illegitimate and appearing on a podcast before the Capitol breach predicting that \"all hell will break loose.\"\u00a0 She spoke about the subpoena, including its \"commands\" and deadlines.\u00a0 Bannon is the first of two former Trump aides charged with criminal contempt of Congress to stand trial. Former trade adviser Peter Navarro was also indicted after refusing to comply with a Jan. 6 committee subpoena and is set to stand trial in November, after pleading not guilty.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Some of the documents from former President Donald Trump's White House that were turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration were torn up by the former president and had been pieced back together, the agency said. The Archives confirmed in a statement Trump's habit of tearing up records, citing press reports from 2018 that detailed his practice. The Archives said \"White House records management officials during the Trump Administration recovered and taped together some of the torn-up records. These were turned over to the National Archives at the end of the Trump Administration, along with a number of torn-up records that had not been reconstructed by the White House.\" Politico reported in 2018 that the former president's unofficial \"filing system\" consisted of him ripping up papers and throwing them on the floor or in the trash, which led to the arduous process of taping documents back together to ensure compliance with the Presidential Records Act. The law requires memos, letters, emails and other documents be preserved and given to the Archives at the end of an administration. The statement from the Archives came after CNN and the Washington Post reported that some of the documents from the Trump White House that the Archives handed over to the House select committee investigating the January 6 assault had been torn up and then reassembled. House investigators received more than 700 pages of documents from the Archives late last month after Trump lost a court battle with the committee to shield their release. The select committee had requested from the Archives reams of records surrounding the events of January 6, including presidential diaries, visitor logs, handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, binders from then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and a draft executive order on election integrity. While Trump asserted executive privilege over the records in an attempt to block their release, President Biden declined to uphold his privilege claims. The former president sued the committee and Archives in October to block the disclosure of the records, and the case wound up before the Supreme Court, which declined to stop release\u00a0of the tranche to the House. Among the documents obtained by the committee was a draft executive order, published by several news outlets, given to Trump that would have directed the Defense Department to seize voting machines during the 2020 presidential election. Dated December 16, 2020, the order was never issued and it's unclear who authored the document.\u00a0 Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, told \"Face the Nation\" last month investigators \"have information that between the Department of Justice, a plan was put forward to potentially seize voting machines in the country and utilize Department of Defense assets to make that happen.\" Thompson said public hearings by the panel are expected to begin in the spring.",

Two sources said the interview was \"largely uneventful.\" Another source estimated the interview lasted about three hours, said Trump Jr. did not plead the Fifth and described the interview as \"very cordial.\"\u00a0 Committee chair Bennie Thompson last week said that Trump Jr. was on the deposition wishlist, and that the committee was engaging with him. Trump Jr. spoke at the rally at the Ellipse on January 6 before the attack on the Capitol began. According to the Associated Press, Trump Jr. posted videos backstage of his family and top Trump aides. At that rally, former President Donald Trump encouraged his supporters at the rally to \"walk down\" to the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes.  Trump Jr.'s fiancee, Kimberly Guilfoyle, also spoke at the Ellipse rally in support of Trump and his baseless claims of election fraud. According to Thompson, the committee has also obtained evidence that Guilfoyle touted her involvement in raising funds for that rally. Investigators also said they believe Guilfoyle communicated with others about Trump's decisions on who would be allowed to speak at the rally.\u00a0 Guilfoyle has already appeared before the House January 6 committee earlier this month, nearly two months after her lawyers abruptly ended a voluntary virtual interview by committee staff over frustration with its format. The panel later issued a subpoena to Guilfoyle, compelling her testimony and records. According to text messages obtained by CNN, Trump Jr. sent text messages to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows two days after Election Day saying \"we have operational control\" to ensure his father would be declared the victor in the 2020 election. \"It's very simple,\" Trump Jr. texted to Meadows on November 5, according to CNN. He added, \"We have multiple paths. We control them all.\" Those texts are among the records obtained by the House January 6 committee, according to CNN. Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle are the latest members of the Trump family to appear before the House January 6 committee. Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump met virtually with investigators in April, and her husband, Jared Kushner, spoke with the panel voluntarily in March. But some members of Trump's staff have refused to appear before the committee or provide documents.

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - HEATHER CONLEY PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS MICHAEL MORELL: Heather, welcome to Intelligence Matters. It is great to talk with you. HEATHER CONLEY: So great to be here. Thank you so much. MICHAEL MORELL: So you and I actually talked about having this conversation a couple of months ago when we were on a panel together. And I'm really glad that that we're taking the opportunity to do so today. I want to start, Heather, by congratulating you on your appointment as president of the German Marshall Fund in the United States. I know that's a great honor for you, and I know the organization is in good hands. HEATHER CONLEY: Well, thank you so much. It is an extraordinary privilege to to lead an organization that represents the living memory of the Marshall Plan, which is celebrating its 75th anniversary and allowing this great, bold American leadership initiative that rebuilt Europe after the Second World War and pushed back against communist influence. So that is a great heritage to have. And boy, do we need to rebuild Ukraine and Europe. So our work is needed now more than ever. But thank you so much. MICHAEL MORELL: You're welcome. You're welcome. So, Heather, in your previous post at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, you led a team that produced a series of papers called The Kremlin Playbook. I want to ask you, what's the series about and why did you undertake the project? HEATHER CONLEY: Well, thank you. A great question. So the year, I think was 2009, and it was the very early days of the Obama administration and a group of Central European leaders wrote a letter. It was an open letter, which was sort of a strange form of communication at the time. These were great friends of the United States. They wrote a letter to President Obama, warning that Russian economic warfare - and those were their terms - was having the effect of basically challenging or changing these countries' transatlantic orientation.  These were countries that were members of NATO as well as the European Union. And for me, it was the research question: Could that be true? Could economic influence, Russia's economic influence, change the very nature of the regime and its preferences and its democracy? So we went about quantifying the amount of Russian economic influence in a select group of European countries. And that first report, it came out that, yes, if a country has over 12% of its gross domestic product is of Russian origin - and that's sometimes hard to calculate because it's designed to be very stealthy and shell companies and things like that - we were starting to see evidence of their democratic institutions were beginning to be challenged. Corruption efforts were being shut down, judicial reform was being shut down. And you began to see where this, we called it a virtuous cycle of influence, of economic influence, which grew political influence, which continued to grow Russia's economic presence. The report landed about two weeks before the 2016 presidential election, and it really, I think, explained in detail how economic influence can begin to subvert democratic institutions and challenged the orientation of a country's policies and preferences. So that first one, needless to say, made a big splash and I think helped people understand a very challenging concept of how economic influence literally purchases or corrupts democracy. We then went on to continue to study these tactics. Our second report was 'The Enablers.' So how do countries that want that Russian economic influence - there are forces that that actually gorged themselves on it. So corporate service providers, tax earnings, they are all growing and using Russian influence and it was starting to pervert their own systems. And then our very final one, called, 'Keeping the Faith,' looks at actually the economics of what we call orthodox entrepreneurs. These are all like Russian oligarchs that have been investing in the the use of the church, in some ways weaponizing the church and Western values. And so that's the third one. It's called, 'Keeping the Faith,' and how religion and values are now being perverted by it, by Russian influence. MICHAEL MORELL: So that's the one, the third one, Heather, that I really want to dive into. But before we do that, I know you were not the only author of these papers, and I wanted to give you a chance to say something about your co-authors. MICHAEL MORELL: Yes, absolutely. And I want to give a great shout out to tremendous authors. My co-author, Donatienne Ruy, who's at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But we had an international group of authors. Marlene Laruelle, who's at George Washington University. Majda Ruge, who's at the European Council on Foreign Relations. Elizabeth Prodromou, who is with Tufts University's and then Tengiz Pkhaladze who is in Tbilisi, Georgia, with the Georgian Institute for Public Affairs. So we had a wonderful series of experts that helped us dive into Russia's use of what we call strategic conservatism in our study countries, which was France, Bosnia, Georgia and Greece. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay. So, 'Keeping the Faith' centers around that notion, right, of Moscow's strategic conservativism. Can you explain what that term means to our listeners? What it is and how to think about it. HEATHER CONLEY: Yeah, absolutely. And we really have to focus on terms and we want to be very careful because what we wanted to do in this report is to protect people's beliefs, their values, their faith, and to make them aware that it can be susceptible to to disinformation, to malign influence. So we describe the term, 'strategic conservatism,' which is basically using one's beliefs, values and traditions and using them for foreign policy and security-related purposes. So what Russia does - and Russia actually uses strategic conservatism internally to Russia, by enforcing a set of rules and norms that only the state sort of has the authority and the knowledge of of the moral values of of Russia. That's, of course, the Russian Orthodox Church is a pillar of that, but it's also a series of societal norms - again, the state, the hierarchy, the collective over the individual. But we were observing how Russia uses a variety of tools: as I mentioned, the Russian Orthodox Church. There are other charitable organizations they use. And what they're trying to do is build in separation from the Democratic West, from what we would call the liberal West, by saying that only Moscow is the true defender of the faithful, of the conservative. So this decadence of the West, a social agenda that embraces same-sex marriage or LGBTQ rights, that this decadence must be stopped. And Moscow is really the only one that is preventing this decadence and stopping it. So this can be - obviously this is playing on the divisions within Western societies. And we certainly know that in the United States there are deep divisions about social agenda and the challenges that that presents. And this is where Moscow inserts itself on the side of the defender of the faithful and the traditional. But what they're trying to do is divide the West and demonstrate that, you know, you don't want to be part of the West, particularly for countries that are aspiring to join NATO or join the European Union. This is a really powerful tool to separate those countries and divide their government. So it's very powerful. It works differently depending on, you know, the tools at their disposal. The Russian Orthodox Church is a huge amplifier of this, as are a lot of disinformation channels that really approach people who share concerns. And it really helps them, you know, amplify their malign message. MICHAEL MORELL: I want to keep keep digging deeper here, and I want to ask some questions about the Russian Orthodox Church. But before I do that, can you talk about what the concept of the 'third Rome' is and how it's relevant to this concept of strategic conservatism? HEATHER CONLEY: Absolutely. And it is a really important concept. So it is both a theological concept. It's also a political concept. So the idea of the third - that Moscow is the third Rome. So after the fall of Rome and then the fall of Constantinople, what some who support this view that Moscow is now the legitimate, the true authentic empire that hasn't fallen because of their their own corruption, that this 'third Rome' means that it is the center of conservatism, that again, Moscow, as the authentic empire, is now the true defender of the faithful. And it also speaks to this sort of sense that the leader of Russia, the czar, if you will, or Vladimir Putin, is the spiritual leader of this global orthodox and conservative movement. So it's got a lot in there, but it is a very powerful, both religious and political thought that puts Moscow at the center of the Slavic and Orthodox world, and they are the only true inheritor of that empire and the defender of the faithful. MICHAEL MORELL: So when I read the report, one of the things that struck me was the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church being sort of the central actors in this story. And I'd like to ask you, how would you describe the relationship between the two and what do both sides get out of that relationship? HEATHER CONLEY: Yes. I mean, going back to the the Russian Orthodox Church - and during the Tsarist times through the Soviet Union and now today, it has always been a very complicated, a very contradictory relationship. So, of course, during Tsarist times, the Russian Orthodox Church, like Putin is doing now, it's embraced as part of traditionalism, identity and that hierarchy and that state control; again, the tsar as the spiritual leader, in addition to the political leader. Of course, during Soviet times - particularly Stalin, you know, wiped away the Russian Orthodox Church. Churches were turned into warehouses. It was to abolish that spirituality and that religious right. Communism was the new religion. Now, where you have now, since 2009, a patriarch, Patriarch Kirill, who initially had distanced himself a little bit from from Vladimir Putin, has now fully embraced Putinism as a way to strengthen the Russian Orthodox Church. So it's a mutually beneficial relationship. So Patriarch Kirill fully supports Mr. Putin. He sees Mr. Putin as a miracle of God. He's fully supportive of the Ukrainian war. In fact, Pope Francis recently called Patriarch Kirill, 'Putin's altar boy' and warned him not to be that close to those political leaders. But it's been - and actually it's been dangerous and hasn't worked, because the closer the Russian Orthodox Church has come to Putinism, it's created schisms within the church so that the object was to unify a global orthodoxy. But what's happened is the Russian Orthodox church has divided the Orthodox world. And the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, or the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, has actually formally separated from the Moscow patriarch. So, but they are trying to unite under one Slavic, you know, one leader. Actually, they've deeply divided the Orthodox world. MICHAEL MORELL: So how deep is this concept of the third Rome? How deep is that believed within the Russian Orthodox Church in Russia? HEATHER CONLEY: So I think it has grown over time, really. This - I would say this whole third Rome narrative well over a decade ago was only heard in the most, sort of, ultra nationalist, you know, voices. But after Vladimir Putin returned to the Kremlin in 2012, he was suffering from a legitimacy problem. He encountered the largest demonstrations of his tenure. And so in some ways began to embrace exactly this spirituality, this traditionalism. And in 2012, a civil activist group, a female rock band, Pussy Riot, had a major demonstration in the major Orthodox Cathedral in Moscow. And in some ways, this sort of crystallized opposition to Putin's leadership and and the violation of Russian traditions and faith and identity. And so it really began to grow. And I see it, you know, accelerating now with the war in Ukraine, where this spiritual - the 'spiritualness' that Russia cannot be spiritually whole without Ukraine, that Putin is this spiritual leader, this miracle of God. And so all of those threads have really come together and crystallized. So now this third Rome narrative has sort of legitimacy and justification for a lot of Russia's war aims. MICHAEL MORELL: One of the things I'm wondering about is does Putin actually believe in this concept or does he not? And he simply understands that it's a powerful political and foreign policy tool for him. What is your sense HEATHER CONLEY: So I would say, 5 to 6 years ago, he saw it as an important tool to strengthen his legitimacy. I would argue - I don't know whether this is the pandemic and his isolation or health or, I have no idea. But I would say the last two years, what was a tool became much more deeply ingrained. You know, he's writing these historical essays about Ukraine. These are inaccurate and incorrect, a historical understanding that he's starting to, in some ways, drink his own Kool-Aid and really believing this more deeply and wanting to demonstrate that, again, it strengthens his legitimacy. All this talk about the decadence of the West. What this is, is he's trying to separate any contamination, as he sees it, of democracy, of the value of the individual over the collective. And this is what they're trying to separate themselves from, and even turning the script and saying, 'You know what? What the United States did at the end of the Cold War, the collapse of the Soviet Union, it was ending communism.' Well, some around Putin believe that Russia is now the West's savior, that we have to, you know, move this smoke from our eyes, as it were, of this decadence, of this social decadent agenda that is ruining us. So they also see it as not only protecting themselves from Western democracy and ideas, which they're trying to suppress on their own within Russia. But they're also trying to use it to divide Western societies and propel themselves as this great savior, this great defender of the faithful and the conservative. MICHAEL MORELL: So this is a little off topic, but you've been watching Russia for a long time. And I'm just wondering if you sense that Putin is somehow somehow ill, somehow sick, or you just can't tell? HEATHER CONLEY: You know, the rumors have just been extraordinary the last several months. And these rumors have circulated - you know, after the assassination of former deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, Putin disappeared for 11 days. There was speculation about his health. There was speculation that he has a bad back, that, you know, all sorts of things. They certainly have accelerated. I would argue that the pandemic, while it was tough on everybody and certainly accentuated mental health challenges, there was something, I think during this, the pandemic - this is total speculation on my part. He was very isolated in his palace in Sochi. So very away from people. I think it was time to stew. It was time to - you know, he was getting a lot of pressure. Navalny, Alexei Navalny was, you know, challenging him, his legitimacy, the change in the Russian constitution, his own sense of, you know, his leadership. It began to crystallize in all of these things. Again, he just used as tools; they were they were instruments. To further it, he began to internalize them, believe them, write incorrect essays, and instead really internalize this. And I would argue this is where, you know, his isolation and maybe questionable health issues is propelling this urgency to restore Russia's greatness and its spirituality that he sees. He is the unique leader; only he can write the historic wrong of the Soviet Union's collapse. But, boy, you need better doctors and psychologists. That's what he's about. But that's my guess. MICHAEL MORELL: I think a lot of people are trying to figure it out, not with a lot of success at the moment.  So Heather, when we started the conversation, you mentioned this concept of Orthodox entrepreneurs, and I found that really interesting in your report. Who are these folks and what did they do? HEATHER CONLEY: Yes. And in fact, this is because we studied Russian economic influence. This is how, in some ways, how we stumbled across this, the use of strategic conservatism. So what we began to see is a select group of Russian oligarchs. Probably the most noted one is a gentleman known as Malofeyev. He has been a very big believer in the spiritual return or restoration of Russia. He has, you know, great investments. And again, he's his own oligarch in his own right. But he invests in humanitarian organizations. He runs St. Basil's, the great charitable organization that promotes religious understanding and studies. He has spent money to bring relics from the Holy Land to Moscow again. And it creates that aura of the third Rome, that legitimacy, if you will, of Russia as the defender of the faithful. But what we began to see is a lot of Russian Orthodox cathedral construction. So in France, in other places, cultural centers, surrounding this, you know, the cultural and the orthodox world, use of organizations like Russkiy Mir, Russia World, to help support that study. And what we began to notice - this was particularly prominent in France - that another oligarch, the former Railroad Ministry, Yakunin, was also funding - going into sort of former circles, monarchist circles and of French Russian emigres that came out of the Russian civil war, that they were, you know, playing on those themes of the tsar and Russian Orthodox and spirituality. And so it was a cultural issue. It was building these large cathedrals, funding charitable organizations. And it was again, it was continued to surround countries and societies with these messages of the third Rome, that Russia is the defender and the savior. You could also see financial support for referendums in several countries on same-sex marriage referendums. These referendums were designed to divide the societies at the time, put separation between countries that wanted to join the European Union or stay within Russia's orbit. So all of it worked together. Some of it was very soft. Others of it was was pretty clear of what they were trying to do to divide. But they were - these orthodox entrepreneurs were really focused on strengthening this strategic conservatism. So it was sort of private sector support of the larger initiatives of the Kremlin as well as the Russian Orthodox Church. MICHAEL MORELL: Do you think, Heather, that this strategic conservatism to some extent explains, for want of a better word, the affection between the Trump White House and Putin? I know there were a couple of true believers in this concept inside the White House, and I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on that. HEATHER CONLEY: So I think we certainly do see a lot of affinity groups in the United States that truly believe in the agenda of the Kremlin, this strategic conservatism agenda in its to fight against this perception of decadence. So, sort of just taking the Kremlin and the malign work out of it, there is a shared view about, you know, dramatic social change and what that means to one's faith and values. And that is a complicated and difficult topic, I think, where we're starting to see the synergies - and this is particularly true with some groups in the United States who really support the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, who's also perfected, in some ways, this use of strategic conservatism. It's an anti-West sort of - it's a culture war. It's putting these cultural issues at the forefront and weaponizing them. And so in using that for political legitimacy, so you are definitely seeing there is huge uptake. Some of this does begin to originate in the United States. There's sort of a feedback loop. There is a real focus on this protection of the traditional family, protection of traditional values, for sure. But I think many are unwitting and don't understand that there is a foreign policy implication of this, that Russia is using this so we fight one another more intensely, that it causes division and weakness in the West, that this is just another tool in their toolkit, which is - that's why we wrote the report. So people understand what's at stake. Look, everyone, we are respectful of different perspectives, but they can't be weaponized. And Russia is weaponizing this to divide our societies. MICHAEL MORELL: I want to move on to ask some questions about Ukraine, specifically, Heather, but just one more question on this broader topic. And you mentioned earlier that the Pope had sort of scolded the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church on his support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But what role, if any, did the Roman Catholic Church play in the growth of strategic conservatism, positively or negatively? HEATHER CONLEY: Oh, gosh, that's a good question, because, again, the evolution of this, again, was - and I think Pope Francis was certainly a leader in this - was trying to bring the ecumenical community together and not have these deep divisions and these separations. And unfortunately, Pope Francis - in his own views, on more liberal views on same-sex marriage, for instance, you know, 'Who are we to judge' -that, I think, opened a real division between what the Russian Orthodox Church was doing, and I think they thought they had a better ally, potentially, in the Catholic Church or the leadership of the Catholic Church. But it's certainly, again, these questions of faith and values, if not properly addressed with congregants, things can be extremely divisive. But I think most interestingly, I mean, the Catholic Church hasn't played a huge role - in fact, in our discussion of strategic conservatism in France, we actually saw where more French Catholics were beginning to start to migrate to the Russian Orthodox Church with that orthodoxy, because it was more conservative. So we're actually seeing where, some in the Catholic Church were, in France, leaving for orthodoxy. But I think the real loss here was the Russian Orthodox Church was trying to unite the entire Orthodox world under their leadership. And the beginning of the war in 2014 with the annexation of Crimea and the first invasion in Donbas, that actually created the conditions where the ecumenical patriarch in Constantinople agreed to the separation of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. And so the church is split. And so this strategic initiative for the Russian Orthodox Church to be the unifier and the leader, they've just done their own goal of basically dividing the orthodox world. And now we have even more churches within Ukraine leaving the Moscow patriarchy because of their continued support for the war. MICHAEL MORELL: So I want to talk a little bit about Ukraine, Heather, and I know you've mentioned this several times in our conversation, but maybe we can come at it directly here. How does this dynamic of strategic conservativism tie into the conflict in Ukraine? HEATHER CONLEY: Yeah, and this is where - I call it 'the great contradiction,' because on the one hand, Vladimir Putin has argued that the Ukrainian and Russian people are one people. I mean, that is in part to eliminate any distinction that Ukraine is a distinct nation, distinct people. And that, you know, again, the Ukraine for Russia is its spiritual home because the origins of Russia began in Ukraine and Kievan Rus'. So there's a spirituality to this. And I think there's parallels to the founding of Russia coming out of Ukraine. So it is the contradiction that Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine are killing the one people, killing ethnic Russians that live in Ukraine. They are bombing Russian Orthodox churches because of indiscriminant bombing. So this whole sense of reunification that restores Russia's greatness, that Ukraine is at the center of its spiritual and historic heart, it is destroying itself, literally. That's the contradiction. And where you see - because Putin has to rally Russian society, they don't support war in general, which is why they're calling it a 'special military operation,' they can't even say 'war.' They have so repressed society, because war is unpopular, and if you advance, then, the knowledge that you're trying to save your spiritual, your Slavic brothers, you're killing them and as well as killing Russians at the same time. So this is where the contradiction comes of this, again, this third Rome, you know, the Kremlin is the defender of the faithful. No, they're killing the faithful, and their own spiritual heart. So that's just what makes this extraordinary. But the Russian Orthodox Church is obviously being mobilized in vilifying the Ukrainian people as as Nazis. But even over time, Mr. Putin's quote from the other day, they keep changing their justification of their war; it was de-Nazification. Now it's returning Russia's historic lands, which they view, I mean, they go back to Peter the Great in those historic lands, which concerns all of us, because those historic lands stretch to Sweden, Finland, the Baltic states. So you know that's a very expansive definition. MICHAEL MORELL: So it seems to me - correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me that this new justification that Putin has shifted to, away from de-Nazification, you know, towards recovering strategic lands, is actually selling better in Russia. Is that right, or hard to tell? HEATHER CONLEY: So, you know, it's hard to tell, but I think for me, it's telling that he's continuing to find the justification, maybe the denazification, although again, using the symbolism, the St. George's ribbon and things like that, it's certainly been well -introduced. But I think this returns back to his theme of last July of this historic essay. He, again, he sees himself as the great restorer of Russia's greatness, historical - and he's now, you know, I think we thought maybe this is about restoring the Soviet Union when he told us. No, this actually goes back to much, much greater, a thousand years of Russian history that he's actually about restoring that potentially, which is an extraordinary ambition when 70% of Russia's conventional forces right now are having a difficult time securing Luhansk Oblast. But it speaks to his broader vision and speaks to, again, the grievance, the history, the spirituality of Russia itself. So the ambition is sweeping. MICHAEL MORELL: So the key gain here for Putin is the use of strategic conservativism here helps him legitimize what he's doing. HEATHER CONLEY: It does, as I said. And I think that was-  he's used this tool before. I think he's internalizing it. I think that's what concerns me the most, is that when you start buying your own lines and you believe you are uniquely placed, that, you know, does he see himself as the spiritual inheritor of Peter the Great, of restoring the lands? And this is where the Russian Orthodox Church, which was right beside the tsars, as they were the political and the spiritual leader, is he trying to fuse those? So this has got legitimacy about Ukraine aims. It's about keeping the West divided. But is he now starting to really believe Patriarch Kirill, that he is a miracle of God and that he has this broader spiritual world? That's where you get, I think, a little scary into his own understanding of himself and his ambitions and what he is set to do. MICHAEL MORELL: You mentioned earlier a bit of a backlash, Heather, in the Orthodox Church more broadly, to the invasion of Ukraine. And I'm wondering if there's been been any backlash inside the Russian Orthodox Church itself or not? HEATHER CONLEY: Yeah, it sure has. Not all Orthodox priests subscribe to Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, his full throttled support for Putin for the war. I mean, I think this is, again, it speaks to priests that are, you know, tending their own congregants. They're there and working with Russian citizens that have lost loved ones in the war without understanding where they are, that understand the economic toll that Russia's war is taking and saying, again, sort of as Pope Francis said, 'Look, you know, we have a different role here. Our role is not necessarily to support the state in harming our congregants. We, you know, have a different role here.' So priests have been jailed. They've been shuffled around. There's been some leadership changes within the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church for even more higher-level voices that have been questioning how the Russian Orthodox Church has embraced Putinism. But again, it is clear that there is a strong control by Patriarch Kirill, and he's really banking that the Russian Orthodox Church will be successful because Putin will be successful. But the opposite can be true. If Vladimir Putin is not successful in the future, that will really challenge the Russian Orthodox Church as well. MICHAEL MORELL: So we have about a minute or so left here, Heather, and I want to ask you, how do you think the West should respond to this strategic conservatism as a political tool? We don't want to criticize people's religious beliefs. But how should the West deal with this? I know it's a really tough question. HEATHER CONLEY: Step one, awareness. Understanding that our societal divisions, particularly when we talk about culture wars, wokeness, things like that, that division, you know, foreign powers that don't wish us well will use that and will exploit that weakness. And Russia has in some ways perfected this and sees this as a major place where they can help amplify our own divisions and separate themselves from democracy, from the role of the individual. Look, freedom of religion and the value of the individual to freely express their religion or not have religion at all - what the Russians are doing is turning that on its head and making this about the collective interest, not the individual, and really in many ways, perverting freedom of religion. So this is something, again, these are these are freedoms that we have to protect, the sanctity of them and be aware that they are being twisted. So heal our societal divisions. Don't use these as these culture wars, which are, again, aiding and abetting actors who do not wish the United States or our allies well. And that's really the place we have to start. That's how we we keep the faith that we can have these views and not allow them to be perverted. MICHAEL MORELL: Heather, thank you so much for your time today. Thank you for sharing such an interesting paper with us. If my listeners actually want to go read the papers - and I suggest you do - just search 'Kremlin Playbook, CSIS,' and they'll pop right up there for you. Heather, thank you so much. MICHAEL MORELL: Thank you. It's great to be with you.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany appeared Wednesday before the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0 The panel's chairman, Representative Bennie Thompson, told CBS News on Wednesday afternoon the appearance was virtual and had \"been going on all day.\" McEnany was serving as a top spokesperson for the Trump White House when hundreds of the former president's supporters stormed the Capitol last January to stop the certification of the 2020 election results. McEnany had also served as an adviser to the Trump 2020 campaign.\u00a0 The select committee first subpoenaed the Fox News personality in November, instructing her to appear for a deposition and turn over records. The committee's interest in speaking with her stems in part from \"multiple public statements\" she made promoting the former president's baseless claims of fraud in the November 2020 election, according to a letter the panel sent McEnany. The committee also noted in its letter that McEnany was with the former president on January 6 when he traveled to the Ellipse, where he would deliver a speech to supporters urging them to \"fight like hell\" and \"stop the steal.\"\u00a0 The letter also pointed to reporting in the book \"I Alone Can Fix It\" that indicated McEnany \"popped in and out\" to join Trump as he watched the attack unfold that afternoon.\u00a0 Thompson said Wednesday the committee has issued about 85 subpoenas, including Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege. Two top Trump allies, former strategist Steve Bannon and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon. Both said they are following instructions from Trump, who has claimed executive privilege.\u00a0 The House select committee, created by Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier this year, is investigating the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol during the Stop the Steal rally, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland that aired Sunday, April 3, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week, CBS News and The Washington Post revealed that internal White House phone records from January the 6th showed a seven hour gap in President Trump's call logs during the violence at the Capitol that day. Maryland Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin is on the House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol and joins us here now. Welcome. REPRESENTATIVE JAMIE RASKIN: Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: The nation, this seven hour gap, you have subpoenaed the president, the former president's assistant, Molly Michael. I know you've been trying to figure out from staff what happened. Do you have any insight? REP. RASKIN: Well, it's a very unusual thing for us to find that suddenly everything goes dark for a seven hour period in terms of tracking the movements and the conversations of the president. And some things we've been able to piece together from other people's interviews and depositions that we know took place during that time. We are aware of other phone calls that took place during that time that included the president. But we have no comprehensive, fine grained portrait of what was going on during that period, and that's obviously of intense interest to us. MARGARET BRENNAN: You still don't have that after debriefing some of these assistant- I mean, his office, the former president's office was known for being sloppy. He used cell phones. She wasn't- the personal assistant wasn't in the office that day. Is there a chance here that this was just sort of large scale incompetence rather than conspiracy? REP. RASKIN: Well, we're taking that possibility into account. It does seem like the gaps are suspiciously tailored to the heart of the events. But we're checking that out. And, you know, our mandate under H.R. 503 is to get a complete picture of everything that took place on January 6th, the causes leading up to it, and then what we need to do as a country to fortify democratic institutions and processes against future insurrections and coups and attempts to destabilize and overthrow our elections. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, it's just an incredible phrase: \"Potential future coups.\" REP. RASKIN: Well- MARGARET BRENNAN: It's breathtaking to hear you say it, that. REP. RASKIN: Congressman Mo Brooks said just a week or two ago that president- former President Trump continues to try to get him and other Republicans to rescind the election. In other words, he continues to look for a way to nullify an election that he considers fraudulent. Last night, you know, I was at the Gridiron Club dinner, and I saw the governor, the Republican Governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, who I thought was a huge breath of fresh air. He said publicly he broke tradition, apparently in the Gridiron Club. He said Donald Trump is f-ing crazy and he didn't say f-ing. So I don't want to make any history on your show. But he also seemed to announce that he was going to run for president in 2024. Laying down the gauntlet essentially against the Trump-Putin axis within the Republican Party. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, your earpiece just popped out there. REP. RASKIN: Even though I didn't say the word. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you can hear me. I mean, are you concerned that at the end of this investigation, you're not going to find what it sounds like you're looking for, which is substantiation of a- of a link between a pressure campaign to change the election results and the events of January 6th itself. Are you confident you'll get that and you will be able to make a criminal referral to the Justice Department? REP. RASKIN: Well, no, I think you put your finger on it. I mean, we know there were two things going on and one was a violent insurrection that included a mob riot which injured 150 of our officers with broken jaws and broken necks and broken vertebrae and so on. And then that was led by domestic violent extremist groups like The Proud Boys, who, you know, then President Trump had told to stand back and stand by the Oath Keepers, the three percenters, people who have been charged with seditious conspiracy, which means conspiracy to overthrow the government. They shut down the counting of Electoral College votes for the first time in American history. Didn't even happen when Lincoln took-took the presidency, 1861. Okay. So there was that violent insurrection, but then there was an attempt at an inside coup, what the political scientists call a self-coup, not a coup against a president, but a coup that's orchestrated by the president against the constitutional system. And what we're looking for is the connections between the inside political coup and the violent insurrection. And I do feel confident we're going to be able to tell that story. MARGARET BRENNAN: But tell that story is different in the political context from making a criminal recommendation or a legal proceeding at the Justice Department. Are you confident that will happen? REP. RASKIN: Well, we will lay out the evidence that we see. Now understand, the role of the January six select committee is to deliver a report to the American people in the Congress.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly.\u00a0 REP. RASKIN: And so individual criminal accountability is something that comes in the domain of the Department of Justice. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I wanted to make that clear. REP. RASKIN: Yeah. And one of the traditions we want to rebuild that was torn down during the last administration was of not having members of Congress and the president trying to dictate policy to the Department of Justice. And that's what the last president did. And I'm glad this president's not doing it, and we don't want to be part of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: How long is too long? Because we keep hearing that the public hearings are getting pushed off. Is it May? Is it June? When do you cut this-- REP. RASKIN: I-- MARGARET BRENNAN: off? REP. RASKIN: --think we're- I think that the hearings should be in early May. That's what I'm hoping for. Obviously, we're up against a lot of obstruction now. This week-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hmm. REP. RASKIN: --we voted to bring contempt citations against-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REP. RASKIN: --Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REP. RASKIN: --the social media guy for him, and Peter Navarro was the- the trade adviser who for some reason was off involving himself-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REP. RASKIN: --in insurrectionary coup plotting activities-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And that-- REP RASKIN: Those guys are claiming executive privilege, which is absurd. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that vote is going to be happening this week? REP RASKIN: We-- MARGARET BRENNAN: As we understand that--\u00a0 REP. RASKIN: --hope so, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be back with more Face the Nation in a moment.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Representative Bennie Thompson that aired Sunday, January 23, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We are back now with the Chairman of the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Congressman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. Good morning to you, chairman. REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS): Good morning, how are you? MARGARET BRENNAN: Good. This was a very big week, as we said, 700 pages of Trump administration documents were handed over to your committee at the order of the Supreme Court. What changes now that you have these in your possession? REP. THOMPSON: Well, we are in the process of reviewing the documents. As you know, this was one of the first requests that we made as a committee to the National Archives. We think it's important to our investigation to have this information and we are glad that the Supreme Court agreed with us today. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the last piece of the puzzle here? I mean, how does this affect your timeline for holding public hearings? As you said, you want to begin those in the spring. REP. THOMPSON: Well, to be honest, where he will review the documents, we'll see what those documents present to us in terms of direction. We'll see if that information leads us to additional individuals to make requests. But it's so significant to our investigation to have the documents and executive privilege and other things obviously had no bearing, and we're just happy for the Supreme Court decision. We'll look forward to reviewing it and based on the review, we'll take next steps.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And the spring is still the plan for public hearings? REP. THOMPSON: Absolutely. To be honest with you, as you know, we are reviewing thousands of pages of documents, hundreds of witnesses. It's taken a good bit of time for the committee to put together. And hearings at this point, we expect to be sometime in the spring. MARGARET BRENNAN: In recent days, your committee also took aim at Rudy Giuliani, the former president's attorney. You subpoenaed him. You asked the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, to appear by Feb 3. You also subpoenaed two white nationalists. This seems like a pretty wide net. What is your strategy? REP. THOMPSON: Well, our strategy is to get to all the facts and circumstances that brought about Jan 6. We identified the players, Rudy Giuliani is clearly one of those individuals, the right-wing individual organizations that participated, providing security and other things very important. And obviously, Ivanka Trump was a major adviser to the president all along, a number of items attributed to what she's been saying and so we asked her to come in voluntarily and give us the benefit of what she knows.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Will she?\u00a0 REP. THOMPSON: Well, we'll wait and see February 3rd, and we'll go after that. MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of Rudy Giuliani, who we just mentioned, you subpoenaed. There was another news development in terms of public reporting. Republican electors in at least five states put together essentially fake slates of the electors. In states that Joe Biden won, they handed over these slates, saying instead that Donald Trump won them. And according to Marc Short, the former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, he was presented with letters by Rudy Giuliani on behalf of state legislators to this- to this end, trying to persuade the former vice president not to certify the election. Do you know who was orchestrating this effort? I mean, this is a pretty significant claim. REP. THOMPSON: Well, we do know that some of the information we've received from National Archives include proposed plans for doing certain things if we are after review of those plans determined specifically individuals who did this. We will make the referral to the Justice Department. We're not a criminal entity, that's the Department of Justice, but we are concerned that documents have been filed saying they were individuals responsible for conducting and certifying elections, and they are not. And when you falsify documents, in most instances, that's a criminal act.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: There was also another story, significant. POLITICO published the text of a draft executive order that had been presented to President Trump in Dec of 2020 to have the defense secretary seize voting machines in battleground states. And multiple news organizations have now reported this. Do you intend to go to the Attorney General, Bill Barr, to ask him about this? I mean, how do you follow up on- on this kind of allegation and the paperwork to back it up? REP. THOMPSON: Well, yes, we do. To be honest with you, we've had conversations with the former attorney general already. We have talked to Department of Defense individuals. We are concerned that our military was part of this big lie on promoting that the election was false. So, if you are using the military to potentially seize voting machines, even though it's a discussion, the public needs to know, we've never had that before. And so any of these individuals who are participating and trying to stop the election, the duly election of a president, and if we can document it, we will share it with the public. MARGARET BRENNAN: I just want to follow up on something you said. Do you have proof that there was someone inside the United States military working on this premise? Of actually seizing voting machines. REP. THOMPSON: Well, we have information that between the Department of Justice, a plan was put forward to potentially seize voting machines in the country and utilize Department of Defense assets to make that happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Something beyond this draft executive order, there was actually an operational plan? REP. THOMPSON: Well, no, not an operational plan, but just the draft itself is- MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REP. THOMPSON: \u2013Is reason enough to believe that it was being proposed. Our job is to get to the facts and circumstances of how far did they go? We do know that a potential person was identified to become the attorney general of the United States, who would communicate with certain states that election on their situation had been fraudulent and not to produce certified documents. Well, we understand that. So, we will move forward on that investigation, and we will look and see specifically how far that plan went. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's incredible. Will the former attorney general, Bill Barr, testify to you? Will you seek out other members of the military to clarify some of what you just laid out here? REP. THOMPSON: Well, part of our plan is to continue to engage all those individuals that we deem necessary and important to our investigation. Some will talk to some we will do in deposition under oath. Others we will offer hearing opportunities. But I can assure you, as we develop this information, we will clearly present it to the public. We plan at this point to have a series of public hearings showing the use of federal assets, Department of Justice, Department of Defense and other agencies to actually stop the duly election of a president. So, we'll do it in-in due time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, Stewart Rhodes, the head of the far-right group the Oath Keepers, was charged with seditious conspiracy by the Department of Justice this week. As part of that, it became public that he was apparently stashing weapons waiting for the White House to invoke the Insurrection Act. Is any part of that connected to what you just laid out? REP. THOMPSON: Well, Stewart Rhodes is one of the persons that we identify as a committee we wanted to talk to. We'll see what happens. We're not part of the criminal indictment. That's a separate investigation. MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand. Chairman, thank you for your time this morning. And next up, we'll have more on the situation in Ukraine and what can be done to stop Russia.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The National Archives and Records Administration will release records from Vice President Mike Pence \u00a0to the House panel investigating the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, despite efforts by former President Donald Trump to shield their release. David Ferriero, archivist of the United States, told Trump in a letter Tuesday that he will give the documents to House investigators \"after consultation with the counsel to the president and the assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, and as instructed by President Biden.\" The Archives will deliver the records to the select committee on March 3 \"unless prohibited by court order,\" Ferriero wrote. The records at issue stem from two separate requests the select committee made to Archives in March and August. Trump notified the Archives in a January letter he would be asserting executive privilege over a tranche of documents, which contain vice presidential records. But Mr. Biden rejected Trump's attempt to block the release of the records, according to a February 1 letter from White House counsel Dana Remus to the Archives, as the president determined \"an assertion of such a privilege is not justified and is not in the best interests of the United States.\" The records, she continued, should be turned over to the select committee in 30 days barring a court order stopping their release. Remus said many of the records Trump asserted privilege over \"were communications concerning the former vice president's responsibilities as president of the Senate in certifying the vote of presidential electors on January 6, 2021.\" Some of the records also involved litigation \"in which certain parties were represented by the Department of Justice,\" she said. Trump and his allies sought to pressure Pence to reverse the results of the 2020 presidential election in the run-up to the January 6 joint session of Congress, which was ultimately interrupted by the breach of the Capitol building by a mob of the former president's supporters. While Trump encouraged the vice president to reject electoral votes, Pence rebuffed the former president's pressure campaign, writing in a lengthy letter the morning of January 6 he could not claim \"unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not.\" More than a year later, Trump has continued to allege Pence had the power to toss out state electoral votes and indicated in a statement Sunday that he wanted the vice president to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\u00a0 Trump on Tuesday also suggested the January 6 select committee investigate \"why Mike Pence did not send back the votes for recertification or approval.\" In the course of their examination into the events surrounding the January 6 assault on the Capitol, House investigators have interviewed more than 400 witnesses and obtained over 50,000 documents, according to Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who sits on the committee. Greg Jacob, Pence's chief counsel, met with the committee Tuesday, while Marc Short, Pence's former chief of staff, appeared before the panel last week. Members also plan to ask the former vice president to meet with them voluntarily.\u00a0 Investigators, meanwhile, continue to gain access to documents from the Trump White House. Last month, they received more than 700 pages of records that were at the center of a legal battle mounted by Trump that was ultimately unsuccessful.\u00a0 Congressman Pete Aguilar of California, a member of the select committee, told reporters this week that in addition to the 700-page batch from the Archives, the agency continues to produce more records. The committee has issued dozens of subpoenas, including ones to Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege. Two top Trump allies, Steve Bannon and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon. Both said they are following instructions from Trump, who has claimed executive privilege. \u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee last year earlier this year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol during the rally at the Ellipse before the electoral vote count, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon, former Trump White House chief strategist, declined to appear in person for a pretrial hearing in Washington, D.C., Monday, in his contempt of Congress case. His legal team suffered a series of defeats during the hearing, losing nearly every argument.\u00a0 D.C. District Judge Carl Nichols ruled that Bannon's trial will not be delayed, despite Bannon's claims of potential jury bias because of the ongoing Jan. 6 House select committee hearings. His trial is still set to begin next week, on July 18.\u00a0 Bannon had argued that as a former White House official, he did not have an obligation to comply with the select committee's subpoena when executive privilege has been asserted by the president. The panel subpoenaed him in September 2021 because of news reports that he had urged former President Trump to focus on Jan. 6 and had tried to coax members of Congress to vote against certifying the 2020 presidential election. Nichols also ruled that Bannon cannot make a series of defenses at his trial, including a \"public authority\" argument that President Donald Trump ordered his non-compliance with the committee. The judge cited Trump's status as a private citizen and a lack of evidence that Trump had ever made such an order.\u00a0 Bannon's argument that the House violated its own rules in its operation of Jan. 6 select committee was also dismissed by Nichols, who said he will defer to the House on its own interpretation of its rules. Nichols became the latest in a series of judges to dismiss claims the committee was not lawfully authorized or composed.\u00a0 Prosecutors will also need only to show deliberate intent by Bannon to defy the Jan. 6 committee's subpoena, according to Nichols' order. They will not need to show an \"evil intent.\" Bannon may not present evidence that\u00a0\"he relied on advice of counsel\" or privilege, according to the judge. He previously sought to argue that he was heeding the advice of his lawyers and did not know he was committing a crime by failing to appear before the committee or providing material in response to the subpoena. Bannon may still argue that he was \"unaware\" of subpoena deadline date, however.\u00a0 Nichols did not immediately rule on the relevance or admissibility of Bannon's new offer to testify before the House panel. But the Justice Department cast doubt on Bannon's\u00a0newfound willingness to testify\u00a0before the select committee, calling his about-face on cooperating with the panel an \"attempt to change the optics\" days before his trial on charges of criminal contempt of Congress begins. On Thursday, the next pretrial hearing in Bannon's case will take up that issue. After the hearing, Bannon's lawyer, David Schoen, said he didn't know whether Bannon would testify before the Jan. 6 committee, but he did reiterate that Bannon \"said he's willing to comply if they just resolve the privilege issue,\" and he noted that \"now, the privilege has been waived, withdrawn.\" Cristina Corujo contributed to this report.",

Meanwhile, former Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro did not show up for his scheduled deposition, he confirmed to CBS News.\u00a0 Committee chair Congressman Bennie Thompson told reporters Wednesday that investigators' goal was to wrap up depositions with witnesses by the beginning of April. The committee would then hold public hearings that month, which would be followed by an interim report in June, he said. The committee's timeline could be pushed back, however, if investigators find out new information or seek testimony and records from additional witnesses. So far, investigators have spoken to over 650 witnesses, according to a panel aide. The committee has publicly issued more than 90 subpoenas, targeting witnesses that span members of former President Donald Trump's inner circle to January 6 rally organizers and rightwing extremists. On Wednesday, the committee heard from Patrick Casey, who the panel has identified as a leader of \"America First\" or \"Groypers\", a far-right group. The committee first issued a subpoena to Casey in January, after Casey declined to voluntarily cooperate through his attorney. Navarro was also slated to testify Wednesday, but refused to appear. In a statement to CBS News, he said his hands were \"tied\" because he could not waive an executive privilege assertion he said was made by the former president.\u00a0 \"The Committee has a firm legal obligation to negotiate this matter directly with Trump and his attorneys before attempting to coerce and bully me into cooperating with its highly partisan effort.\u00a0 If the president waives privilege, I will appear,\" the statement said. Thompson on Wednesday did not rule out the possibility of pursuing criminal contempt against Navarro, saying it's \"always an option\" for witnesses who refuse to cooperate. Navarro's no-show came a day after a lawyer in the White House Counsel's office notified Navarro that President Biden would not assert executive privilege to shield him from testifying before the committee. The committee subpoenaed Navarro's records and testimony in early February, citing his role in a plan to delay the congressional certification of the 2020 election results, and ultimately overturn President Biden's victory. Navarro is the latest no-show for the House January 6 committee. Two top Trump allies, Steve Bannon and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Sunday that he \"probably\" would not have appointed a special counsel to oversee the Justice Department's two ongoing investigations involving former President Donald Trump, as Attorney General Merrick Garland did last week. \"In this case, Merrick Garland clearly made a discretionary decision. The department had been handling this itself for two years, could have continued to handle it itself. But he believed that this would help to promote public confidence. I think it remains to be seen whether that's the case,\" Rosenstein said in an interview with \"Face the Nation.\" \"It's easy to second guess from outside. I think, you know, my inclination, given that the investigation had been going on for some time and given the stage which they've reached, is that I probably would not have, but I just can't tell from the outside.\" As deputy attorney general in 2017, Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and any ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. Jeff Sessions, then the attorney general, had recused himself from the case, leaving Rosenstein with oversight of the Justice Department's probe. Garland announced Friday that he had named John \"Jack\" Smith as the special counsel tasked with overseeing the Justice Department's investigation into Trump's handling of sensitive government records at his South Florida home, as well as possible obstruction related to that probe and efforts to unlawfully interfere with the transfer of power after the 2020 presidential election or the certification of Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, 2021. Smith served as former chief of the Justice Department's Public Integrity Division and as chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague investigating war crimes. The attorney general said his decision to appoint a special counsel was based in part on Trump's announcement last week that he would be running for president once more, and President Biden's intention to run for reelection in 2024. Trump, meanwhile, told Fox News that he \"won't partake\" in the special counsel's probe, and in a speech Friday, called the investigations a \"horrendous abuse of power.\" The Justice Department's investigation into Trump's handling of government records involves documents the former president brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his South Florida resort, from the White House at the end of his presidency. Federal prosecutors revealed in court papers that 300 documents marked classified were eventually recovered from Trump's residence, including during the Aug. 8 search of the property by the FBI. A special master has been appointed in that case to review the thousands of documents seized by federal investigators and separate any that may be covered by claims of attorney-client or executive privilege. The Jan. 6 case, meanwhile, is more wide-ranging and involves the failed strategy to certify alternate fake slates of presidential electors and keep Trump in power for a second term, as CBS News has reported previously. It also encompasses\u00a0fundraising by Trump's team between the November 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021, and how the money was used. Rosenstein said he believes that while the Justice Department has spent nearly two years on the Jan. 6 case, and nearly a year on the Mar-a-Lago investigation, the appointment of a special counsel indicates investigators believe they have a \"viable potential case.\" \"It doesn't mean they made a decision to go forward,\" he said. \"But it certainly is an indication they believe it's a possibility.\" But Rosenstein said there are \"multiple levels of issues\" that the Justice Department needs to consider before indicting a former president. \"Number one is, you know, is the evidence sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction? Number two is, is it an appropriate use of federal resources to bring that case? And a case against a former president, obviously, would be extraordinary, would raise unique concerns,\" he said. \"And so I would hope that Merrick Garland and his team would be very careful about scrutinizing that evidence, not just checking the box, but making sure that they're prepared to stand behind the decision that they make.\" Rosenstein said sustaining a conviction would mean ensuring not only that a 12-person jury is persuaded of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but also that a conviction would be upheld on appeal.\u00a0 \"The department sometimes brings cases in which they use novel theories that prevail in district court but are overruled on appeal,\" he said. \"If they're to bring a case against the former president, you want to make sure they had a solid case and they were confident both of conviction and of prevailing on any appeal.\" Rosenstein also expressed concerns about the timing of the appointment and said there is a \"fair chance\" the investigation will continue into the 2024 election cycle. \"The new special counsel, Jack Smith, needs to get up to speed in the case. He's not even in the U.S. so he needs to come back and get engaged and supervise his team. He may need to bring in additional team members, people he trusts to review the circumstances,\" he said. \"And then there are other potential delays as well. You know, one of the downsides of appointing a special counsel is the possibility of litigation over the validity of the appointment of the special counsel. And that has always been upheld by the courts. But litigation can impose additional delay.\"",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2013 Former President Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro pleaded not guilty Friday to two charges of contempt of Congress. The charges against Navarro stem from his refusal to comply with a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the assault on the Capitol that took place on Jan. 6, 2021. The committee had asked Navarro to testify and provide documents related to the Trump administration's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\u00a0 Navarro's lawyers asked Friday that his trial date be delayed in order to allow him to promote his upcoming book in September, telling the court that it is \"important to him for his livelihood.\"\u00a0 After his arraignment, Navarro complained to reporters about his treatment. \"I thought that we could handle this matter in a civilized way dealing with constitutional issues. Obviously being put in leg irons and having people want to put me in prison has changed matters,\" he said. His lawyer, John Rowley, said that they had \"never seen anything as outrageous as what happened to Mr. Navarro.\"\u00a0 \"They put him in handcuffs; they put him in leg irons,\" Rowley said. \"I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that does not typically happen to career criminals.\" Judge Amit Mehta, who is overseeing Navarro's criminal case, previously rejected Navarro's request to delay his arraignment. In a June 8 letter to the judge, Navarro, who only recently hired a legal team after representing himself, wrote, \"My very freedom here is at stake and I ask for the court's understanding that it will take time both to find the appropriate representation and time to develop an appropriate legal strategy.\"\u00a0 Navarro declined Friday to say how he was paying his lawyers, after recently telling Fox News that he would be \"eating dog food\" because lawyers are so expensive.\u00a0 Rowley announced he is dropping a separate civil challenge to the House Jan. 6 subpoenas and grand jury subpoena. Judge Mehta said all the charges in the civil case could be resolved in the criminal trial.\u00a0 Earlier, Mehta granted the Department of Justice's request for a protective order in the case to limit what evidence Navarro may release to the public.\u00a0 \"Immediately after his initial appearance, in front of the courthouse doors, the Defendant voluntarily made an almost 18-minute extrajudicial statement about the pending criminal case,\" according to a Justice Department filing.\u00a0 Outside the courthouse after his arrest, Navarro addressed the press, calling the Jan. 6 House select committee a \"kangaroo committee.\"\u00a0 \"They're essentially acting as judge, jury and executioner,\" he complained. \"Their mission, their clear mission is to prevent Donald John Trump from running for president in 2024 and being elected for president.\"\u00a0 But the committee has said it needs information related in part to Navarro's work on a post-election effort known as the \"Green Bay Sweep,\" which aimed to reverse President Biden's victory over Trump.\u00a0 During his initial appearance earlier this month, Navarro was visibly angry at the prosecutors, calling them \"despicable\" and alleging prosecutorial misconduct.\u00a0 He has claimed investigators refused him an attorney, food and water, and \"shackled\" him in jail. CBS News confirmed Navarro was arrested at an unnamed airport gate before he was to board a flight to Nashville, an arrest he protested was unfair and unnecessary.\u00a0 The Justice Department responded to his various accusations in a filing late last week, writing, \"The Defendant has made numerous false statements in the press about his arrest \u2014 for example, that he was deprived of food and water. In fact, when he asked, he was offered food and water, took it, then asked if he wanted more.\"\u00a0 Navarro recently sued the House committee and the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office ahead of his indictment, alleging the subpoena he received \"pointedly ignored all claims of executive privilege and testimony immunity.\" He challenged the legality of the subpoena, claiming the select committee is \"neither duly authorized nor properly constituted,\" and the subpoena and resolution finding him in contempt of Congress violated separation of powers. Navarro has said his criminal case should be delayed until the lawsuit is resolved.\u00a0 Trump himself sought to block the release of White House records related to the Jan. 6 insurrection from the National Archives and Records Administration, citing executive privilege. But in January, the Supreme Court rejected his request. If convicted, Navarro faces one year in prison for each of the two counts against him. Another Trump adviser, Steve Bannon, has also been indicted on contempt of Congress charges for refusing to comply with subpoenas from the Committee. He has pleaded not guilty and is set to stand trial this summer.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol has interviewed more than 1,000 individuals and gathered more than 140,000 documents. Its members have spent nearly a year reviewing documents and hearing testimony from figures ranging from former Trump officials to Capitol police to riot defendants. \u00a0 This month, the House select committee is holding a series of public hearings on what it uncovered in its 11-month probe. Here are some of the key figures involved: Steve Bannon: The former White House chief strategist spoke with Trump at 8:37 a.m. on Jan. 6, and told him to call Mike Pence to urge him to block certification of the election. Bannon was subpoenaed to testify and turn over records to the select committee and refused to do so. He was indicted last fall for contempt of Congress and has pleaded not guilty. Jeffrey Clark: Clark worked in the Justice Department and was a key figure in raising doubts about the integrity of the 2020 election with Trump. A Senate Judiciary Committee report found he attempted to use Justice Department resources to delay certification of the election results and was in contact with Trump in the days leading up to Jan. 6. The select committee subpoenaed Clark for testimony and records in October and moved to hold him in contempt when he failed to appear. But the panel then granted him a reprieve after he indicated he would sit for a deposition and invoke the Fifth Amendment.\u00a0 John Eastman: A former law professor at Chapman University, Eastman devised the legal strategy for Vice President Mike Pence to delay counting or reject electoral votes from key states on Jan. 6, overturning the outcome of the election. Since January, Eastman has been involved in a legal battle with the select committee over a subpoena to Chapman for emails he exchanged using his university email account. Rudy Giuliani: The former New York City mayor and former personal attorney for Trump is, according to the committee, an \"important witness to the conspiracy to overthrow the government.\" His number, as well as Bannon's, appeared on the White House call log on the morning of Jan. 6. Giuliani led the legal fight to keep Trump in office and at one point was suspended from practicing law in New York and the District Columbia over his attempts to overturn the election. In May, Giuliani testified virtually before the select committee for nine hours. Mark Meadows: Trump's chief of staff at the time of the assault cooperated in part with the the committee, turning over text messages and emails, but he would not be deposed, citing Trump's privilege claims. His texts revealed Trump allies pleading with Meadows on Jan. 6 to intervene and get Trump to stop the violence. Ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration, his texts showed Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene suggested Meadows look into the possibility of imposing martial law. The Justice Department recently declined to prosecute Meadows for refusing to cooperate with House investigators.\u00a0 Mike Pence: He was in the Capitol presiding over the joint session of Congress to affirm the results of the Electoral College as rioters shouted,\"Hang Mike Pence\" outside the Capitol. The vice president was whisked away by Secret Service just before rioters breached the area where he would have been. Trump publicly pressed Pence to stop the certification of the election on Jan. 6. Pence refused and said he had no choice but to certify the results. He called the idea of overturning an election \"un-American.\"\u00a0 Stewart Rhodes: The founder of the far-right and anti-government Oath Keepers group has pleaded guilty to the high-level charges of seditious conspiracy and obstructing Congress' certification of the Electoral College votes. According to court documents, Rhodes attempted to contact Trump during the attack.\u00a0 Enrique Tarrio: The leader of the far-right Proud Boys has been charged with seditious conspiracy, along with four of the group's other members. They stand accused of conspiring to use force to oppose the lawful transfer of power on Jan. 6, according to a grand jury indictment filed this week. Tarrio pleaded not guilty. Donald Trump: House investigators are hoping to learn more about what the president said and did on Jan. 6, 2021, although Trump has continued to insist the election was stolen and unfair. And as some of the president's allies urged him to call off the rioters, the president who could have fired off tweets condemning the violence and the rioters was silent for hours.\u00a0 Day 1 Caroline Edwards: U.S. Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards was the first law enforcement officer hurt by rioters as they stormed the Capitol grounds on Jan. 6. Since then, her injuries have prevented her from returning to the role she had as a member of the USCP First Responder Unit.\u00a0 Nick Quested: Quested, a filmmaker and documentarian, captured the movements and chaos at the Capitol on Jan. 6. He's an acclaimed filmmaker who was nominated for an Academy Award for producing \"Restrepo,\" which followed a platoon in Afghanistan for a year.\u00a0 Bennie Thompson: As chairman of the panel, Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, is responsible for issuing subpoenas. Thompson was appointed to the role by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0 Liz Cheney: A Republican congresswoman and vice chair of the committee, Cheney was ousted from her House Republican leadership position over her vocal support for impeaching Trump and for her continued public assertion that Trump lost. Cheney has called the insurrection and false claims about the 2020 election an \"ongoing threat.\"\u00a0 Adam Kinzinger: The Illinois representative is the only other Republican on the select committee and, like Cheney, voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection. He has continued to be one of the most vocal critics of Trump and the so-called \"Big Lie,\" that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from the former president. Kinzinger opted not to run for re-election this year after the Illinois state legislature passed a new map of voting boundaries that put him and fellow GOP Rep. Darin LaHood in the same district. Zoe Lofgren: Lofgren, a California Democrat, was one of the House managers in the president's first impeachment trial. She also participated in the Nixon and Clinton impeachment proceedings.\u00a0 Adam Schiff: Schiff was the lead impeachment manager in the first impeachment trial of then-President Trump over his handling of a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\u00a0 Pete Aguilar: Aguilar is the vice chair of the House Democratic caucus. He has said the committee must \"come together in an apolitical way\" to tell the story of what happened on Jan. 6.\u00a0 Stephanie Murphy: Murphy, a Floridian, is not running for reelection this year. She is the co-chair of Democrats' moderate Blue Dog Coalition. Jamie Raskin: The Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol came only days after Raskin lost his son, Tommy, to suicide. Days after that, Raskin led the second impeachment trial against Trump.\u00a0 Elaine Luria:\u00a0Luria is a Navy veteran from Virginia. She has described the details the committee has unearthed so far as \"shocking.\"\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California that aired Sunday, June 5, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We're gonna go now to California Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff. He joins us from Los Angeles. Mr. Chairman, good morning to you.\u00a0 REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SCHIFF: Good morning.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You wear a lot of hats, but I want to ask you about the January 6 committee that you serve on. The Justice Department, as you know, on Friday decided not to prosecute the former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, or social media director, Dan Scavino, for refusing to cooperate with your committee. We know the committee said that was puzzling. Is it your understanding that- that these men are immune from all prosecution? REP. SCHIFF: No, they're not. And it is very puzzling why these two witnesses would be treated differently than the two that the Justice Department is prosecuting. There is no absolute immunity. These witnesses have very relevant testimony to offer in terms of what went into the violence of January 6, the propagation of the big lie, and the idea that witnesses could simply fail to show up. And when the statute requires the Justice Department to present those cases to the grand jury, they don't, is deeply troubling. We hope to get more insight from the Justice Department, but it's a- I think, a grave disappointment, and could impede our work if other witnesses think they can, likewise, refuse to show up with impunity. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it because these two men had such close proximity to President Trump? Is the executive privilege argument actually applying here? REP. SCHIFF: That- that shouldn't be the explanation here because of course there are great many things these witnesses can testify with no even plausible claim of executive privilege. They were both involved in campaign matters. They both have documents that they could offer. None of this is protected by privilege and the idea that you can simply refuse to show up rather than show up and say as to this question, I'm going to exert a privilege, that just invites others to be in contempt of Congress or be in contempt of judges around the country, in other courtrooms, and I think it's a very dangerous precedent to set. MARGARET BRENNAN: New York Times was first to report, CBS has confirmed, that Mike Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, actually warned the Secret Service and the lead agent protecting the vice president the day before January 6 that he thought the president would turn on the vice president and that it would pose a direct security risk. We know Mr. Short plans to testify himself before your committee. Is that sufficient? Do you need to hear from the Vice President? REP. SCHIFF: Margaret, we're not commenting on specific witnesses so I can't confirm or deny who will appear before us. I can say that certainly one of the themes that we will be fleshing out is the- the fact that in advance of the 6th, that there was an understanding of the propensity for violence that day, of the participation of white nationalist groups, of the effect that the continued propagation of this big lie to rile up the country and rile up the president's base was likely to lead to violence. So you will see that theme among the narratives that will be exhibited during these hearings. But as to a particular witness, I really can't comment. MARGARET BRENNAN: But if you don't deliver a bombshell on Thursday, don't you run the risk of losing the public's attention here? REP. SCHIFF: Our goal is to present the narrative of what happened in this country, how close we came to losing our democracy, what led to that violent attack on the 6th? The American people, I think, know a great deal already. They've seen a number of bombshells already. There's a great deal they haven't seen. But perhaps most important is the public hasn't seen it woven together, how one thing led to another, how one line of effort to overturn the election led to another and ultimately led to terrible violence, the first non peaceful transfer of power in our history. So we want to tell that comprehensive narrative, and we're aiming at people and audience, frankly, that still has an open mind about these facts. We want to counter the continuing propagation of big lies. And that's- that's what our goal is. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about inflation, which is a problem throughout the country. The San Francisco Fed said that the American Rescue Plan contributed about three percentage points to inflation. It's not the primary driver, but a contributor to it. In hindsight, do you think Democrats should have structured that $2 trillion package differently? Should it have been smaller? REP. SCHIFF: No, I don't think so. And of course, there have been other studies that have reached the- the opposite conclusion that it had an even more minimal impact on inflation. What I do think is the cause--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --It's a non-political group, you know that. REP. SCHIFF: Well, no, I understand that. But again, there are studies that show that it had a negligible impact on inflation as well that are also very credible. I think the- the reality is though, and this- this I think is borne out by all the evidence, is there was a global inflationary pressure, global problem with supply chains. Our economy, in fact grew so fast the in United States that that problem is particularly acute, because the demand when we emerged, you know, so quickly from the pandemic, and grew so many jobs, the- the disparity between that demand, and the supply was so pronounced this to lead to this inflation. But people are suffering from it. We've got to attack it in every way we can. I think, sadly, the Republicans are getting in our way, because they would rather have the issue of inflation, then really do something about it to help the country and this is what we're confronting in Congress, and what the administration is battling against. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration seems to also be making some foreign policy decisions that keep inflation in mind as well. We know the president is preparing to travel to Saudi Arabia this summer. And he'll meet with the royal family, including potentially Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince, who U.S. Intelligence said issued that order to kill or capture a US-based writer named Jamal Khashoggi. This is what you said in February of 2021. REP. SCHIFF ON MSNBC IN FEBRUARY 2021: I think he should be shunned. I think he should be- I don't think the president should talk with him. I don't think the President should see him. MARGARET BRENNAN: Should the President still go to Saudi Arabia and meet with the Crown Prince? REP. SCHIFF: In my view, no. I wouldn't go. I wouldn't shake his hand. This is someone who butchered an American resident, cut him up into pieces and in the most terrible and premeditated way. And until Saudi Arabia makes a radical change in terms of human rights, I wouldn't want anything to do with him. Now, I understand the degree to which Saudi Arabia controls oil prices. I think that's a compelling argument for us to wean ourselves off of reliance on foreign oil and on oil more globally, so we don't have despots and murderers calling the shots. But no, I wouldn't go and- and If I had to go to the country for some other reason, I wouldn't meet with the Crown Prince, I think he should be shunned. MARGARET BRENNAN: So there is no way to justify a trip like this, if it is an attempt to get Saudi Arabia to put more oil on the market and lower gas prices? REP. SCHIFF: Well, in my view, we should make every effort to low- lower oil prices, but going hand-in-hand to someone who's murdered American resident would not be on my list. And I would want to see Saudi Arabia, lower their oil prices- or increase their production rather. I'd want to see them make changes in their human rights record. I want to see them hold people accountable, that were involved in that murder, and in the torture of other detainees before I would extend that kind of dignity to Saudi Arabia or its leadership. MARGARET BRENNAN: Chairman Schiff, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

            "article_content": "Jared Kushner, former President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser in his White House, is expected to appear before the committee investigating the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol, multiple sources familiar with the matter tell CBS News. Kushner was not physically at the White House on January 6, though he had significant influence within the administration. He was returning to Washington from a trip to Saudi Arabia, where he was working on negotiations between Gulf Arab leaders. He did not return to the White House that day. The committee asked Kushner's wife, Ivanka Trump, to appear for testimony in a January letter that cited her presence with her father in the White House that day, as well as in the Oval Office during a phone conversation Mr. Trump had with Vice President Mike Pence that morning. As recently as late February, a spokesperson said she was in discussions with the committee to voluntarily appear for an interview. A spokesman for the committee declined to comment, and a spokesperson for Kushner could not be reached for comment. Though Kushner was not among the vocal supporters of the president claiming widespread fraud in the 2020 election, he was possibly on the receiving end of those advocating for action. In a text message to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows obtained by CBS News, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote, \"Just forwarded to yr gmail an email I sent Jared this am.\" It's not clear who she's referring to.\u00a0 The news of Kushner's testimony came on the heels of a victory for the committee: A federal judge in California on Monday ordered conservative attorney John Eastman to turn over a tranche of emails they had sought, and found that former President Donald Trump \"more likely than not\" illegally tried to impede official congressional proceedings on the day of the attack. The committee will be voting Monday night on whether to recommend to the House that two former Trump aides be held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas from the committee. The committee issued a report late Sunday recommending the nine-person committee move forward on holding the pair, Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, in contempt. The vote is likely to be approved, since the committee is comprised of seven Democrats and two Republicans, who both support investigating the former president.\u00a0 The committee has issued more than 90 subpoenas, including ones to Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege. Two top Trump allies, Steve Bannon and Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon. Both said they are following instructions from Trump, who has claimed executive privilege.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee last year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol during the rally at the Ellipse before the electoral vote count, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.\u00a0 Rebecca Kaplan covers Congress for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Former Trump administration Attorney General Bill Barr is in talks to cooperate with the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to an individual close to Barr.\u00a0 Committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson told \"Face the Nation\" in January that the select committee \"had conversations with the former attorney general already,\" and an individual close to the Barr confirmed the panel contacted him for what was described as an informal conversation to see whether he had information related to the Capitol attack or the actions of former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark. When asked about a draft executive order\u00a0obtained by Politico\u00a0that was given to former President Donald Trump directing the Defense Department to seize voting machines after he lost the 2020 election, Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said, \"we've had conversations with the former attorney general already. We have talked to Department of Defense individuals.\" At that time, Barr said he did not have any visibility into the events of January or Clarke's work and did not feel he had much information that could be useful to the select committee. Barr resigned from his post as attorney general in December 2020 and ended his tenure at the department on December 23. Clark, a key figure in raising doubts about the integrity of the election with Trump, attempted to use Justice Department resources to delay certification of the 2020 election results, according to a report from the Senate Judiciary Committee. Clark was in contact with Mr. Trump in the days leading up to January 6, according to the Senate Judiciary committee's report.\u00a0 The select committee issued a subpoena for his testimony in October. The committee had moved to hold Clark in contempt late last year when he failed to appear but granted him a reprieve after he indicated he would appear for a deposition and invoke the Fifth Amendment.\u00a0 While Barr was considered a defender of Trump while he led the Justice Department, their relationship soured in the wake of the 2020 presidential election after Barr told the Associated Press that federal investigators had not found evidence of widespread voter fraud, as Trump claimed. A source familiar with the situation confirmed to CBS News in October that former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen sat for an interview with the committee. It lasted around 8 hours. The committee is winding down its investigations ahead of planned public hearings, set to start on June 9. Thompson said earlier this week that he didn't expect the committee would call Trump as a witness. Thompson said earlier this week the first hearing will \"more or less\" show what the committee has learned over the past year.\u00a0 The House select committee was created last year by Speaker Nancy Pelosi to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory.

According to The Washington Post, Jacob was with Short and Pence in the Capitol on January 6 as pro-Trump rioters overtook the building and they were forced to evacuate to a safe location within the Capitol complex. \u00a0 Trump had publicly and privately pressured Pence to reject the election results in certain states won by Joe Biden, but Pence issued a statement saying he could not do so.\u00a0 Pence certified the Electoral College count at 3:40 a.m. on Thursday, January 7, more than 14 hours after the joint session began.\u00a0 A spokesman for the committee declined to comment.\u00a0 Jacob reportedly clashed with Trump attorney John Eastman over the legal authority of the vice president to overturn the election during Congress' counting of the electoral votes.\u00a0 \"The outside lawyers pushed a fallback plan positing that the Vice President could instead stop the electoral vote count Congress and refer it out to the states,\" Jacobs reportedly wrote in an opinion article he decided not to publish, according to the Washington Post. \"That suggestion violated several provisions of the Electoral Count Act, had no historical analog, and would deprive Congress of its historical and statutory role in vote counting decisions.\" t Former President Trump continues to incorrectly assert that Pence had the authority to reject the electoral count during Congress' certification process, and said in a statement over the weekend that Pence \"could have overturned the election.\" The committee is also looking to speak with Pence himself. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the panel's chair, told NPR in early January that the committee could request a meeting with the former vice president by the end of the month. Thompson told reporters in January that counsel for the two sides had been in touch. But the lawyer who had represented Pence, Richard Cullen, left his law firm in late January to join Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin's office. It's unclear who represents Pence now. Another former Pence advisor, retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, testified to the committee at length in December. Kellogg had served as Pence's national security adviser, but was in the White House on January 6 and was at times with Trump. Among the topics Kellogg discussed with the panel was a phone call between Trump and Pence on the morning of the attack. Kellogg recalled to investigators that Trump said something \"'like you're not tough enough to make the call'\" and had sought to persuade Pence to reject the election results. Kellogg also testified that at the close of the call, Ivanka turned to him and said, \"Mike Pence is a good man,\" to which he said, \"Yes, he is.\" The committee has issued dozens of subpoenas, including ones to Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege. Two top Trump allies, Steve Bannon and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon. Both said they are following instructions from Trump, who has claimed executive privilege. \u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee last year earlier this year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming President Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Mr. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \"walk over\" to the Capitol during a rally at the Ellipse, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate. The panel has interviewed 400 witnesses and has obtained over 50,000 documents, according to Representative Jamie Raskin, who sits on the committee.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S Capitol is demanding four social media companies turn over internal records as it examines the spread of misinformation online and how violent extremists used social platforms to organize efforts to overthrow the 2020 election. The committee sent subpoenas to Twitter, Reddit, Alphabet, which owns Google and YouTube, and Meta, formerly known as Facebook, to immediately produce documents related to their investigation after \"inadequate responses\" to prior requests. \"Two key questions for the Select Committee are how the spread of misinformation and violent extremism contributed to the violent attack on our democracy, and what steps\u2014if any\u2014social media companies took to prevent their platforms from being breeding grounds for radicalizing people to violence,\" select committee chair Bennie Thompson said in a statement. \"It's disappointing that after months of engagement, we still do not have the documents and information necessary to answer those basic questions.\u00a0 Former President Donald Trump posted on Twitter and Facebook during the riot, although he did not condemn the attack until several hours after it started. Two days after the riot, Twitter permanently banned Trump, citing \"the risk of further incitement of violence.\" Facebook soon followed suit, although the Oversight Board has ordered the company to review the decision by 2023. In a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Thompson mentioned the company's Civic Integrity team, whose mission was to counter election misinformation but was disbanded before the January 6 attack. \"Facebook disbanded the Civic Integrity team that had focused on risks to election including misinformation, and reduced the application of tools used to restrain the spread of violent content,\" Thompson writes, adding, \"despite repeated and specific requests for documents to these matters, the Select Committee still has not received these materials.\" It's a change of tune for the chairman of the committee, who said in an October interview on \"Face the Nation\" that \"at this point, Facebook is working with us to provide the necessary information we requested.\" In a statement to CBS News, Meta spokesperson Nkechi Nneji said Facebook is cooperating. \"Meta has produced documents to the committee on a schedule committee staff requested \u2014 and we will continue to do so,\" Nneji said. The Select Committee wants Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to turn over records about how it developed, implemented and reviewed its content moderation and other policies that may have affected the events on January 6th. In a letter to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Thompson writes that the company has \"significant undisclosed information\" critical to the committee's investigation. \"YouTube was a platform for significant communications by its users that were relevant to the planning and execution of the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol,\" Thompson writes in his letter to Pichai. Thompson also said Steve Bannon, who once served as chief strategist for Trump and spread lies that the results of the 2020 election were illegitimate, live-streamed his podcasts on YouTube in the days before and after the attack on the Capitol. \"To this day, YouTube is a platform on which user video spread misinformation about the election,\" Thompson writes. Like Meta, Alphabet said it is cooperating with the committee, and reiterated that it has \"strict policies prohibiting content that incites violence or undermines trust in elections\" on both Google and YouTube.\u00a0 \"We remain vigilant and are committed to protecting our platforms from abuse,\" an Alphabet spokesperson told CBS News. Twitter, which declined to comment for this story, was also scolded by Thompson for allegedly allowing high-profile accounts to use the platform \"for communications amplifying allegations of election fraud.\" Thompson said Twitter has not produced documents relating to warnings the company received that its platform was being used to plan or incite violence on January 6, 2021. \u00a0 \"Twitter has failed to produce any documents that fully explain either its decision to suspend President Trump's account on January 8, 2021, or any other decisions the company made regarding President Trump's account relating to the events of January 6th,\" Thompson wrote in a letter to Twitter's new CEO Parag Agarwal. A spokesperson for Reddit confirmed to CBS News that the company has \"received the subpoena and will continue to work with the committee on their requests.\" Thompson wrote to Reddit CEO Steven Huffman that the \"subreddit\" community \"r/The_Donald\" grew significantly on Reddit, adding that the users of the group discussed, and planned actions related to the January 6 attack. In August, the select committee sent requests for records to 15 social media companies and set a two-week deadline for the companies to respond. Thompson said Wednesday the committee has issued about 85 subpoenas, including Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege. Two top Trump allies,\u00a0Bannon and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol announced Friday it had issued subpoenas to 14 individuals who participated as \"alternate electors\" in an apparent scheme to contest and ultimately overturn President Biden's victory in the 2020 election. The committee is demanding testimony and documents from individuals who met and later submitted illegitimate Electoral College certificates in seven states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Their deadlines to appear are mid to late February. \"The Select Committee is seeking information about attempts in multiple states to overturn the results of the 2020 election, including the planning and coordination of efforts to send false slates of electors to the National Archives,\" the committee's chairman Bennie Thompson said in a statement. \"We believe the individuals we have subpoenaed today have information about how these so-called alternate electors met and who was behind that scheme.\" A press release from the committee said it had \"obtained information\" that groups of individuals met on December 14, 2020, in seven battleground states carried by President Biden in the November election. These fake electors then allegedly submitted bogus slates of Electoral College certificates, claiming former President Donald Trump had won those states, to Congress. The existence of the alternate elector votes was used as a justification to delay or block the certification of the election, Thompson said in letters to the individuals being subpoenaed. CNN reported that Rudy Giuliani spearheaded the push.\u00a0 Former Trump campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn told MSNBC last week that he was part of this effort to put up \"alternate electors.\"\u00a0 \"Yes, I was part of the process to make sure there were alternate electors for when, as we hoped, the challenges to the seated electors would be heard, and would be successful,\" Epshteyn told MSNBC after insisting that the electors were indeed \"alternate\" and not \"fraudulent electors.\" The effort ultimately failed, with Congress and Vice President Mike Pence certifying Biden's victory on January 6. The 14 individuals who were subpoenaed by the committee were either listed as a chairperson or a secretary of a group of alternate electors: The announcement of the subpoenas came shortly after Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, the no. 2 at the Justice Department, told CNN federal prosecutors were \"looking at\" the fake Electoral College certifications. An official with knowledge of the situation separately confirmed to CBS News the agency was reviewing the matter.\u00a0 The committee has issued dozens of subpoenas, including Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege.

According to the committee, they will \"present previously unseen material documenting January 6th, receive witness testimony, preview additional hearings, and provide the American people a summary of its findings about the coordinated, multi-step effort to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and prevent the transfer of power.\" The committee said additional details regarding witnesses would be released next week. The panel has so far not publicly released who the witnesses will be. They have interviewed over 900 witnesses in the 10-month investigation and have received nearly 104,000 documents, an aide to the panel said last month. A Trump aide confirmed to CBS News that former President Donald Trump is expected to provide a counterresponse, likely in the form of statements, some of which could be distributed through his \"Truth Social\" platform. The aide said they would probably be more general in nature versus real-time rapid response.\u00a0  Committee chair U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi said in May that they plan to \"use a combination of witnesses, exhibits, things that we have through the tens of thousands of exhibits we've [...] looked at, as well as the hundreds of witnesses we deposed or just talked to in general.\" This is not the first public hearing the committee has held \u2014 there was a public\u00a0hearing held in July 2021\u00a0that featured testimony from police officers who helped defend the Capitol from the mob on January 6, 2021. The June 9 hearing will the first of the several\u00a0planned hearings as the committee winds down its investigation. Committee member Rep. Jamie Raskin told CBS News' \"Red & Blue\" in May that the committee divided it up into chapters \"that will allow for the unfolding of the narrative.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the nine-person committee, comprised of seven Democrats and two Republicans, nearly a year ago to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.

In letters to two former Trump campaign officials, the panel's chair Bennie Thompson, wrote that the committee has discovered that the plan was directed at least in part from the former president's national campaign.\u00a0 \"The Select Committee is in possession of communications involving you and other members of the Trump campaign reflecting a coordinated strategy to contact Republican members of state legislatures in certain states that former President Trump had lost and urge them to 'reclaim' their authority by sending an alternate slate of electors that would support former President Trump,\" Thompson wrote.\u00a0 Thompson said that Michael Roman and Gary Michael Brown, director and deputy director of the Trump campaign's Election Day operations, helped coordinate campaign staffers' efforts in the scheme.\u00a0 Among the other individuals to whom the committee issued subpoenas were two state lawmakers who took part in the alternative elector plot and traveled to Washington on January 6.\u00a0 Mark Finchem, an Arizona state House member, said in a press release the following week that he was there \"to deliver an evidence book and letter to Vice President Pence showing key evidence of fraud in the Arizona Presidential Election, and asking him to consider postponing the award of electors\u2026\" Doug Mastriano, a Pennsylvania state senator, publicly called for the Republican-controlled legislature in his state to appoint its own electors to change the outcome of the presidential election there because of \"mounting evidence that the PA presidential election was compromised.\" The committee also subpoenaed Kelli Ward, the chair of the Arizona GOP. Ward, who sued the committee earlier this month over its pursuit of her phone records, \"apparently acted as a purported Electoral College elector to meet and ultimately transmit to Congress a set of alternate Electoral College votes,\" Thompson wrote in his letter to her.\u00a0 The committee additionally demanded a deposition with Laura Cox, the chairwoman of the Michigan GOP, who was reportedly with Rudy Guiliani on calls during which he encouraged local activists to convince Republican state lawmakers to appoint their own electors for Trump.\u00a0 The committee has issued dozens of subpoenas, including ones to Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege.

Last month, the committee asked Ivanka Trump, who served as an adviser to her father, to voluntarily speak with them. \"Ivanka Trump is in discussions with the Committee to voluntarily appear for an interview,\" the spokesperson told CBS News.\u00a0 The news, which was first reported by The New York Times, comes just over a month after Chairman Bennie G. Thompson sent a letter to Ivanka Trump requesting that she appear before the committee. The letter said the committee believes that she was at the White House on January 6 and in the Oval Office when then-President Trump had a phone call with then-Vice President Mike Pence. The chairman wanted to ask her about this, as well as if she heard or was a part of any other conversations about her father's plan to \"obstruct or impede the counting of electoral votes.\" According to Thompson's letter, many White House staffers repeatedly asked former President Trump to dissipate the crowd at the U.S. Capitol once it turned violent. Some allegedly asked Ivanka Trump to speak with her father.\u00a0 \"Testimony obtained by the Select Committee indicates that members of the White House staff requested your assistance on multiple occasions to intervene in an attempt to persuade President Trump to address the ongoing lawlessness and violence on Capitol Hill,\" the letter said.\u00a0 In response to Thompson's letter, a spokesperson for Ivanka Trump said last month that she had not spoken at the January 6 rally. The spokesperson added that she put out a public call to stop the violence once it started, saying: \"Any security breach or disrespect to our law enforcement is unacceptable. The violence must stop immediately. Please be peaceful.\" If Ivanka Trump appears before the committee, she will be one of the former president's closest allies to do so. Since the committee was formed, it has sent over 80 subpoenas to former members of the Trump administration as well as those involved in the January 6 rally, according to Thompson. Last month, the committee issued subpoenas to top Trump allies Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, Sidney Powell and Boris Epshteyn, who all sought to overturn the 2020 election results. Steve Bannon and Mark Meadows, former Trump aides, have been held in contempt for refusing to appear. Bannon was charged by the Justice Department.

Short was with Pence in the Capitol on January 6 as pro-Trump rioters overtook the building and the pair were forced\u00a0 to evacuate to a safe location within the Capitol complex. Trump had publicly and privately pressured Pence to reject the election results in certain states won by Joe Biden, but Pence issued a statement saying he could not do so.\u00a0 Pence certified the Electoral College count at 3:40 a.m. on Thursday, January 7, more than 14 hours after the joint session began.\u00a0 A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment.\u00a0 The news of Short's cooperation with the committee was first reported by CNN. The committee is also looking to speak with Pence himself. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the panel's chair, told NPR in early January that the committee could request a meeting with the former vice president by the end of the month. The meeting with Short represents another senior administration official adding to the trove of records the committee is building.\u00a0 Congressman Jamie Raskin, who sits on the January 6 select committee, said earlier this month that the committee has interviewed 400 witnesses and has obtained over 50,000 documents.

Prosecutors allege Rhodes and 10 co-conspirators intended to stop the presidential transfer of power by January 20, 2021, when President Biden was sworn into office. \"They coordinated travel across the country to enter Washington, D.C., equipped themselves with a variety of weapons, donned combat and tactical gear, and were prepared to answer Rhodes's call to take up arms at Rhodes's direction,\" according to the indictment. \"Some co-conspirators also amassed firearms on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., distributed them among 'quick reaction force' teams, and planned to use the firearms in support of their plot to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power.\" After weeks of planning, mostly over messaging apps, prosecutors say the members of the Oath Keepers and its affiliates formed two \"stacks\" to breach the Capitol building on the day of the attack. Meanwhile, the charging documents and subsequent filings allege a separate team of Oath Keepers remained outside Washington and was \"prepared to rapidly transport firearms and other weapons into Washington, D.C., in support of the operations.\" Such a transport was never ordered by Rhodes or any other leaders, prosecutors said.\u00a0 \"Rhodes stood at the center of the seditious conspiracy,\" the government alleged in court documents, \"orchestrating plans to use force, recruiting and financing co-conspirators, purchasing weaponry and tactical gear, inciting support and action, and endeavoring to conceal his and other co-conspirators' crimes.\"\u00a0 Virginia-based attorney Jon Moseley says he will represent the Oath Keeper before the Committee during Wednesday's deposition.\u00a0 Both Moseley and Rhodes' criminal defense attorney, Philip Linder, confirm that their client will likely avoid answering questions that may interfere with his criminal trial.\u00a0 The Oath Keepers founder is currently detained in Oklahoma, likely on his way to D.C. before trial, his attorneys say.\u00a0 However, Linder and his co-counsel, James Lee Bright, both of Texas, have asked a Washington, D.C. judge to either free their client from pretrial detention or transfer him back to a Texas jail to help facilitate his preparation for July's trial. They are requesting that the judge reconsider Texas Magistrate Judge Kimberly Priest Johnson's ruling that Rhodes be detained ahead of that trial. \"The evidence shows Defendant orchestrated a large-scale attack on the federal government with the purpose of intimidating, by violence, federal officials and disrupting official governmental proceedings incident to the transfer of power in the Executive Branch following a national election,\" the magistrate judge wrote.\u00a0 Rhodes and nine of his co-defendants have pleaded not guilty to charges that they planned for and participated in the January 6 Capitol attack. In all, 11 Oath Keepers have been charged with seditious conspiracy.\u00a0 The House January 6 select committee has issued dozens of subpoenas, including to Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege. Two top Trump allies, Steve Bannon and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, have been held in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with subpoenas, and the Justice Department has charged Bannon. Both said they are following instructions from Trump, who has claimed executive privilege. \u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee last year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming President Biden's victory. According to lawmakers, the panel has interviewed 400 witnesses and has obtained over 50,000 documents.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "A federal judge on Thursday struck down parts of a sweeping election law signed by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in 2021, saying in his ruling that some of the law's provisions were enacted \"with the intent to discriminate against Black voters.\" Judge Mark Walker said in his decision that Florida cannot enforce the law's limits on when ballot drop boxes maycould be accessed and requirements that third- party groups issue a warning when registering voters that their registration application may not be turned in on time. The judge also said that the law's prohibition of \"any activity with the intent to influence or effect of influencing a voter\" near a polling place cannot be enforced because it could be read to ban \"line warming\" activities, like giving food or water to voters waiting in line.\u00a0 DeSantis signed the law, known as SB90, last May, as Republican state legislatures around the country were also making made significant changes to their voting laws following the 2020 election. At the time, DeSantis said that Florida had the \"strongest election integrity measures in the country,\" but added, \"we're not resting on our laurels.\" \"Defendants argue that SB 90 makes minor prophylactic changes to the election code,\" Walker wrote. \"Plaintiffs, on the other hand, allege that SB 90 runs roughshod over the right to vote, unnecessarily making voting harder for all eligible Floridians, unduly burdening disabled voters, and intentionally targeting minority voters\u2014all to improve the electoral prospects of the party in power.\" \"Having reviewed all the evidence, this Court finds that, for the most part, Plaintiffs are right,\" Walker added.\u00a0 Walker, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, also said \"Florida has a grotesque history of racial discrimination,\" and that history was a factor inweighed into his decision. The law was challenged by voting rights advocates, including the League of Women Voters of Florida.\u00a0 \"At some point, when the Florida Legislature passes law after law disproportionately burdening Black voters, this Court can no longer accept that the effect is incidental,\" Walker wrote. \"Based on the indisputable pattern set out above, this Court finds that, in the past 20 years, Florida has repeatedly sought to make voting tougher for Black voters because of their propensity to favor Democratic candidates.\" Citing evidence and testimony from plaintiffs' experts, Walker wrote that \"not only do Black voters disproportionately use drop boxes, but they also use them in precisely the ways SB 90 prohibits.\" \"This Court further finds that, to advance the Legislature's main goal of favoring Republicans over Democrats, the Legislature enacted some of SB 90's provisions with the intent to target Black voters because of their propensity to favor Democratic candidates,\" Walker wrote. Walker said that any future changes Florida makes to provisions dealing with third-party voter registration groups, drop boxes or \"line warming\" activities are subject to pre-clearance under the Voting Rights Act for ten years.\u00a0 \"Senate Bill 90 was clearly an anti-voter measure that raised barriers to voting with specific impacts on elderly voters, voters with disabilities, students, and communities of color,\" Cecile Scoon, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida, said in a statement. \"The League is gratified that once again the constitutional rights of Florida's voters have superseded partisan politics.\" In addition to the measures that Walker struck down, SB90 requires voters to provide either a driver's license or state ID number or the last four digits of their Social Security number when requesting a mail ballot. Voters will also need to request mail ballots more frequently.\u00a0 Florida's GOP-controlled legislature passed another election- related bill this session that would create a new state office dedicated to investigating alleged election crimes.\u00a0 \"In front of certain district judges, we know we will lose no matter what because they are not going to follow the law,\" DeSantis said at a news conference, according to the Associated Press.\u00a0 DeSantis has previously said that if parts of the law were struck down by the federal district court, he is confident that an appeals court would reverse that decision.\u00a0 CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon that aired Sunday, Dec. 11, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm so glad, first of all, that we're finally doing this. JAMIE DIMON: I'm thrilled too, I know it's been a while. MARGARET BRENNAN: So let's start off with why we're here. Why is America's best known banker in an inner city, low income neighborhood in Baltimore? DIMON: I think it's a- it's a kind of a microcosm of banks do, which is to lift up society. So most people think of us as an investment bank and a private bank and commercial bank, and we do all those things. But we also bank you know, at 25%, of our branches are in lower income neighborhoods, and we want to lift them up too. And so this is branch here is a uni-, we're brand- we're new to Maryland. So we're now in 48 states. 30% of the branches here in lower income neighborhoods. They're in communities. We work with local government folks, local not for profits, then you show the mayor, governor-elect, what do they need and we call it a community branch, means the community manager gets to know all of the local folks - the churches, the schools, the businesses, and we invite people in for education about mortgages, wealth, starting a business, etc. We use local vendors for food to build the place. We hire locally, so their paychecks going out in the local neighborhood. And you can see the spirit of the people. I mean, it's very uplifting. And so it's just part of what we do. And then we come into town. We bring everything else to government for not for profit banking, we bank cities, schools, states hospitals. So it's just a wonderful way to help lift up communities. And it's extremely critical for America to focus on helping the underprivileged. I think it's a mistake to just drive by and say that's not our problem.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhmm. DIMON: And so you see a lot of companies doing it. I'm proud of all the people to do it. And it's good for business. I mean, if you lift up society, it hurts- it helps everybody.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's what I want to ask you. Because you've done this now in Detroit, you've done this here, you've done it in parts of Dallas. You're not a charity, you're doing this for profit. DIMON: Yeah. So people look at that there's a little piece of charitable money, which sometimes I call an accelerator.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhm. DIMON: So if you can put that little piece of charity and on top that you can build $100 million of loans. But , but it's not done for charities, it's got to be sustainable. Things which aren't sustainable don't work very well. And so- But once we've got collaboration with local government, we're here, we- we intend to make a profit here and open accounts here and do things like that. Like I said, if you lift up Baltimore, it lifts up every business here. It lifts up all the people. you have more jobs, more wages, better social outcomes, better real estate value, so it's critical we do it and it is very good for business in the long run. And if everyone did it, you know, it'd be very good for all of America.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: If everybody did this? DIMON: If everyone - and a lot companies- (crosstalk) BRENNAN: Bank of America's across the street over there, is that where- where you're talking about? DIMON: Well I'm not going to mention any competitors, but this is a much nicer looking branch. (Both laugh) MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when you - I mean, just fundamentally - when you, when you lend money, both parties are at risk. So in coming in here, JP Morgan has to change some of the parameters because you're reaching people who are unbanked.\u00a0 DIMON: Yes MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you know if someone is credit worthy If they've never owned a home, they've never had a bank account? How do you know you're making a good bet?\u00a0 DIMON: It's a great question. So when you try, when you're here and you ask and you know the neighborhoods and you work with government, you do multiple things, So we do special things. We have- we call special credit, I won't go through legal parameters, but you can do\u00a0 - use other facts that are not used in traditional underwriting, like do you- have you paid rent for 10 years? So you and I would both say, if there is a mother or father or family paying rent for 10 years, that's a good credit sign, so we take a little bit of a stretch on that.\u00a0 And so we live and learn, and so you can use a lot of data to do that. The government here, realize when it comes to lifting up neighborhoods, you can't do- you can't have a block where 50 homes, you know, 50 townhouses are bad or destroyed, and 50 are occupied. You have to lift all of them up.\u00a0 So the government here came up with a very special program, to put in the seed money to rehab-fit the whole block. Once they rehab the whole block, we can step in and start making mortgages. So people can buy the homes and live there. And so there are- there are multiple paths to do it. On the entrepreneur of color fund that we do with small businesses, you know, we get- we give them an advisor too.That gives us great comfort that they're doing the right things. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've been critical in the past, though of government-backed lenders like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for their role in the last crisis and, and loosening up the ability to take loans. This was all at that time well intended -\u00a0 DIMON: Yes MARGARET BRENNAN: -to boost homeownership DIMON: Yes (crosstalk) MARGARET BRENNAN: So you can have a good intention and fix it wrong (crosstalk) DIMON: You're absolutely correct. You know, things done badly are bad. And so there are a lot of examples where lenders did the wrong thing and the case banks and stuff like that, but we test, we learn, we test, we learn. And so this -\u00a0 these are not government programs, these are programs that we do that we're pretty comfortable doing a good thing. Do we take extra risk. Yes, but that's part of our job. We've banked venture capital companies, we bank startups, we bank a lot of people. We're adults, we're big boys, we know that their credit cycles thing go up or down.\u00a0 So we're not taking so much risk that it's going to sink a company. Remember, Fannie and Freddie went bankrupt. The government paid, you know, hundreds of billions of dollars in that. And the other thing there by the way is some of the underwriting was hidden. People didn't actually know what other people - with people were doing in the underwriting which is not the case you here. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the overall intent of boosting homeownership you believe is really important?\u00a0 DIMON: Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But in this moment we're in right now - you have mortgage rates -what? About 7%?\u00a0 DIMON: 6 1/2 % yeah MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, right around there. It's hard to get access, but the Fed's also trying to cool off a housing market bubble.\u00a0 DIMON: Yeah MARGARET BRENNAN: So why try -\u00a0 DIMON: Another good question. We look right through that - so this isn't we're not doing this and pulling in or pulling out our horns because the markets are good or bad. This is, you get to a community, you start doing it.\u00a0 So obviously, we're probably making less mortgages now because of higher rates, but we're in the community, we're gonna have loan officers in the community, we're gonna learn more about the community. And we will look past the actual rates. And remember the important thing about mortgages - and this is why I do criticize some public policy sometimes - mortgages are how most Americans got their their net worth. And if you can't get a smaller mortgage to buy a house, it's hard to build your net worth. Mortgages are also, by the way, how often people funded their small business startup. So it is absolutely critical.\u00a0 And you know one of the things we've been trying to change a little bit is because of all excessive rules now, and I'm not talking about things would make risk worse about origination, servicing, securitization, the cost of a small mortgage is probably 50 basis points higher than it should be. So that $150,000 mortgage or $200,000 mortgage is less affordable by a lot of people. And that's because of regulatory policy. That's not because of bank policy. And so, you know, I think there are things that could be done that can make mortgages far more affordable. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, if but you're saying not at this moment, you're not necessarily expecting- (crosstalk) DIMON: No they should change that right now.\u00a0 Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: So bigger picture on this effort right now, you said it's important to be trying to do things to address and build up communities. So if you're trying to combat discrimination, boost racial equity, that's admirable. But the other side of the coin is a critic would say a big bad Wall Street bank is loading debt onto poor people. How do you respond to that? Because- DIMON: That's a fairly ignorant person\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well- DIMON: We-\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You just spent a lot of time in Washington, I'm sure you have heard a lot of criticism of Big Bad banks (crosstalk) DIMON: But that's a different issue. We're not trying to load debt on anyone. And yes, I hear about big bank banks, but we're here, we're doing jobs. We want to make good mortgages, we want to do good small business loans, you want to educate people how to open an account, how to save money, we've got products that are special for lower income communities-\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right\u00a0 DIMON: We are going to do that. It is good for this community. If this community does better, it's good for this community. It doesn't hurt any other community. In fact, it helps them. MARGARET BRENNAN: But how do you reassure folks who say the lender shouldn't be the educator? DIMON: Well we're educating them about how to save money MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what those classes are about? (crosstalk) DIMON: Yeah, how to save money, how to buy a home, how to manage a business, if you start a business, how to get a- how to sign a lease, how to negotiate a government contract, so a lot of its education, it's not lending money. So you know, there's a specific account we have is an account where you know, you get a debit card, checking account, all the services, ATM services, branch services, can't overdraft.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You can't overdraft? DIMON: No, if you buy this account, it does not allow an overdraft. So we have a lot of products and services. we live and learn. And I don't worry about naysayers all the time. You know, we go- we we have a TrueNorth. We know what we're doing. We lift up societies around the world. We do it from low income to high income, we do- we bank governments, we bank the IMF, we bank the World Bank, we bank middle market companies, we make small businesses, we're in lower income neighborhoods. And we want to help- we want to do it all well, and we've done it all well. We're quite comfortable with all the things we do and and that they're also good for shareholders in the long run. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've been doing this particular program since roughly 2020. Put about $18 billion into it.\u00a0 DIMON: Yup MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to expand it? DIMON: Yeah, so we've been doing programs like this for a long time. The biggest lesson to us, and we did this huge effort in Detroit. So Detroit is one of the major American cities that had not had a renaissance. They ended up with a fabulous mayor, Mayor Duggan, we worked with him, we did an extended ten- almost in the 10th year anniversary - $250 million. I won't repeat all the same things, a lot of the similar things here. But working with local nonprofits, local institutions, local government, and it works you know, you can turn a city, you can make it work better, you can- have you go- go to the- go into downtown Detroit and look at it today versus what it was 15 years ago, then you can see the powerful effort. That kind of informed us, you know what, we could do this in other places, in different ways. And so we're always learning, but we now-\u00a0 we have now of doing something like this in 15 cities MARGARET BRENNAN: Do those states, do those governors and mayors come to you or are you still- DIMON: They- sometimes. But you know, we we talk we obviously talk to a lot of them, but I think you've heard you know, Peter Scher talk about that the collaboration is what makes it. We're not asking for gifts from cities or states or anything like that. But we also need their help. Like I gave you that very specific example about affordable housing here.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0 DIMON: So that the rules laws are different in Michigan and are different in other places. So if you've got people working together works, if you know if the local government doesn't like business and you know turns the scans and doesn't, you know, thinks we're bad. So no, it's hard to want to do business there and they're making a mistake. What they should do is go to Detroit. Come here. Visit a branch, see what policy works and what policy doesn't work. MARGARET BRENNAN: So in cities across the country right now, there's a homelessness problem.\u00a0 DIMON: Yeah.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's some of it is linked to many issues, but one of them is just accessible, and affordable housing. What incentive do you see for a developer right now to go in and try to take a loan and build up that kind of housing, like what is preventing that? DIMON: we are one of the biggest affordable lending in the in the country and a lot other banks do a lot of great job with that too. It is- first of all it's very local. It could be zoning laws, it could be requirements, it could be building requirements. It could be logo construct- it could be a million different things. But we often provide either the equity or the debt or the mezzanine, to build affordable housing, we do it everywhere. So I can give you- I'd have to send you a big position papers-\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right DIMON: different by every state. It is a big deal. It can be done, but you really need to have competent, affordable housing policies.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And that comes down as you're saying to these community relationships- (crosstalk)\u00a0 DIMON: It's community- MARGARET BRENNAN: that you have to try to solve DIMON: And community laws, there are community laws, there are city laws, there are federal laws, there- A lot is legal stuff. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, you've been in Washington for a few days, have you talked about this with lawmakers? I mean at the national level (crosstalk) DIMON: I've talked about the mortgage thing. Oh I've talked a lot of these things all the time. I go to Washington all the time, you know- MARGARET BRENNAN: But the acute homelessnes- DIMON: No. That's hard for us to do, we do affordable housing.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yup DIMON: And, all these other issues are so local, you got to really get into the local level. So our people get involved in that. And, and we get involved in federal policies. But I think one really important thing, this is a microcosm of what a bank does. And you know, and then other businesses, you heard about other businesses coming to lower income neighborhoods and what they're doing. But it's- but the most important thing is also government federal policy, around infrastructure, education, taxation, regulation, health care. So we, you know, we got to tackle these problems from both sides, good public policy at the federal level, good public policy at the state level. And then people like us doing our job, you know, that we're- that we we're meant to do. Finance, grow, develop people's dreams, help them accomplish their goals. MARGARET BRENNAN: So big picture, because you've lived through a lot of crisis in this country. And just looking back, you were at the helm during the financial crisis and the Great Recession, sovereign debt crisis, the pandemic. This moment we are in feels like a transition point and inflection point. And I wonder how you think about where America is at this moment. DIMON: Yeah. I think- I mean, I think it's very important people understand, America is the most prosperous nation the world's ever seen. Our basic principles of freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, are unbelievable. The innovation is unparalleled anywhere around the world. So start with that. It's an amazing position of strength. The economy is going through a bunch of things, and you just mentioned them COVID, and stuff like that. And we don't, we don't always really know whether you have a mild recession or hard recession. And if it happens, we're going to be fine. I feel bad, terrible, for people who lose jobs. We want to keep it as short as possible. I do think you're right about a turning point. But that turning point is about geopolitics. That's about Ukraine, oil, Russia, war, migration, food, national security, China trade, that whole bucket of things. And I'd put in that category, quantitative tightening, which is basically reducing the liquidity in the banking system in the world. That that is actually\u00a0 - forget us for a second - that it could\u00a0 be very difficult - high dollar, the dollar going up - higher rates and quantitative tightening on smaller countries around the world MARGARET BRENNAN: The World Bank and the IMF have been warning about this for a while. DIMON: Yes.\u00a0 And some say you got to put that whole mix in -what's happening in geopolitics, I would say that that's critical. And Ukraine is a turning point. You know, Ukraine is a turning point where, you know, maybe all this sort of self- illusion that we had that some how the world's at peace, and everything would be fine, that should have been shattered. And therefore we should be thinking about how can America do great in the next 100 years? What policies should we have? Obviously, it's a change. And you know, I hold our military in the highest regard. But what they accomplish around the world is extraordinary. But what do we need, and part is just having a very strong economy, which helps pay for all this, and it has to be done with our allies, otherwise, you're not going to end up with the world that we really want. MARGARET BRENNAN: When I looked at your last shareholder letter, which I know you take a direct role in writing DIMON: Word -I write every word.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that was April so- \u00a0 DIMON: I get help, but I write every word. MARGARET BRENNAN: You, everyone, everyone goes through a process and thinking through these things, and when you ranked some of the things worrying you, Ukraine was right up there- DIMON: Yeah MARGARET BRENNAN: with all the domestic issues. That was right after the war started.\u00a0 DIMON: Yeah MARGARET BRENNAN: And now we're at a point where some would look and say, okay, it wasn't the worst case scenario in Europe in terms of severe recession. They're finding ways to get oil and gas elsewhere. Do you think in the same way now, as you did- DIMON: Absolutely\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: -then in terms of risk? DIMON: I think even more so.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Really? DIMON: That's a false sense of security that you've had this war going on, you know, for nine months or whatever, and that somehow it's okay. Oil prices went way up. Europe's going through a recession. Migration has been extraordinary. You haven't seen the full effect of food prices around the world. If you go to Europe, they- they would - they're taking this much more seriously than Americans are. They're on the front line, you had those missiles going to Poland. You have, basically nuclear blackmail. I mean, it is as serious as you can get. So we should all hope it goes away, that there's some kind of armistice or settlement. You know, that's good for Ukraine, by the way. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 DIMON: But this is, this is the Western world under attack. I mean, this is to take it - anything like that. And wars, if you read the history of wars, they don't start, they don't end the way people think they would when they started. MARGARET BRENNAN: No DIMON: So that's like every war. And so the danger of this war is extraordinary. And it can go on for years. But this oil and gas thing, it looks like they're, you know, the Europeans will get through it this winter. But this oil and gas problem is going to go on for years. So I, you know, if I was, you know, in the government or anywhere else, I'd say, I have to prepare for getting much worse. I hope it doesn't. But I would definitely be preparing for it to get much worse. MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that look like to you in terms of what should be prepared for on the energy front?\u00a0 DIMON: Well I-\u00a0 I was - so it's multiple things. On the energy front, we need secure, reliable, cheap oil and gas. The problem, you know, a lot of people think that oil and gas prices being high is good for CO2. It's not.\u00a0 So cheap, reliable - you're looking to Germany, I mean, the Europeans are terrified. Their - their energy prices are 2, 3, 4, 5 times ours, which is hurting consumers, which the governments have to do something about, and it's hurting businesses. You know, and, and, and it's just started. And so the pain and suffering could get a lot worse. So, and it has the benefit, lower prices have the benefit of having more production. Okay. They have the benefit of helping poor nations, lower income individuals, our allies who are desperate for more secure energy, and CO2, because quite predictably- MARGARET BRENNAN: Carbon emissions.\u00a0 DIMON: Carbon emissions\u00a0 - because quite predictably carbon emissions are going up, because nations rich and poor around the world are turning on -back on their coal plants. They cannot afford expensive energy, and they can't afford no energy. So you know to me - to solve climate, we kind of need all the above, permitting, plants, gas is the best and cleanest way to reduce coal, which is the best way to reduce CO2. So we are really thoughtful policy, confident the policy would get us there. But it also is military policy, economic policy, including trade. So when I say economic, I'm talking about you know trade is one thing, but economic is investment rights. So anything that relates to national security will have to be changed -\u00a0 like you know about semiconductor, rare earths -\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to ask you all about that. Yeah.\u00a0 JAMIE DIMON: And OK so that'll if you ask me later, I'll wait. But those are all things that have to be fixed. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Let's button up on economy -\u00a0 on energy, though, because, you know, President Biden has called it Putin - Putin's price spike. But he's also blamed price inflation on corporate profits. And I know this irritates you.\u00a0 DIMON: Yeah MARGARET BRENNAN: You've argued energy costs are not high because of price gouging, but because of the dramatic decline in investments in energy, which results in reduced supply when demand goes up. So if that's true, what is it going to take to increase lending to companies so they can make those investments?\u00a0 DIMON: Yeah\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: is that the choke point? DIMON: Yeah, this is it's a little more complicated now because part of it is that companies don't want to do it.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? DIMON: Well, part, part of that, but when people talk about excise profit tax. That's one, they can't get permits done, they can't get leasing and stuff like that. And part of is their investors are putting a lot of pressure on them, you know, that - MARGARET BRENNAN: To go green? DIMON: To go green, but not to invest too much capital, where you're not making a profit with oil at a high price. You know, it's not enough. Like that. And so, so it is that so there are think of- It's a global problem, America produces 10 million barrels a day, the world consumes 100 million. And so, and the other thing we have to remember about oil, which is really important, that it goes up and down for a million different reasons. And people tend to look at one reason and say that's it. But right now, it's come down considerably, mostly because China's slowdown, and Europe's going into recession. And then people think there might be a world recession. So the future price of oil is going down. Those things will reverse. And this underinvestment in oil and gas it will hurt you two or three years out. It's quite predictable, but it's not today. And so we have time, you know, I'm hoping the administration, you know, they're looking at all these issues. I've spoken to John Podesta who now runs the the IRA act about what we can do to accelerate, reduce CO2, but have better, cheaper, more secure energy, not just for us, but for particular allies around the world.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So America set for record oil production in 2023. But it's like the refinery capacity turning into something usable, where that's kind of a choke point. So is the administration making it difficult for that specific kind of investment? DIMON: I think you'd have to talk to the oil, the oil folks about that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. DIMON: Look, this world is really complex. I mean, if you don't have the pipelines, you can't have the refinery. If you can't do this, you can't do that. If you don't have the charging stations, you can't do this. If you build EV cars, but it's still coal, coal powered electricity, you're not accomplishing CO2. So I think I just think, We need to really look at this in detail. And hopefully a lot of smart people working on it. I think it's important. We are spending a lot of time on it, because of how critical energy is to the world. And remember, it's 40% of food prices, too. So, so this is not a simple matter. And it's, you know, for food prices, the question is starvation.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right DIMON: So this isn't a question of how far you can drive your car, how much your gas costs? So I put this whole, I think we need to call a Marshall Plan for energy, you know, and that's got to be all the above, and all the people involved. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the IRA, you refer to the Inflation Reduction Act, that's just a sliver of what you're imagining for a Marshall Plan of Energy. DIMON: And that is, that is a huge I mean, we're still studying every piece of it for renewables and EVs and a lot of different things. But it's not just that. It's the infrastructure we're building. It's- it's competition around the world, it's access to rare earths. I mean, when you dig into it as a really complex thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are the ingredients needed for electric vehicles- DIMON: Exactly MARGARET BRENNAN: that China has a monopoly on right now, DIMON: They have a monopoly in production, not on where it is. So we have rare earths in America MARGARET BRENNAN: Right DIMON: whether we can produce them here or not, because of certain laws and requirements, that's a different issue. We need to build grids, you know, we don't get permissions to- permits to build- build grids. So, you know, one of the deals that was done between the president and Joe Manchin was the permitting bill, that permitting bill is for pipelines, we need to get gas to Louisiana, to get that get Louisiana gas to Europe to help our allies and reduce the costs there. That also reduces their coal usage. So it's very green, if you look at on the margin. And so it gets- it gets very complicated, and we just need to do the work. MARGARET BRENNAN: How would you- I mean, I remember covering financial crisis and all this and the frustration between Wall Street and Washington that they just kind of spoke past each other all the time. Where do you put that conversation now? Are people here hearing what you're trying to explain in terms of market dynamics and investment? DIMON: So I think it's sometimes justifiable when people talk across each other because damage was done, there was damage done in the financial crisis, not all the big banks would have failed. And not everyone is equally guilty and all that, but, and then, of course, things, people have simple political slogans- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right DIMON: that you know, get elected or something. But I think there's a lot of talk, we talk all the time to the Biden administration and multiple levels. And we should, you know, I'm going to help any president to try to do the best job for America. And those conversations are pretty intense. So Peter talks to them, I talked to them, they come to the BRT, which you saw a part of. And so it's very important, we do it. And you will be you're not always going to get your way. And there's going to be disagreements, but that's okay, too. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. And I know you speak, you speak plainly, which you are known for doing. I want to ask you about China. It looks like they are loosening some of their COVID restrictions, maybe moving away from COVID Zero. How do you see this impacting in the long and short term? DIMON: So my own view, and again, they they kind of have to do that. You see the political unrest, and you also see the damage doing to their economy. So they may - they announced like yesterday - ten different things. It sounds good- I just read them quick this morning. They sound good to me. I think they want to get their economy going. Again, that's a function of capital, COVID, laws, trade and things like that. And they've just started to have real conversations, or they said they're going to with the Biden administration. The most important thing about China in America, we actually talk that we actually get engaged at a detailed level of what we agree where we disagree, and try to resolve these things and also work on some of the things we got to do together climate, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, bioterrorism, and it's in all our interests to fix those problems. And you can't do without America in China. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not just the second largest economy in the world. Our countries are incredibly intertwined. DIMON: They're incredibly intertwined. But you, what you really need is American leadership to do this. And to bring our allies in. If we do adjust bilaterally, it will not work, if we- because the Chinese will go negotiate separate better deals with you know, God knows how many different countries so we need to do it kind of in combination with allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the US and China are in direct competition and the chances of conflict are arising on the national security front. The former Goldman Sachs CEO and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. I know you know him, has warned the two economies are just too intertwined to separate at this point. How do you think about that, and the increased conversation about trying to find separate supply chains and weaning ourselves off of, of cheap Chinese manufacturing. DIMON: So number one, I'm a patriot. And national security is paramount, absolutely national security, American national security, I'm going to leave Taiwan aside, I'll leave that to the experts and that kind of thing. And then most importantly, for the American public, we have the most prosperous kind of the world's ever seen. If we open our doors to people, millions, billions of people come here, we have the best innovation, we've got food, water and energy, we're in extraordinary good shape. And we shouldn't be shy about that or afraid or panicked or anything like that. DIMON: What we need is tough negotiations. And you've already missed on national security, that's going to be about semiconductors, rare earth, penicillins. You know, that's, that's a unilateral. The Chinese do that, we do it. Most businesses support it, that gets very complicated into an export controls and investment controls. But basically, the government's working with people like us, a lot of other companies- but how do you implement something like that, that's that that is good for national security, but doesn't diminish American business doing well overseas. MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. \u00a0 DIMON: Because it could do that. And again, it gets very specific. The other two trade things are not as important okay. One is, you know, every company wants to have a reliable, secure line, you know, supply chain, some people already moving their stuff, you can move some stuff to Mexico, you can move it to India, etc. So that's already taking place. And then the third one is called is how we all look at competition, unfair competition, state controlled competition. And again, that also needs to be done with allies. Because, you know, if I was just all around Latin America, and they say to me, Hey, you know, we actually love America. But China's here with money, technology, they're making a cheaper, and what's my alternative, Americans got to have alternatives. Some of that will turn out to be that we need better development, finance, better diplomacy, we need better rules around how banks or companies could go down and invest in foreign countries to do things that make sense. So it's comprehensive, the government's fully aware of it, it's doable, it's going to take work and take time. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, you're\u00a0 just saying the State Department and those other sort of softer bits of diplomacy need to be beefed up. DIMON: Immediately.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Immediately.\u00a0 DIMON: Immediately, and diplomacy, I say development finance\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. DIMON: Because, you know, if the Chinese are gonna go there and build a bridge or build a plant or buy the lithium mine. And you're gonna have American companies who would, could but don't for a whole bunch of different reasons, you should ask the question why. And I don't want to go through all the different reasons. But there are reasons American companies don't go to certain countries. And so we- It could all be done. And I think, you know, we're rolling up our sleeves. It should never have gotten this far, it did. I don't want to cry over spilled milk. But, and the other thing too, remember is, America could do a lot of things unilaterally. You know\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Like what? DIMON: Well, if we don't- if we don't think they're being fair on X, you know, we- think of it as trade. If I can't sell there, you can sell here, if I can't invest in 100% [unintelligible] you can't invest in 100% there. There's a reciprocal behavior\u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So does tariffs stay on?\u00a0 DIMON: You know, I look, I think, I think it was the right thing to focus on China years ago. I think that was the wrong way to go about it. But they're not going to come down until it's negotiated as part of something else. Don't (crosstalk), maybe areas which should come down right away, just to help certain producers and certain consumers.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You referenced some of the domestic\u2013 DIMON: We like we have to go back to like TPP, we have to stop thinking about trade\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: free trade within Asia\u2013 DIMON: Negotiated trade. I mean, obviously, we shouldn't sign the deal that's not in the interest United States of America. But think of it\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: But no one is going back to TPP.\u00a0 DIMON: No, but we're making a mistake\u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013it was politically toxic.\u00a0 DIMON: I know. But I don't know what that means. Because we have a trade policy with Asia, it's functioning today, make it better. The notion that says we're not gonna have a trade deal is a mistake, because we have one today, that one would have been better. And we just got to change how we- and there's also strategic- in this case it's also geopolitically strategic. Think of real politic here, this would have been better, an American and Asia trading system that is set up the right way that we think has the right rules, requirements, laws, governance, etc. And then China could be invited in. It's not against China. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when you talk about and you reference their investment in semiconductors, here, electric vehicles, that kind of thing, that's part of the Biden administration's domestic economic revitalization, but it is national security policy as well. DIMON: Yeah, it's a little both, we kind of mixed them up, mix-and-match them a little bit. MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. But there are some critics who say that that's causing a little bit of market distortion there. DIMON: It does, I think, look, you know, this stuff gets complicated and remember it gets written by Congress and\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. DIMON: \u2013so the body is pretty good. But it has really irritated the Europeans, because it's buy America build America, it's a huge disadvantage for you know, a part of the world we need really very good relations with. When when people complain, the first thing you always do is to say, 'were they right?' And they're right about some of it, not all of it. And you know, the President did say we can tweak and modify it and\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: The electric vehicles and things like that\u2013\u00a0 DIMON: \u2013and I think that can be done. But here's the really important part of this. It's not just that. If Europe goes its own way and trade and they said they're gonna do their own IRA bill. Either their own trade bloc buy America- buy Europe build Europe, that is very bad for the global negotiates of trade. That is very bad for national security. That is very bad for the next century of America. And that's why I think this - is a it doesn't sound like it is. But it's absolutely critical for national security, we get this one, right. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm not at all disagreeing with you. I want to ask you, though about like, the way foreign policy is exercised right now. With Russia, for example, it was financial warfare at first. Yeah, that's the direct hit the United States is taking on Russia. And I wonder how you think that was handled? DIMON: I thought it was handled extremely well, actually, I think there have been occasions where we overdid our financial sanctions and using it because you don't want to say I don't want to do business with American banks, or American entities or stuff like that. It has been a little misuse, but there are times it's properly used. So here's both the Europeans and the American authorities, you know, the Treasury Department here, who said, this is a way to part of our big geopolitical war, helping Ukraine. And they were right. And it was both sanctions and export controls and things like that. And I think they did it the right way. There's constant communication. I mean, if I say commun- like every day about how you effectuate these things, and which ones work and which ones don't work, and how Swift was going to work, and all these various things, but But it's been quite good. I think they were very much right to do it in this case. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you couldn't do this with China, could you because the economies are too intertwined. DIMON: You couldn't well, you if you had to you could, but that would, that's a whole, the economic effect in China and the world would be dramatically worse, no one would benefit from that. And by whatever it is, it'd probably be worse for China than for us. Because like I said, we have all the food, water and energy we need. We have peace in North America here. China, the American public may not know, China imports 11 million barrels of oil a day. They're not sitting there saying how comfortable they are. They're sitting there saying how vulnerable they might be. So you got to, if you're going to look at China, look at the whole thing. Take a deep breath, and figure out what's in our interests and then go negotiate. And like I said, a lot of it can be done unilaterally, it has to be done multilaterally, like with our allies. MARGARET BRENNAN: You had said in this country, you were happy about the midterm results. I mean, the old adage was like gridlock is good for Wall Street. But when you're talking about very large challenges to the country, that are left unaddressed, that seems to be a risk. DIMON: I didn't. I didn't say anything about gridlock.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I'm saying that.\u00a0 DIMON: (Crosstalk) I thought it\u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that what we're going to get with a split Congress\u2013 JAMIE DIMON: \u2013I thought the election was good. Because on both parties the kind of the- the wing nuts didn't get elected. And there, so the rational thing, when I was just in Congress, I was gratified by their thought they want to make progress. And I think they can make progress. There are a lot of examples in history, under George W. Bush, Obama, Clinton, where when he had divided Congress actually got a lot of good things done\u2013\u00a0 (Crosstalk)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've got really thin margins\u2013 JAMIE DIMON: \u2013and I would prefer to see collaboration and getting good stuff done. And so I think\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: You're staying optimistic about that. DIMON: Yeah, I think there's a good chance they will get some good things done. MARGARET BRENNAN: So so we're days away from this government funding deadline. And Congress is gonna have to pass the bill to avoid a shutdown. As a risk manager, where do you put the risk level here? DIMON: Well funding is different than debt ceiling. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know.\u00a0 DIMON: Okay.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But the risk is once power shifts come January that it could become a bigger problem. DIMON: (Crosstalk) Yeah, I would say government funding is not the way to\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Could be used as leverage.\u00a0 DIMON: It's not the way to run a railroad. I mean, basically you end up spending much more money too because the American public may not know, you pay people and the you pay them more to come back to work. It costs us much more money. So even if you want to be fiscally responsible is not a good idea. The debt ceiling is, you talk about, June of next year, and we'll deal with that later. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, there's some debate about whether it should be done now in these last few weeks while Democrats still have control to avoid that kind of showdown. DIMON: As they should because the catastrophic effects of an- of an actual default, not the debates I understand both sides why we want it, how they want to use it is, that's catastrophic, or potentially catastrophic. I would never take that risk. So for me, yes, I'd get it done now. Take- take it off the table. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you said back in 2019, on CNBC, my heart is Democratic, but my brain is kind of Republican. The world's changed a lot since 2019. I wonder what what you are thinking right now. DIMON: I'm kind of in the same place. And I look, I think we are our brother's keeper, we take care of ourselves. We do community branches, and I want my employees to feel great, and I want customers to be happy. And I just think we need rational policy, you know, really rational policy and that a lot of that policy is not Democrat or Republican. Getting proper infrastructure built is not Democrat or Republican. We should all acknowledge that inner city schools don't work particularly well, in a lot of areas. Half the kids don't graduate. That's not Democrat or Republican. That's acknowledging the problem. And then talking about solutions. Health care, we have the best in the world. Hell, I'm a beneficiary of it. But we also have some of the worst. Trust- almost 20% of GDP, 50 million people uninsured, huge obesity, high blood pressure, things- a lot of things which are fixable, and I can go on and on and we need good policy. You know, good. And no policy is sometimes bad policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: You referenced, you're the beneficiary of the health system. You had this near death experience.\u00a0 DIMON: Yep.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: How has that changed how you view your work right now? And I wonder if it's changed whether you have any desire to enter government. DIMON: Now I'm- I don't play golf. You know, it's I basically, I still love what I do. I love helping people. I love the people here. I have, I'm so proud of them sometimes. And so that hasn't changed my view, I'm I want to do things. I'm always going to do something. I'm not going to go smell the flowers and stuff like that. I'm not sure sure. I'm suited for government. I want to help my country. I'll do anything I can help my country. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it sounds like you've got a lot of ideas to do that.\u00a0 DIMON: And we have a lot of ideas.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that aired Sunday, January 9, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Since the 2020 elections, Georgia has become ground zero in the fight over election integrity. The state's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger joins us now from Atlanta. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.\u00a0 GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE BRAD RAFFENSPERGER: Good morning.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to remind our audience, you became known nationally in the wake of that election because you refused to succumb to pressure from President Trump when he specifically asked you to quote, \"find 11,780 votes.\" President Biden, of course, won that state by 11,779 votes. Now you're up for re-election and you are being primaried by a Republican congressman who objected to even certifying the president's victory. I wonder, do you fear that in the future, Republican officials in your state may try to change the outcome of an upcoming election for purely political purposes? RAFFENSPERGER: Well, the person I'm running against, Congressman Hice, he's been in Congress for several years. He's never done a single piece of election reform legislation. Then he certified his own race with those same machines, the same ballots. And yet for President Trump, he said, you couldn't trust that that's a double minded person. And as a pastor, he should know better. So, I'm going to run on integrity and I'm going to run on the truth. I don't know what he's going to run on. MARGARET BRENNAN: But to that point is the level of what's at stake here, the possibility that an election outcome in your state could be manipulated. RAFFENSPERGER: The laws that we have in place, there have been concerns raised, but no. The results will be the results, and those will be the results that will be certified. You cannot overturn the will of the people and so that won't matter. But at the end of the day, I will be reelected, and he will not be. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about something that the former president claimed this week, which once again he says there was fraud in Georgia. He said people were being paid $10 for their ballots. I know that asking a third party to drop off your absentee ballot, something called ballot harvesting, is illegal in the state of Georgia. But I wonder, has there been any evidence that any of those ballots were actually fraudulent or cast by ineligible voters? RAFFENSPERGER: It is an ongoing investigation; what I can tell you is that we just got that information over Nov. 2021, a year after- over a year after the election, so I'd like- we'd like to wish we would have gotten a whole lot sooner, but we've opened up an investigation. But no one has alleged that those are fraudulent ballots. Those were lawful voters. And the allegation is that then they were collected and delivered by a person. But that's one thing that I do think we need is to make sure that nationwide there should be a law that bans, you know, ballot harvesting. I don't think that ballot harvesting is good. The only person I should touch your ballot is you, and the election official. So, I think that's one a solid election reform measure. Number two, I think that we should have a constitutional amendment, a U.S. constitution amendment that only American citizens vote in our elections. I think we should have also photo of I.D.. We now have a photo I.D. for all forms of voting in Georgia-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Only U.S. citizens do currently vote in elections but go on. RAFFENSPERGER: But we don't have a constitutional amendment. Now you see cities are trying to push noncitizen voting, and I believe that only American citizens should be voting in our elections, that is supported by a wide variety- a wide majority of all Americans, just like photo I.D. supported by all demographic groups and a majority of both political parties. And that's what they've been using in Minnesota for over 11 years for their absentee balloting. So that's another, you know, solid common sense federal reform measure if they really want to get serious about election reform. MARGARET BRENNAN: I assume there you're referring to the President and the Vice President will be traveling to your state in the coming days. They are doing so to campaign for two laws: the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.\u00a0 RAFFENSPERGER: Right, and\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: The Freedom to Vote Act actually does promote a national standard for states that have an ID requirement for in-person voting. You could use a bank statement or utility bill. I wonder, why do you think Republicans\u2013 RAFFENSPERGER: It does not have- it does not have photo I.D. and photo I.D. is the most secure way of using and making sure that you can identify who the voter is, and I think that's very important. And then they also want same day registration, and that's just, you know, very difficult for any election official to manage. And I think that undermines trust in elections. And right now, we need to restore trust wherever we can. In Georgia, we've been fighting this- this theme of, you know, stolen election claims from Stacey Abrams about voter suppression, and then 2020 was about voter fraud; both of them undermine voter trust. MARGARET BRENNAN: They may both undermine voter trust, but I'm sure you draw a distinction between someone who doesn't hold any kind of office and the president of the United States actively putting pressure on you to find and manufacture votes. They're not equivalent. RAFFENSPERGER: Jan. 6 was terrible, but the response doesn't need to be eliminating photo ID and then having same day registration. And if you don't have the appropriate guardrails in place, then- then you're not going to have voter confidence in the results. In Georgia, we've actually increased the number of days of early voting. We have more early voting now than New York, New Jersey and Delaware. MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I understand. But when you were talking about Stacey Abrams, I was just acknowledging that there is a difference that she didn't call on people to attack the State Capitol when she was questioning the outcome of the 2018 gubernatorial race. RAFFENSPERGER: The president is the top, you know, official that we have in our country and that obviously that positional power is just much higher than a candidate running for governor. But be that as it may, when people lose races, I think the proper thing to do is admit that you lose. And if you want to run again, by all means do so. MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Georgia has a painful past with racial discrimination. And until 2013, states like Georgia had to seek some federal preclearance when it came to changing their election laws. I won't get into the details of all of it, but this is one of the provisions that the White House says is so important in the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Do you see any merit in the idea that there needs to be more federal oversight in states that have a history of racial discrimination? RAFFENSPERGER: Georgia has moved so far ahead, we're not where we were in 1965. And you look at we have more early voting than all these\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: But this was in place until 2013? RAFFENSPERGER: I know, and I think that we have shown that Georgia has fair and honest elections. We have record registrations. We have record turnout. Anyone that wants to vote in Georgia has tremendous opportunities to vote early, vote with no excuse absentee voting with photo I.D., and then also show up on Election Day. And I'll compare our record against the other states. In fact, we were just recognized by Heritage as the number one state for election integrity. RAFFENSPERGER: Well by heritage. And I think the public will hear a different version when they- the President goes to your state. And that's why we want to talk to you today. Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Senators returned to the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday to charge ahead with consideration of voting rights legislation, even in the face of opposition from Republicans that is expected to tank the effort and roadblocks from a pair of moderate Democrats. The Senate convened to begin debate on a package approved by the House last week that combined the two voting rights bills, the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer last week adjusted Democrats' strategy for taking up the voting rights legislation, using existing rules to force debate on the package with support from just a majority of senators. \"When this chamber confronts a question this important, one so vital to our country, so vital to our ideals, so vital to the future of our democracy, you don't slide it off the table and say nevermind. Win, lose or draw, members of this chamber were elected to debate and to vote, especially on an issue as vital to the beating heart of our democracy as voting rights,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"The public is entitled to know where each senator stands on an issue a sacrosanct as defending our democracy.\" While Schumer has said the move requires Republicans to go on-the-record with their opposition to the package, GOP senators are expected to block the legislation from advancing to a final vote, as advancing it requires 60 votes in the evenly divided chamber. Democrats then plan to move to consider changes to Senate rules, which would allow them to push legislation through without relying on Republican backing, relying just on a simple majority.\u00a0 On Tuesday evening, Schumer told reporters that if Republicans block the measure from advancing, \"I will put forward a proposal to change the rules to allow for a talking filibuster on this legislation,\" with a simple majority of 50 for passage, including Vice President Harris.\u00a0 Currently, filibusters are \"silent,\" that is the minority party just threatens to filibuster, and the majority leader doesn't bring legislation to the floor because it will not have the 60 votes necessary to proceed. A \"talking\" filibuster means that senators who want to stop a bill from receiving a vote must speak on the Senate floor to draw out the debate process. He said of Republican senators, \"They should not be allowed to sit in their office, they've got to come down on the floor and defend their opposition to voting rights, the wellspring of our democracy.\"\u00a0 This rule change, if it were to pass, would only be in effect for the voting rights measure. It would also require all 50 Democrats to support it, since there is no Republican support for the rule change. Because two moderate Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, oppose altering the filibuster, the Democrats are expected to fall short. The forthcoming Senate action on voting rights legislation comes after President Biden last week ramped up the pressure on Congress to send to his desk the legislation that would overhaul the nation's voting laws. The Freedom to Vote Act would establish national election standards, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would reinstate a core provision of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of racial discrimination in voting to get approval from the Justice Department before changing their election policies. In a forceful speech in Atlanta, the president threw his support behind eliminating the filibuster to push the voting rights legislation through the Senate, where its 50-50 margins have complicated Democrats' efforts to enact key pillars of Mr. Biden's domestic policy agenda. The president appeared before Senate Democrats on Capitol Hill on Thursday to continue lobbying them to overhaul Senate rules to allow passage of the voting rights measures, but acknowledged the effort could be doomed. \"I don't know that we can get it done, but I know one thing: As long as I have a breath in me, as long as I'm in the White House, as long as I'm engaged at all, I'm going to be fighting to change the way these legislatures have moving,\" he told reporters after his meeting with the Senate Democratic caucus. Just before Mr. Biden met with Senate Democrats, Sinema delivered a Senate floor speech in which she noted her support for the voting rights bills but reiterated her opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which she said would \"worsen the underlying disease of division afflicting our country.\" Democrats, though, have criticized Sinema and Manchin for stymying their efforts to preserve ballot access and counter changes to elections procedures being pushed by Republicans at the state level.\u00a0 \"I know that these two Democrats have decided that it is much more important to them to protect the voting rights of the minority on the Senate floor than to protect the voting rights of minorities in this great country of ours, this great country, the minorities that made it possible for them to be in the position that they're currently in,\" Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"I hope, but I don't think that we will change their mind. But we will see.\" Asked Monday about her message to the pair, Vice President Kamala Harris told reporters she is \"not going to absolve \u2014 nor should any of us absolve \u2014 any member of the United States Senate from taking on a responsibility to follow through on the oath that they all took to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" While the Democratic-led House has passed legislation to reform voting and elections procedures, Republicans in the Senate have on four different occasions blocked the bills from advancing in the upper chamber, where 60 votes are typically needed to begin debate on a measure.\u00a0 That opposition laid the groundwork for Schumer to pursue the strategy in which the Senate would debate the House-passed measure despite the expected Republican blockade to end debate and move to final passage.\u00a0 Republicans have criticized the legislation as a federal takeover of state-run elections, and some are instead pushing for the Senate to embrace changes to the Electoral Count Act, which they argue would get bipartisan backing.

            "article_content": "On this 56th Super Bowl Sunday, whether the Bengals or the Rams win, \"Sunday Morning\" senior contributor Ted Koppel finds real meaning in the final score: \"The Buffalo Bills take the lead with 1:54 to go in the fourth quarter!\" You'll find Jake Varcoe and his \"Bills Bunker\" on YouTube.\u00a0 Varcoe is a sports reporter with a passionate bias. What he provides, that's sometimes missing among professional sports commentators, is a front-row perspective on the thrill of victory \u2026 and the agony of defeat.  Three weeks ago, in a magnificent playoff game between the Buffalo Bills and the Kansas City Chiefs, with Buffalo up by three, Varcoe had every reason to believe that his beloved Bills were one game away from the Super Bowl. \"What a game this has been! Three lead changes in the last two minutes of the game!\" But \u2026. \"The Chiefs still have an opportunity. They're at field goal range with that one.\"  In the immortal words of Yogi Berra, \"It ain't over 'til its over.\" And it wasn't. The game went to overtime.  In overtime, if your team gets the ball first and scores \u2013 not just any score, it has to be a touchdown \u2013 you win. So, getting the ball first can be a big deal. That is decided by the flip of a coin. \"(Sighs) And the Bills lose the coin toss. If you can get that coin flip, you're going to win.\" It isn't quite that simple, but Varcoe is right: The odds favor the team that gets the ball first. The Chiefs got the ball. The Chiefs won. \"I'm not a fan of the overtime rules in the NFL, but I'm not going to complain about them,\" Varcoe told his \"Bills Bunker\" audience. \"Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a hard-fought victory.\" Nice. Gracious. The quarterbacks showed class, too.\u00a0 Those young men demonstrated something that the country has all but forgotten: how to win with dignity and lose with grace. Jason Gay, a sports columnist for the Wall Street Journal, said, \"In the days afterwards, there was this really compelling gesture from Chiefs fans. They made $13 donations to the charity set up by Josh Allen, the quarterback for the Bills.\" Chiefs fans made thousands of $13 donations (13 being the number of seconds it took the Chiefs to tie the game and send it to overtime).  \"This resulted in an amount of hundreds of thousands of dollars,\" said Gay. \"And it was really kind of a touching thing, when you consider how acrimonious that ending could have been.\" Koppel asked, \"Jason, I don't think it will come as any shock to you, if I tell that what I'm driving at is the question of whether our sports fans are capable of doing something that our political fans are incapable of doing?\" \"I think sports, mercifully, is one of the last places where we still have commonly-accepted facts,\" Gay replied. \"When the scoreboard says 30-27, we don't go around and say, 'It was 42-38!' And I think that is a significant difference between our athletic platforms and some of the other platforms in our lives.\" Condoleezza Rice, national security advisor and secretary of state in the George W. Bush administration, is a professor at Stanford \u2013 and an life-long, passionate football fan. She said, \"There is something about sports that I think kids learn pretty early on, which is maybe this time I won't win and you'll win. But maybe the next time if I work harder, I'll win. We all have to play by the rules and have the game be meaningful.\" For years, in fact, Dr. Rice let it be known that she really yearns to be commissioner of the National Football League. Not anymore.  \"As I've gotten older and wiser, I've started to think that maybe it's not that great a job after all,\" she said. \"I'll just stay a fan.\" Probably a wise decision. Between charges of racial discrimination and sexual harassment in the league, it's become a very tough job indeed.\u00a0 And sometimes, of course, those enforcing the rules get it wrong. And that lands in the commissioner's lap, too \u2013 as was the case three years ago, in another playoff game, between the New Orleans Saints and the Los Angeles Rams: Gay explains: \"We have a 20-20 game. Drew Brees lobs a pass to the sideline, and a Rams cornerback just completely takes out the Saints receiver.\" But there was no flag on the play. The official missed the call. The crowd went crazy. Gay said, \"So, this really egregious penalty, a penalty that you could rightfully argue kept the Saints from scoring and going on to the Super Bowl, just was allowed to happen.\" Saints fans made their opinions known: \"This is a travesty!\" \"Worst call ever!\" \"Cheatin' f****s!\" One particularly rabid Saints fan, James Carville (who sometimes also dabbles in Democratic Party politics), told Koppel, \"First of all, it was evident to anybody in the stands that our receiver was interfered with. \u2026 I was just aghast. I said, 'They're going to have to do something.'\" Koppel said, \"Now, the commissioner did apologize to the coach, didn't he?\" \"That's great!\" Carville laughed. \"If I run over your grandkid and I say, 'Gee, I feel terrible about it!' What else could he do? Of course, he had to apologize.\u00a0 \"Did anybody think of bringing a lawsuit?\" \"A lotta people,\" Carville replied. \"Some were filed.\" Indeed, one fan told a reporter, \"If we can find an attorney in the city of New Orleans worth his salt or her salt willing to take on the NFL, I'll put my house on the line.\" Carville said, \"I thought about being a plaintiff on one of 'em. But I have a lotta lawyer friends [who said], 'I'll be glad to file a suit. But you know, you're not gonna win.'\"  But ultimately, what happened? \"Nothing,\" Gay said. \"We're still in a situation where NFL games are very often left to subjective decisions by individuals on the field.\" And the fans had to sort of eat it.  Ultimately, though, in sports and in politics, there's a final authority, and an understanding, whether it's handed down by someone in a striped shirt or a black robe. Fair or unfair, for the good of the sport (and sometimes for the good of the nation), you live with it, as Al Gore did in the wake of a 5-4 Supreme Court decision that delivered the Presidency of the United States to George W. Bush: \"Let there be no doubt, while I strongly disagree with the court's decision, I accept it,\" Gore said on December 13, 2000. \"For the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.\" Rice said, \"That is how democracy has to work. It is really important that rule, that understanding, that I may not like the outcome, but I am going to respect the outcome. That's extremely important. Now, I will say there's something that's also forgotten a bit about 2000. There were people on the other side, some of them in Congress, who said, 'He's not really my president.' So, maybe that erosion started before we actually realized that it had started. We really have to get back the sense that our elections are the test of democracy, and that when they're over, we move on.\" So, are we comparing a bad call in a football game to the Supreme Court decision that cost Al Gore the presidency? Not even close. Although at some point, in football and in real life, in order for the system to function, you simply have to accept when there are no further appeals.\u00a0 Carville said, \"In spite of every fact, every court decision, 60 court decisions, six gajillion recounts \u2013 I'm talking about 2020, yeah \u2013 I don't know how many different recounts that all find the same thing, that there's no evidence or fact at all that anything other than minor discrepancies that happen in any election had an effect. And you have 35% of the country that just believes otherwise? They're not going to change. They're just not.\" We've seen where a refusal to accept that notion can lead ...  In a few hours, though, about a hundred million Americans will gather before their televisions to bear witness to one of the few remaining national events where accepting the final score as fact remains a widely-accepted practice. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Story produced by Dustin Stephens.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Tuesday announced his support for getting rid of the filibuster in the Senate to pass legislation that will overhaul the nation's voting laws and counter a raft of new changes pushed by Republicans at the state level.\u00a0 It's a moment progressives have been waiting for, even though the president has no technical power to change Senate rules. Mr. Biden urged lawmakers pass two laws: The Freedom to Vote Act, which would establish national election standards, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would reinstate a core provision of the Voting Rights Act \u2014  gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013 \u2014   that required states with a history of racial discrimination to seek Justice Department approval before changing their election rules. \"Sadly, the United States Senate, designed to be the world's greatest deliberative body, has been rendered a shell of its former self,\" Mr. Biden said, speaking in Atlanta on the grounds of Morehouse College and Clark Atlanta University. \"It gives me no satisfaction in saying that, as an institutionalist, as a man who was honored to serve in the Senate. But as an institutionalist, I believe the threat to democracy is so grave that we must find a way to pass these voting rights bills, debate them, vote, let the majority prevail,\" Mr. Biden said. \"And if that bare minimum is blocked, we have no option but to change the Senate rules, including getting rid of the filibuster for this.\" Now is the time for action, he said, and to support the legacy of the late John Lewis and Martin Luther King, Jr.\u00a0 \"I've been having these quiet conversations with members of Congress for the last two months. I'm tired of being quiet!\" the president exclaimed, slapping his hand on the lectern.\u00a0 Republicans in some states are trying to put up obstacles to vote because \"to them, too many people voting in a democracy is a problem,\" he claimed.\u00a0 \"The right to have that vote and to have that vote counted is democracy's threshold liberty,\" he said. \"Without it, nothing is possible. But with it, anything is possible. But while the denial of fair and free elections is undemocratic, it is not unprecedented.\" Vice President Kamala Harris urged Americans not to normalize making it more difficult to vote.\u00a0 \"Over the past few years, we have seen so many anti-voter laws that there is a danger of becoming accustomed to these laws,\" Harris said in her remarks. \"A danger of adjusting to these laws as though they are normal. A danger of being complacent. Complicit. Anti-voter laws are not new in our nation, but we must not be deceived into thinking they are normal.\" Asked by reporters in Georgia ahead of his speech if he has the votes, the president responded, \"Keep the faith.\"\u00a0 Traveling with Mr. Biden in Georgia were Senator Raphael Warnock and members of the state's congressional delegation, as well as former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Absent from the president's speech, though, was Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, which Mr. Biden said before departing the White House is because of a scheduling mix-up. The president told reporters the two are on the \"same page,\" and Abrams took to Twitter on Monday to applaud Mr. Biden for his visit and speech, thanking him for \"for refusing to relent until the work is finished.\" The speech from the president is viewed by the White House as an extension of his condemnations of the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol during remarks marking its one-year anniversary. The president used his fiery speech\u00a0last week to pledge he would \"allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of our democracy.\" Mr. Biden's visit and address in Atlanta is also aimed at the Senate, where Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he will soon bring the voting rights legislation to the floor despite expected unanimous opposition by Senate Republicans. If Republicans filibuster the bills as expected, denying Democrats the 60 votes they need to advance legislation in the 50-50 Senate, Schumer has pledged to bring forward changes to the Senate rules that would lower the threshold for the measures to advance in the upper chamber with a simple majority. \"If Republicans refuse to join us in a bipartisan spirit \u2014 if they continue to hijack the rules of the Senate to turn this chamber into a deep freezer \u2014 we are going to consider the appropriate steps necessary to restore the Senate, so we can pass these proposals and send them to the president's desk,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor Monday. During a press conference Tuesday, the New York Democrat told reporters he is\"exploring a variety of different changes\" to Senate rules. But Schumer still faces an uphill battle to changing Senate rules that would make it easier for voting rights legislation to clear. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, both moderate Democrats, generally oppose changing the chamber's rules. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, accused Schumer of mounting \"an attempt to attack the core identity of the Senate.\" McConnell also accused Democratic leaders of \"trying to use a big lie to bully and berate their own members into breaking their word, breaking the rules, and breaking the Senate.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "President Biden will meet with Senate Democrats during their regular caucus lunch Thursday, following his speech Tuesday on voting rights in which he voiced support for eliminating the filibuster to pass two bills aimed at increasing voter access.\u00a0 A White House official said both the president and Vice President Kamala Harris will be working the phones over the next several days to try to push senators to support the two key voting bills and changes to Senate rules. The official said the president will meet with Democrats to discuss the \"urgent need to pass legislation to protect the constitutional right to vote.\"\u00a0 Persuading moderate Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to change the Senate rules will be the tallest hurdle for the president and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Democrats want to eliminate the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation, to pass two laws: The Freedom to Vote Act, which would establish national election standards, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would reinstate a core provision of the Voting Rights Act \u2014 gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013 \u2014 that required states with a history of racial discrimination to seek Justice Department approval before changing their election rules.   Schumer set a deadline of Monday, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, for the Senate to either pass voting rights bills or consider making changes to the chamber's rules. In a memo to Senate Democrats sent Wednesday that was obtained by CBS News, the New York Democrat laid out a new strategy for taking up the measures and said the Senate would begin consideration of them \"in the coming days.\" Under the plan detailed by Schumer, the Senate will use existing rules to force debate on the voting rights legislation by using a shell bill originating in the House as the vehicle for the two voting rights measures. Once the revised bill clears the House, it would move on to the Senate, where support from a majority of senators would be needed to begin debate, according to Schumer's memo. The majority leader said the strategy \"sets up a process in which senators can finally make clear to the American people where they stand on protecting our democracy and preserving the right of every eligible American to cast a ballot.\" \"With this procedure, we will finally have an opportunity to debate voting rights legislation \u2013 something that Republicans have thus far denied,\" he said. Schumer acknowledged 10 Republican senators would still need to join all 50 Democrats to end debate on the bills and pass them, which is unlikely. The Senate would then need to change the Senate rules if GOP members block the legislation from advancing, he said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has accused Schumer of trying to \"attack the core identity of the Senate,\" and says he didn't recognize Mr. Biden in the speech he delivered Tuesday. Sinema's office said Wednesday the Arizona senator remains in \"regular discussions and meetings\" with her colleagues, including with a small group of Senate Democrats Tuesday night. Still, her office reiterated her position remains unchanged.\u00a0 \"Senator Sinema strongly supports and has voted for the For The People Act, John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, and the Freedom to Vote Act -- and will continue to support such efforts, because she believes that the right to vote and faith in our electoral process are critical to the health of our democracy,\" Sinema's office said in a statement. \"As she has throughout her time in the U.S. House and Senate, Senator Sinema also continues to support the Senate's 60-vote threshold, to protect the country from repeated radical reversals in federal policy which would cement uncertainty, deepen divisions, and further erode Americans' confidence in our government.\" Mr. Biden and Democrats in the Senate have moved on to voting access, as their efforts to pass a sweeping social spending bill faltered in December. They say they still intend to pass the agenda, even with the midterm elections rapidly approaching. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" Sunday she believes a deal can still be reached with Manchin on the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better bill.\u00a0 \u2014 CBS News' Melissa Quinn and Nikole Killion contributed to this report.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Senate Republicans blocked Democrats from moving forward on voting rights legislation, and Democrats failed to get 50 votes to change the Senate rules to move forward with the legislation with a simple majority.\u00a0 The dramatic night started with the Senate first voting on whether to end debate on the voting rights legislation, a move that failed to get the 60 votes needed to move the bill forward. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer then brought up a vote on a rules change to move the legislation forward with a one-time exemption, which was fiercely opposed by Republicans and two members of his own party, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema.\u00a0 Democrats' frustration with Manchin and Sinema was apparent, with Senator Bernie Sanders saying after the vote that Manchin and Sinema have \"forced us to go through five months of discussions which have gotten absolutely nowhere.\"\u00a0 President Joe Biden issued a statement after the votes, saying he was \"profoundly disappointed\" in the outcome, although he did not place blame on fellow Democrats. \"I am disappointed \u2014 but I am not deterred,\" Mr. Biden said. \"My Administration will never stop fighting to ensure that the heart and soul of our democracy \u2014 the right to vote \u2014 is protected at all costs. We will continue to work with allies to advance necessary legislation to protect the right to vote. And to push for Senate procedural changes that will protect the fundamental right to vote.\" Mr. Biden said Vice President Kamala Harris will continue to lead the effort to pass voting rights legislation. After the voting rights bill failed to advance, Harris said in a statement that \"Senators voted to preserve an arcane Senate procedure rather than secure that fundamental freedom. The American people will not forget this moment. Neither will history.\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said it was \"perhaps the most important day in the history of the Senate\" and said that if the Democrats' succeed, they would \"break\" the Senate. \"Tonight for the first time in history almost an entire political party will write in permanent ink that they would shatter the soul of the Senate for short term power,\" McConnell said. Schumer, who changed his vote on voting rights legislation to allow the bills to be reconsidered, needed 51 votes to move forward on the rules. At one point, Manchin asked if the vote could proceed without the rule change, which was denied.\u00a0 Ahead of the rules change vote to amend the filibuster, Schumer called the proposal \"very simple.\" \"Tonight let us sidestep voting rights no more,\" Schumer said. \"The question before the Senate is how we will find a path forward on protecting our freedoms in this turbulent 21st century. The only choice to move forward on these vital issues is to change the rules in the modest way we have proposed.\" The Senate rules change proposed by Democrats would have implemented a \"talking filibuster\" for the voting rights legislation alone. Under this plan, final passage would require a 51-vote majority, rather than the usual 60, after senators used their opportunities to speak to filibuster the bill. Earlier Wednesday, Manchin told his colleagues that invoking the so-called nuclear option to eliminate the 60-vote threshold would exacerbate the current political divisions. \"I cannot support such a perilous course for this nation when elected leaders are sent to Washington to unite our country, not to divide our country,\" he said. \"Putting politics and party aside is what we're supposed to do. It's time that we do the hard work to forge the difficult compromises that can stand the test of time.\" Manchin delivered his speech alongside a poster that read \"The United States Senate has never been able to end debate with a simple majority\" and called claims by his Democratic colleagues that eliminating the filibuster would restore the vision the founding fathers intended for the Senate \"simply not true.\" \"Allowing one party to exert complete control in the Senate with only a simple majority will only pour fuel on the fire of political whiplash and dysfunction, and that is tearing this nation apart,\" he said. Several Republican senators gathered on the floor to hear Manchin's speech, including McConnell and Minority Whip John Thune. Earlier Wednesday, Schumer addressed Sinema's and Manchin's opposition and their arguments that the filibuster is used to foster bipartisanship. \"I don't see that evidence, evidence of that at all,\" Schumer said. \"But even for those who feel that the filibuster is a good thing and helps bring us together, I would ask this question: isn't the protection of voting rights, the most fundamental wellspring of this democracy, more important? Isn't protecting voting rights and protecting their diminution more important than a rule in the Senate?\" Manchin and Sinema have remained firm in their defense of the filibuster under intense pressure by some Democratic lawmakers and activist groups. EMILY's List, a group that endorses women politicians who advocate for abortion rights, said that it will not endorse Sinema in future elections if she refuses to support a rules change to pass voting rights legislation. \"We want to make it clear: if Senator Sinema can not support a path forward for the passage of this legislation, we believe she undermines the foundations of our democracy, her own path to victory and also the mission of EMILY's List, and we will be unable to endorse her moving forward,\" said EMILY's List President Laphonza Butler in a statement. Wednesday's votes took place just hours after President Biden's first press conference of the year. One of Mr. Biden's signature pieces of legislation, the social spending bill known as Build Back Better, also remains stalled in the Senate because it lacks the support of Manchin and Sinema.\u00a0 The voting rights legislation includes a wide array of proposals to expand access to the ballot. Some of the proposals include making Election Day a national holiday, creating standards for voter ID and allowing no-excuse absentee voting around the country. It would also create a baseline to allow for early voting for at least 15 days before Election Day and to establish same-day voter registration.\u00a0 The measure would reinstate a core provision of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of racial discrimination in voting to get approval from the Justice Department before changing their election policies. This section of the law was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. A CBS News poll released Wednesday showed that 68% of Democrats believe it is \"very\" important to pass voting rights legislation. The poll also displayed that a majority of Democrats believe that the filibuster should end, while 65% of Republicans said that the filibuster should be kept.\u00a0 Senate Republicans have alleged that the legislation amounts to a \"federal takeover\" of the elections process. McConnell said Wednesday morning that Schumer's proposed rules change would \"destroy\" the Senate, arguing that the filibuster is a \"central Senate tradition.\" \"The Senate is not supposed to be a duplicate House of Representatives with fewer members and fancier desks,\" McConnell added.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the Senate.",

            "article_content": "Black Americans continue to be among President Biden's strongest supporters, with two-thirds approving of his job performance. But as with the public overall, the president's approval ratings among Black Americans fell over the course of 2021 and have not returned to the heights seen at the start of his term.\u00a0 It's inflation weighing on his ratings now: most Black Americans disapprove of Mr. Biden's handling of inflation, specifically \u2014 as do Americans overall. Nor do most think he's focused enough on inflation.\u00a0 This is even as they give him net positive marks for other issues, for handling the pandemic, and for the economy more generally. Black Americans who disapprove of his overall job performance overall also disapprove of his handling of inflation, in particular, among other issues. Black Americans still give Mr. Biden very positive marks for handling coronavirus, even though that measure dipped over the last year too. And it's an important measure because they feel Black communities have been hard-hit by the virus, citing \"a lot\" of impact.\u00a0 For context: compared to other recent Democratic presidents one year into their terms, Mr. Biden's approval rating from Black Americans today is a little lower than it was\u00a0 for Bill Clinton in 1994 (72%) and quite a bit lower than for Barack Obama in 2010 (87%.) The president has also lost ground on his ratings of empathy. Among Americans overall \u2014 including Democrats, both White and Black \u2014 the percentage who describe Mr. Biden as caring about people like them is down over the year.\u00a0 The percentage of Black Americans who feel the president cares about people like them \"a lot\" is only about half of what it was a year ago. We also see some unmet expectations, compared to a year ago. Ahead of his inauguration, two-thirds of Black Americans thought Mr. Biden's policies would do more to favor the interests of Black people \u2014 as well as other groups \u2014 but today, Black Americans are more apt to feel his policies have had no impact on their interests in particular. And those who say they haven't seen a positive impact are far more likely to give him negative ratings on handling the economy and inflation, as well as overall.\u00a0 More White Democrats feel Mr. Biden's policies have favored Black people than Black Democrats do. Black Democrats, meanwhile, are more likely than White Democrats to feel Biden hasn't focused enough on issues of discrimination. Younger Black Americans are not as positive in their assessments of Mr. Biden as older Black Americans are. Black people under age 45 give him lower approval ratings overall and on key issues compared to those who are older. Younger Black Americans are less likely to think Mr. Biden's policies are doing more to favor Black people or that he cares about people like them. Black voters are a core part of the Democratic Party's coalition, but younger Black Americans are not as likely to identify with the party as their older counterparts. And like younger Americans more generally, younger Black people are less likely than those who are older to be registered to vote and to have voted in the 2020 presidential election.\u00a0 We also see differences within Black Americans by education and income. Black Americans with lower incomes and those without college degrees have generally less positive views of Mr. Biden's job performance compared to those with higher incomes and those with college degrees. \u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Biden has said that he plans to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court. This is being received quite well among members of his own party, including both White and Black Democrats, most of whom are enthusiastic about the prospect. Most Americans overall are either enthusiastic or at least satisfied about this.\u00a0 Democrats, including majorities of Black Democrats and White Democrats, think it's important that the Supreme Court should reflect the diverse gender, ethnic, and racial make-up of the country as a whole. This is less important to Republicans, but about half say it's at least somewhat important.\u00a0 And those who say it's important that the diversity of the Supreme Court represent America are particularly likely to be enthusiastic about Mr. Biden's plans to put a Black woman on the bench. Black voters were pivotal to Mr. Biden's victory in the presidential election. The strong support of Black voters in South Carolina, for example, was instrumental in delivering Mr. Biden his first primary win, that represented a turning point in the campaign that helped propel him to the nomination. He won 87% of the Black vote in the general election. Overall, Mr. Biden's job approval is at 43%. His handling of inflation, in particular, has dipped this week and ratings of the overall economy, widely seen as bad, fell again after they had rebounded a little bit in the weeks prior. Those dips are, in turn linked to his overall approval edging down to its low to-date. Mr. Biden does retain majority support from Black Americans, as noted, and also from Democrats, but remains underwater with independents. His ratings began falling last summer with events in Afghanistan, and the case rise from the Delta variant, and then were weighed down further by inflation and haven't rebounded. Kabir Khanna and Fred Backus contributed to this report.\u00a0 This story is part of a series from the CBS News poll looking at Black Americans' views on a range of important issues as part of Black History Month. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,494 U.S. adult residents interviewed between February 15-18, 2022. Respondents were selected to be representative of adults nationwide with an oversample of African-American respondents included, and the final sample as reported was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as to 2020 presidential vote. The margin of error for the total sample is \u00b12.3 points. The margin of error for the sample of African Americans\u00a0 is \u00b15.0 points.\u00a0 Toplines",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with GOP Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina that aired Sunday, January 30, 2022, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham joins us from Clemson, South Carolina, this morning. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, coming up on this program, Congressman Jim Clyburn, he has said repeatedly in interviews that South Carolina Federal District Judge Michelle Childs, not only as someone he likes, but that both South Carolina Republican senators will support her. So he's talking about you. Did you tell him you're a yes vote on Childs? SEN. GRAHAM: Here's what I'll tell him and the nation, I- I can't think of a better person for President Biden to consider for the Supreme Court than Michelle Childs. She has wide support in our state. She's considered to be a fair minded, highly gifted jurist. She's one of the most decent people I've ever met. It would be good for the court to have somebody who's not at Harvard or Yale. She's a graduate of the University of South Carolina, a public education background. She's been a workers comp judge. She's highly qualified. She's a good character. And we'll see how she does if she's nominated. But I cannot say anything bad about Michelle Childs. She is an awesome person. MARGARET BRENNAN: That- that sounds like pretty close to yes. You're a yes vote? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, what I don't know if she's going to be nominated\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. GRAHAM: if she's nominated, she will not be treated like Judge Kavanaugh, I promise you, by Republicans. Let's see how she does at the hearing. But I think I've made it pretty clear that I'm a big admirer of\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, you did\u2013 SEN. GRAHAM: Judge Charles. And I'd like to see the court have- a have a lot more balance, some common sense on it. Everybody doesn't have to be from Harvard, Yale\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. GRAHAM: It's okay to go to a public university and get your law degree. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have been glowing in your descriptions, but your colleague, Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, said picking a female black Supreme Court justice is affirmative racial discrimination. He questioned her- any potential impartiality from any of the candidates named. Nikki Haley of South Carolina also tweeted the president should not have a race or gender litmus test. President Reagan promised to nominate a woman, Sandra Day O'Connor. So why is this different? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, it's not different to me. Put me in the camp of making sure the court and other institutions look like America. You know, we make a real effort as Republicans to recruit women and people of color to make the party look more like America. Affirmative action is picking somebody not as well qualified for past wrongs. Michelle qual- Childs is incredibly qualified. There's no affirmative action component if you pick her. She is highly qualified. And President Reagan said running for office that he wanted to put the first female on the court. Whether you like it or not, Joe Biden said, I'm going to pick an African-American woman to serve on the Supreme Court. I believe there are plenty of qualified African-American women, conservative and liberal, that could go onto the court. So I don't concede- I don't see Michelle Childs as an act of affirmative action. I do see putting a black woman on the court, making the court more like America. In the history of our country, we've only had five women serve and two African-American men, so let's make the court more like America. But qualifications have to be the- the- the biggest consideration. And as to Michelle Childs, I think she's qualified\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. SEN. GRAHAM: by every measure. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator, I want to move on to Ukraine. Senator Menendez, Democrat, on another program this morning, said they're nearing bipartisan agreement on a package of sanctions, some of which would put sanctions on Russia now, some later. I know you're part of the talks. I know you want sanctions now. So what exactly are you pushing for? What needs to be hit? SEN. GRAHAM: More. More against Russia, more for Ukraine. There's bipartisan support to sanction Russia now. They're dismembering the Ukraine by the invasion- the threat of invasion. It's 2022, for God's sake. You can't get your way by threatening to invade a country. So, punish Putin now more, weapons to the Ukraine now so they can defend themselves, more economic aid to the Ukrainian economy so they can- they can deal with the threat of invasion and more troops to NATO. As Putin tries to dismantle NATO and divide NATO, I support President Biden's decision to send more troops in to reinforce NATO. He's trying to destroy a neighboring democracy. He hates democracy- Putin. And I will just say this to President Putin. If you invade the Ukraine, you will destroy the ability of future presidents to treat you and Russia as normal. You'll long for the good old days of the Cold War because every president in the future will pound you and every Congress in the future will pound you if you dismantle this democracy. So be careful what you wish for, my friend. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, strong words there. We know President Biden is already looking at sanctions after an invasion. He's looking at sovereign debt sales, hitting oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin, the banks that handle critical industries and- on top of export import restrictions. Is this enough or are you saying you're pushing President Biden further? SEN. GRAHAM: The bipartisan working group will submit sanctions now. Look what Putin has done. He's dismantled\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: On what specifically, though? SEN. GRAHAM: he's hurting the- Oh, an array of pre-invasion sanctions, the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is a cash cow for Putin, that'll probably be after the invasion, knocking them out of financial systems that they will need to conduct business normally, the Swift program. All of this is on the table, but the\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: European allies don't support that. SEN. GRAHAM: It is 20. Well, the Congress has a different view here. I want sanctions on Putin's behavior now. What is Putin doing? He's threatening- he's warning to get his way by threatening it to invade a country. This is 2022, for God's sake. That's not the way to resolve disputes. So, I think there'll be bipartisan support for sanctions now. There'd be a bipartisan support for more- more lethal aid now to the Ukraine, more economic assistance for the government now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. GRAHAM: And I think there's bipartisan support to reinforce NATO. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, well, in your version of a bill, what would trigger invasion? Right? Because there's an array of options Vladimir Putin's looking at. Does a cyberattack trigger sanctions? SEN. GRAHAM: A cyber attack against the United States would be an act of war, and we shall respond in kind. I am tired of Putin, China and North Korea attacking us. If they blew up a pipeline that would be an act of war. Well, if you shut it down through a cyber attack, it's the same outcome. MARGARET BRENNAN: But a cyberattack in Ukraine? SEN. GRAHAM: My Russian friends- Yeah. Well, any- any attack on the sovereignty of a nation, any attack on their critical infrastructure, any attack on their ability to do business. But he needs to be sanctioned now. What is he done? He's using the threat of force of arms to get his way. That should be outlawed in 2022. Listen, I want to support President Biden to the- to the full extent possible, but the Congress is ready to sanction Putin now. But there will be more sanctions come if he invades. And I will end with this point: If you invade the Ukraine, if Russia invades the Ukraine, no future president, no future Congress\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. GRAHAM: will give you a pass. It will change the relationship forever. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, more than 730 people have been charged by the Justice Department for their role in the attack on the Capitol on January 6th to stop\u2013 SEN. GRAHAM: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: the certification of our election. Last night, President Trump, at a rally, said this. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: If I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6th fairly. And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons because they are being treated so unfairly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Pardons? Do you agree? SEN. GRAHAM: No, I don't want to send any signal that it was OK to defile the Capitol. There are other groups with causes that may want to go down to the violent path that these people get pardoned. MARGARET BRENNAN: But isn't that a dangerous thing to say? SEN. GRAHAM: Kamala Harris- Yeah. Well, I think it's inappropriate. I- I don't want to reinforce that defiling the Capitol was OK. I don't want to do anything that would make this more likely in the future. And just let me finish my thought here. When Kamala Harris and her associates and the people that work for her, her staffers, raised money to bail out the rioters who hit cops in the head and burned down stores. I didn't like that either. So I don't want to do anything from raising bail to pardoning people who take the law into their own hands because it will make more violence more likely. I want to deter people who did what\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SEN. GRAHAM: on January the 6th. And those who did it, I hope they go to jail and get the book thrown at them because they deserve it. MARGARET BRENNAN: That was clear, Senator, before I let you go, I want to ask you. The District Attorney in Georgia has- in Fulton County has gotten clearance to set up a grand jury to investigate President Trump. She says she wants to talk to you about that phone call you made to Georgia's secretary of state ten days after the election, are you going to cooperate? SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah give me a call. Yeah, I talked- I asked about how the system worked when it came to mail in voting- balloting. The January 6 committee was not the 911 committee. After 911, we came together, we formed a bipartisan committee after the next election-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I was talking about Georgia though. SEN. GRAHAM: So what's going on Georgia and the January 6th- Yeah. I know, but there's an effort here to use the law, I think inappropriately. So I don't know what they're going to do in Fulton County. I don't know what the Jan. 6 committee is going to do. I expect those who defile the Capitol to be prosecuted. But there's a political movement using the law to try to knock Trump out of running. And I, particularly, don't like it or appreciate it. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, Senator, thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back with Congressman James Clyburn.",

At the forefront was the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed more than 1 million lives in the country. He has also been put at the helm of tackling climate change, an economic downturn and racial injustice.\u00a0 \"We still face stern tasks, including taming inflation without causing a recession, and combatting violent crime.

Cannon-Brookes, Gore wrote, is a major backer of a project that would help Australia harness and export solar power. The project, a 2,600-mile undersea cable, would connect a solar farm in northern Australia to nearby Singapore for \"around-the-clock power.\"\u00a0 Last year, the billionaire also pledged over $350 million in personal funds to philanthropies fighting climate change.\u00a0 \"Cannon-Brookes' innovative investments and vocal advocacy for decarbonizing the private sector are redefining the role of climate activism in business and investment,\" Gore wrote. \u00a0 .@algore on Mike Cannon-Brooks (@mcannonbrookes):\"He is one of the visionaries and major backers behind a groundbreaking project that will allow Australia to not only harness its potential for solar power, but also export it\" #TIME100 https://t.co/ep80eH8MIX Once mostly known for his comedic role on \"Saturday Night Live,\"\u00a0Pete Davidson\u00a0has gone on to star in several movies, host stand-up shows and most recently semi-join the family of fellow Time's list member Kris Jenner by dating Kim Kardashian.\u00a0 But for rapper Jack Harlow, Davidson is someone who changed his life for the better.

Kendi, CBS News racial justice contributor Click\u00a0here to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\" \u00a0                            MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on Face the Nation: Inflation rises, and so does the risk of recession. Plus, more evidence from January 6 shows that former President Trump and his allies knew their plot to overturn the election was illegal. The lawmakers investigating the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and witnesses to that day warn that former President Trump and his allies pose a clear and present danger to American democracy. (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE BENNIE THOMPSON (D-Mississippi): Former President Donald Trump and other political allies appear prepared to seize the presidency in 2024. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Last week's hearings revealed shocking new details about how close we came to a potential act of horrific violence. (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE PETE AGUILAR (D-California): Approximately 40 feet, that's all there was, 40 feet between the vice president and the mob. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We learned more about the extraordinary pressure the former president exerted on his vice president to overturn the 2020 election, despite top aides telling him the scheme was unconstitutional and his claims of voter fraud were bogus. (Begin VT) WILLIAM BARR (Former U.S. Attorney General): He has become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with one of the investigators, California Democratic Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren. Plus: The Federal Reserve signaled it will hike interest rates at the most rapid pace in decades to fight inflation that is running at a 40-year high. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): I'm using every lever available to me to bring down prices for the American people. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the president powerless? And can the country avoid a recession? We will hear from the director of the National Economic Council, Brian Deese, and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Loretta Mester. Then: Vaccinations for the youngest Americans are set to begin this week. We will ask former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb about the rollout. And, finally, as Americans observe Juneteenth, we will hear from author and historian Ibram Kendi. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have a lot to get to today, including some long-awaited COVID news finalized just yesterday. Nearly 20 million children will finally have access to coronavirus vaccines, after the CDC approved emergency use in infants, toddlers and preschoolers, relief for parents. But there is more economic anxiety. Fears of a recession are piling on top of struggles with inflation. The Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by three-quarters-of-a-percentage point, in the single largest increase in nearly three decades. But we begin with a crisis in our American democracy, the investigation into the January 6 attack and the elaborate scheming that led up to it. Lawmakers and witnesses are warning that the threat is not over. For more on what we learned and what's next in the hearings, here's CBS News congressional correspondent Scott MacFarlane. (Begin VT) MIKE PENCE (Former Vice President of the United States): On this vote... SCOTT MACFARLANE (voice-over): An unprecedented pressure campaign against a sitting vice president ended with Mike Pence in an underground loading dock beneath the Capitol for four hours January 6. He'd been rushed into safety from the U.S. Senate chamber and, at one point, insurgents were just 40 feet away. REPRESENTATIVE PETE AGUILAR: A confidential informant from the Proud Boys told the FBI the Proud Boys would have killed Mike Pence if given a chance. SCOTT MACFARLANE: That day, he refused to leave. GREG JACOB (Former Counsel to Vice President Mike Pence): The vice president did not want to take any chance that the world would see the vice president of the United States fleeing the United States Capitol. SCOTT MACFARLANE: Earlier that day, the president personally pressured Pence one last time before the electoral vote. Witnesses say he called Pence a wimp. In a speech Friday, the former president denied it... DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States): I never called Mike Pence a wimp. I never called him a wimp. SCOTT MACFARLANE: ... but again asserted Pence could have stopped the official certification of the electoral votes. FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I said, well, what is he, a robot? He's a human conveyor belt. SCOTT MACFARLANE: The committee argued the already violent mob was egged on further by Trump's midafternoon tweet that Pence lacked courage. MAN: I'm telling you, if Pence caved, we're going to drag mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED) through the streets. RIOTERS: Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence! SCOTT MACFARLANE: A series of White House lawyers and aides described an elaborate, weeks-long effort to strong-arm Pence into executing a scheme devised by California lawyer John Eastman to reject some of the electoral votes and steal the election. White House lawyers testified, the president and Eastman both knew the plan was bogus and unlawful. A Trump White House aide described a call to Eastman. ERIC HERSCHMANN (Former White House Attorney): I said: \"Are you out of your F'ing mind?\" I said: \"You're going to cause riots in the streets.\" (End VT) SCOTT MACFARLANE: The committee has two hearings planned for the week ahead, including one in which they're expected to argue that Donald Trump tried to interfere with local election officials, including in Georgia. And CBS News has learned the committee also has a team investigating the role played by far right groups, including their efforts to plot and plan ahead of the attack -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott, thank you. We now want to go to Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren of California. She is in San Jose. Good morning to you. You're one of the investigators on this Select Committee. And I think one of the most powerful moments was when the retired conservative judge, Judge Luttig, said that he sees a clear and present danger today. He said there could be further attempts to subvert American democracy in 2024. What exactly is the threat you see? REPRESENTATIVE ZOE LOFGREN (D-California): Well, I think Judge Luttig said it very well. And, by the way, he is a very conservative man, once considered by Republicans for the Supreme Court. I think his concern -- and I share it -- is that the former president is continuing on his campaign to undercut confidence in the election system. They are installing loyalists who say that the election was stolen in states who are going to count the votes. They clearly tried to get the vice president to throw the actual votes out and replace electors with the losing candidate. And it looks like that's in the works for the next election as well. It's a grave concern. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, to be clear, there are about 100 Republican candidates for office right now who are repeating that they are election deniers. They're repeating some of what President Trump still claims. At least five of them have won their primaries. Have you found any direct links between any of those candidates and the grift that you have been tracking? REPRESENTATIVE ZOE LOFGREN: Well, we are going to release additional information. I have got the staff working on it right now. Obviously, the hearings are a couple of hours each, and you can't lay out all the information that's been compiled. So, I know there's been substantial interest in the -- the big ripoff. And we will provide additional information to the public soon. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying establishing direct links between those individuals standing for election to office now and the scheme you're laying out? REPRESENTATIVE ZOE LOFGREN: Not necessarily. We will lay out what we have, and people can look at it. I don't want to just pop off irresponsibly here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your colleagues on the committee Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger said on another network this morning that he just received a death threat against him, his wife, and his 5-month-old child for the work he's doing. REPRESENTATIVE ZOE LOFGREN: Right. Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: He said there is violence in the future. Do you agree that you have a fear of political violence? And have you received threats? REPRESENTATIVE ZOE LOFGREN: Well, I don't want to go into the threats I have received. I think it just encourages more of them. But it's very concerning that Adam and his wife and his little baby were threatened. I saw the threat. It was a written threat. We saw that Republican Congressman, a very conservative representative, Crenshaw was roughed up over the weekend at a Republican meeting because he was not conservative enough. And I think that's what the former president has unleashed here. You know, when he sent out the tweet attacking his vice president, he already knew that the violence was under way. The only conclusion you can reach is that he intended to accelerate that violence against the former vice president. So, we're in a very rough time in America right now. And we, all of us, elected officials, but also just Americans and their neighbors, need to stand up for the rule of law and against political violence. It's not what America is about. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, for the busy American people who may not have been watching the hearings as closely as we were, exactly what is the endgame here? Are you laying out a road map for the Department of Justice to ultimately try to prosecute the former president? REPRESENTATIVE ZOE LOFGREN: We are doing what we were asked to do when the committee was formed, which is to find the truth, lay it out. And we will also be making legislative recommendations. For example, the Electoral Count Act was violated. Dr. Eastman admitted as much .But we think we can tighten that up, so it's less susceptible to abuse. And we're working at -- especially Liz Cheney and I are working on that. The Department of Justice has to make its own decision. We're laying out facts. They can see it. But I'm sure they have access to other information because they've got grand juries meeting with various defendants. We are going to be helpful to them in terms of specific information that they wish from the -- our own investigations. But they have got a -- it's not the role of Congress to decide who gets prosecuted. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a number of your committee members, your fellow committee members, have criticized Attorney General Garland for not moving faster. So, they do want to see some kind of action here. (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: And there was this letter from the Justice Department asking for transcripts and saying that your committee's failure to immediately hand them over was complicating their investigation. Exactly what is going on here? REPRESENTATIVE ZOE LOFGREN: Well, that was kind of -- we were surprised by that, frankly. And we will engage. We're not going to be an obstacle to the Department of Justice prosecution of individuals. We're in the middle of putting these hearings together. The staff is working, I mean, incredibly hard, along with the members of Congress, where we will get particular information that they need over to them in an orderly way, certainly, by the beginning of next month. MARGARET BRENNAN: By the beginning of next month. In the next week, you have a number of Republican officials from state, local governments coming, including Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers, who said he had been pressured by the president -- the former president's attorney Rudy Giuliani and by the former president himself to retroactively change Arizona law to choose a different slate of presidential electors. He also has said he received e-mails from Ginni Thomas to reverse Trump's loss. And she is the wife, of course, of sitting Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Will you ask Bowers about that link to Thomas? REPRESENTATIVE ZOE LOFGREN: Well, I'm not going to step on the committee's lines for the hearing. But, obviously, as you know, we've invited Ginni Thomas to come in and visit with the committee, answer our questions. And we've received actually additional information when we got evidence from the Eastman e-mails that have now been ordered released by Judge Carter in California. So, we have questions for her, and we may have questions for him as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will Ginni Thomas appear? Do you need to subpoena her? And will her husband appear? REPRESENTATIVE ZOE LOFGREN: Well, we've asked her to appear. She -- it was a private letter. She decided to disclose it, which is her right to do. And she said publicly that she looks forward to coming in and talking to us. So, I take her at her word that she intends to come in. And we look forward to talking to her. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Lofgren, thank you for your time. And we will be watching. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to former FDA Commissioner, current Pfizer board member Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who joins us from Westport, Connecticut, this morning. Happy Father's Day to you, Doctor. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I have been asking you for years now when my children were ever going to be able to get a vaccine. And now we know they're actually being shipped out. But this is a pretty unique rollout for these youngest of Americans. In fact, children under the age of 3 can't go to these mass vaccination sites that we've seen for older people. How complicated is rolling this out to the youngest Americans going to be? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, more complicated than other age segments. And I think it's going to be a little bit more of a slow rollout, relative to what we've seen in past rollouts with the other age groups. There are going to be pharmacies that are vaccinating children. CVS is going to move it into their pharmacies, but they're only moving it into the pharmacies with advanced care providers with their MinuteClinics. You're probably not going to see clinic stood up. Maybe around children's hospitals, you'll see some clinics stood up. But most people are probably going to get vaccinated and their pediatricians' offices. And it's going to take a little bit more time to get the vaccine into those local settings, because it's more difficult to vaccinate a child who is very young. You need people who are specially trained to do that. And so you want -- you want the settings to be appropriate. MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House adviser Dr. Ashish Jha briefed this week, and he said almost 50,000 children under the age of 5 have been hospitalized due to COVID infections, a quarter of them in the ICU, so really directly disputing the idea that kids don't get that sick. But then, when we look at the orders here, 10 million doses made available by the government. Just short of four million were actually ordered. That indicates perhaps a low level of uptake. Does that concern you? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, it's continued to concern me that we haven't seen a lot of uptake among children generally, that only about 30 percent of kids ages 5 to 11 have been vaccinated with two doses. That's lower than what the initial estimates are. Right now, there are surveys showing that about 20 percent of parents plan to vaccinate children under the age of 5. I suspect it may end up being lower than that. I think, as prevalence declines going into the summer, a lot of parents may choose to take a wait-and-see attitude and reconsider this in the fall. So I would suspect that uptake is going to be pretty slow. I think the 4.98 -- or 3.98 million doses that have been ordered so far is a reflection of that fact. I think, over time, we're going to see more kids get vaccinated. But this is a serious disease in children. More than 1,000 have died, about 440 under the age of 4. We've seen, as you said, tens of thousands of hospitalizations in this age segment. And this isn't a benign illness in a lot of kids, healthy kids, as well as kids with a lot of comorbid illness. And we're still seeing tens of thousands of hospitalizations every week in that pediatric age segment. And the final point I will just say is that COVID is a much different disease in children who are immune-naive vs. children who have some prior immune exposure. So, if you can gain some prior immune exposure through vaccination, when a child is eventually going to confront this infection -- and most people, eventually, over the course of their lifetime, are going to get this infection -- it's a much different disease once you've had that prior immune exposure and have some baseline immunity against this -- this infection. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear you saying it's not that your kid won't get sick, if they get the shot; it's that they will not necessarily be hospitalized, right? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: They'll have more baseline immunity. They'll have some T-cell protection. They'll have memory B-cells that can protect them in that setting. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Look, every part of this pandemic has become politicized in some way. And there was this back-and-forth between the White House and the state of Florida, the governor there, Ron DeSantis, whose state is actively dissuading children from being vaccinated. And there was this back-and-forth over not ordering vaccine supplies. What is this about? And he's claiming the trial data was abysmal and it should not have gotten FDA authorization. He's not a doctor. You're a doctor. Tell me, what's your view here? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, these vaccines have gone through robust clinical studies. We have a lot of experience with these vaccines now in children, children ages 5 to 11. This got a unanimous vote from a pretty diverse set of advisers at the FDA, 21-0 in a unanimous vote from CDC. So, I think people should feel confident in the safety and effectiveness of both of these vaccines. I think there's really two questions on a table with respect to the state of Florida. Are they right to actively discourage vaccination, and did they take steps to actively impede the ability of physicians in that state to get access to the vaccine? I think they're wrong to actively discourage vaccination. They could have taken a neutral stance and just merely said, we're not recommending the vaccine for children. Instead, they affirmatively oppose the vaccine. I believe they're the only jurisdiction to do that. Other countries that aren't recommending the vaccine haven't actively opposed vaccination. They haven't said that kids shouldn't get vaccinated. With respect to the second question about the access to the vaccine for providers, I don't think that they're actively impeding the ability of pediatricians in the state to get the vaccine. They're just not facilitating that. And this is a position that they said they would take all along. They articulated this much earlier in the year. What's happening in every other state is, the states really act as an intermediary, taking possession of the vaccine from the CDC, and then redistributing it to physicians within that state. And so what other states did, where they preordered vaccine, in the state of Florida, they're not playing that role. They told physicians, you're going to have to direct order from the CDC. And because of that, no preorders were placed. Physicians were only able to place orders once this was approved. So the state of Florida was the only state that wasn't able to get preorders in, and the first shipments that went out were those preorders. Now, the White House has taken steps to... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: ... prioritize the orders that have come in from doctors in Florida. About 20,000 have come in as of yesterday. So, they'll be getting vaccine this week. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, it's an emergency use authorization. Private industry can't buy this directly. The government has to be involved, correct? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's right. So, in the state of Florida, physicians are going on to the Web site, the Florida State Web site, and putting in orders. It's effectively through the state. I mean, the state's acting as a broker. Those orders are then going into CDC. But the state is not taking possession. And what's happening in other states is that they are taking possession of the vaccine, then redistributing it. And a lot of states have chosen to do that because they want to make sure there's equitable distribution. They want to get early supply. They want to be able to target to certain -- certain parts of the state. In Florida, they said: We don't think people should be getting this vaccine and we're going to play no role in facilitating that access. So, they're not blocking access. They're just not facilitating that access. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right. No, interesting perspective from you, Dr. Gottlieb. Always love having you on the program. We will be back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to our economic challenges. CBS News senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann has more on how we got here. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): If your paycheck feels smaller, it probably is. Our economy is racing red hot, with widespread worry it's careening toward a cliff. JEROME POWELL (Federal Reserve Chairman): We have both the tools we need and the resolve that it will take to restore price stability. MARK STRASSMANN: But beyond raising interest rates, there's much the Fed can't control, the multiple drivers behind the highest rate of inflation in 40 years, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine, now almost in its fourth month, its global impact on the prices of minerals and metals, food and fuel. Russian troops have blockaded or stolen Ukrainian wheat and corn. Corn futures trade at $8 per bushel, the highest price in a decade. And, most conspicuously, the war's impact on gas prices. At roughly $5 a gallon, the average price of U.S. gas is $2 higher than it was a year ago, with a cascading impact throughout our economy. Take poultry prices, up almost 17 percent year to year, roughly double the rate of inflation. Farmers need gas for equipment transportation, even fertilizer. They're paying more, so you're paying more for chicken. Another inflationary pressure, ongoing supply chain issues, an outgrowth of the pandemic. Demand dwarfs supply still. Take China, makers of the world's cheap goods. Its zero-COVID policies have shut down many of its manufacturing centers, including at one time much of Shanghai, its financial hub. U.S. car buyers feel it, too few options on the lot, new cars up almost 14 percent in a year, used cars up 16 percent. Inflation is also high because of a competitive labor market. The jobless rate is under 4 percent, with almost two available positions for every job seeker. One way employers compete for scarce workers, raise wages. And yet, despite everything costing more, Americans keep spending right through the price increases, a combination of pandemic cabin fever and deep pockets. Washington pumped out $6 trillion in stimulus in two years, including putting checks in the hands of consumers. And, as a country, we have money to burn, $2.3 trillion in excess savings. What isn't clear, whether inflation has peaked or if rising interest rates will slow growth too dramatically and trigger a recession. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: And then there's the battle of inflation, psychology, consumer confidence, something the Fed can help shape, if not control. Can its policies and messaging help balance supply and demand, given the widespread belief out there that, with inflation, things could get worse before they get better? -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann, thank you. Coming up, we will speak with two people who help shape economic policy, Director of the White House National Economic Council Brian Deese, as well as the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Loretta Mester. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you can't watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR, or we are available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ apps. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're joined now by Brian Deese. He is the director of President Biden's National Economic Council. Good morning, and welcome to the broadcast. BRIAN DEESE (Director, National Economic Council): Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have an incredible challenge on your hands. Yes, the jobless rate is low, but wage growth not keeping pace with inflation. What do you say to Americans who are thinking that they might need a second job to pay their bills? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Well, it is an uncertain moment. And we face real challenges, global challenges. Inflation is a global challenge, 9 percent in the U.K., over 8 percent in Europe. But we also have real strengths here at home. And so what I would say is, we need to navigate through this transition in a way that gets us to stable growth, without giving up all of the incredible economic gains that we've made. You mentioned the jobless rate at 3.6 percent. We've also seen household balance sheets strengthened over the course of this period. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressional Budget Office predicts that high inflation will persist until 2024. The Treasury secretary has said it will stay higher than the originally forecast 4.7 percent. When does it come down? How much time are you talking about? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Well, prices are unacceptably high right now. And that's why the president has said we need to make this our top economic focus and do everything that we can to get them down. Most independent forecasters, the Blue Chip, the Federal Reserve, as you said, see inflation beginning to moderate over the course of this year. But our focus is on, what are the steps, what are the policies that we can take? And the single most impactful thing that we could do right now is to work with Congress to pass legislation that would lower the costs of things that families are facing right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Like what, and how? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Like prescription drugs. We could lower the cost of prescription drugs by allowing Medicare to negotiate better prices. That would actually lower federal spending, and it would lower the costs that people pay. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said this week in a rare interview that he actually has the votes to do it. Where's the deal? When's the vote? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Well, lowering prescription drug costs is one piece. Lowering utility costs by providing tax incentives for energy is another piece, but, equally important, lowering the federal deficit by enacting long-overdue tax reform. If we can do a package like that, and we can move forward in the near future, it will not only help in lowering prices, but it will send a signal to the markets and the global economy that the United States is really deadly serious about taking on this inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hiking taxes isn't going to change the price of milk. When and how are you actually putting forward this package? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: The package has been debated. It's been worked through. MARGARET BRENNAN: It failed back when -- Build Back Better's version of it. So, if inflation is the number one priority right now, when are you scheduling a vote to do the things you just laid out? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: We're working very closely with congressional leadership, with Senate leadership on that. Senator Schumer is working with his caucus to try to get a final package in place. And we're hopeful that we'll see progress on that in the coming weeks. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in the coming weeks. You think you can get this done on a party-line vote before September? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: We're hopeful we can move forward on that and other priorities in Congress as well. There's a bill on semiconductors, which I know you've talked about on this program, computer chips. The lack of affordable and available computer chips has driven up prices across the economy, including in things like automobiles. We're hopeful that we can move that as well before the August recess. That would provide some real relief to the economy as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Despite all of what you laid out -- and I know the president said recession is not inevitable -- it seems increasingly probable. The Conference Board put out their survey this week. It shows eight out of 10 global CEOs now expect a recession within the next 12 to 18 months. So, what power does the president have to stop that kind of contraction? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Well, I think what -- where we are in the economy right now is in a transition. And I spoke to CEOs this -- over the course of the past week from sectors across the economy, and they're figuring out how to navigate this transition. Some of this is exactly what we need to see. MARGARET BRENNAN: They're planning around a recession. DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Well, they're planning around transitions in our economy. People are buying less goods spending time at home. They're spending more on services. That creates some real challenges for some companies and some CEOs. What I would say is that not only is the recession not inevitable, but I think that a lot of people are underestimating those strengths and the resilience of the American economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: But shouldn't you level with the American public and just say, we are in uncharted waters? I mean, even the Federal Reserve Chair said this week there are things beyond his control. He can't control the price of gasoline. He can't control the war in Europe. He can't control COVID. He has a limited set of tools. And so do you. Is the president powerless here? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Absolutely not. Look, we face unprecedented global circumstances, a global pandemic and a war in Europe that is affecting the global economy. But, at the same time, we have a strategy that will make a difference. That legislation that we were talking about, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, lowering the cost of energy, lowering the federal deficit, that would make a real difference. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have all 50 Democrats on board for that? Because you didn't last time you tried parts of this bill. DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Look, nothing is -- nothing is done until it's done. We're hopeful. We're working hard. We have got our head down, and we're going to try to get something done. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, a number of economists -- I want to put up a chart of inflation here for our audience to see, measured by the Consumer Price Index, so from the beginning of the pandemic through now. And, as you can see, the tick-up began a good year before the war in Ukraine began. A number of economists, including at the San Francisco Fed, have said that the tremendous fiscal spending that went under way, the $6 trillion in two years, did add to that, including, as you can see right on there, the $2 trillion that the Biden administration pushed through in the spring of 2021. So when people look at that, and they say, well, the White House told us why that inflation would be transitory, the White House told us we could go through with this kind of spending, we'd be fine, even when Democrats within your own party were warning this would add to inflation, how do you win credibility here to the public and say, this time, we're not wrong? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Well, you just have to look around the world today to recognize that the two principal drivers of inflation are the pandemic and Putin. We're seeing this everywhere. It is a global phenomenon. As I mentioned in the U.K., inflation's hit 9 percent. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but the point is, those are the things you can't control. DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: In Europe, it's over... MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm talking about the things you can. DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how do you win that credibility back? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Well, if we look at the things that we can control, we win credibility by taking action. This president is acting. This president galvanized the global community to do a historic release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a million barrels a day. Leading oil market analysts this week said that action was single-handedly responsible for keeping oil prices from going up even further. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, short term. DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: We are going to take action. We're going to prioritize. We're going to make clear that tackling inflation is our top economic priority. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things that you do have control over at the executive is the approach on tariffs. Treasury Secretary Yellen told me back in November, she acknowledged that the Trump era China tariffs do add to inflation domestically here. The president was asked about this yesterday and said: \"We are still in the process of making up my mind.\" If inflation is the number one priority, why are you dragging out this decision? DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Well, I will let the president's words speak for himself. We're looking closely at it. And I anticipate the president will have more to say on that issue in the coming weeks. But, just to be very clear, over the course of the last couple of months, this is an issue about our supply chains and about getting goods to the United States in a way that is effective and cheap. And the president has been incredibly focused on that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll continue to track it. Thank you very much, Brian Deese, for coming in. DIRECTOR BRIAN DEESE: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: There are just 12 people who get to vote on whether to adjust interest rates and by how much, the members of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee. Loretta Mester is one of those people and she joins us from Philadelphia this morning. Good morning to you. LORETTA MESTER (President, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland): Good morning, Margaret. Glad to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad to have you back. You know, this sustained high inflation continues to surprise Federal Reserve officials. Chair -- Chairman Jerome Powell -- excuse me -- said as much this week, and that's why he said there was this unusually large interest rate increase of 75 basis points. He expects another similar one in another few weeks. What would alter that plan for you? LORETTA MESTER: Well, what we're looking at is trying to get our interest rates up to a more normal level, so that we can stem some of the oversized demand momentum in the economy and bring it back down, so that we can relieve some of those inflationary pressures. So we're going to be looking for the month-to-month changes in inflation rates to get some really good evidence on whether we've seen inflation first stabilize and then begin to move back down. It is going to take a while to get inflation back down to 2 percent. But what we're looking for is that we could see some moderation in demand, which has been incredibly strong, bringing it back in alignment with supply side, which, of course, as you know, has been constrained, alleviating some of that price pressures, getting inflation moving back down, and on a sustainable path back to 2 percent, which is our inflation goal. So that's what we're going to be looking at is, what's going on in the monthly numbers? And, frankly, the May CPI report basically was bad across the board, in terms of, we didn't really see inflation stabilize. In fact, some of the measures actually looked worse in May than in April. And so that was part of the calculus of why moving up at a slightly higher-than- normal rate increase happened at our meeting last week. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and one person did dissent, Esther George of the Kansas City Fed. She said she thought the Fed was moving by too much and too fast. She argued: \"Significant and abrupt changes can be unsettling to households and small businesses.\" Why is she wrong? And are you confident these dramatic hikes won't trigger a recession? LORETTA MESTER: Right. Well, I would never say Esther's wrong. It's an alternative view. We had signaled that we thought 50 would be appropriate, but then we got new data. And we've also said that we really need to be nimble in this period of uncertainty. And when we see data moving in the wrong direction, or continuing to move in the wrong direction, and information that inflation expectations, not in the short run, but even in the longer run are moving up, that was what was convincing to me that it was appropriate to move at a bigger clip than we had signaled early on. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you would expect that next time? LORETTA MESTER: But, again, clearly, what we're going to be looking at is, is demand moderating and coming better in line with supply, and is inflation turning back down? That's going to be key here. We need to see compelling evidence that inflation is beginning to move back down towards our goal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, you know her from her time when she was running the Federal Reserve. She said this morning the economy will slow. How much are you expecting it to slow? Are you predicting a recession? LORETTA MESTER: So, I'm not predicting a recession. If you look at the forecasts that were submitted and released earlier this week of all the participants in the FOMC meeting, you'll see that we do have growth slowing to a little bit below trend growth, and we do have the unemployment rate moving up a little bit. And that's OK, right? It's sort of, we want to see some slowing in demand to get it in better line with supply. But there's other things that are going to be happening later in the year too. For example, we've already seen households really shifting some of their spending, rather than spending on goods, which really was the bulk of spending coming out of the pandemic, height of the pandemic, when the economy reopened, into more services. That's going to help alleviate some of the upward pressure on goods prices. So other parts of the economy will be moving, as well as what we're doing on interest rates. We've already seen interest rates have an effect in the housing sector, where the housing sector is pulling back from the heights that it had seen. So, we want to see some moderation in demand, right? What we're going to be navigating, though, is setting our policy rates, our interest rates, so that we can maintain a healthy economy and healthy labor markets as we go through this period. But there's a lot of uncertainty out there. And we're going to have to be very careful and nimble in how we approach this pulling back of this very accommodative monetary policy that's something more appropriate to the economy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. The Fed chair, though, was pretty clear that there are things that are beyond your control. Monetary policy can't solve this problem. He said gas prices are beyond your control, the war in Ukraine, COVID. So, for people at home, does that mean they should assume their food and energy costs are going to stay high for the next year or two? LORETTA MESTER: So, I agree with Chair Powell, right? The way monetary policy works is on the demand side of the economy. We can slow some of that demand that's way above where the supply currently is. But we should expect to see some moderation and some improvement on the supply side as we go forward as well. Highly uncertain, I agree. Monetary policy can't control that. What we can do is really do what we can with our tools to get this inflation problem. And, as you said, it's at a 40-year high. We've got to get monetary policy in a good place to combat that excessive demand and the excessive demand that really is driving price pressures. That's what we can do with our tools. And we're committed to doing that and keeping inflation -- moving it down back to 2 percent. But the reason it'll take a while is because we need to have that supply side come back into better balance as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. LORETTA MESTER: And that's why it isn't going to be immediate that we see 2 percent inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. LORETTA MESTER: It will take a couple of years. But it will be moving down. MARGARET BRENNAN: A couple of years. I mean, the other thing that's hard to measure is just people's confidence, right? And when they look at being told by the administration, by the Fed that inflation was transitory, they can say, people were wrong, right? The officials got it wrong. Gary Cohn, former president of Goldman Sachs, formerly Trump economic adviser, said the Fed was clearly behind the curve, clearly late in raising rates, and now the runway for a soft landing is now much shorter and narrower. You're not predicting recession, but you've got to acknowledge that there have been missteps, and the risk is rising. LORETTA MESTER: Right. The recession risks are going up, partly because monetary policy could have pivoted a little earlier than it did. We're doing that now by moving interest rates up. But, of course, there's a lot of other things going on as well. The Ukraine situation, which is a tragedy, right, has really led to that high oil prices that everyone's feeling the brunt of and high gasoline prices. So other things were moving on the supply side as well. No doubt, supply conditions remain constrained longer than I think anyone thought. The businesses that we talked to in the Cleveland district all thought that there would be meaningful improvement even as early as last year. We didn't get that. Now they don't see meaningful improvement until farther -- much further out. So, again, other things are going on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. LORETTA MESTER: What I want to say, though, is, we at the Fed are very committed to using the tools at our disposal, right, to bring this inflation under control and getting it back to 2 percent. It is the number one challenge in the economy now. MARGARET BRENNAN: It is. LORETTA MESTER: And I believe it's necessary to do that if we want to sustain healthy labor markets. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. LORETTA MESTER: I don't see this... MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. LORETTA MESTER: ... as a tradeoff at all. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, it's a -- it's a huge economic challenge and a political one. We'll continue covering it here. Thank you, Loretta Mester. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Today is Juneteenth, a federal holiday marking the abolition of slavery and African-America freedom. June 19, 1865, was when the last enslaved people in Texas received word of their freedom, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation. For more, we'd like to turn to CBS News racial justice contributor, Dr. Ibram Kendi, who is also the author of two new books, \"How to Raise an Antiracist\" and \"Goodnight Racism.\" Good morning. Happy Father's Day, by the way. IBRAM KENDI: Thank you. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you have a 6-year-old daughter. So, I wonder, how are you going to teach her what this holiday is? IBRAM KENDI: Well, I'm actually going to teach her that it's Freedom Day and that, throughout this nation's history, there's been two perspectives on freedom, really two fights for freedom. Enslaved people were fighting for freedom from slavery, and enslavers were fighting for the freedom to enslave. And, in many ways, that sort of contrast still exists today. There are people who are fighting for freedom from assault rifles, freedom from poverty, freedom from exploitation, and then there are others who are fighting for freedom to exploit, freedom to have guns, freedom to maintain inequality. So I really want to get her to understand that there are multiple kinds of freedom, and she should be fighting for and joining with those who are fighting for freedom from something like slavery. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this concept gets to sort of the core of what so many of your books are about, when you say anti-racist. And I just want to be clear for people who are listening. You do not teach Critical Race Theory, or CRT, which has become very politicized. You focus on this idea of anti-racism. How do you explain to people at home the difference? And for those who say, this might be too advanced for a child, how do you -- how do you respond? IBRAM KENDI: Well, the difference is, Critical Race Theory is an anti- racist sort of theory, but I'm thinking about something -- I'm really trying to get the American people to really understand that there's inequality, and the cause of that inequality is not what's wrong with, let's say, black people. It's what's wrong with -- with bad policies. And the way kids can understand it is, kids understand bad rules. My daughter understands what's not fair. And we can teach children that there's bad rules in society. There are things that are not fair in society. And that's why, let's say, black people have less. It's not because they are less. MARGARET BRENNAN: You -- so, I think, for people at home who are trying to understand the concept, it's interesting, because you basically are arguing being colorblind is not a virtue. For so long, people were taught, be blind to color. You're saying acknowledging this is important, because, if you ignore it, it allows racism to survive. Is that right? IBRAM KENDI: It does. And, unfortunately, we, as parents and teachers and caregivers of children and just adults, want to believe that, but, unfortunately, it's just not true. I mean, studies show that, as early as 3 years old, our kids have an adult-like concept of race. They're not only seeing color, but they're attaching it to qualities, like smartness, like honesty. And so we have to share with our children, yes, there are all these different colors, but they don't mean anything, just like a book cover doesn't mean anything. You literally have to open the book, and you have to open someone's heart to see who they and what they truly are. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state, was on this program around this time last year. And I was reading her remarks. And she said, when it comes to teaching about race, she wants children to be taught about America's birth defect of racism, but also forward progress on its issues. She said: \"I don't want this to be black against white, my weaponization of my identity against yours.\" Do you see that weaponization happening, because there is fear of that? IBRAM KENDI: I actually think that that weaponization can happen, but that's why, for instance, I talk about the clash between racism and anti- racism, as opposed to black and white. And I also think it's important for us to understand what I call in my work racist progress, how, over time -- let's take voter suppression policies, have become more sophisticated over time. And so, if we're not recognizing both racial progress and racist progress, then we're going to be missing the ways in which racism and why racism is persisting and why inequality is persisting. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, one of the things that we are tracking right now in this country is this threat of domestic extremism. And, just this week, the 18-year-old white man who killed 10 Black people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, made an appearance in federal court. He apologized to his parents, but explained his motivation as being about preventing the elimination of the white race. How do parents prevent their child from being radicalized like that? I mean, that sounds like online recruitment for terrorism or something. IBRAM KENDI: It is. And that's a huge, huge problem, I mean that the number of particularly white male teens who are being recruited in multiplayer video games, online through memes, through direct messages is really high. And the way that we protect our kids from that is ensure they can identify white supremacist ideology. And the way you -- the way they can identify white supremacist ideology is to teach them about it. There's no way they're going to be able to protect themselves from it, just like they can't protect themselves from cars. They have to understand to look both ways, whether they're teenagers or young people, so they won't get harmed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Kendi, thank you very much. Good luck with the books. And Happy Father's Day again. IBRAM KENDI: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. And a reminder that you can set your DVR if you can't watch the full show. And, to all the dads out there, including my dad, my father-in-law and my husband, happy Father's Day. Until next week, for Face the Nation, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "It was always unlikely that there would be many Republicans voting to confirm Judge Kentanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, and they will only be able to delay \u2014 not to stop her \u2014 from becoming the first Black woman justice. But the GOP was able to use the Judiciary Committee hearings this week as a vehicle to give their midterm messages a dry run.\u00a0 It's unclear at this point whether and how the war in Ukraine and related policy might influence November's elections. But when it comes to domestic issues, several Republicans saw Jackson as a foil for themes they hope will not only motivate their base of supporters, but also help sway white suburban voters who turned away from the party during the Trump era.\u00a0 Republicans on the committee focused much of their questioning around crime, critical race theory, and gender identity, issues at the center of today's culture war. It was a coordinated effort. The Republican National Committee, for example, tweeted a gif that crossed out KBJ (Jackson's initials) and replaced it with CRT.\u00a0 Led by Sen. Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, GOP members shaped their opposition strategy around Jackson's sentencing of child pornography offenders below the federal sentencing guidelines. Democrats and the White House argued such focus was intended to signal far right conspiracy theory groups like Q-Anon, which promotes false claims about Democrats and child trafficking. The lines of questioning amount to \"testing ground for conspiracy theories and culture war theories,\" Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin said during the hearings. \"This is a president who is presiding over a historic crime wave. So, if they want to dismiss parents' concerns about their children's safety, and if they want to dismiss concerns about crime as a conspiracy theory? Take that argument to the polls,\" Hawley told reporters outside the Senate chamber. \"Crime is an important issue. It's important to parents, it's important to me as a parent. We are in the middle of a historic crime wave. I think it's a topic on people's minds.\" Hawley's argument extended up the higher ranks of the GOP. Sen. Rick Scott, of Florida, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told reporters at the weekly party leadership press conference, that Jackson \"seems to be very soft on sexual predators, people that have, you know, harmed our children.\" Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, told CBS News that Jackson is soft on crime, particularly evidenced on the child pornography [sentencing].\"\u00a0 Jackson, who served as a district court judge in Washington, referenced her family members in law enforcement and her own experience as a mother who \"took these cases home with me at night because they are so graphic in terms of the kinds of images that you are describing.\"\u00a0 She argued that \"In every case, I did my duty to hold the defendants accountable in light of the evidence and the information that was presented to me\u2026The evidence in these cases are egregious. The evidence in these cases are among the worst that I have seen, and yet, as Congress directs, judges don't just calculate the guidelines and stop. Judges have to take into account the personal circumstances of the defendant because that's a requirement of Congress.\" Republicans also focused on gender identity, as several GOP state legislatures across the country have pushed transgender sports bans. Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn asked Jackson to provide a definition for the word \"woman.\" Jackson replied that she was not a biologist. Blackburn responded: \"The fact that you can't give me a straight answer about something as fundamental as what a woman is underscores the dangers of the kind of progressive education that we are hearing about.\" And as questions around teaching students about racism in the country's history are causing rifts among school boards, parents and activists, Sen. Ted Cruz pressed Jackson on critical race theory, which acknowledges racial disparities that have persisted in U.S. history and offers a framework to understand how racism is reinforced in U.S. law and culture. The Texas senator referred to a 2015 speech in which she referenced the term, and brought various children's books to the hearing. Jackson said the term \"doesn't come up in my work as a judge. It's never something I've studied or relied on, and it wouldn't be something that I would rely on if I were on the Supreme Court.\"\u00a0 The days of wide bipartisan support for Supreme Court nominees may be long gone. But the historic nature of Jackson's nomination as the first Black woman on the court may have been compelling in another era. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse told Jackson that she is \"going to be a hero\" to children and students across the country. Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of GOP leadership who is retiring this year, said he would be pleased to vote for the first Black woman on the court, but that what happens at the hearings should be the most important element of consideration.\u00a0 \"My view from day one was that I thought it was absolutely fine for the president to make that commitment in the campaign that that's what he wanted to do. And I had no problem with thinking that this is a time to narrow the field of candidates, to a person representing people who have not previously served on the court,\" Blunt told CBS News. \"But [they] would obviously have to be good lawyers and have the right temperament to be a good judge.\" Grassley told CBS News the nature of Jackson's nomination is not a factor in his decision. \"We look at the record of the person, we don't care whether it's man, woman, whether it's Black, White, Hispanic, Native American, any of those things,\" he said. \"We are interested in people being constitutionalists, strict constructionists, not try to fill in holes that Congress might leave in laws.\" Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were two of three Republicans to vote for Jackson's nomination to the district court and are considered potential crossovers for this nomination.\u00a0 Sen. Lindsey Graham, withstood the wrath of conservatives when he voted to confirm President Obama's Supreme Court nominees, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, noting then that though they would not have been his choice, \"elections have consequences,\" and he deemed them to be good judges with good character. He voted to confirm Jackson to the district court, too, but his questioning this week made clear he doesn't plan to support her again. When asked why elements of Jackson's record concern him now when they didn't in her previous confirmation, Graham told CBS News, \"The position she has today could change the law.\"\u00a0 Collins told reporters this week that \"my mind is open,\" but she wants to review the hearings before making a decision.\u00a0 Anyone considering crossing the aisle to vote for Jackson will do so without political cover from Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who announced on the Senate floor Friday that he would oppose Jackson's nomination.\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "This report was originally broadcast September 19, 2021. That tall, amiable sheriff and his little boy, Opie, heading to a fishing hole on the outskirts of Mayberry, North Carolina, at the start of \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" were actually strolling along a lake in Beverly Hills, California. Ron Howard, the actor who played Opie, is now one of Hollywood's top directors. Most of the other stars \u2013 Andy Griffith; Don Knotts, who played his deputy, Barney Fife; and the actors who played Aunt Bee and Floyd the Barber \u2013 they've all passed on. After all, it's been 54 years since Andy left the show.  So, it may come as something of a surprise to learn that Mayberry is doing just fine, even though its actual name is Mount Airy, and its only genuine link to \"The Andy Griffith Show\" is that Griffith was born and grew up here. \"Andy Griffith, God bless him, if he had not been born in this particular little town, we wouldn't be standing here having that conversation,\" said Randy Collins, president and CEO of the Greater Mount Airy Chamber of Commerce.  He's recalling when North Carolina's tobacco and textile industries had the stuffing knocked out of them: \"After the mills closed, I think a lot of the town fathers and the business owners got together and said, 'Hey, you know, what about this Mayberry thing? Maybe we can do something with it.' And businesses were born, or reinvented.\" \"It's a little bizarre, isn't it?\" asked \"Sunday Morning\" senior contributor Ted Koppel. \"It went off the air more than 50 years ago.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"It captured a reality that never was.\" \"True; Mayberry is fictitious,\" Collins said. \"Most everyone knows that! Except maybe some of the rabid fans of the show. They believe it's real.\" And, let it be said, the town isn't doing a whole lot to undermine the illusion. Stop by at Wally's filling station, and you can get a ride around town in a vintage Ford Galaxy squad car. These days there's a whole fleet of them carting tourists around town. Collins said, \"We are constantly looking at other ways that we can promote the community, 'cause we know the Mayberry generation won't be here forever.\u00a0 But now with streaming television, Andy will be forever with us, and we hope a younger generation will pick it up.\" As if on cue, the Foster family, from Pomeroy, Ohio, showed up. It is no exaggeration to say that this re-creation verges, for the Fosters, on being a national monument.\u00a0  Koppel asked the Fosters, \"You watch 'The Andy Griffith Show' four hours a day?\" \"More than that,\" said Bobby Foster.  \"What do you mean, 'more than that'?\" \"It's on sometimes early in the morning,\" Sarah Foster explained.  \"Aren't you afraid that after a month or two of watching four hours or more a day, that you're gonna turn his little brain to mush?\" \"No!\" young Isaiah replied.\u00a0 \"Oh, no!\" said Sarah. \"Not when it comes to good, wholesome shows.\" \"Tell me why you like it so much?\" \"Good, clean comedy fun,\" said Bobby.  \"Yeah, good, clean comedy,\" Sarah said. \"Has morals, values. You don't see that a lot today in TV.\" Down on Main Street, where tourists peek into Floyd's barber shop or grab a bite at the Snappy Lunch diner (\"We drove from Louisiana for the famous pork chop sandwich!\" said one man), you hear the same theme. One man told Koppel, \"I think the generations now long for that simplicity of the episodes of Andy being real with his son about stealing or doing the right thing, and as a godless society that we see today is longing for simple life. Back when neighbors were neighbors, and they provided for everybody else.\u00a0  \"What do you see, Mr. Koppel? Let me flip it back on you. I know you're doing this, but what do you see?\" \"What you're saying is true of certain people,\" said Koppel. \"If you were Black in the '60s, things were not all that good for you.\" \"That's true. True.\" \"If you were a Vietnam vet coming back, things were not all that good for you.\"\u00a0  \"Spat on and hated, yeah,\" said the man.  What actually happened during the years the program first played \u2013 the Cuban missile crisis, the assassination of President Kennedy, the Vietnam War, marches by African Americans for the right to vote \u2013 those events never intruded inside Mayberry's imaginary town limits.  Mayberry is where more than 30 million Americans a week went to escape reality, which is why it's strange to find so many people half a century later searching for what made America great in a copy of a town that never was.  And, as Randy Collins of the Chamber of Commerce acknowledges, African Americans were all but invisible on \"The Andy Griffith Show.\" \"There were very few speaking parts,\" he said.  [Actually, only one: Rockne Tarkington played Opie's football coach, Flip Conroy, in one episode.]  Collins said, \"If you watch closely in the crowd scenes, I think Andy and others on the show pushed to make sure that there were people of color in the crowds, but you have to look closely.\" Maggie Rosser is in her 90s now. She and her younger brother and sister were all born here in Mount Airy, left, and returned. \"I moved back here, 1973,\" Rosser said. \"So, we wanted a sandwich. And went in our Main Street, and they served us, but we had to go out and eat.\" \"They wouldn't let you sit?\" asked Koppel. \"So, even in 1973, or a little bit after?\" \"A little bit after, yes,\" she said.  Bobby Scales, also born and raised in Mount Airy, has a clear memory of race relations in the '60s: \"Blacks knew where they belonged, and Whites knew where you belonged, too!\" he laughed. \"And everything was segregated.\" Evelyn Scales Thompson (Bobby's twin) said, \"Black people didn't exist. In making those programs, it was for basically the White population.\" She believes she understands the ongoing popularity of the program: \"It's appealing to people who are not familiar with small towns. And what Andy has projected is a quiet, peaceful town with everybody happy. Everybody's looking for peace.\" \"So, Mayberry, Mount Airy, good place to live?\" asked Koppel.  \"It's a good place,\" Thompson replied. \"If it were not home, I would not be here.\" \"Unwrap that for me! I mean, your home is where you make it.\" \"Yes, but not where you were born and your memories and family.\" \"But if your memories are mostly memories of being treated as the lesser, why would you wanna stay?\" \"Well, I wasn't treated as a lesser in my family,\" Thompson replied. \"I have family history. Our property is there, and memories of childhood is still very strong. I'm very satisfied being retired in the place where I grew up.\" \"Somehow,\" Koppel said, \"Mount Airy becomes more complex with each conversation.\" \"I bet! I bet! Yes, indeed,\" Thompson said.  Mount Airy is a place where fantasy and reality intersect.  Koppel asked Collins, \"If I wave the political thermometer across the forehead of Mount Airy, do people here believe that Joe Biden is the legitimate president?\" \"That's a good question,\" he replied. \"Our former president had a lot of support here. If you took a poll, that would probably not lean in our current president's favor.\" As for the visitors? For twenty bucks a pop, they get to ride on a trolley car tour of Mount Airy. Sometimes a fella in a deputy's uniform (who does look a little like Barney Fife) rides along. The Elvis impersonator was an unexplained bonus \u2013 as was the entire crew from \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" Koppel asked the trolley's riders, \"I know you came here to have a good time and not to talk politics. But let me just ask you, as a matter of curiosity, how many of you think we had a fair election?\" \"No way!\" said one man wearing an American flag T-shirt with the word \"Patriotism.\"  \"I saw two hands go up,\" Koppel said. \"So, is it fair to say the rest of you think that it was not a fair election?\" \"No, no. No, it wasn't. I don't think it was at all,\" said the man.  Another man said, \"I think there was a lot of voter fraud. It's never been proven. There's been people that's voted that's been dead 15 years. I think it's more the mail-in ballot stuff. You don't know how much of those that were duplicated, triplicated. The whole bit.\" A third man said, \"Look how many dead people voted for Biden.\"\u00a0  Koppel asked, \"One question, it's a serious question and I know you all will take it seriously: Tell me what you think happened on January 6 at Congress?\" The first man said, \"They showed truckloads of people that they were bringing in for this. It was all staged. And that's how that started. They even showed pictures of it on the news, about these vehicles coming in with all these BLM people.\" Another man, who believed the election was fair, called the January 6 attack, \"A disgrace on our country.\" \"Whose fault was it?\" Koppel asked. The man smiled.  One rider did blame Donald Trump, but he was in a distinct minority. A woman said, \"I think it was staged. We've been to a lot of the Trump rallies, and I don't understand why they're focusing so much on that one issue when there's so many cities that are being burned down every day by protesters. It's supposed to be peaceful. But it's all focused on holding these two people.\" \"Murder and kill everybody there \u2013 hang 'em, put 'em in jail,\" said the first man.  Another woman said, \"We don't even watch news on TV anymore. We don't feel like we're being told the truth. And we find our truth in other ways. And I won't say what those other ways are, but I feel like we're not being told the truth, because we're trying to be swayed in a direction that we know is not the right direction.\" \"I won't be offended,\" Koppel said. \"I've been a journalist all my life. When President Trump talked about the press being the enemy of the people \u2026\" \"They are!\" the woman replied. \"And I love President Trump. And I love that man. I do.\" A third woman said, \"I just hope when this airs, it won't show Southerners as a bunch of dumb idiots. Like so many parts of the country do, you know? We have a lot of love in our hearts. We love our country. We love our fellow man. And if the rest of the country felt like that, it would be a better place.\" A fourth man asked, \"Mr. Koppel, can I say something? This conversation about politics and division is what people come here to get away from. We don't care what color you are. We don't even care what your politics are. We just want to be good neighbors and treat everybody alike. And that's why they're coming here.\" The Barney Fife impersonator added, \"That's what America should be.\" And, when the script was written in Hollywood, that's the way it was. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Story produced by Dustin Stephens.
