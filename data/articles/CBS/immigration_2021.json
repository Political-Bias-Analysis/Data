            "article_content": "The official who interprets the Senate's rules said Thursday that Democrats can't include a provision in President Biden's social spending plan that would offer work permits to unauthorized immigrants, yet again thwarting Democratic efforts to pass a longstanding policy goal without Republican votes, according to\u00a0guidance\u00a0obtained by CBS News. Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough said a plan to allow 6.5 million immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status to apply for work permits and protections from deportation could not be passed through the budget reconciliation process. The procedure allows bills to be approved by a simple majority of senators, rather than the 60-vote threshold needed to pass most legislation. As parliamentarian, MacDonough is tasked with determining whether reconciliation proposals have a direct impact on the federal budget \u2014 a requirement for the procedure. She determined Democrats' latest proposal was not primarily related to the budget. \"These are substantial policy changes with lasting effects just like those we previously considered and outweigh the budgetary impact,\" MacDonough wrote in her opinion Thursday. This is the third time MacDonough has ruled against Democrats' attempts to include an immigration relief provision for some of the country's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the Build Back Better package that Democratic lawmakers hope to push through the evenly-split Senate in the next few weeks. To the dismay of progressive activists, the rejected proposal would not have placed the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. without authorization on a pathway to permanent status and citizenship \u2014 a policy Democrats and Mr. Biden have advocated for. But the plan to offer work authorization and deportation protections to a large segment of the undocumented population represented Democrats' clearest opportunity to pass some form of immigration relief before their razor-thin majority in Congress is threatened by the 2022 midterm elections. For weeks, progressive lawmakers and activists have urged senators to ignore the parliamentarian \u2014 and those calls intensified Thursday. But it is unclear whether the necessary number of Democratic senators would vote to overrule her guidance. In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and fellow Democratic senators Dick Durbin, Bob Menendez, Catherine Cortez Masto, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n and Alex Padilla criticized the parliamentarian's decision but did not commit to overruling her. \"We strongly disagree with the Senate parliamentarian's interpretation of our immigration proposal, and we will pursue every means to achieve a path to citizenship in the Build Back Better Act,\" the senators said. Angelica Salas, the executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, urged Democratic lawmakers to disregard the parliamentarian's opinions and offer undocumented immigrants a pathway to U.S. citizenship through the spending package.\u00a0 \"Every single Democrat promised citizenship. They promised green cards and now they have the power in the House and they have the power in the Senate. And yes, it's by a slim margin, but they have the power,\" Salas, a former undocumented immigrant, told CBS News. \"They are choosing not to use their political power on our behalf.\" Earlier this fall, the parliamentarian ruled against Democratic proposals that would have made undocumented immigrants eligible to become permanent residents, saying the plans were not primarily budget related. Under the latest plan, certain immigrants who have lived in the U.S. since 2011 would be eligible for parole, an immigration benefit that allows non-citizens to live and work in the country legally. Applicants for the temporary program, which would expire in 2031, could be rejected if they fail to pass background checks. While parole does not provide a direct pathway to permanent U.S. status, it could allow approximately 3 million undocumented immigrants to apply for green cards if their immediate U.S. citizen family members are willing to sponsor them, according to a congressional estimate. In her guidance on Thursday, MacDonough concluded the latest plan is \"not much different in its effect than the previous proposals we have considered.\" She said the plan would offer undocumented immigrants work authorization, travel documents and other benefits. Some would also be allowed to apply for a green card after receiving parole, MacDonough noted. The plan, she said, would expand the parole program, which is designed to be granted on a limited, case by case basis. Other immigration provisions in the Build Back Better plan passed by House Democrats include an effort to recirculate nearly 400,000 green cards that went unused during the past three decades and make them available to immigrants waiting in line. The plan would reduce the massive green card application backlog. Another provision would exempt eligible immigrants in the U.S. from annual immigrant visa caps and allow them to get a green card if their applications have been approved for two years.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "President Biden came into office pledging to usher in a new era of U.S. immigration policy by rolling back his predecessor's hard-line agenda, proposing to legalize undocumented immigrants, expanding legal immigration and making America a safe haven for refugees. During his first 100 days as president, Mr. Biden halted border wall construction and ended some Trump-era policies, including broad restrictions on green cards. However, Mr. Biden has kept several of his predecessor's immigration changes, including a historic-low cap on refugees and limits on asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. Mr. Biden has also yet to fulfill some campaign promises, like ending for-profit immigration detention and rescinding Trump administration rules that disqualified victims of gang and domestic violence from asylum. A record increase in arrivals of unaccompanied children at the southern border has consumed much of the Biden administration's early work on immigration. It has also been the focus of political attacks from Republicans, who believe immigration could be the Achilles' heel of Mr. Biden's presidency, which remains relatively popular, in part because of its response to the coronavirus pandemic. Republican attorneys general have already mounted legal challenges to Mr. Biden's immigration policies, successfully blocking his proposed 100-day freeze on most deportations.\u00a0 Mr. Biden's proposal to place 11 million undocumented immigrants on a pathway to permanent legal status also faces an uphill battle in Congress, where Democrats hold slim majorities in both chambers. Some stand-alone bills, like ones to legalize \"Dreamers\" and farmworkers, have gained some Republican support, but it's unclear if Democrats can secure 10 GOP votes in the Senate to bypass the filibuster. A White House official said the Biden administration is focused on \"rebuilding\" the U.S. immigration system and reversing the hundreds of immigration changes made in the past four years. Trump-era rules that remain in place after Mr. Biden's first 100 days could still be discontinued later on, the official said. \"We're taking our time to do it right,\" the official told CBS News. \"We've had to sort of crawl out of a bit of a mess from the previous administration.\" Here's an overview of how U.S. immigration policy has changed \u2014 or remained the same \u2014 during Mr. Biden's first 100 days in office. During the campaign, Mr. Biden promised to restore U.S. asylum laws, denouncing Mr. Trump's border policies as draconian and inhumane. On Inauguration Day, Mr. Biden suspended the so-called Remain in Mexico program that required 70,000 asylum applicants to wait outside U.S. territory while their cases were adjudicated. Since then, his administration has admitted more than 8,000 asylum-seekers who were previously enrolled in the program and allowed them to stay in the U.S. pending a final decision on their applications. In February, the Biden administration withdrew from three Trump-era agreements with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador that allowed U.S. border officials to re-route asylum-seekers to these countries. The move was largely symbolic, as the deal with Guatemala was the only one that had been implemented and deportations under it were paused in March 2020 due to the pandemic. Despite these changes, the Biden administration has continued to cite a little-known public health authority first invoked under former President Donald Trump to expel tens of thousands of migrants without allowing them to apply for U.S. asylum. The Biden administration has declined to expel unaccompanied migrant children under the public health authority, known as Title 42. But border agents have continued to expel most adult migrants and asylum-seekers, including families with children, to Mexico or their home countries. As part of one of his early executive actions, Mr. Biden established a task force to locate and reunite migrant parents and children who remain apart after being separated near the southern border during the Trump administration. As of earlier this month, the task force had not yet reunited a family.\u00a0 Shortly after being sworn in, Mr. Biden revoked Mr. Trump's travel and immigration limits on 13 countries, most of them Muslim-majority or African. In late February, Mr. Biden rescinded a proclamation issued by his predecessor that banned the issuance of most immigrant visas during the pandemic. He did not, however, lift similar restrictions that Mr. Trump placed on work visas last summer, instead letting them expire in late March. Last month, the Biden administration stopped enforcing the Trump-era \"public charge\" rules, which granted immigration adjudicators broader discretion to deny green card applications from immigrants determined to rely, or be at risk of relying, on public aid, like housing vouchers and food stamps. Following through on one of Mr. Biden's campaign pledges, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas offered Temporary Protected Status, a humanitarian protection from deportation, to up to 300,000 Venenzuelan immigrants in the U.S. While the Biden administration has also extended deportation relief to some Syrian and Burmese immigrants in the U.S., it has yet to say whether it will reverse the Trump administration's move to end TPS protections for 300,000 immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Sudan, Nicaragua, Nepal and Honduras.\u00a0 As part of an effort to expand pathways of legal immigration from Central America, the Biden administration revived an Obama-era initiative that allows some children in the region to reunite with family in the U.S. Mr. Biden's deputies have portrayed the program as an alternative to the treacherous trek some Central American children embark on to reach the U.S. border. DHS has also said it will issue a rule in the next few months to safeguard the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program from a court challenge that threatens the deportation protections and work permits of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors. Mr. Biden's election elated refugee advocates who had been demoralized by Mr. Trump's drastic cuts to refugee admissions and restrictions on resettlement, which collectively shut the door to thousands of people fleeing war and persecution around the world. In his first weeks in office, Mr. Biden reiterated his campaign promise to admit up to 125,000 refugees in fiscal year 2022, a sevenfold increase from the record-low 15,000-spot ceiling Mr. Trump set. Mr. Biden also vowed to make a \"down payment\" by increasing the current fiscal year's refugee cap to 62,500. But Mr. Biden delayed signing the paperwork needed to enact his proposed changes for weeks, leading to the cancellation of flights for hundreds of travel-ready refugees who were subject to the Trump-era restrictions. Mr. Biden finally issued a refugee order earlier this month. While he terminated Mr. Trump's rules that restricted who qualified for refugee resettlement, Mr. Biden kept the historic-low 15,000-person cap, provoking swift and vocal condemnation from Democratic lawmakers and refugee advocates.\u00a0 Amid the uproar, the White House backtracked later that day and said Mr. Biden would increase the refugee ceiling by May 15. As of last week, fewer than 2,300 refugees have been admitted into the U.S. this fiscal year, according to State Department data provided to the resettlement agencies. Through a late-night order on Inauguration Day, the Department of Homeland Security barred the deportation of most immigrants in the U.S. for 100 days \u2014 the policy equivalent of Mr. Biden's boldest immigration campaign pledge to enact a moratorium on deportations. The unprecedented policy, however, was short-lived. Four days after the pause took effect, Texas convinced a federal judge to block it. Since the court order remains in place and the Justice Department has not appealed it, Mr. Biden's vow to stop most deportations in his first 100 days went unfulfilled. Despite this setback, the Biden administration has been able to limit arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency that has come under intense scrutiny from progressives, some of whom have advocated for it to be abolished. On his first day in office, Mr. Biden rescinded an order issued by Mr. Trump that rendered most undocumented immigrants vulnerable to being arrested. ICE has since issued guidelines instructing agents to prioritize the arrest of immigrants deemed to pose a threat to national security, those convicted of certain crimes and recent border-crossers. During the campaign, Mr. Biden said he would end for-profit immigration detention, but ICE has yet to make announcements regarding its multi-billion-dollar contracts with private prison companies, who run many of the agency's detention centers. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 ICE has, however, announced plans to wind down the long-term detention of migrant families, for now. It has converted two family detention centers in Texas into rapid processing hubs and started using hotels to temporarily house parents and children released from U.S. border custody. As of last week, ICE was detaining about 15,000 immigrants, including more than 1,500 parents and children at the family holding facilities, according to the latest statistics.

            "article_content": "Democrats dominate politics in California and no Republican has won statewide since 2006. But the upcoming recall election on September 14 is presenting a serious political challenge to Governor Gavin Newsom.\u00a0President Joe Biden campaigned on the eve of the polls opening for the governor in Long Beach, California. Days earlier,\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris also traveled to the state to campaign with Newsom. The election is taking place amid a rise in COVID-19 cases and as wildfires rage in the state. The election also presents a key test for how voters will respond to the way Democratic governors handled the pandemic.\u00a0 There have been previous attempts to recall Newsom, but this is the first challenge to get to the ballot. The election will be just the second recall election for governor in state history. The other took place in 2003 when Democratic Governor Gray Davis was recalled and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger became governor.\u00a0 Here's what you need to know about the recall.\u00a0 In February 2020, a group called the California Patriot Coalition began circulating a petition to recall Newsom, citing his administration's policies on immigration, homelessness, the state's drought emergency and taxes. Newsom had faced five previous recall attempts, but such petitions require 1.5 million signatures to trigger an election \u2014 and the prior ones all fell short. \u00a0 The coalition was started by Orrin Heatlie, a retired sheriff's sergeant. Other groups such as the Reform California organization have ties to Republican operatives and helped fundraise to collect signatures.\u00a0 Proponents of the recall say the movement really gained traction in collecting signatures after Newsom was spotted at the upscale French Laundry restaurant while his indoor dining shutdowns were still in effect. Recall supporters were able to submit more than 2.1 million signatures and California's Secretary of State verified 1.7 million signatures. All 22 million registered voters in California are set to receive a mail ballot that will feature just two questions.\u00a0 Question 1: \"Shall Gavin Newsom be recalled (removed) from the office of Governor?\"\u00a0 Question 2: The second question asks voters to choose which candidate should replace Newsom. And there will be a list of all 46 candidates, not including Newsom. Paul Mitchell, vice president of Political Data Inc, which provided voting data to campaigns, estimated that 80% to 85% of the vote will be from mail ballots.\u00a0 If more than half of voters choose\u00a0 \"no\" on the recall question, Newsom will remain in office. But, if a majority vote \"yes,\" Newsom will be replaced by the candidate who receives the highest number of votes.\u00a0 Twenty-four Republicans, 9 Democrats, 10 \"No Party Preference\" candidates, 2 Green Party and 1 Libertarian candidates will be on the ballot to replace Newsom. Six Republicans have stood out with their campaign activity and fundraising:\u00a0 Elder entered the recall race in mid-July and has already brought in at least $5.5 million for his campaign. A Los Angeles-based host of a nationally syndicated conservative talk show, Elder has been the most recent target for Newsom's recall campaign, which claims Elder's show serves as a platform for disinformation on science and COVID-19 and that he's further \"to the right\" of former President Trump. \"Think about the judges he could appoint,\" Newsom said Friday in San Francisco. \"Who would he have appointed to replace Kamala Harris in the U.S. Senate? How would that impact the trajectory of this country? What would this mean for the future of the Democratic party in our efforts to keep the House of Representatives?\"\u00a0 Elder, like other Republican candidates in this recall, have gone after Newsom's COVID-19 measures. \"This man that I'm going to defeat on September 14, he shut down the state in the most severe way than any of the other 49 governors have,\" Elder said Friday in San Jose. \"When I get elected, assuming there are still facemask mandates and vaccine mandates, they will be repealed right away and then I'll break for breakfast.\" Since entering the race in April, Jenner has trailed other candidates in polling despite her name recognition. She launched a bus tour Thursday focused on immigration. \"It always sounded like an extreme longshot, kind of a hope that the Democrats and Independents would go for it because of her name, not any single issue,\" said Joshua Spivak, an expert in recall elections.\u00a0 Cox lost to Newsom by over 23 points in the 2018 race for governor, though his campaign argues his statewide name recognition and conservative credentials gained from his previous race will help in the current election.\u00a0 Faulconer has positioned himself as the more centrist candidate \u2014 often pointing to his 2013 election as a Republican mayor in San Diego, a historically Republican city that has trended Democratic since 2008. He made a public plea for citizens to get vaccinated during a recall debate in August, but says he doesn't favor state mandates.\u00a0 Kevin Paffrath, a 29-year-old real estate investor who makes financial advice videos on YouTube, \u00a0jumped into the recall race after seeing no notable Democratic candidate. \"Once it became official \u2014 I thought, 'Wow. Why did they not pick another Democrat? A neutral JFK-style Democrat that can bring both sides together and actually solve the real problems?\" he said.\u00a0   A new CBS News poll found 13% of voters would select Paffrath to replace Newsom. That put him 10 points behind Elder, who was the leading candidate in the poll; 25% of voters said they are not sure who they would choose to replace Newsom. \u00a0 Yes. Whether a voter votes \"yes\" or \"no\" on the recall question, they are allowed to cast a vote for a potential replacement or leave that question blank.\u00a0 California Democratic Party Chair Rusty Hicks told CBS News that it's up to voters to decide if they want to pick a replacement even if they vote \"no\" on the recall question. Newsom and his allies are focused on that question.\u00a0 \"We intend to defeat this recall on the first question. It's the only way to stop this Republican power grab,\" Hicks said. \"I'll be leaving the second question on my ballot blank.\" Yes. If Newsom is recalled, it would be the second time that California voters have recalled a governor.\u00a0 In 2003, Democratic Governor Gray Davis was recalled and replaced by Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. Schwarzenegger went on to win a full term as governor in 2006.\u00a0 The memories of that race still sting Democrats. Hicks said because of the 2003 result, he's glad that there isn't a strong Democratic candidate challenging Newsom. In that election, then-Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante ran as a replacement candidate.\u00a0 \"We had a Democratic governor and we had the 'backup option' and the result was Arnold Schwarzenegger,\" Hicks said. \"I think that California Democrats carry that lesson with us to this fight.\" As of September 8, over 6 million voters have already cast ballots in the race. That's 80% of the number of ballots that had been returned at an equivalent point last year, about one week out from Election Day. Early voting has slowed down since\u00a0the week before then, when it was more or less keeping pace with the general election. A big question going forward is whether the high rate of early voting will sustain or slow down further in the coming days. Democrats hold a massive advantage in party registration numbers. As of July 16, there were 10.3 million registered Democrats in California, accounting for 46.5% of all registered voters. There were about 5.3 million Republican voters and about 5.1 million who registered as \"No Party Preference.\"\u00a0 But recent polling suggests that Newsom is far from in the clear and his biggest issue may be complacency among Democratic voters.\u00a0 According to a new CBS News poll, 78% of Republicans say they will definitely vote, while 73% of Democrats say they definitely will. Republican voters are also more motivated to cast ballots than Democrats. The poll found that among registered voters, 54% think Newsom should not be recalled, compared to 46% who think he should. But among likely voters, the gap narrowed to 52% against the recall compared to 48% who support it.\u00a0 Other recent polling from California has shown a similar picture. A Berkley IGS poll from late July found that 51% of registered voters wanted to vote \"no\" on the recall, while 36% planned to vote \"yes.\" But among the voters most likely to cast a ballot, 50% planned to vote \"no,\" while 47% planned to vote \"yes.\" A Core Decision Analytics poll released in early August indicated a similar trend, but showed Newsom with a slightly better position among the likeliest voters.\u00a0 \"Those that think this thing is not close \u2013 I'd hate to disabuse you. It is,\" Newsom said recently.\u00a0 Newsom's team is hammering the message to Democrats who are considering sitting on the sidelines. \"It [the recall] will happen if Democrats don't vote. Period,\" said Nathan Click, senior adviser for Newsom's anti-recall efforts. The main committee defending Newsom raised more than $46 million through July 31 and had more than $26 million in cash, giving Newsom's side a massive warchest in the final stretch.\u00a0 According to a source familiar with the president and vice president's planning, President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will be taking an active role over the next month in the effort to stop the recall. That could include potential in-person events and other forms of engagement.\u00a0 \"He knows how to get the job done because he's been doing it,\" Mr. Biden said about Newsom in a recent statement, praising his response to the pandemic, his environmental work and his advocacy for women, immigrants and the LGBTQ community.\u00a0 \"And to keep him on the job, registered California voters should vote 'no' on the recall election by September 14 and keep California moving forward,\" he added.\u00a0 Republicans remain optimistic about their chances not only because of enthusiasm, but also because of some key victories in 2020. Jessica MillIan Patterson, chair of the California Republican Party, said Democrats believe that Republicans' only shot to win is low turnout, but 2020 showed the GOP can win in the Golden State.\u00a0 \"We had record turnout last year with mail-in ballots and we won where we played,\" Patterson said, pointing to four GOP flips in Congressional elections and wins on statewide ballot initiatives.\u00a0 Still, Patterson acknowledged the pro-recall movement's strong enthusiasm is due to its roots at the grassroots level and Newsom's decision making.\u00a0 \"This isn't something that started in the California Republican Party, this is an outside organization of Californians of all political affiliation,\" Patterson said. \"We are incredibly fortunate as Republicans that (Newsom) is our governor and has done everything possibly wrong and has failed the California people on every single level.\" COVID and Newsom's restrictions in response to the pandemic are at the heart of this recall. Newsom fully reopened the state in June, but the Delta variant has caused cases and hospitalizations to increase in recent weeks. On Wednesday, Newsom announced that California teachers will be required to get vaccinated\u00a0or submit to regular testing, prompting some of the leading Republican candidates to quickly criticize the policy. Whether Newsom may have to make more decisions along those lines could weigh on voters as they fill out their ballots.\u00a0 \"I do not think that mandates are the way to go,\" Patterson said. \"I think that Californians are sick of one man and one-party rule here.\" Newsom's team is hoping that contrast between Newsom and his alternatives will motivate the Democratic base. Click said that promises to repeal mandates or banning local communities from putting restrictions in place are \"an anathema to how Californians see the role of a governor and see the role government plays in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic.\" About 60% of Californians think Newsom did a \"very good\" or \"somewhat good\" job handling the COVID outbreak, according to a new CBS News poll. A majority, 67%, of Californians back vaccine mandates for employees, 69% support vaccine mandates for health care workers and 61% are okay with indoor businesses or venues requiring customers to be vaccinated.\u00a0 Depending on how wide the margins are, the outcome of this race could show how voters will react to their governors' actions and stay-at-home orders during the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty governors will be up for re-election in 2022, including Newsom and 10 other Democratic governors. Mitchell, the Political Data Inc. vice president, said that a big Newsom win would show that voters \"are now forgiving Democrats for these stay at home orders\" and that it shows Democrats have a \"path out of the woods and there's a New York Times Magazine cover of Gavin Newsom as the example of Democrats being able to withstand post-COVID political heat.\" \"Or Gavin gets trounced and then Democrats are running around like chickens with their heads cut off,\" Mitchell said.

            "article_content": "Upon losing an election, political parties usually search their souls \u2013 with the help of operatives poring over polling and data \u2013 to plot their resurgence. Democrats are embarking on such a mission after losing a startling number of House seats, even though Joe Biden won the presidency and they won control of the Senate, if just barely.. But Republicans this year are forgoing the traditional election post-mortem, despite their losses, and instead are pursuing a hardliners'\u00a0 \"election integrity\" message that resonates with their base and unites factions within the party. Although the Republican Party has otherwise been divided on its future in the post-Trump era, on the issue of election laws, the Republican National Committee, state legislatures, conservative outside groups, and federal lawmakers appear to be singing the same tune.\u00a0 \"Autopsies are such a beltway convention, and look where the autopsy in 2012 started and look where we ended in 2016,\" says Matt Gorman, a Republican strategist and veteran of presidential and congressional campaigns. Then-RNC chair Reince Priebus' post-mortem really was called an \"autopsy,\" what he concluded was that the party should prioritize comprehensive immigration reform and make a bunch of technical changes, like shortening the primary process, limiting the number of debates and raising more money. \"Public policy is always more productive,\" says Gorman. \"It's forward looking and can help instill confidence.\"\u00a0 Federal election legislation that passed the House, known as HR1 and now S1 in the Senate, is spurring conservatives into action. The sweeping proposal would create automatic, online and same-day registration, expand access to early and mail voting, and reform redistricting.\u00a0 \u00a0\"The urgency of the conservative movement to recognize the importance of safeguarding elections is more important today than ever before,\" says Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action, which launched a $10 million \"election integrity\" campaign focused on opposition to HR1 and action in state legislatures.\u00a0 \"HR1 would be a federal takeover of state election laws. Among the base, that's what's hitting the hardest.\" Anderson said that while Heritage Action has focused on election laws for years, \"the difference is the grassroots, they are more energized...that's a direct result of the frustration around what happened in November.\" A Quinnipiac University poll from early February found 76% of Republicans believe there was widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Mr. Trump and his allies were defeated in more than 60 court cases after the election, former Attorney General William Barr said there was no evidence of fraud at a level that \"could have effected a different outcome in the election\" and a group of federal, state and local officials working with the Department of Homeland Security declared the 2020 election \"the most secure in American history.\"\u00a0 House Republicans unanimously opposed the H.R 1and with little prospect for getting GOP support in the Senate, activists have tried to leverage Republican opposition to push Democrats to kill the filibuster.\u00a0 The fierce opposition to H.R. 1 extends down to the GOP's base. RNC chair Ronna McDaniel constantly hears from activists who are concerned about the bill. The RNC announced a new Committee on Election Integrity in February that is \"dedicated to restoring election transparency and ensuring voters have confidence in future election processes.\" Republican lawmakers around the country are pushing voting restrictions in their state legislatures. More than 40 states have introduced over 250 bills that would restrict voting access in the wake of the 2020 election, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\u00a0 Lawmakers supporting the bills often use the refrain that the measures make it \"easy to vote and hard to cheat.\" Legislative sponsors also say the bills are designed to shore up confidence in elections. In some instances, lawmakers supporting new restrictions questioned the results of the 2020 election or suggested the measures could lead to political gain. In Iowa, where Governor Kim Reynolds signed a bill that shortens the early voting period, tightens the timeline for returning absentee ballots and requires county auditors to follow state election laws, one GOP state senator repeated the false claim that the election was stolen. \u00a0\u00a0 \"Most of us in my caucus, the Republican caucus, believe the election was stolen,\" Iowa Republican State Senator Jim Carlin said during a debate over the bill that Reynolds eventually signed. \"Who believes that Joe Biden got 12 million more votes than Barack Obama on his best day? I don't.\" John Kavanaugh, a state representative in Arizona, one of the states the Brennan Center ranked as having the highest number of restrictive bills, told CNN that \"Democrats value as many people as possible voting, and they're willing to risk fraud. Republicans are more concerned about fraud, so we don't mind putting security measures in that won't let everybody vote -- but everybody shouldn't be voting.\" \"Quantity is important, but we have to look at the quality of votes, as well,\" he added, saying some voters may be \"totally uninformed.\"\u00a0 Those sentiments echo former President Trump's baseless claims about the election and indicate his sway\u00a0 around the issue.\u00a0 However, some of the most ardent supporters of tightening voting access do not want Mr. Trump associated with their efforts.\u00a0 \"I think he should sit it out,\" says Ken Cuccinelli, a former Trump administration official who is chairing the new \"Election Transparency Initiative\" at the Susan B. Anthony List. \"To the extent he comments on issues of the day, it ought to be foreign affairs and taxes and the economy and immigration.\" \"He makes it more partisan....like the RNC getting in there, but times ten,\" Cuccinelli says. \"The goals he would prefer to be achieved are more likely to be achieved without his participation than with it.\" Cuccinelli says groups like his that are working on voting laws should focus on preventing the passage of HR1, which conservatives see as a federal takeover of election laws, and at the state level should focus on voter ID, voter rolls and ballot security. \"There are a few people who are in their own head fighting out 2020. That is not what we are doing. We are trying to stay forward looking,\" he said. \"If we want to make our system work in a way that every American can be confident in, we are going to have to put some work into it.\" Though the party is largely unified in pressing for more stringent voting laws, the schism between them could open up again about how views of the 2020 election will impact primaries during the midterm cycle. One battleground state GOP strategist told CBS News that he fears that falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen could be a litmus test in GOP primaries. \"You don't necessarily have to lean in deep, but if you can't at least lean in a little bit, I tend to think you're 'not a conservative' by today's standard,\" the strategist said. \"I almost feel like that's the first litmus test. I would like to be wrong on that, but we'll see.\" Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "In first speech since leaving office, former Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday night highlighted what he saw as the accomplishments of the Trump administration while laying out what he called a \"positive agenda for the Republican party. Pence's public reemergence \u2014 in an early primary state \u2014 came as President Joe Biden marked his first 100 days in office and fueled speculation about a 2024 run.\u00a0 In speaking to the Palmetto Family Council, a South Carolina social conservative Christian group, Pence criticized Mr. Biden for what he called \"an avalanche of liberal policies.\" He said the president wants to launch an \"explosion of runaway spending\" with his COVID relief plan, infrastructure proposal and the American Families Plan. \"I've had enough,\" Pence said. \"After 100 days, I think the time has come for Americans devoted to faith and family and freedom and limited government to stand up and unite behind a positive agenda and win back America. And it starts right here and right now in South Carolina.\" Pence also praised South Carolina Senator Tim Scott for the \"positive vision\" he outlined during his Republican rebuttal to Mr. Biden's address on Wednesday night.\u00a0 Republicans, Pence said, need to \"unite behind a positive agenda\" that includes strong national defense, immigration policies that emphasize border security, appointing conservative justices and \"upholding all of the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution.\" He called \"election integrity\" a critical issue, and one that should be left to the states, but did not repeat Mr. Trump's false claims that the election was stolen.\u00a0 Thursday night's speech marked a turning point for Pence, who is expected to have an increased travel schedule moving forward, according to a senior aide. He'll likely be active on the campaign trail during the 2022 cycle to help Republicans try to win back the House and Senate. \"We have the winning agenda and now it's incumbent upon us to take that winning agenda to the American people,\" Pence said.\u00a0 After the January 6 attack, Pence and former President Trump didn't meet for several days, but Pence told the crowd in South Carolina that serving in the administration was \"the greatest honor of my life.\" Pence often used \"we\" and \"our\" when touting their accomplishments. He highlighted their work on jobs, immigration, foreign policy, judicial appointments and COVID-19 vaccines.\u00a0 \"It was four years of consequence, four years of results and four years of promises made and promises kept,\" Pence said.\u00a0 While Pence had only positive things to say about his former boss on Thursday, Mr. Trump told top donors at a Republican National Committee retreat earlier this month that he was \"disappointed\" in Pence for confirming the results of the 2020 election, according to The Washington Post. A senior aide said Pence and the former President have a friendly relationship and have spoken often since they left office, including after Pence's recent heart surgery. \u00a0 The former vice president made only one reference to the January 6 attack during the counting of Electoral College votes, referring to it as a \"tragedy at our nation's Capitol.\" Pence has already plotted out significant steps for his life after the Trump administration. Earlier this month he launched Advancing American Freedom, an organization that he said in a statement will \"promote the pro-freedom policies of the last four years that created unprecedented prosperity at home and restored respect for America abroad.\" Former President Trump said in a brief statement to the Washington Examiner it is \"nice to see Mike highlighting some of our many achievements!\" The former Vice President is also working with the Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative think tank. He has published two columns with the group focused on election integrity and immigration. Pence is also set to launch a podcast later this year with Young America's Foundation (YAF), an organization run by former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. He is also YAF's Ronald Reagan Presidential Scholar and will join the campus lecture program.\u00a0 The possibility of Mr. Trump running to reclaim the White House in 2024 looms large over the other Republican hopefuls who may consider running in 2024. He told conservative personality Dan Bongino on Wednesday that he'll likely make a decision after the 2022 election. On Thursday morning, he did an interview with Fox Business Network, where he repeated false claims that he won the 2020 election, and said he is \"100%\" considering running for President again. \u00a0 Other potential 2024 presidential candidates have been making early moves: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is visiting Pennsylvania next month, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer; Senator Ted Cruz of Texas; Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri; former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Iowa in March; and Senators Rick Scott of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina, who gave the to President Biden's address to a joint session of Congress, also recently traveled to the Hawkeye State in recent weeks. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas is set to travel to Iowa at the end of June, as is former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.\u00a0 Some of the potential 2024 contenders are attending a donor event in Texas next week that's partly organized by prominent GOP strategist Karl Rove, CNBC reported. CBS News has confirmed Pompeo and Senators Cotton and Rick Scott will be among the attendees.\u00a0 In a sign of the former president's influence, Haley recently told reporters that she would back Mr. Trump if he ran in 2024 and wouldn't run for president.\u00a0 Pence leaned heavily on his faith during the speech before the Christian conservative group and said he's optimistic about what's to come for the country. \"God isn't done with America yet,\" Pence said. \"There is a future and the best days for the greatest nation on Earth are yet to come.

            "article_content": "Caitlyn Jenner first moved to California nearly 50 years ago to chase her Olympic dreams. Now she's pursuing a new challenge \u2014 running for California governor. She is one of the highest-profile challengers to Governor Gavin Newsom in the state's upcoming recall election. With no prior political experience, Jenner considers herself a \"disruptor\" and said she has no ties to Sacramento, which she believes is a selling point. \"I think that's a good thing, being from the outside. The insiders who we're talking about as what makes you qualified \u2014 well, these insiders who are qualified... they're the ones responsible for 13.3% tax rates. We have the highest tax rates in the country. We have a homeless crisis in California. They're the ones responsible, not me. I'm going in there to fix those things,\" Jenner told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Anthony Mason. She announced she was running as a Republican for governor of California last month after residents gathered more than a million signatures on a petition to recall Governor Newsom. Recent polls show about half of California's registered voters plan to reject the recall and allow Newsom to finish his term. Since announcing her bid, Jenner hasn't received much traction in the gubernatorial race. A UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies/ LA Times\u00a0poll found that only 6% of Californians surveyed said they would vote for her to replace Newsom. Republicans Kevin Faulconer and John Cox, who are also running for governor, each received 22% support.\u00a0 That isn't slowing Jenner's campaign. But the road to the governor's mansion will require support among Latino voters. Jenner said she has engaged with \"some\" communities and said she has a lot to learn still. \"I have engaged some at this point. Obviously, it is still new, and I have a lot to learn on that subject. I've engaged with all voters. I talk every day to people. I mean, I go to the gas station, and I \u2014 you know, I ask the guy getting on the other side, 'Hey, what, why are you still here? What are the problems with California?' I constantly ask people,\" Jenner said. It's estimated that nearly 1 in 10 California workers are undocumented immigrants. Jenner said she supports offering legal protections to people who are already in the state and have been for years, but without allowing an \"open border.\" \"I would provide protection to the people that are here. They can stay. Legal status, they've been here for years,\" she said. \"What I don't want is I don't want an open border where you have drug lords, you know, terrorists, bad people coming across, MS-13, bad people. We've got to keep that out. I don't want criminals in this country. I want good people. You know what there's a lot of great people, a lot of my friends are.\" Even though they have millions of followers, Jenner told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King she doesn't want her \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" family members engaging in her campaign, and asked her children not to be involved. \"I said, 'Hey, I do not want one tweet... This is my deal.' Not be involved whatsoever... I said if anybody asks any questions in the media, because they are obviously in the media, just say 'No comment.' Address your comments to me,\" Jenner said. Jenner, who came out as a transgender woman in 2015, said the Republican Party is \"wrong\" on efforts to limit access to transgender health care. \"I would obviously, not as governor, follow that,\" Jenner said. \"I think the party's wrong on a lot of [issues]. That's why I'm running as an inclusive candidate.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), announced his resignation on Monday, citing court battles over the legality of his appointment to lead the sprawling bureaucratic juggernaut.  In a message to DHS employees obtained by CBS News, Wolf said he was \"saddened\" to resign and suggested he was effectively forced to do so.\u00a0  \"Unfortunately, this action is warranted by recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as Acting Secretary,\" Wolf wrote. \"These events and concerns increasingly serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power.\"  According to DHS press secretary Chase Jennings, Wolf will remain at the department as head of its policy and planning office, a second post he held while serving as acting secretary. He was confirmed to the under secretary position by the Republican-led Senate in 2019. Wolf's resignation comes three days after a federal judge in California ruled that his appointment as acting secretary in November 2019 was likely unlawful, blocking a set of sweeping asylum restrictions that were slated to take effect Monday.  The Government Accountability Office (GAO), Congress' investigative arm, and other federal courts have also concluded that DHS officials failed to follow legal requirements that dictate leadership appointments when Wolf was installed as acting secretary.\u00a0  Several major Trump administration immigration policies \u2014 including restrictions on work permits for asylum-seekers and the planned suspension of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as minors \u2014 have been blocked by federal judges who determined that Wolf did not have the authority to approve them.  Three days before the court ruling on Friday, Wolf's nomination to be the permanent, Senate-confirmed secretary of homeland secretary was withdrawn by the White House. A Trump administration official with ties to Wolf said the move placed the acting secretary designation on shaky legal grounds, raising concerns about Wolf's ability to continue serving legally in the role.  Pete Gaynor, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will become acting secretary upon Wolf's resignation, which will take effect Monday at midnight. \"Right now, our nation is facing significant challenges and it is our privilege to support the nationwide efforts to fight the pandemic and protect our homeland,\" Gaynor said in a message to FEMA personnel that was obtained by CBS News. \"I know you will not waiver in your dedication to our mission.\" While Ken Cuccinelli is the second-highest ranking official at DHS, his appointment has also been determined to be invalid by the GAO. A federal judge last March separately concluded that Cuccinelli had been unlawfully appointed to his second post as the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Wolf's resignation comes after the departure of two other Cabinet secretaries in the days since the\u00a0attack on the Capitol. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u00a0both stepped down\u00a0from their posts in the wake of the attack.  Since being tapped to lead DHS after the departure of then-acting secretary Kevin McAleenan in November 2019, Wolf has been a loyal supporter of President Trump's immigration agenda, repeatedly touting his department's efforts to restrict asylum eligibility, construct barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border and limit temporary work programs.  Wolf was also a vocal defender of the federal government's aggressive response to anti-racism protests and riots in Portland last summer, when he dispatched DHS agents to the city despite opposition from local Democratic politicians.  In the wake of the deadly assault on the U.S. Capitol by Mr. Trump's supporters last week, Wolf issued a statement strongly condemning the violence and calling on the president to forcefully denounce it. During the attack, Wolf was in Bahrain to broker security and travel agreements with the government there.  A former senior DHS official who was granted anonymity to speak freely said the department had focused on \"things that were politically important to the White House, not the core mission\" during Wolf's tenure.\u00a0 John Sandweg, a former general counsel at DHS during the Obama administration, said Wolf \"leaves behind a tarnished legacy\" due to the department's politicization. \"To try to repair his reputation here with an early departure that perhaps indicates some sort of protest with what happened on January 6 is, I think, too little too late,\" Sandweg told CBS News. But Wolf strongly defended his record in his message to employees Monday, saying his job entailed \"difficult questions\" and \"hard decisions.\" \"Together, we have strengthened border security, reformed our immigration system, stood up a world class cybersecurity agency, increased the worldwide aviation security baseline, enhanced US Coast Guard readiness, countered malign nation-state influence, responded to countless natural disasters, highlighted the vital work of the Federal Protective Service, supported the security of multiple federal and state elections, and continue to respond to a global pandemic,\" he said. Wolf also said DHS is prepared for \"an orderly and smooth transition\" into President-elect Joe Biden's administration. Mr. Biden has tapped Alejandro Mayorkas, a former federal prosecutor and Obama-era DHS official, to lead the department. \u00a0 \"Welcome them, educate them, and learn from them,\" Wolf told DHS employees. \"They are your leaders for the next four years \u2014 a time which undoubtedly will be full of challenges and opportunities to show the American public the value of DHS and why it is worth the investment.\" Nicole Sganga and Arden Farhi contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:   Click\u00a0here\u00a0to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\"   MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on FACE THE NATION, confusion plagues the COVID booster rollout, and challenges continue to hobble the Biden presidency. Poorly orchestrated handling of problems like the Afghanistan pullout, border and immigration problems and unease about his handling of the economy are now taking their toll on America's views of President Biden's effectiveness and competence.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Part of it is dealing with the panoply of things that were landed on my plate. I'm not complaining. It's just a reality.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Now at stake, the centerpiece of the Biden presidency, an economic plan, including that trillion-dollar infrastructure bill, plus, his domestic extravaganza, thee and a half trillion dollars in new spending to boost the economy, paid for by tax increases for corporations and the wealthiest Americans.  Key votes are expected this week in Congress. Will the politics within the Democratic Party threaten the entire Biden agenda?  On top of that, inflation. Millions of Americans still out of work and supply-chain delays due to COVID are all slowing the economic recovery.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I think it's understandable, people being frustrated, frustrated by, you know, \"I thought this was going to be better.\" \"I thought everything was working out.\"  MARGARET BRENNAN: And there is more muddled messaging to clear up when it comes to covid guidance. Just hours after the CDC authorized Pfizer boosters for a limited number of Americans, the President seemed to get ahead of the science.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I think what's going to happen is you're going to see that in the near term--or we're probably going to open this up anyway.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Doctor Rochelle Walensky.  Then bipartisan negotiations on a police reform bill in Congress collapse. What went wrong.\u00a0 We'll ask lead Republican negotiator, Senator Tim Scott.  A leading House Progressive Washington Representative Pramila Jayapal will also be here.  Can the President do a better job of handling crises that are avoidable? We'll get some analysis from John Dickerson.  Finally, the international agenda, as the President promises a new era of relentless diplomacy, we'll talk with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION.\u00a0 \"Messy and confusing\" is how the Wall Street Journal's Editorial Board characterized the Biden administration's booster vaccine plan late last week. But they praised CDC Director Rochelle Walensky for \"the right outcome.\" This is a reference to her decision to include frontline workers with a high risk of exposure among those who are now eligible to receive Pfizer booster shots. Along with adults with underlying conditions and those who are 65 and over.  We go now to the CDC Director, Doctor Rochelle Walensky.\u00a0 She is in Newton, Massachusetts.\u00a0 Good morning to you.  ROCHELLE WALENSKY, M.D. (Director, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/@CDCDirector): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: So can you explain what made you side with the FDA in saying people at high risk of exposure should be eligible to get this third dose when you're own advisory committee did not come to the consensus? And exactly who is high risk?  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Great. So, first let me start by saying that we still have 70 million Americans who are unvaccinated in this country.\u00a0 And these are people who are 10 times the risk of being hospitalized, and 11 times more likely to die. So we have hard work in making sure we get those people vaccinated. But as I'm here to talk about boosters, let's-- let's get to protecting the people to optimize people who have already been vaccinated. So, there is a scientific process. We have an FDA advisory board meeting. They then provide the regulatory authorization and then it comes to a CDC advisory meeting. And then I provide those recommendations.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: And there has been remarkable consensus in-- in a lot of those discussions, people over the age of sixty-five, people at high-risk conditions and where there was some real scientific discussion, and a scientific close call was for those people who are at high risk of living by virtue of where they live or where they work. And because of that close call and because of all the evidence we reviewed both of the FDA and at the CDC, I felt it was appropriate for those people to also be eligible for boosters. So, who are those people? Those are people who live and work in high-risk settings, that includes people in homeless shelters, people in group homes, people in prisons, but also, importantly, are people who work for-- work with vulnerable communities. So, our health care workers, our teachers, our grocery workers, our public transportation employees.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, teachers. Does that make other people living with unvaccinated children should also be considered high risk? Does that make parents living with unvaccinated kids high risk?  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: The-- the recommendations were not intended for that population.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: It's really for people who are working all the time with many different people who might be unvaccinated, might be at-- and high risk and really the vulnerable community, the vulnerable occupations like our health care workers, our teachers, our public transportation.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the-- the category just seems very broad. So that's why I want to give some real-world examples here. Should a healthy twenty-year-old male who waits tables at a restaurant, for example, go out and get a vaccine, a third dose?  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: You know this is really where we made-- we made it possible for people to be eligible, but they really have to identify their own individual risk and they own-- their own individual benefit. And I recognize that this is confusing, and we have a lot of resources available with your pharmacist, with your physicians, with your public health departments and with the CDC. So really, I would try and get a sense from that individual. What kind of community? How much? How much are people wearing masks? Are there masks in the restaurant? Is-- are people generally vaccinated in that community to make a personal decision about whether that person wants to be vaccinated?  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, a forty--  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Or boosted.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --a forty-year-old parent living with unvaccinated kids, though, you said not necessarily necessary for them to get a booster.  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: No, not yet. And we will have more data forthcoming and, of course, we will be looking at those data on an ongoing basis in real time and updating those guidances. But if that forty-year-old parent does not meet eligibility for some other reason then I would say it's not time for that person to get vaccinated.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But so, you can understand that--  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Boosted. I'm sorry, boosted.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Boosted. Boosted. Yes, I understood what you meant there, but-- but you can understand when--  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --the President stands up there and says, \"we're probably going to open this up anyway.\" And you're saying, wait and see. There's some confusion. Are-- are you going to recommend boosters for the general population?  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: You know I recognize that confusion. Right now our recommendation is for these limited people in the population, over sixty five high-risk workers, high-risk community occupations, as well as high risk by comorbidities. We are evaluating this science in real time. We are meeting, you know, every-- several weeks now to evaluate the science. The science may very well show that the rest of the population needs to be boosted and we will provide those guidances as soon as we have the science to inform them.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, for those who didn't come to the consensus at the CDC that the view that you did, what are the risks that they're looking at? What is the risk for that twenty-year-old going out and getting a third booster, a third dose?  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Yeah. So that's a great question. So, you know, as we've looked at the risks, benefit, and safety profiles of people who have gotten third doses, we have a lot of experience from other countries. Israel has vaccinated millions of people now with third doses, and we've actually vaccinated here up to two and a half million people now with third doses. So, we just don't have as long of a duration of safety for those third doses. But what I can tell you is so far in the twenty thousand people we've looked at; the safety signals are exactly the same as what we've seen for the second dose. So-- and we've vaccinated over a hundred and sixty million people with mRNA vaccines in this country. We have an extraordinary amount of safety data. So, you know, some in-- some scientists may say, wait, we want to wait and see what more safety data come in, what-- whether there is a true benefit to be seen in-- in-- in trials and effectiveness. But there's extraordinary data to demonstrate the safety of these vaccines and, in fact, that they work. So if you're in a high-risk position, I would absolutely--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: --recommend you get the boost.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- so when-- when you are talking about the formulation of the vaccine, you're saying the second and the third dose are the same thing. Does that change as the virus continues to mutate? Should we all be prepared that we all will need to go get boosters every single year?  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: I want to emphasize that our goal right now is to stay ahead of the virus. We want to boost now so we don't end up in a vulnerable place, but your question is an important one and it's one we don't necessarily have the answer for yet. We are working to stay ahead of the virus. We will see if we can get the amount of transmission down in this country and truly around the world, which we are also working to do then we are anticipating and hoping that we will not have more mutations that will require more boosting in the future.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I appreciate at the outset you laid out the bureaucratic process that-- that happens within the government to say yes or no on these vaccines. But we're in the middle of a national health crisis where trust has been diminished where clarity and communication is so important. Was this the right way to actually get this done? I mean almost every day we had a different message on whether to take the booster or not.  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Yeah, I want to actually articulate that this is not the bureaucratic process; this is the scientific process. You have scientific experts, academicians who are talking about at the FDA advisory committee. The FDA puts its authorization. You have academicians, people working their entire career in immunology and vaccinology, informing the CDC. I think that this is an important scientific process and an important scientific dialogue. It has been scrutinized. It's been watched in ways that it has never been before--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: --but this has been the process that has held us in good stead. And that I think is important for people who might-- and-- and it's very transparent. And I think it's important for people to understand and be able to watch the science, so they have confidence in the process.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You said back in March you had a feeling of impending doom. You got-- took a lot of flak for saying that in those terms but--  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Indeed.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --but we were on the cusp of the Delta surge. We are now back at two thousand deaths a day. How do you feel now?  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Look, you look at states around this country and you see places that are using crisis standards of care. That is not-- and that means that we are talking about who is going to get a ventilator, who is going to get an ICU bed. Those are not easy discussions to have, and that is not a place we want our health care system to ever be. And we are working--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that-- is that what you meant when you said impending doom, what you're seeing now? Crisis levels of care?  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: In some states, yes. They are running out of beds. And when you see that, you worry that people may not be able to come in and get the proper care if they have a motor vehicle accident or if they're having a heart attack. And that is why we are working so hard in areas that have high levels of disease where they can't. Their health care systems are in-- in dire straits; that working to get-- get assistance to them, working to get those communities vaccinated. Because, as I noted, people who are not vaccinated are ten times more likely to be in the hospital. Our hospitals are filled with unvaccinated people.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Infections among children five to eleven are at the highest they've ever seen on a weekly basis, according to your agency's data. Are schools vectors of transmission? Is this where kids are getting sick?  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Our science has actually demonstrated that the disease generally comes in from the community, and that when schools are practicing the proper mitigation and prevention strategies, it's not where the transmission is actually happening. So just this week we had two studies published. Over ninety-six percent of schools just in this school year have been able to remain open. And, yet, we also published a study out of Arizona that demonstrated that places that had no masks in place were three and a half times more likely to have outbreaks--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: --than places that did have masks in place. So we know how to keep them safe. And when we don't use the proper mitigation strategies, they're more likely to have outbreaks and have to close.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Just very quickly before I let you go: Should kids go trick or treating on Halloween? Is it safe?  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Oh, gosh, I certainly hope so. If you're able to be outdoors, absolutely. Limit crowds. I wouldn't necessarily go to a crowded-- a crowded Halloween party--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: --but I think that we should be able to let our kids go trick or treating in small groups. And-- and-- and I hope that we can do that this year. Before I go: If you're not vaccinated, please get vaccinated. If you're eligible for a boost, go get your boost.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Walensky, thank you for your time this morning.  ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Thank you so much.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute. Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: A top agenda item for President Biden, the bipartisan push for police reform following the killing of George Floyd collapsed last week when Democrats, led in the Senate by New Jersey's Cory Booker, ended talks with Republicans. President Biden laid the blame on Republicans, saying they \"\u2026rejected enacting modest reforms which even the previous president had supported\u2026\" We spoke earlier with the top Republican negotiator, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: What happened? This country was supposed to be at a moment of reckoning--  SENATOR TIM SCOTT (R-South Carolina/@SenatorTimScott): Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --at the relationship between police and the Black community. Why did you miss the moment?  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: I'm not sure why they missed the moment. I have been at this table twice already. They've walked away twice. They did this a year ago and they're doing it again now.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're blaming Democrats--  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: I can't--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --for the failure of police reform.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: I can't understand-- well, we-- we should ask ourselves how do we get there at all? It's the big blue cities where they have failed to pass policies that protect their most vulnerable communities. Think about Minneapolis, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Portland, Seattle. This problem came to the federal government because of the failure of blue mayors and liberal city council members for us to get here. So what we've decided to do was to stay at the table and look for common ground. We found common ground, we found common ground on military equipment, we found common ground on chokeholds, we found common ground on providing PTSD assistance and mental health and co-responders. We found common ground on a number of areas. Instead of moving forward on the areas where we were in agreement they just simply walked away.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you just detailed all those points of-- of agreement.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cory Booker, who was your partner in this--  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --I mean this started under the Trump administration and continued under the Biden administration.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Exactly.  MARGARET BRENNAN: When Republicans in control, it went nowhere. Democrats in control, it's going nowhere.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: But both times, the person-- the folks that left the table were the Democrats. Let's just be clear that we have stayed at the table. We said simply this: I am not going to participate in reducing funding for the police after we saw major city after major city defund the police. Many provisions in this bill that he wanted me to agree to limited or reduced funding for the police. That's a lose-lose proposition. When you reduce funding for police, you actually lose lives in the communities. Our approach was a win-win approach. We want the best wearing the badge and we want the vulnerable protected. So when you tie funding losses in this legislation, you should expect an allergic reaction from me.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But they would say that there wasn't a net loss of funding. In fact, there was funding being increased in terms of increased mental health funding, specifically. That there were specific programs for recruitment and training funding increases, body-worn camera funding increases, data collection.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Yes, all--  MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's not cutting funding. It might be allocating it in different ways.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Actually, here's what we know. We have about a billion dollars in grant money that goes to police. When you start saying in order to receive those dollars, you must do A, B and C. And if you don't do A, B, and C, you literally lose eligibility for the two major pots of money the Byrne grants and the COP grants. When you tell local law enforcement agencies that you are ineligible for money, that's defunding the police, there's no way to spin that. You can spin it by saying--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But this would codify the Trump executive orders.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Let me-- let me-- let me finish. Let me finish. The Trump executive order I actually agree to. What I did not agree to was the cuts that come from noncompliance. When you say once again that in order for you to receive the money for the Byrne grants or the COP grants, you must do the following, and if you don't do the following you lose money--that's more defunding the police. We saw that tried throughout the country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You do want to cut funding for underperformance, is what you're saying?  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Not at all. I would say--  MARGARET BRENNAN: You would want to increase to police departments that aren't doing what they are supposed to be doing?  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Let's look at-- let's look at what we're asking for. What the Democrats asked for was a simple thing. They asked for more reporting on serious bodily injury to death. I said, that's a great idea. When they wanted to nationalize local policing, I said, that's a bad idea. When they say that every single traffic stop in this country must be reported to the federal government, whether it's a traffic ticket or stopping someone on the-- on the streets of New York or Charleston--every single time that you have any interaction, for the federal government to be in charge of all that information, I say, let's do it, but let's do it voluntarily.  MARGARET BRENNAN: People at home watching this say this was a moment that was missed. This just looks like it's playing politics again. I mean--  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: I do think they're playing politics. You're right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But what about Republicans here? Because I know you're saying you're at the table--  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: We're at the table--  MARGARET BRENNAN: You are at the table, but when you're coming back to defunding the police--  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Here's a-- here's-- here's the fact.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --which was a very effective political line.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: No. It's actually part of their legislation.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it this--  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Now, Margaret, if we're going to be fair to the American people to get the whole story--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But to-- but let me just finish my question.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: --you have to allow me to have a conversation about the issue that I've been working on for the last two years.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you the question.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: I'm going to give you the answer to defunding the police.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is-- but isn't this just Republicans not wanting to look--  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: The defunding of the police is a very--  MARGARET BRENNAN: --like they are being soft on crime ahead of the 2020 races?  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Of course not, that's the answer to the question. No.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that part of your calculation at all?  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Not at all. Why would you-- why would I be at a table? I'm the-- I'm the person who has lived in the communities that we're talking about. I'm the person who has experienced the challenges that we are trying to solve. I'm the person who understands and appreciates this issue intimately. If you want to keep our community safe, you have to properly fund the police.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The issue that for-- for you sunk all of this had to do with funding related to data collection about traffic stops--  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: No.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --at the national level?  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Absolutely not. I gave you-- you asked me for specificity. I gave you an example. There are--  MARGARET BRENNAN: There were other things.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: There were eight or-- eight or nine issues-- eight or nine parts of the bill were the answer the Democrats put on the table was reducing the funding to the police. When you have one issue, we can work that out. When you have eight different areas of the legislation that reduces funding--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: --that's a different conversation. Now you're talking about defunding the police. You may not like that as a statement, but it's actually what you can read in the language of the bill.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But Senator Booker has said on MSNBC that the funding increases--  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: All you have to do is actually read the areas of the bill that actually reduce the funding--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: --that's-- that's-- that's available.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, obviously, that's a big point of disagreement between the two of you and the interpretation.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Only if you can't read.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying Senator Booker can't read?  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: I'm only saying that if you read the legislation, it's pretty simple. This is not something that I'm making up and we can debate our facts. We can actually say, in several different areas of the bill, it reduces funding.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to also ask you about immigration. You didn't seem to have a problem when President Trump adopted Title 42, which allows for those migrants crossing the border to be expelled without first being guaranteed asylum hearings. This was all justified under the pandemic. The Biden administration kept those things in place. Do you have a problem with what the Biden administration is doing with the expulsion of migrants now?  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: I was for a strong border under President Trump. I'm for a strong border right now under President Biden.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So you, when it comes to this question of the Haitian migrants that the-- the White House has basically said it's embarrassed about what has happened in the past week and a half, do you think that it's justified? And what you have seen on camera with some of these thousands of Haitian migrants being forcibly expelled, some of them rounded up by men on horseback. Is what you're seeing humane?  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: I think President Biden and his administration owns a crisis that they've created at the border, the humanitarian crisis that's unfolding before every eye in the-- in the American public--  MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's the same policies--  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: --is-- is-- is embarrassing.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --under the Trump administration.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: The treatment, obviously, is different. That's why his people have resigned from their post. It's the responsibility of the President--  MARGARET BRENNAN: The envoy for Haiti, you're talking about there.  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Thank you. It is the responsibility of the President to secure our borders. President Biden has not done so. The crisis of his own making looks very similar to the one that he made in Afghanistan, the one we're experiencing right now with taxing, the one we're experiencing with spending. So, yes, this President should do a much better job of avoiding crises that are avoidable.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to button that up though, the President has said those people he's talking about, the men on horseback who at times it looked like they were whipping some of these Haitian migrants who were running. He said, \"I promise you those people will pay.\" Those agents--should those agents pay? Did what those agents do look wrong to you?  SENATOR TIM SCOTT: I certainly think he should hold accountable his agency-- his agency. Absolutely.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We have invited Senator Booker to appear next week to respond to Senator Scott, we'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Late yesterday afternoon an Amtrak train carrying a hundred and fifty-seven people derailed neared Joplin, Montana, killing three people and injuring at least thirty. The train was traveling from Seattle to Chicago when it went off the tracks. Now, the NTSB is preparing to send a team to Montana to investigate. We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. So stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Congressional Democrats are in a stalemate over spending priorities. Progressives say two-- three and a half trillion worth of social environmental spending is the top priority. Moderates want to finish up that one-trillion-dollar infrastructure package that has passed the Senate and could get a vote in the House this week. Moderates also say the three-and-a-half-trillion price tag is too steep for the other package and needs to be paid for. We're also headed for a government shutdown later this week unless Congress can agree on an extension of funding when the fiscal year ends. So, a very busy week ahead of her and now Pramila Jayapal of Washington is leading the progressives in the House and joins us on set. Good morning to you.  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-Washington/@RepJayapal): Good morning, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, I want to get to this very busy agenda, but, first, have your reaction to the conversation we just had on-- on police reform. Senator Scott, specifically, referred to the City of Seattle--  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --right in your district as an example of what goes wrong when you cut funding. The city did cut the police budget eighteen percent. Crime did go up. The mayor has asked for more money, but does the senator have a point when he says this just shows it is not time to reduce funding for police?  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Margaret, I just have to take everyone back to eight minutes and forty-six seconds. That's what we're talking about, the eight minutes and forty-six seconds that led to George Floyd's murder. The chokeholds and everything that have been happening across the country with Breonna Taylor. And the reality is we need real accountability. And I think that Senator Scott was just not willing to admit that he doesn't want real accountability for our law enforcement to treat people humanely with dignity. And we've got to transform public safety in this country, or we are not going to give black and brown people a fair shot.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And he argued Democrats were the ones to walk away. We're going to check in on that conversation next week again. I want to get on to the business right ahead of you. Democrats control the White House, the Senate, the House. Slim majority, as you know. President Biden said to reporters on Friday that he told progressives and moderates who met with him this week that they need to focus less on the number and more on their priorities. Speaker Pelosi said today that it is self-evident this bill will not be three and a half trillion dollars. Have you agreed to compromise and give up some of your requests?  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Yeah, you know what we've said is we are happy to hear what it is that somebody wants to cut. They-- so far we have not seen any negotiation back from the Senate, and we understand Margaret, that we've got to get every Democrat on board in the House and the Senate. We don't have the margins to do anything except that. So, we've put out our vision. And I think the key thing is not the top line number. It's what is it that you actually want to fund--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL: --because if you want childcare, if you want paid leave, if you want to take on climate change, if you want to repair housing in this country, if you want to make sure people have health care, there's going to be a price tag that goes with it so.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it will be less than three and a half trillion, as the speaker suggested.  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Well, let's talk about what people want and then let's come to the number from that. It's not just a random number. So if somebody wants less than three and a half trillion, tell us what you want to cut. Do you want to cut the child care? Do you want to cut paid leave? What is it you want to cut? And then let's figure it out from there. But President Biden also said something very important the other day, which is this is a zero-dollar bill because it's going to be completely paid for with taxes on the wealthiest and the-- the largest corporations.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The Joint Committee on Taxation says, actually, that in raising this revenue taxes could go up at least two percent on those making between two hundred thousand and five hundred thousand dollars a year. It also will raise taxes for corporations and-- and those who are wealthier. So it's not no cost.  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Well, what the President has said is people making under four hundred thousand will not pay more. We will make sure of that in the package that we put together. But we do want people who are making billions through the profits, not reporting their taxes, not being held accountable by the IRS to pay their fair share. That's really all it is.  MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to the things that you have to prioritize, what about free community college? The President threw that out as an example--  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Yeah.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --and mentioned means testing, adjusting for cost of living and things like that. Are you open to that?  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL: We're open to whatever negotiation is out there, but on means testing we saw what happened when we put in tons of barriers in the rental assistance program. People didn't get it. If you have a twenty-five-page document that somebody has to go through to figure out--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL: --whether or not they qualified, the most vulnerable are not going to get the assistance they need. So, I think we should be universal in our programs, make sure people get the benefits immediately and make it as easy as possible to get this assistance out to the people who need it the most.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I do want to ask you about immigration. Homeland Security said four thousand Haitians have been forcibly expelled back to their home country. Others, some of them will be appearing before a judge. Are you satisfied, though, with how the administration is handling this crisis and the fact that they're keeping the same pandemic-era regulations as the Trump administration?  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL: I am not. I think we have a responsibility to be humane and compassionate and create alternatives, pathways for people to be able to get here who are struggling. Sending people back to a country that has been torn apart where there is no food, no water, no opportunity is not the way to handle this. So, I am looking for the administration to come out with humane pathways and alternatives in those countries to be able to get people here quickly and to be able to make sure that we are upholding our values as a country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, good luck in the week ahead. We'll be watching the negotiations. Thank you for your--  REPRESENTATIVE PRAMILA JAYAPAL: Thank you, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --time today.  And we want to dig deeper into the President's challenges. A Gallup poll out this week has his approval at forty-three percent, which is the lowest in his presidency. Who other would we turn to than chief political analyst John Dickerson, who joins us this morning from New York. John, how are you?  JOHN DICKERSON (CBS News Chief Political Analyst/@jdickerson): Good morning, Margaret. I'm well.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Democrats have control here. We knew, as we were just speaking about with the congresswoman that there are some disagreements within the party itself. How does the President solve this?  JOHN DICKERSON: Well, he solves it by convincing the party to do as much as it can, given the tight political realities, the congresswoman mentioned them. They are those narrow margins in Congress. And they need to do this because failure would be worse. Congresswoman Jayapal gave the progressive view. She represents the progressives. The other side is represented by Terry McAuliffe. He'd like to be governor again in Virginia. He was also chairman of the party. And he told Jonathan Martin of The New York Times. He said, \"Voters didn't send Democrats to Washington to sit around and chitty chat all day. They need to get this done.\" He was talking about infrastructure. A host of policies he thinks are important, but he's also making a political case. His argument is the districts that are battlegrounds in the next election and the states that are have a more diverse electorate. It's not packed full of progressives, and that Democrats need to appeal to that more diverse electorate. Joe Biden has a lot of challenges, including the Republicans that don't want to work with him. But these challenges are all within his own party.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  JOHN DICKERSON: He is the leader of that party and these are challenges he has to solve.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you put your finger on why there is this rush to get things done between-- before 2022, but this new poll out from Pew shows that the President's approval rating is down with young voters, some fourteen percentage points since July, down sixteen points among Latinos, eighteen points among African-Americans. These groups really helped deliver the White House to President Biden. So, how can he deal with anger among these particular parts of the electorate?  JOHN DICKERSON: You know when you go to a political rally and somebody shouts into a bullhorn, \"what do we want?\" Nobody shouts back incremental progress. The people who turn out-- the people who turn out in mid-term elections, Terry McAuliffe has his view. He says it's a more diverse electorate. What progressives will say is in mid-term elections, the people who turn out are your most ardent supporters. And those are the people who really care at a human level about these programs. The congresswoman was just talking about them. They see the human cost of not having child care paid for or not having a good start in pre-kindergarten. They also wonder what power is worth. If they did all this work to put Joe Biden and the Democrats in power, and these programs are broadly popular as polling shows, why did they do all this work if they're getting such weak tea from Washington? And so, this is also a challenge for the President. Even if he can get some things passed--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  JOHN DICKERSON: --he has to worry about those progressives. He needs to be out there working hard. And so one of the challenges will be even if something gets passed, how the President and the party sort of bind up their own bruises and convince progressives that they got as much as they could and that they should keep fighting.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But, you know, it's not just about the aspirations of what needs to change. It's the lived experience what people are going through now. On their kitchen tables, they're seeing the cost of food has gone up. You know they are experiencing some of the economic slowdown. So is it too soon to say that the President is underdelivering, you know, eight months in? How do we judge where we are now?  JOHN DICKERSON: Well, there is a-- there is a paradox in the presidency, which is the President should be judge-- judged very heavily because he is the only place everybody can take their complaints. He represents the whole country. And so he should get the pressure off this because it has a political benefit: It motivates his team. It focuses the mind. On the other hand, this President, like all Presidents, inherited a whole host of challenges. And so we need to be smart about how we-- we see where those challenges are coming from. Not all of them are coming from the presidency.  MARGARET BRENNAN: John Dickerson, always great to chat with you. Thank you.  We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. and China appear headed towards confrontation. To push back against China's military buildup in the Pacific, President Biden brokered a new defense partnership with Australia, and will sell it stealth nuclear-powered submarines. That decision came at the expense of U.S. ally France. We spoke with Australia's prime minister on Thursday.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Prime Minister, thank you for joining us.  SCOTT MORRISON (Prime Minister of Australia/@ScottMorrisonMP): Thank you. It's great to be here.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What is the biggest threat you see from China?  SCOTT MORRISON: Well, we-- we're resilient to foreign interference. We're resilient to whether their-- their attacks that come through-- from-- from cyber or other forms of foreign interference. Any sovereign country would be.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So why do you need U.S.-made nuclear submarines?  SCOTT MORRISON: Because Australia's defenses depend on having a long range. I mean Australia is a long way from everywhere, and in order to ensure that our security interests are best protected, we need to have a long reach and a long range.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you needed them faster than what the French were delivering you. That's what led to this big diplomatic blowup with the French. You switched to nuclear-powered submarines--  SCOTT MORRISON: That's right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --that can police longer distances.  SCOTT MORRISON: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're talking about in China's backyard. You need some military support here, no?  SCOTT MORRISON: Conventional submarines can no longer meet that need with the changed strategic environment in the Indo-Pacific.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're buying these nuclear submarines. Are you looking an arms race with China because that is what the Chinese have warned that that is what this is a signal of?  SCOTT MORRISON: No. What we're doing is we'll be moving from our existing conventional fleet of submarines, our Collins-class submarines and over time to be able to replace that with a-- with a fleet of nuclear submarines with-- with--  MARGARET BRENNAN: Because China has built up its military.  SCOTT MORRISON: --with higher capability. There's been an increased militarization of the Indo-Pacific for many, many years and-- and we've seen that escalating for some time. And so the escalation predates our decision.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you concerned that this could be read by China as a reason to feel more threatened? Do you think this puts a target on your back?  SCOTT MORRISON: Well, I believe it should be. And that's really our point. Australia has every right to take decisions in our sovereign interests to provide for our defenses, to work with our partners, to create a more stable region.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect retaliation for this?  SCOTT MORRISON: I see no reason why there should be.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You haven't spoken to the Chinese president in well over a year.  SCOTT MORRISON: Mm-Hm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Things are not very friendly at the moment.  SCOTT MORRISON: Yeah. Well, the phone's always open at our end. The door's already-- is always open at our end. There is no Australian obstacle to direct dialogue at a political level between Australia and China. But that opportunity the China side have not shown an interest in, but they're always welcome when they wish to.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Would he take your call?  SCOTT MORRISON: Whose?  MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you tried to call the Chinese president?  SCOTT MORRISON: That-- those-- those opportunities have been available for-- for years, but that-- that's not something they're interested in at the moment, that's their choice.  MARGARET BRENNAN: He doesn't want to take a call right now.  SCOTT MORRISON: No.  MARGARET BRENNAN: How real is the threat of a hot war? Of military conflict in your region of the world?  SCOTT MORRISON: I certainly don't see it as inevitable and I think it's all completely avoidable. And those issues, though, are going to be resolved principally between the United States and China.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So the French government made clear they were not happy they lost this contract for submarines--  SCOTT MORRISON: Sure.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --and the U.S. and Australia, U.K. as well, have inked one. A defense contractor in France says it's sending you a bill for 66 billion dollars. Do you intend to pay that?  SCOTT MORRISON: Wow. I think that's a rather extraordinary claim. It's simple.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think there's any wrongdoing?  SCOTT MORRISON: No. We-- we had a contract for procuring submarines that had gates in the contract which gave us the option. Had we proceeded, then as prime minister, I would have been negligent because I would have been going forward with a massive and very costly contract that would not have done the job that Australia needed to be done.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you regret not being more transparent or direct when-- Australians are known for being direct?\u00a0  SCOTT MORRISON: We are.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Why weren't you direct with the French president?\u00a0  SCOTT MORRISON: Well, I-- you should be assuming I was.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Saying, you're going to-- you're going to lose us?  SCOTT MORRISON: And-- and I have been. We were very clear that we had deep concerns that conventional submarines would no longer do the job. We had discussions about that. And at the end of the day, we didn't see the situation the same.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.  SCOTT MORRISON: French, obviously, thought their submarine could still do the job. We didn't believe that was the case. And as a result, we decided not to proceed.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Australia is one of the few Western democracies that has really put in place some very, very strict COVID protocols. You shut down your borders 18 months ago. When will they reopen? Are you going to have vaccine passports? When will Australians be able to leave?  SCOTT MORRISON: We will see our international borders, particularly for Australians to leave and return, and Australians who are overseas who have been vaccinated to return and that will occur before the end of the year, and it could happen well before then. With the vaccines, that is improving our resilience and-- and we'll be able to open up those borders. But I'll tell you what shutting those borders did. It saved over 30,000 lives in Australia. Almost-- it's around about 1200 Australians have lost their lives to COVID. That is what is lost in a day here in the United States.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Culturally, there's this huge difference. You talk about shutting your borders. You will go into quarantine when you return home to Australia.  SCOTT MORRISON: Correct.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think less liberty is medically necessary? We have a huge argument over that in this country. Why did you think it was worth it in Australia?  SCOTT MORRISON: Thirty-thousand lives is the simple answer.  MARGARET BRENNAN: People in this country won't wear masks.  SCOTT MORRISON: That's a matter for the United States.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But what do you attribute that difference culturally to?  SCOTT MORRISON: Well, look, we're different societies. I think we are different societies. I mean we're great friends and we share beliefs and values that we hold dear. We're a very pragmatic nation. And I can tell you the virus doesn't care what you believe. The virus cares about how it can come and take your life. And in Australia, we've introduced what we believe are practical controls that have saved tens of thousands of lives. And I think the proof of those decisions is in the results.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The Delta variant is really challenging.  SCOTT MORRISON: It is.  MARGARET BRENAN: Some of the record, though. I mean Sydney again in lockdown.  SCOTT MORRISON: Yeah. True.  MARGARET BRENNAN: In Melbourne this week, you did have some protests--  SCOTT MORRISON: We did.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --against mandates. So, is there just sort of an exhaustion level here politically that makes it difficult for you to try to control the virus?  SCOTT MORRISON: The Delta variant is the game changer. We have had a lot of success with COVID in managing the virus pre Delta. But when Delta hit, it was-- it changed everything. And so, regrettably, we've had lockdowns in our two biggest cities in Sydney-- Sydney and Melbourne now for-- for many months, and we're looking forward to the end of that. And those restrictions are already starting to ease. And the vaccination program, which has been running successfully, our rates of vaccination on a daily basis per capita have even exceeded those that were achieved in the United States and the United Kingdom at their peak. And so that is getting us to a place where we'll be able to open again.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We also spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan during his trip to the U.S. last week. Turkey was the U.S. ally in Afghanistan, where Turkish forces had protected the Kabul airport before the U.S. withdrew. We asked Erdo\u011fan about working with the new Taliban government.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: You said, it back in August, for sure, the Taliban's views won't be the same as they were 20 years ago. But the Taliban is only letting boys go back to school, not girls. They've told women not to show up for work in government positions. It doesn't look like the Taliban has evolved. Can you do business with a government like this?  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN (President of Turkey/@RTErdogan/through translator): Madam, Turkey's approach to women's issues is quite well known. Women are present in every aspect of life. Our views would apply to Afghanistan as well. Whenever women become more involved, more active in every aspect of life, we can support them. If they would need us in health care and security and in other walks of life and if they need, we could support them in terms of education in our country.  MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you don't want to do business with the Taliban at this point?  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: About the issues that I've just listed, if they shall be agreed on, if they will be accepted and recognized, we can do business, but, if not, we won't do business with them.  MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden is a constant critic of human rights abuses. Has he ever asked you to improve your treatment of journalists, or anything specific?  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: No, he didn't. And because we don't have any problems of that nature. In terms of freedoms Turkey is incomparably free.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Committee to Protect Journalists says that you rank second only to China when it comes to jailing journalists. Worse than Iran. Worse than Saudi Arabia.  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: Well, sorry, then I won't accept this. And these associations, these unions--uh, statements, and disclosures are not shared by me, because Turkey doesn't have such a situation.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, human rights lawyers say you have a hundred thousand Turkish citizens who are being investigating just for insulting you.  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: Do you believe these?  MARGARET BRENNAN: International organizations, credible ones are coming out with these statements.  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: Well, I know those credible international organizations that have no credit for me--  MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States government has said these things.  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: Well, you're being deceived actually, and you're led to believe. Are you looking at the source of these allegations? Are you researching these claims? Please do, if you're not, ask these questions.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You think the U.S. State Department is not credible when it criticizes human rights abuses in Turkey?  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: Well, I don't, because in order for me to believe that it's a credible claim or a statement, my country's organizations, actual findings are important.  MARGARET BRENNAN: When you came to Washington in 2017, you were on camera when you were watching those protesters get beaten. Those American protesters. There were Secret Service officers who were injured as a result. Do you understand that in the eyes of the American public, that's completely unacceptable?  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: Well, sorry, but, they're-- not the Secret Service. And as press members, please consider the attacks against the Turkish citizens.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But I'm talking about the video that was shown in households around this country. When they turned on the evening news, they saw you stand there while those protesters were being beaten. Do you understand why that hurt Turkey?  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: I wasn't standing there. I wasn't standing there. I was just following the incidents, but I wasn't standing there. We need to be honest. We need to speak the truth.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you approve of it?  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: And I was not inside that crowd.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that appropriate?  RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: On the contrary, our citizens were attacked and the American security forces, aggressively attacked the Turkish citizens and I told this to the American authorities.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for watching. We'll see you next week. ",

            "article_content": "Michael Wood, one of the Republicans running in the special election in Texas' 6th congressional district, is hoping to stand out in the race as an anti-Trump Republican, he told CBSN on Thursday.\u00a0 \"It's time for us to move past this man,\" Wood said in an interview with CBSN's Anne-Marie Green and Vladimir Duthiers. \"I think that we need to do that now before we lose to Democrats in the midterms next year and the presidential election after that.\"\u00a0 Wood, who is a Marine combat veteran and small business owner, is one of more than 22 candidates running in the state's special election to succeed Congressman Ron Wright, who died in February from complications from COVID-19. The North Texas seat represents the Dallas-Fort Worth area and has been held by Republicans since 1983.\u00a0 \"I'm in this race because this is the first battle for the soul of the Republican party,\" Wood said. The candidate's decision to pursue politics is what he said was expedited following the tone and certain policies of Trump's presidential term, including the January 6\u00a0insurrection, which Wood said former President Trump \"bears direct responsibility for.\" His campaign in Tarrant County, Texas \u00a0\u2014 which still accounts for many pro-Trump Republican voters\u00a0 \u2014   is what Wood described as a \"tall mountain\" to climb. However, Wood said that 30 to 35% of the Republican Party has indicated that they too are ready to move on from the previous president.\u00a0 \"Frankly I've been surprised with the number of people who have come up to me and said that they had been waiting on someone to say the things that I am saying; a Republican to speak plainly about what's happened in our country especially over the past few months,\" Wood said.\u00a0 Aside from anti-Trump pillars of his campaign, the Midland, Texas native also is pushing for a more modest infrastructure plan than President Joe Biden's $2 trillion dollar proposal. He said that infrastructure problems in the nation and in his state, which saw major issues in the past year, can be addressed with a plan in the range of $300 to $500 billion dollars.\u00a0 The veteran, who was deployed in Afghanistan for two tours, also said that he agreed with Mr. Biden's recent decision to withdraw troops from Afghanistan after the 20 years spent fighting in the country against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. \"We can have a robust anti-terrorism policy towards Afghanistan that doesn't require an incredible amount of troops on the ground,\" Wood said. \"I think this is just, from a moral and a strategic point of view, the right move but it is very difficult.\" Wood also told CBSN that he supports Mr. Trump's \"Remain in Mexico\" policy and said that he hopes that it will be reinstated. The policy, also referred to as the Migrant Protection Protocols, was first implemented in January 2019 and sent asylum seekers to return back to Mexico while waiting for their U.S. immigration proceedings. \"This isn't going to be solved through litigation,\" Wood said. \"The immigration problem as a whole ultimately has to be solved through Congress, through legislation.\"\u00a0 In a little more than two weeks, Wood face against two former Trump administration officials, 11 Republicans, and 10 Democrats in the polls at the state's special all-party election.

            "article_content": "Toronto \u2014 Canadians gave Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party a victory in Monday's parliamentary elections, but his gamble to win a majority of seats failed. The Liberals were on track to win the most seats of any party. The 49-year-old Trudeau channeled the star power of his father, the Liberal icon and late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, when he first won election in 2015 and has led his party to the top finish in two elections since.   Trudeau's Liberals were leading or elected in 157 seats - exactly the same number they won in 2019, but 13 short of the 170 needed for a majority in the House of Commons.  The Conservatives were leading or elected in 121 seats, the same number they won in 2019. The leftist New Democrats were leading or elected in 29, a gain of five seats, while the Quebec-based Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was down three at 28 and the Greens remained at two seats. Trudeau didn't win enough seats to avoid having to rely on help from other parties to pass legislation. Trudeau entered the election leading a stable minority government that wasn't under threat of being toppled.   The opposition was relentless in accusing Trudeau of calling an unnecessary early vote - two years before the deadline - for his own personal ambition. Trudeau bet Canadians didn't want a Conservative government during a pandemic. Canada is now among the most fully vaccinated countries in the world. Trudeau's government spent hundreds of billions of dollars to prop up the economy amid lockdowns, and he argued that the Conservatives' approach, which has been skeptical of lockdowns and vaccine mandates, would be dangerous. And he says Canadians need a government that follows science. At an election night party, Trudeau told supporters, \"You are sending us back to work with a clear mandate to get Canada through this pandemic. I hear you when you say you just want to get back to the things you love and not worry about this pandemic or an election.\" Conservative leader Erin O'Toole didn't require his party's candidates to be vaccinated and wouldn't say how many were unvaccinated. O'Toole described vaccination as a personal health decision, but a growing number of vaccinated Canadians are increasingly upset with those who refuse to get vaccinated.   Trudeau supports making vaccines mandatory for Canadians to travel by air or rail, something the Conservatives oppose. And Trudeau has pointed out that Alberta, run by a Conservative provincial government, is in crisis.  Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, an ally of O'Toole, said the province might run out of beds and staff for intensive care units within days. Kenney apologized for the dire situation and is now reluctantly introducing a vaccine passport and imposing a mandatory work-from-home order two months after lifting nearly all restrictions. \"Hubris led Trudeau to call the election. He and the Liberals won the election but lost the prize they were seeking. This is only a great night for the Liberals because two weeks ago it appeared they would lose government outright -- something they could not fathom before they gambled on an election,\" said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. Wiseman said the Conservatives were hurt by the situation in Alberta. \"The explosion of the pandemic in Alberta in the past 10 days undermined O'Toole's compliments of the Alberta Conservatives on how they had handled the pandemic and reinforced Trudeau's argument for mandatory vaccinations,\" he said. \"Trudeau lost his gamble to get a majority so I would say this is a bittersweet victory for him,\" said Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University.   \"Basically we are back to square one, as the new minority parliament will look like the previous one. Trudeau and the Liberals saved their skin and will stay in power, but many Canadians who didn't want this late summer, pandemic elections are probably not amused about the whole situation,\" he said. A Conservative win would have represented a rebuke of Trudeau against a politician with a fraction of his name recognition. O'Toole, 47, is a military veteran, former lawyer and a member of Parliament for nine years. O'Toole advertised himself a year ago as a \"true-blue Conservative.\" He became Conservative Party leader with a pledge to \"take back Canada,\" but immediately started working to push the party toward the political center.   O'Toole's strategy, which included disavowing positions held dear by his party's base on issues such as climate change, guns and balanced budgets, was designed to appeal to a broader cross section of voters in a country that tends to be far more liberal than its southern neighbor.   The son of a long-time politician has faced criticism he will say and do anything to get elected. Whether moderate Canadians believed O'Toole is the progressive conservative he claims to be and whether he alienated traditional Conservatives became central questions of the campaign.  Adrian Archambault, a 53-year-old Vancouver resident, voted Liberal and said he didn't mind the election was held during a pandemic. He noted provincial elections have also happened during the pandemic.  \"Everybody has been so preoccupied with COVID the last few years it wasn't maybe a bad thing to sort of do a re-check,\" he said. Trudeau's legacy includes embracing immigration at a time when the U.S. and other countries closed their doors. He also legalized cannabis nationwide and brought in a carbon tax to fight climate change. And he preserved free trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico amid threats by former U.S. President Donald Trump to scrap the agreement.   Former U.S. President Barack Obama and ex-Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton tweeted support for Trudeau. There wasn't a Trump endorsement of O'Toole.  Conservative campaign co-chair Walied Soliman said there is no alignment whatsoever between O'Toole and Trumpism. Soliman said earlier in the day holding Trudeau to a minority government would be a win for O'Toole.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Republican Congressman Louie Gohmert said Monday he will run for attorney general of Texas, joining a crowded field of GOP candidates looking to unseat incumbent Ken Paxton. The announcement from Gohmert, who is in his ninth term in the House, formalizes his bid for the seat after he told supporters earlier this month he was exploring a run for attorney general but needed at least $1 million to launch a competitive campaign against Paxton. Gohmert, 68, said in a video revealing he would be jumping into the race that he reached his $1 million goal and would be filing to run. \"Though our current AG has had two terms, it seems he really started working harder after so many of his most honorable and very top people in the AG's office left, complaining of criminal conduct,\" Gohmert told supporters in his new campaign video. \"If you allow me, I will not wait to be my busiest until after there is some bad press about legal improprieties. I'll start boldly protecting your rights on day one.\" The Texas congressman said his top priority will be election integrity, and he knocked \"unconstitutional mandates,\" an apparent reference to mask and vaccine requirements, as well as illegal immigration.\u00a0 Gohmert represents Texas's 1st Congressional District and has served in the House since 2005. Before he was elected to Congress, Gohmert was a state court judge. Following the 2020 presidential election, Gohmert filed a lawsuit in federal court that sought to force then-Vice President Mike Pence to decide the outcome of the race, though it was dismissed. \u00a0 In announcing his candidacy for Texas attorney general, Gohmert will face a Republican primary field that includes George P. Bush, Texas land commissioner and grandson and nephew of the Bush presidents, Eva Guzman, a former state Supreme Court justice, and Matt Krause, a member of the Texas state House.\u00a0 Paxton has served as attorney general of Texas since 2015, though he has faced legal troubles across most of his two terms. Not long after he began the job, Paxton was indicted on felony securities fraud charges,\u00a0 though the case has stalled, and was recently accused of bribery and abuse of office by former top aides. Paxton has denied any wrongdoing, and former President Donald Trump endorsed him in his reelection bid in July.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham that aired Sunday, February 7, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Senator Lindsey Graham in Clemson, South Carolina. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good morning. Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran has threatened to kick out U.N. inspectors within the next three weeks if sanctions are not lifted. You heard the president. Where do you think the stalemate goes from here? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, the Trump administration put Iran in a box. As a result, you've got four or five Arab nations doing peace agreements with Israel. I think Iran is weaker today than they've been since the regime was started about 40 years ago. So if I were President Biden, I would keep the sanctions on until Iran changed its behavior. I would not want to go into an old deal with Iran because they've been up to no good for too long. So he's going to have three problems here: what to do with Iran differently than Trump, what to do with China different than Trump and how to change Trump immigration policies without creating a run on the border. I would caution President Biden because Trump did it doesn't mean it's wrong. So I would slow down if I were President Biden and re-evaluate some of these Trump policies and keep them in place if they make sense. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've known the Biden family for years. Have you spoken to the president since inauguration? SEN. GRAHAM: No, I haven't. \u00a0Congratulations to- to him. He's the legitimate president. I talked to Secretary Blinken two days ago. I'm very pleased with what the Biden administration is proposing for Afghanistan. We're going to keep troops there on a conditions-based approach. The Afghan study group-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Past May? SEN. GRAHAM: --came out with a good- say again? MARGARET BRENNAN: Past May, which is when the Trump deal would call for conditions-based drawdown? SEN. GRAHAM: I think it's- I think it was, yeah, I think we're not going to leave in May. We're going to leave when the conditions are right. The- the Taliban have been cheating. They haven't been complying. And so I like what Tony Blinken and the Biden administration is doing. They're reevaluating our presence in Afghanistan to keep the footprint low, but not to walk away and lose all the gains we've achieved. If we leave too soon without a conditions-based withdrawal, ISIS and al-Qaeda will come roaring back. Women will suffer greatly. So they're in a good spot, I think, on Afghanistan. When it comes to Iran, I would caution the Biden administration to go back into the Iranian deal. There's a proposal by myself and Senator Menendez that the Iranians can have all the nuclear power they want. They just can't enrich. And I think Arabs would sign up for that deal, which would be a good deal for the world. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll stay tuned for- for what the policy is. I want to ask you about what's happening here at home with the scheduled trial that is supposed to begin on Tuesday of former President Donald Trump. You voted against holding that trial, but you said this on the morning after the siege of the Capitol. (BEGIN CLIP) SEN. GRAHAM: When it comes to accountability, the president needs to understand that his actions were the problem, not the solution, that the rally yesterday was unseemly. It got out of hand. It breaks my heart that my friend, a president of a consequence would allow yesterday to happen. And it will be a major part of his presidency. It was a self-inflicted wound. It was going too far. (END CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: What changed? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, it's not a crime. I mean, the House is impeaching him under the theory that his speech created a riot. When you look at the facts, many people had already planned the- to attack the Capitol before he ever spoke. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the trial memorandum from the-- SEN. GRAHAM: The president said at the rally I think was-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The trial memorandum from the House impeachment managers actually lays out a pattern of behavior. They say it wasn't just the speech. They say this was cultivated over time. SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, well, here's what I would say, that if you believe you committed a crime, he can be prosecuted like any other citizen. Impeachment is a political process. We've never impeached a president once they're out of office. I think this is a very bad idea. Forty-five plus Republicans are going to vote early on that it's unconstitutional. It's not a question of how the trial ends. It's a question of when it ends. Republicans are going to view this as an unconstitutional exercise. And the only question is, will they call witnesses? How long does the trial take? But the outcome is really not in doubt. That doesn't mean what happened on January the 6th was okay. It means this impeachment, in the eyes of most Republicans, is an unconstitutional exercise. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SEN. GRAHAM: The president's behavior, in my view, is not a crime, but he can be charged with one if people think he committed it because he's now a private citizen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some Republicans, your colleague, Pat Toomey, a Republican, believe that this is constitutional since the president was impeached while he was still in office. But, you know, people can look at this and say, look, when you can't argue a case on its merits, you argue on process. And that's what Republicans are doing right now. Because I want to ask you to clarify this. You said on January 7th, this about Mike Pence. (BEGIN CLIP) SEN. GRAHAM: The things he were- he was asked to do in the name of loyalty were over-the-top, unconstitutional, illegal, and would have been wrong for the country. (END CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: Unconstitutional and illegal sounds a lot like high crimes and misdemeanors. SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, well, he wasn't charged with that. The bottom line is the impeachment articles, I think, are unconstitutional because the president is in Florida. He's not in office. Impeachment for a president requires the chief justice to preside over the trial. He's not at the trial because President Trump is not the president. So this is not process. The Constitution, I think, is being flagrantly violated because, when it comes to Trump, there seems to be no end to all of this. So, the trial is going to result in an acquittal. Most Republicans, I don't know what Senator Toomey is going to do, is going to view this as unconstitutional and the president's behavior is not incitement under the law. And the longer it takes, the worse off for the country, I believe. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said if the president committed a crime, he should be charged. Do you think any of the president's actions, the tweets calling for the rally, the language leading up to the rally, the lying to the public about the ability to overturn the election, what you described he said about Mike Pence, does any of that deserve a reprimand? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I mean, he's going to have a place in history for all this, but the point of the matter is that we're in Congress. We're not prosecutors. Impeachment is never meant to be a prosecution. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you have oversight of the Justice Department. SEN. GRAHAM: We don't do bill of attainders. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think? SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I think I'm ready to move on. I'm ready to end the impeachment trial because I think it is blatantly unconstitutional. I'm ready to get on with trying to solve the nation's problems. And as to Donald Trump, he is the most popular figure in the Republican Party. He had a consequential presidency. January the 6th was a very bad day for America, and he'll get his share of blame in history. But I do believe that in 2022, the Republican Party is going to come roaring back because our friends on the Democratic Party- on the Democratic side are going to change immigration policy to have caravan after caravan hit our borders. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you still believe he is the head of the Republican Party? SEN. GRAHAM: They're going to raise our taxes, and they are going to weaken us across the board. Excuse me again? I'm sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: You still believe President Trump is the best face for the Republican Party? Yes or no? SEN. GRAHAM: I think he's- I think he's the- yeah, I think, yeah. I think- I think Donald Trump's policies served the country well. I think Donald Trump has to rehabilitate-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. GRAHAM: --himself as a politician. But here's what I think. I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Wait-- SEN. GRAHAM: --most Americans are going to look-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator-- SEN. GRAHAM: --at the Biden Administration and-- \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm- I'm sorry we are- we are out of time. SEN. GRAHAM: I'm sorry go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sorry here to-- SEN. GRAHAM: Okay. MARGARET BRENNAN: --cut you off, I have to take us to a commercial break. Thank you for your time this morning. Stay with us.",

            "article_content": "House Democrats are expected to vote Friday on a new version of President Biden's social spending plan and the bipartisan infrastructure bill, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Thursday night.\u00a0 Hoyer said the House Rules Committee will meet Thursday night, and the House will reconvene in Friday morning at 8 a.m. ET to vote.\u00a0 A Democratic aide said party leadership is feeling confident about finishing those key agenda items Friday, following weeks and months of negotiations.\u00a0 The latest iteration of the Build Back Better bill restores paid family and medical leave \u2014 after that provision had been dropped from the bill over opposition from Senator Joe Manchin. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal announced Wednesday the provision was officially back in the proposal, hours after Republican Glenn Youngkin was projected to be the winner of the governor's race in Virginia. Neal said Democrats could pass paid family leave \"responsibly, fully paying for this means-tested program.\" The measure would allow qualifying Americans to receive four weeks of paid leave. But Manchin told reporters on the same day that he hadn't been informed that House Democrats were putting paid leave back into the spending plan, and he indicated that the idea would have his support in a separate measure.\u00a0 \"I want to support paid leave. I want to do it in a bipartisan way,\" Manchin told reporters Wednesday. \"I've talked to Susan Collins, I've talked to colleagues on both sides. We both agree something can be done. Let's do that in the proper \u2014 we're trying to force it to reconciliation which has guardrails and rules and regulations. Let's do it and do it right...\"\u00a0 To do this in a \"bipartisan way\" suggests Manchin does not want to see paid leave in this bill, which will be passed through a process called reconciliation and will require a simple majority of senators \u2014 every single one of the 50 Democrats in the Senate \u2014 rather than the usual supermajority of 60.\u00a0 He was more explicit about his continued opposition, telling MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Thursday, \"I don't begrudge anybody for doing that (including paid leave). But they shouldn't begrudge me for saying this is not the right place for this piece of legislation.\"\u00a0 Manchin also criticized the Build Back Better bill for using \"10 years of funding to basically supply one or two or five or six years of services, and that's not the true cost.\" \"If you have 10 years of revenue, then you would think that if we put a program in place, that program will last 10 years, too,\" he told MSNBC.\u00a0 The reappearance of paid leave is not the only major addition to the bill. The latest version also increases the cap on the deduction of state and local taxes (known as SALT) from $10,000 to $72,500 (or $36,250 in the case of an estate, trust or married individual filing a separate return), and extends the higher cap through 2031, instead of 2025.\u00a0 One provision of the bill would allow undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. prior to January 1, 2011 to apply for a legal classification known as \"parole,\" which would shield them from deportation and grant them work permits. The parole classification does not provide beneficiaries a direct pathway to apply for a green card or citizenship. Democrats estimate that roughly 7 million immigrants could be eligible to apply for parole. Pelosi has indicated some immigration provisions remain in flux and may not be in the final bill, saying, \"it doesn't seem to have a big prospect in the Senate, so we can't put it in there.\"\u00a0 Before the election, former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe repeatedly called on Congress to pass the social spending plan and infrastructure bill, and following his loss, President Biden was asked if he though McAuliffe would have won, had the measures passed Congress. \"I think it should have passed before Election Day, but I'm not sure that I would have been able to have changed the number of very conservative folks who turned out in the red districts who are Trump voters, but maybe, maybe,\" he said.\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced this week Democrats have reached a deal to lower prescription drug pricing, which would include putting a cap on annual out-of-pocket spending for seniors and allow Medicare to negotiate drug costs.\u00a0 Ellis Kim and Camilo Montoya Galvez contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "The following is the full transcript of the year-end CBS News correspondents roundtable with Weijia Jiang, Ed O'Keefe, Nikole Killion, Jan Crawford and David Martin that aired Sunday, December 26, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\"  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION and our annual CBS News Correspondents year-end Roundtable. This year, we're joined by some of our beat reporters here in the Washington bureau, including CBS News Senior White House and Political Correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Jan Crawford is CBS News Chief Legal Correspondent. Weijia Jiang is also CBS News Senior White House Correspondent. CBS News National Security Correspondent David Martin is also here. And finally, Nikole Killion, who is CBS News Congressional Correspondent. So it's good to have you all and see your bright, shiny faces in person. Nikole, this has been just eight months of infighting and tangling over the Build Back Better spending bill that the White House has really made a signature issue for the president. Is it dead on arrival or is this just on life support in 2022? NIKOLE KILLION: I think life support is a better way to look at it. I don't think Democrats are going to give this up without a fight, even with some resistance from Joe Manchin because the reality is he has been resisting all along and expressing concerns, whether it's about the impact that Build Back Better could have on the economy, could have on inflation, that is something he reiterated towards the end of this year. So while, right now it looks like Democrats are kind of at this stalemate. Again, I think you will see Democratic leadership really try to prod him over these next couple of weeks to get on board. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Ed, doesn't this hurt Democrats the longer this drags on? ED O'KEEFE: I think what's hurting them more than anything is the focus on the process of it all, which they themselves have allowed to be the focus by virtue of the arguments they've had in public, the incredible disagreements that they can't seem to get over and the fact that the president engages behind the scenes, but hasn't done necessarily as much publicly to try to get the warring factions of his party together to say, let's just get a deal. They know going into next year that, you know, a rescue plan that was passed with really only Democratic only votes. A bipartisan infrastructure bill that probably, while historic, and massive and will bring incredible economic growth across the country, is kind of the basic work that Congress should be able to do. Plus, whatever comes of this Build Back Better debate may not be enough, when you ran in 2020 on a promise to do so much more and yet weren't able to secure a big enough majority to make it happen. So the threat for them is a depressed and confused and upset base of support that may not feel compelled to show up if this infighting continues to bleed into 2022 too much. And if they remain so focused on all of that and don't get out in the country to try to sell and explain it to skeptical Americans.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 WEIJIA JIANG: Remember who is at the center of this, right? And that's Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who has a lot less to lose politically than the others because he comes from West Virginia, a deeply red state, and he's aware of that. So again, when you're talking about the political ramifications of this, he is probably thinking of that less and might even be thinking the other way of how a no vote could garner even more support in his state. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what he has also argued is that this would hurt the economy. On the other hand, President Biden has argued this is just absolutely a requirement for the kind of economic recovery and rebuilding he says is necessary. So what's the strategy if you can't get $2 trillion through? JIANG: Well, I think the problem is that, you know, when you look at West Virginia and you look at how poor it is when you look at all the levels of unemployment and how much the need is there for some of the measures in the social spending plan, the poison pill is attached to it and that is the president's sweeping climate proposals. So, perhaps if there was a way to decouple them, Manchin would be more on board. But I do not think that that is something that the White House would be willing to entertain because it's really their only and maybe last shot at passing these huge climate change proposals that he would like. MARGARET BRENNAN: West Virginia native yourself, of course. But, Ed you know, it is the Federal Reserve's job to control inflation. Let's be clear here, but it doesn't matter. The Commander in Chief will get the blame for it if the spending continues to spike. Do you- does the White House believe that this price spikes are actually a short term issue? O'KEEFE: Well, they thought that certainly at the end of the summer into the fall. But I think if you look at what the Fed has said since, they now understand that this is going to continue further into next year. And the argument they will make is, yeah, but A, we've done everything we can and B, so much of this is driven by the pandemic. The longer it takes to get out of it, the longer the supply chains are disrupted, the longer the companies can't think ahead. There's going to be this kind of, you know, once in a lifetime, perhaps economic disruption that leads to a long and painful and expensive reshuffling. And when things are bad economically, they take it out on those in charge, and that's Democrats. So you add that plus the historic nature of a midterm where a party in power usually loses seats anyway. And they know they could be in for a real shellacking. MARGARET BRENNAN: David Martin, you know, I was speaking to a White House official the other day who was talking about the holiday season and saying Vladimir Putin may be making himself known to the world. Do we see a hot war in Europe at the beginning of 2022? DAVID MARTIN: Well, the estimate is that once the ground freezes so that Russian tanks and personnel carriers can get good traction. They'll be- they'll be liable to go from all those Western districts of Russia into eastern Ukraine. I mean, what Putin is trying to do here is basically walk back history by pulling Ukraine back into the Russian sphere of influence. And he's made these demands like he needs a legally binding guarantee that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO. I mean, surely he knows that's a non-starter. So the question here is, is that just as going in position or is that his pretext for an invasion once his demands are- are turned down? MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we went through a part of this back in 2014 when Vladimir Putin annexed part of Ukraine. He did it in a different way last time. Why so overt, this time with a military buildup? Why not the little green men and doing this in a more covert way like he did last time? MARTIN: Well, there's a much more substantial military force waiting for him in Eastern Ukraine that's been hardened by this ongoing war that they've had there. So- and Ukraine has been getting military equipment from the U.S. So it's- it requires a- a bigger operation. Whether they launch that operation-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhmm. MARTIN: --of course, remains to be seen. But the U.S. clearly has intelligence that goes beyond the simple fact that these units are gathering together there in Russia. They know something about what the Russian military staff is planning and what they intend to do with those forces. And right now, they are clearly making the preparations, making the plans to go into Eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhmm. MARTIN: Whether or not it happens, Vladimir Putin may not know yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And U.S. intelligence says he hasn't made up his mind, but of course, this is being watched because it's a test case of what President Biden will do and how he will respond to an adversary. And on the heels of Afghanistan, which looked quite chaotic, this is a big test. MARTIN: It is, I think, one of the- the big dangers for 2022 is that countries like China, Russia, Iran are going to look at what happened in Afghanistan and decide the US is a spent force and we can roll them. And that's not a good mindset to be in now. MARGARET BRENNAN: No. Jan--\u00a0 JAN CRAWFORD: I just have to say, every time we do these annual correspondents panels, David says, something that makes my heart stop-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Terrifying. CRAWFORD: \u2013We're all kind of running around chasing kind of shiny objects. And David just says, listen, I mean, it's every year, every year. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you know, what's scary is he's usually right. CRAWFORD; Oh, no, I know, believe me. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Jan, in terms of predictions, we'll get to those later on in the program. But the big one that I remember you making just a few weeks back when we were all talking about the future of Roe vs Wade and the Supreme Court was that we won't really know the answer to the question on the court's direction until maybe June. CRAWFORD: Right? I mean, and- and history is a guide for that as well i you want to look back. In 1992, which is the last time the Supreme Court had a frontal assault on Roe vs Wade, they were at the brink of overturning it then. They had five votes to overturn it. And then at the last minute, of course, Justice Kennedy- former Justice Kennedy switched his vote to preserve it. So while there may be five votes now and I suspect that there are, anything can happen between now and June, so we'll see-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And-\u00a0 CRAWFORD: --and- and then we won't know, of course, what goes behind closed doors as the court is going back and forth. Sometimes they change their mind when they start writing those opinions. They just won't write, and so they'll change positions. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, those who are saying it will be overturned are perhaps making too early to call. CRAWFORD: They may be right. And I suspect they might be right. I mean, it may well be overturned. I would not be surprised, but I think it's- you can't say that with any certainty because so much can happen between now and when that opinion comes out. MARGARET BRENNAN: And what does that scenario look like? Then we just have a patchwork of different states \u2013 CRAWFORD: Right--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013with different laws. CRAWFORD: If the court would take a position that, as conservatives have long maintained since Roe was released, that it's a lawless opinion with no basis in the Constitution, there's not a right to an abortion in the Constitution. MARGARET BRENNAN: Even Ruth Bader Ginsburg had problems with the legal-- CRAWFORD: Certainly on the- on the grounds that Roe was decided, right? MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. CRAWFORD: But so that would mean that the court would be neutral and the Constitution is neutral on the issue of abortion. So it would go back to the states and the legislatures, which are closer to the voters, as the argument would then decide whether to allow abortion, what restrictions to allow. The political process would happen in the individual states or in Congress. If Congress decided to pass a law, which I mean, I don't know how likely that is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 CRAWFORD: I would guess probably not.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: No--\u00a0 CRAWFORD: And it would take the court out of the issue of abortion, basically and let the state legislatures decide. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it would put it right into the political football space, Weijia. And Weijia, with that, I mean, it's hard to find a more emotional issue and certainly politically it is a galvanizing one. So what happens after June? How does this change the midterm races in 2022 or how the White House even communicates going into 2024? JIANG: I think it's really difficult for President Biden and a sore spot because he is very aware that there is only so much he can do. And that is the case with so many of his promises that he made going into his presidency. And we're seeing that with voting rights. We're seeing that with abortion, we're seeing that with gun control. And I think one of the biggest pieces of news that the president made happened in Oct, when he said he was open to doing away with the filibuster when it came to voting rights and maybe other things. And I do think that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Which would move us away from a 60 vote requirement-- WEIJIA JIANG: Correct, it would move us away. It would allow the Democrats to get something done on abortion, on voting rights without any Republican support. However, he didn't elaborate on that. He said he would have more to say later. And we have yet to hear what that more is and where he really stands on supporting, you know, getting rid of-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 WEIJIA JIANG:\u00a0 --the filibuster. So I think we have to press him on that to see what he means because obviously heading into June, he needs a victory in many of those areas. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Nikole, Sen Joe Manchin has the thing to say about the filibuster as well if you start changing voting rules. KILLION: Well, and Sen Sinema as well. But we do know that there have been active discussions in the Senate about these rule changes. Just recently, we know some Democrats met with former senate parliamentarians to try to see what they can do. There's obviously been talk of trying to do a talking filibuster, but clearly, especially on the issue of voting rights, there is a strong desire and a strong will on the part of senators to try to get things done, even if they can't get Republicans on board. So, what that looks like to Weijia's point, I mean, that may be part of it because we don't know that the senators actually know exactly what it looks like or some of them, you know, kind of dodged questions when you ask about it. But I do think at the start of the year, we will see a very deliberate move to try to get this back on the table and agenda. O'KEEFE: But to your point, because there's at least two senators who don't like this idea and frankly, probably more, but they just don't say it to Jan's point. Keep an eye on the states. We're going into a year where you're going to have dozens of competitive governors races, and I would argue, at least in recent history, this will probably be the most consequential cycle for governors races for a lot of reasons. One, because abortion may very well become an urgent issue. Two, because voting rights remain a concern, and there are ways in the states for either party to restrict or expand access. But for- the biggest reason perhaps if certain presidential battleground states swing towards control of one party or another, they are potentially setting up the playing field going into 2024. You have big races in places like Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, which we're all deciding factors in 2020. If Republicans take full control of those, there will be pressure put on them by a certain former president to put some things in place that would make it harder. Or Democrats are going to have to stand in the way of Republican legislatures, potentially so to the issue of abortion and to all these others, given the inability to get anything done in Congress. Increasingly, political observers tell you, go to state capitals, worry less about what's happening here because the disagreement is causing virtually no action on anything significant.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: When you go to those state capitols, Nikole, What is it, 19 states, 33 laws that make it harder for Americans to vote. The White House points to that. They look at the anniversary of the Jan. 6 siege of the Capitol, and they say politically or at least optically, they're going to start talking about building momentum for voting rights. Does anything actually get passed in 2022? KILLION: I mean, again, I think it comes down to the numbers. And so long as you have somebody like a Sen Manchin or a Sen Sinema who says they are not going to back a rule change and end the filibuster. It's hard to do. You know, I was talking to Sen Warnock, who has been a very vocal advocate of voting rights for obvious reasons coming from the state of Georgia. But you know, he was asked multiple times, how do you get the votes? And he couldn't give an answer. So it is going to be a difficult thread to- to weave. But as I said, I think there will be a very deliberate effort to try to move forward on it if they can. MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House wants to get caught trying, Weijia. JIANG: Oh, absolutely. I mean, they are making a point that the president just held a big meeting with senators. Obviously, the vice president is spearheading this effort as part of her portfolio. But again, we were just talking to some White House folks who said they were really realistic about this as well, and they know that it- it is going to be a struggle. The- the problem is the president knows also, he always says himself that you got to dance with the person who brought you to the party. He's very well aware of how critical this issue is for the Black community. He's aware of the promises that he's made, so he has to show that he is at least doing everything he can to get it done. MARGARET BRENNAN: And David, you know, when we talk about what's happening on the state level and concern about election integrity and votes, all of this gets intertwined into Jan 6th and the insurrection. When you look at what's happening right now and the folks you talk to at the Pentagon, do they believe the biggest national security threat is internal or external? MARTIN: Internal, no question. Military people will say that to you. The biggest threat to the United States of America is a reincarnation of Jan 6th. And if we lose our democracy. What the heck is all that other stuff, who cares about hypersonic weapons if you don't have a democracy. So, yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But how do they talk about that internally? I mean, is that a concern within the military or it- what does that mean? Is this a Jan 6th was a dress-rehearsal type scenario? MARTIN: Well, they had their own dress rehearsal during that period, from the election up to Jan. 6, when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs was almost convinced and certainly worried that Donald Trump was going to declare some sort of national emergency that would allow him to suspend the results of the election. And the military made a lot of preparations for dealing with that, and they seem quite confident that a president. Can't get away with that because he would have to issue an illegal order to them and they are bound by law not to carry out illegal orders. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jan, I mean, it's incredible that we're talking about this. And it was a very real moment and very real conversations. This is not in any way theoretical, I know. Jan, when you look to the courts and this question of faith in our institutions, whether- what David is just sketching out is, he's saying, essentially, the military followed a chain of command and orders \u2013 the institution did what it was supposed to do. It looks like, when we look around the capital, there's a lack of faith in a lot of institutions.\u00a0 CRAWFORD: True, although\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that still there in the court? CRAWFORD: No, I mean, I think there's- I think there's still faith in the United States Supreme Court, and historically and even recently, it's been the institution that polls the best \u2013 way better than Congress and certainly the press.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You picked like the two lowest there, Jan. CRAWFORD: I did. Yeah. Used car salesmen are also- and lawyers. But the court has- and I think that that is the way the court has conducted itself. You know, and- and Justice Breyer has been a big proponent of that. This court's senior liberal, going out, talking to groups and expressing, you know, his strong belief that you see that it's like this beacon of democracy. And you know, that's- gets to the question is how much longer is Justice Breyer going to be around on that Supreme Court? He may very well retire this year. There's been a lot of pressure, of course, from people on the left that he would step down while President Biden could nominate and have his replacement confirmed. So, you know, there's a lot we can talk about about the court and its legitimacy. So far, it's definitely declined, but it hasn't taken the kind of hits that other people have. Some people suggest that if they overturn Roe, that would further weaken its legitimacy\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Justice Sotomayor certainly indicated that\u2026 CRAWFORD: \u2013But on the right, they have just a different view \u2013 that if they uphold Roe, the quote \"lawless decision,\" that that would undermine it. So, you know, those arguments cut both ways as well. It dipped after Bush vs Gore, but then it ticked back up again. But it's important, as Justice Breyer points out, the Supreme Court doesn't have a standing army to go enforce its decisions. It relies on the public's confidence and trust. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. David, when we talk about national threats, I mean, China and those phone calls after Jan 6th last year- I mean, the rest of the world was concerned about the state of American democracy, or at least our stability. When you look at the Pacific right now, there are concerns about the amount of overflights China has been conducting into Taiwanese airspace. This is the projection. This is the war that's coming, right? What does that actually look like? Is this a conventional military conflict? How soon is it? Is this something that's more? I don't know. Are we thinking about it the right way? MARTIN: Well, first of all, I think- nobody I talk to thinks a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is imminent. Near the end of World War II, the U.S. looked at invading Taiwan, which was then called Formosa, as it closed in on Japan. And when they did the analysis, it required an invasion force of one million people. So, it may look on paper that big, bad China can just swallow little Taiwan in a single gulp, but that's not the case. They don't have the military capability to launch a cross-strait invasion. They're working on it, but they're not there yet. If they're going to seize something of Taiwan's in 2022, I would think it'd be much more likely that it would be one of these small offshore islands, which would be much less of a military challenge. And it also would be a little bit of a test case to see how the rest of the world reacts. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Taiwanese have said they project Beijing wouldn't be on track to invade until 2025. But what I hear often is that it doesn't look like a conventional military action. It would be more destabilizing \u2013 more of a Vladimir Putin model. MARTIN: Well, that's going on right now. I mean, the flights are- are what we see, but there are constant cyber attacks, and there are constant attempts to isolate Taiwan \u2013 diplomatically, economically. At the beginning of the COVID crisis, China blocked Germany from sending vaccines to Taiwan. I mean, that's- they just leave no stone unturned in trying to make life difficult for the island of Taiwan. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's a diplomatic arm twisting when it comes to the balance of power here in Washington, Nikole. And we talked a little bit about this earlier, Ed. 2022 and the question of who- who is in the majority? Democrats just eked out a majority in 2022. Do we assume that this is a Republican controlled Senate Republican controlled House in 2022? KILLON: I think Republicans assume that and that is what they are working towards. I mean, look, on the House side, it's really not that hard. There are only five seats they have to flip to get back in power. And so very often you will hear House Republicans even referring to Speaker Pelosi already as a lame duck speaker. So they're measuring the drapes, OK. You know, in the Senate, it's a little trickier because of this split dynamic. Certainly, it's possible, I'd say at this stage in the game where it could go either way. But I think Mitch McConnell is there to stay. And I think whether- this- he's in the majority or the minority, I think you will see him continue to take that role in the forefront. But definitely, history is not necessarily on the side of Democrats this go round and many of them have acknowledged, you know, that they do face some difficult headwinds going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: So does Speaker Pelosi end her congressional career as speaker or as minority leader? O'KEEFE: You want that one? MARGARET BRENNAN: No one wants to answer the question. Majority Leader McCarthy?\u00a0 KILLON: I mean, the bottom line is the speaker hasn't shown her cards. And you know, from those sources that I've talked to, they do fully expect her to stay in her position through the midterms. I mean, keep in mind, she's one of the biggest fundraisers for Democrats, so there's no way I would say it's very unlikely we would see her step down prior. And she's also indicated that she'll likely run for re-election. So you have that, but you do have to wonder if the chamber flips control, if she would stay in that minority role because we know there is some pretty bad blood between the two of them, between Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy. You know, they don't talk all that often. I mean, you could see, speaking of Jan 6th, I mean, they couldn't even agree on a commission. That's one of many issues they can't find agreement on, and they're constantly trading accusations and attacks amongst each other. So I think, you know, it is a jump ball, but I think looking forward at some point we do have to prepare for that generational shift when Speaker Pelosi- if she does retire, Jim Clyburn, Hoyer, you know, at some point there is going to be that shift. Will it happen in 2022? Don't know yet, but\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: But whatever the outcome is, it dramatically changes, Weijia and Ed, what's possible for the Biden White House? \u00a0 O'KEEFE: Totally. And I think the best way to gauge Republican success in November will be who prevails in the spring in the argument of, we need to be nominating Republican conservative purists, which is what former President Trump would want versus we need to be nominating political crossover artists, which is what Mitch McConnell has always rooted for. He listed recently a list of people; Christine O'Donnell, Todd Akin, the kind of Republican candidates a few years ago who let a lot of hair on fire, scored a lot of headlines, but never won an election he goes, \"we don't need that kind of person.\" Will a Trump backed purist work in some states? It might, but it's not going to work in Ohio. It may not work in Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia. And those are the states where they need to win or hold on in order to take back control of the Senate and to some extent in the House. But the issue with the House is that the mechanics are being controlled by Republicans in the states by redrawing the lines. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. O'KEEFE: So by virtue of that, you could probably write off almost a dozen, maybe two dozen seats by the spring that are going to go back to Republican hands just by virtue of the way the lines are being drawn. JIANG: But to your point, MARGARET, I mean, I think it's difficult to imagine the president accomplishing much on his agenda when it was already so difficult with Democrats in control. And I think that actually exposed how much conflict there is within that party. And I don't know that they had anticipated it being done in the open in the way that it was. But even when you look at all of the president's successes, it came with a lot of public fighting when it came to the American Rescue Plan or even the bipartisan infrastructure law that just passed. You saw how moderates and progressives really butted heads and had to, you know, had to put that aside. But it was still out there. Everybody\u2013 KILLON: \u2013I don't think\u2013 \u00a0 JIANG: -saw it. KILLON: -Democratic leaders argue, I mean, that's the sausage making process in Washington, right? I mean. Yes, we could all be Kumbaya, but on the same token, there are some differences and we have seen that evolve in the party over the last couple of years. At the end of the day, they have gotten some things done, maybe not everything, but you know, it's a work in progress. JIANG: Because the party is involved, so much so I think that, you know, we'll see. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to get to underreported stories as well, Jan?\u00a0 CRAWFORD: Oh, I- just for me, I mean, my kids hear me rant about this every day, so I might as well tell you guys it's- it's the crushing impact that our COVID policies have had on young kids and children. By far the least serious risk for serious illness. But I mean, even teenagers, you know, a healthy teenager has a one in a million chance of getting, and dying from COVID, which is way lower than, you know, dying in a car wreck on a road trip. But they have suffered and sacrificed the most, especially kids and underrepresented at risk communities. And now we have the Surgeon General saying there's a mental health crisis among our kids. The risk of suicide girl suicide attempts among girls now up 51% this year, black kids nearly twice as likely as white kids to die by suicide. I mean, school closures, lockdowns, cancellation of sports. You couldn't even go on a playground in the D.C. area without cops scurrying- getting- shooing the kids off tremendous negative impact on kids, and it's been an afterthought. You know, it's it's it's hurt their dreams, their future learning, loss, risk of abuse, their mental health. And now, with our knowledge, our vaccines. If our policies don't reflect a more measured and reasonable approach for our children, they will be paying for our generation's decisions, the rest of their lives. And that, to me, is the greatest underreported story of the past year. BRENNAN: Well said and frightening, David. CRAWFORD: Sorry, David, I didn't mean to take your role. MARTIN: Mine is going to seem awfully paltry compared to that. So I think it's- on my beat I think it's the arms race in space. China and Russia are hard at work, developing ways to take out American satellites, using rockets, lasers, electronic beams and our- our way of life, plus our military's ability to operate depend on those satellites. So, as you might think, the U.S. is doing everything it can to counter that threat. So there's this arms race going on and it's almost all going on in secret. We just know so little about it because everything that happens in space, at least on the military side, is, in my opinion, is way over classified. MARGARET BRENNAN: Weijia.\u00a0 JIANG: Well, I have to agree with Jan, but I did come up with a backup just in case because, you know, obviously as parents were always thinking about this and especially as a parent of young children thinking about the long term impact on their development, I think is something that we just don't know yet. And perhaps that's one reason why it's not reported as much. But I think another underreported story is the global vaccination picture. We're so focused on the fight here in the U.S. as we should be. But you know, ending the pandemic is not just getting every American vaccinated, it's ending the pandemic worldwide. And even though we can pull up stats and figures quickly about how many doses have been administered, how much has been donated by rich countries to poor countries, how many people have been vaccinated. We don't really understand what's happening around the world, especially in those poor countries. And it, you know, until we do, it's hard to really understand our path forward. And I think that was really illustrated by Omicron. We didn't understand the skepticism in South Africa of people getting vaccinated and how that impacted their vaccination rate\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. JIANG: \u2013and why, you know, it was there and then came here very quickly. And I think that will continue to happen until there's more of an understanding and effort to end the virus worldwide. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed? O'KEEFE: The most underreported and under-discussed issue in this town is immigration. There has been a real failure to act for too long, and it continued this year, certainly plenty of urgent priorities that had to be addressed, whether it's the economic recovery, the ongoing fight with the pandemic. Now, of course, things like inflation and just keeping this country together, frankly. But one of the things that just undergirds everything about this country, the economy, job creation, the fight over illegal drugs, schooling, you know, and yeah, national identity and security is this issue that for too long, this entire century, presidents have said they would try to tackle and they just have not. There were some modest attempts made in this debate over Build Back Better to see if they could tuck something into an already big bill. I think most of those involved knew that that was not going to happen, but they had to at least appear as if they were trying. But the problem for Democrats going into next year is if they expect to be able to turn out the kinds of people that they need to win congressional elections and governors elections in the west, especially, they have to show serious commitment to having tried. This happened to them in 2014, and they failed and they've tried it again. Republicans and Democrats at other times, and they claim they're going to try again. But absent presidential leadership, and this is an issue he seems allergic to discussing when he gets asked about it or when he's confronted with it. It's going to be a problem for this country that just persists for too long MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's such a tough nut to crack. O'KEEFE: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nikole.\u00a0 KILLION: On my beat, I would say it's the Violence Against Women Act, and this is something that has always been bipartisan. It hasn't been reauthorized in years, and once it expired in 2019, it hasn't moved forward, it hasn't advanced. We saw the House Pass a reauthorization in March. But in the Senate, it's been a much more difficult battle in terms of trying to find compromise between Republicans and Democrats. And what's interesting is that during this pandemic, there has been so much talk about an uptick in domestic violence to the point where it's been described as a pandemic within a pandemic. And yet there hasn't been that same push that we've seen on issues like voting rights or police reform in terms of trying to get more done with respect to the issue of domestic violence, especially considering you have someone like President Biden in the White House who was a key proponent and author of the Violence Against Women Act. So, I think that as an issue to watch going forward, we saw Angelina Jolie on the Hill multiple times this fall and this winter. And so the expectation is that maybe they can present some compromise legislation by the beginning of the year. So, that is something to watch. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We are going to take a quick break right now, and we'll be back with more from our panel. ---- MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with more from our correspondents panel, and this is when we ask you to do the thing you hate doing, which is predict the future, but they are informed predictions, I know. Jan, what is it that you see happening in 2022? CRAWFORD: Well, I normally predict that Alabama will win the national championship. So you know, that's getting kind of too easy to predict. So- but I'm going to focus on the court and the issue of abortion. I'm- I- I predict that the Supreme Court will overturn Roe vs Wade, say that the Constitution and the court is going to be neutral on the issue of abortion, which would send that back to the states to decide how they wanted to handle it; specific state by state issue. The vote could well be 6-3, with the Chief Justice joining the five more conservative justices after failing to put forward a more incremental approach. MARGARET BRENNAN: That would have huge implications.\u00a0 CRAWFORD: Yeah- no. I mean, it would radically shift the debate, which in the confirmation process for Supreme Court justices, it would shift all of that back to the states. It would also mean that state legislators could no longer play politics with the issue of abortion, knowing that the Supreme Court would overturn it. So, all of a sudden in the state legislatures, those positions that politicians now are taking to pander to the left or more- more specifically to the right knowing the court will step in, all of that now is real. And so they will actually have to make real decisions based on what their voters want or they're out of office. MARGARET BRENNAN: David. MARTIN: I'm going to duck the tough one of whether Putin will invade Ukraine or not, if he hasn't made up his mind. I shouldn't have to make up mine. There are two mysteries out there. What's causing Havana syndrome, this- these debilitating symptoms that hit Americans overseas that seem to be the subject of some kind of directed energy attack. And where are these unexplained aerial phenomena we call UFOs? These drone mike objects that show up in the middle of U.S. military exercises. Where the heck are they coming from? So I'm predicting one of those two will be solved in 2022. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll hold you to it, David. MARTIN: OK. JIANG: I can't follow that. You know, I've been thinking a lot about the president's goals ever since he took office and how a curveball like Omicron can just set everything back. And I- I do predict that things are going to get worse before they get better with the pandemic. And I don't think that the president will implement any lockdowns or restrictions that we saw in 2020, which is something that we've been talking about a lot because, you know, what can you do if you can't force someone to get the vaccine and the virus continues to spin out of control? Is he going to have another 15 days to slow the spread? And I think the answer is no, because he is so committed to his economic agenda and he understands what a shutdown would mean. So, I think it will be up to states and local officials to do that. But I don't predict any federal guidelines for shutdowns in 2022. MARGARET BRENNAN: And even the governors are hesitant because\u2013 JIANG: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013the political cost at this point. So Ed, it's up to you to protect yourself, all of us to protect ourselves. What is your prediction for '22? O'KEEFE: I'm going to tiptoe slightly in the direction of what you and David covered with this by predicting that the president, once we get clear of the worst of this, and once he's able to globetrot a little more, will make trips in the coming year to Latin America and Africa. MARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't put Ireland on there. O'KEEFE: I did not put Ireland on there because that one's going to happen no matter what. But Latin America and Africa and people may wonder why they have to remember everything this president does has China in the background. And this would be designed as an attempt to go to those parts of the world and say, stick with democracy, stick with the United States, avoid the Chinese influence and investment that's coming your way and remember that we stand with you as well. President Trump didn't go to Africa. There's been a belief in the Biden administration that such a trip needs to happen sooner rather than later. Latin America as well, and so many struggling democracies in that part of the world, going would send a big signal, and he would try to meet with some leaders from that region. But those are two trips they would probably like to make, and I predict he will make. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nikole. KILLION: I think in terms of the midterms, I think one dynamic to watch and in covering politics for many years now, we keep talking about the increased number of women who are running and people of color. And I think especially when you look at Black women in particular, I think you will see a barrier being broken, whether that's in the Senate or whether that's in the governor's mansion. And I think what's jaw dropping is there has never, never been a black woman elected as governor in U.S. history. You have five running, Stacey Abrams, you have candidates in South Carolina, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Iowa. There are a number of Lieutenant Governors, we will see Winsome Sears be inaugurated in Virginia, the first African-American woman lieutenant governor for that state, a Republican. I also think, you know, for all of the talk of having the first Black president, Barack Obama having the first Black vice president and vice president of South Asian descent. I think sometimes people forget that there's a deficit now in the Senate. As diverse as Congress is right now, there's no Black women in the Senate. So you have a number of candidates Val Demings, Cheri Beasley and others who are running. But I do think those are two spaces to watch in the midterms in 2022. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We'll be watching. Thanks to all of you for joining us. Great holidays to think we'll see in the new year.",

            "article_content": "The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) shelter system received 122,000 migrant children who were taken into U.S. custody without their parents in fiscal year 2021, an all-time high that shattered previous records, according to new government figures obtained by CBS News. In fiscal years 2016 and 2019, when the previous records were set, HHS received 59,000 and 69,000 unaccompanied migrant children, respectively, historical government statistics show. During a six-month period starting this March, more than 92,000 unaccompanied minors were transferred to HHS. The record number of shelter transfers was fueled by the unprecedented arrival of 147,000 unaccompanied children to the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2021, which ended in October. This year's historic child migration wave, which initially peaked in March before reaching a new all-time high in July, posed major logistical, humanitarian and political challenges for the Biden administration, which has declined to use a COVID-19 policy started under former President Donald Trump to expel unaccompanied minors. \"The program faced an unprecedented challenge at the beginning of this year,\" a senior official at the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the HHS agency that cares for unaccompanied children, told CBS News on Wednesday. The official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal plans, said HHS is preparing for another potential sharp increase in arrivals of migrant children next year by expanding capacity at traditional shelters and identifying two sites in New Mexico and North Carolina that could be converted into emergency housing facilities. Border arrivals of unaccompanied children have declined since the summer, but U.S. officials recorded processing nearly 14,000 migrant minors traveling without parents last month, the highest tally for any November in history.\u00a0 Just weeks after President Biden took office, HHS shelters reached their pandemic-era maximum capacity. By March, U.S. Border Patrol facilities, which are not designed to hold children beyond 72 hours, became dangerously overcrowded with unaccompanied minors whom HHS did not have the space to house.\u00a0 In response, the Biden administration converted more than a dozen convention centers, military installations, work camps and other facilities into \"emergency intake sites\" to quickly process and house the record number of children crossing the southern border illegally without their parents. It also reopened a dormant \"influx\" facility.\u00a0 The emergency HHS sites alleviated the severe overcrowding inside Border Patrol facilities. But they also highlighted the risks of placing migrant children in makeshift housing facilities that were not designed to house minors and lacked the standards of care enforced at traditional HHS shelters. Conditions varied across the emergency sites. But two of them were abruptly closed in the spring, including a Houston warehouse where migrant girls reported being served undercooked food, having limited access to showers and a lack of outdoor recreation. At the largest site, a tent complex inside the Fort Bliss Army base in Texas, migrant teens reported mental health distress, inadequate services and prolonged stays. Children there were constantly monitored for escape attempts, panic attacks and self-harm. After the conditions were publicly reported in June, HHS took remedial measures. Most of the emergency sites have since closed, except for three facilities, including the Fort Bliss tent camp. There are no immediate plans to close the sites, the senior HHS official said, noting that one of them, a former work camp in Pecos, Texas, is being converted into a more permanent \"influx\" facility. HHS has been making preparations to be able to open \"influx\" facilities at an academy campus in Greensboro, North Carolina, and a summer camp in Glorieta, New Mexico, if traditional shelter space is again depleted, the senior department official said. The department also instituted several policies this year to expedite the placement of unaccompanied children with sponsors, typically family members residing in the U.S., reducing their average length of stay at HHS facilities to 30 days, down from the 102-day average in 2020. More than 107,000 migrant children in HHS care were released to sponsors during fiscal year 2021, another record. The states with the highest number of placements were Texas, Florida, California and New York, which collectively received more than 45,000 unaccompanied children. As of Wednesday, HHS had nearly 12,000 unaccompanied minors in its custody, a 46% drop from the record 22,500 children it was housing at one point in April. Roughly 2,800 children remained at the three emergency housing sites on Wednesday, according to internal HHS data. Leecia Welch, a lawyer representing migrant children in a federal court case, said HHS should focus on speeding up the vetting of sponsors and expanding bed capacity at shelters and foster homes. Citing multiple visits, including to Fort Bliss, Welch called the emergency site system a \"complete failure as a means of caring for traumatized children.\" \"We urge the government to do some deep soul searching and learn from past mistakes \u2014 especially around the need for more foster homes for immigrant children,\" said Welch, a lead counsel at the New York-based Children's Rights group. HHS next year will also need to address Republican-led states' objections to the resettlement of unaccompanied minors. Texas and Florida both announced measures this year to restrict state child-welfare licenses for HHS shelters housing migrant children, prompting the Biden administration to consider federal licensing. The vast majority of the migrant children who entered HHS custody this past fiscal year hailed from Central America. According to the figures, 47% were from Guatemala, 32% from Honduras and 13% from El Salvador. Mexican children accounted for just 1% of the unaccompanied minors transferred to HHS facilities. Nearly three-quarters of all migrant children placed in HHS custody this past fiscal year were teens between the ages of 15 and 17, the statistics show. 13- and 14-year-olds accounted for 13% of minors who entered HHS care, while the remaining 16% were 12 or younger, a group the government calls \"tender age\" children. Roughly two-thirds of the unaccompanied minors sent to HHS-overseen housing facilities in fiscal year 2021 were boys, according to the data. Girls comprised 34% of transfers to HHS. Migration experts said the historic number of unaccompanied minors taken in U.S. custody this year was partly driven by persistent conditions in some Central America communities, including crushing poverty, hunger, lack of economic opportunities, violence and displacement caused by natural disasters.\u00a0 Mr. Biden's election, as well as some policy changes announced by his administration, also led smugglers to tell migrant youth they had a better chance of being allowed to stay in the U.S. than they had under Trump, the experts said. Another potent push factor is a desire for family reunification. Over 80% of unaccompanied children who enter U.S. care have family members in the U.S., many of whom are also undocumented, according to government estimates. \"A lot of children in northern Central American countries have parents or other family members here. And they want to be with their families, which is a very human thing,\" said Essey Workie, a Migration Policy Institute researcher who studies U.S. policies that affect unaccompanied minors.\u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "In the first statewide race since the GOP lost the White House and the Senate, Virginia's race for governor suggests that at this moment, former President Trump's influence is still strong among state Republicans. The declared candidates have so far largely embraced Mr. Trump's rhetoric and policies with an eye toward winning the state GOP convention in May, even if doing so makes it more difficult to appeal to moderate voters in the November general election. Republicans have not won a statewide election in Virginia in over a decade, since 2009.\u00a0 Former hedge fund investor Glenn Youngkin and entrepreneur Pete Snyder, who ran for lieutenant governor in 2013, lead the GOP field in campaign ad spending. Former Republican House Speaker Kirk Cox and state Senator Amanda Chase are the only candidates with experience serving in Virginia government. Deciding how their nominee would be chosen has already been a headache for candidates and the Virginia Republican State Central Committee.\u00a0 After months of internal debate over holding a statewide primary versus a convention, an unsuccessful lawsuit by Chase and a botched plan to hold it at Liberty University, the committee decided in March to hold an unassembled convention across 37 locations. It'll be held on May 8, will utilize ranked-choice voting and will require a candidate to win a majority of the vote to be the nominee.\u00a0 All the GOP candidates are tapping into fatigue around the Democrats' handling of COVID-19 and the economy, specifically pointing to the state's slowness in fully reopening schools. Democratic Governor Ralph Northam has called on all schools to start some form of in-person learning by Monday, though Republicans argue that five days of in-person learning should already be happening.\u00a0 \"This election is all going to be about one-party Democratic control and overreach,\" Cox told CBS News, adding that even after schools open, closures will continue to be an issue in the fall because students have so much catching up to do.\u00a0 Republicans will also target Democrats for lagging vaccination rates. The state struggled with distributing vaccinations early on but has improved its systems; it ranked fourth in the percentage of vaccines administered as of mid-March. While Mr. Trump's pet issues, like immigration and the U.S. approach to China, have been raised by some campaigns, candidates have also seized on Mr. Trump's debunked idea of an election that was \"stolen\" from him.\u00a0 President Biden won Virginia, which has voted Democratic in presidential races since 2008, by more than 450,000 votes. Northam cannot run for reelection because the state bans consecutive terms by governors.\u00a0 Youngkin is tapping into\u00a0doubts about the outcome of the 2020 election with his \"Election Integrity Taskforce\" that calls, in part, for more observers and voting machine audits. Snyder has released a similar policy plan, and has said he wants \"NFL-style scouting reports\" on election officials for the November election.\u00a0 \"President Biden is our president. He was inaugurated,\" Youngkin said when asked if he trusts the 2020 election results. \"I do think that process improvements go and push out doubt.\" Chase, who wears her \"Trump in heels\" moniker with pride and attended the \"Stop the steal\" rally on January 6, believes the 2020 election was \"stolen\" as a result of COVID-19. The \"guardrails [were] taken off,\" she said. But Denver Riggleman, a former Virginia congressman who lost his seat in a GOP convention primary last summer, said any candidate's messaging on election integrity \"is based on bullsh*t.\" \"'Election integrity' is a cover term for 'Stop the Steal.' 'Stop the Steal' is a cover term for QAnon. It's based on a real conspiratorial grift that's caused a lot of damage,\" said Riggleman, who is still considering running for governor as an independent. A poll by Christopher Newport University found 61% of Republicans believe Mr. Biden did not win legitimately.\u00a0 Quentin Kidd, the dean of Arts and Sciences at Christopher Newport University, said the embrace of Mr. Trump and his debunked claims of massive voter fraud is the result of a candidate like Chase pushing the field to the right, and of an \"echo chamber\" occupied by GOP candidates and the base. \"Election integrity is the number one issue to the base. And in a race like this one, that's all you're really talking to,\" added Virginia Republican strategist David Alvarez. Kidd predicted Cox or Snyder would win the nomination, but said whoever it is will have a problem appealing to voters statewide after chasing the base on the right to win the convention.\u00a0 \"The question is are Republicans in those competitive states willing to move away from Trumpism enough to be competitive? Or are they going to double down on Trumpism, and in my mind, really hurt themselves in the general?\" he said.\u00a0 Republican candidates have made former Democrat Governor and candidate Terry McAuliffe their main target for the general. Democrats hold their gubernatorial primary in June. To Chase, a convention process requiring citizens to apply to be delegates in order to vote, will prevent the party from fully tapping Mr. Trump's base by November. \"If we're going to win a statewide election, we need more buy-in of our candidates, not just from the party elites,\" she said. \"The Bush Republicans, the Cheney Republicans, they need to recognize that the people are awake and it's a new day. It's time that they understand they're here to stay and embrace them. We're not going away.\" She, too, is still considering a run as a third-party candidate, out of anger with a convention process she says is already rigged. \"Let's see what happens,\" Chase responded.

And this week on Face the Nation, 20 months into the pandemic, we will sort out the conflicting signals on our recovery from COVID and the COVID economy. More and more Americans are heading back to in- office work, and the jobless rate is inching closer to pre-pandemic levels.   But the broader economy is still struggling to shake off the impact of COVID-19. Prices are surging in sector after sector. Businesses are struggling to find workers. And supply chains are tied in knots.   (Begin VT)   JANET YELLEN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: The pandemic has been calling the shots for the economy and for inflation.   (End VT)   MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what can we do about it? We will ask Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.   Then, we will ask the head of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, Neel Kashkari, for his perspective.   Plus, we're starting to see the seasonal impact on COVID cases, leading some states to encourage booster shots for all adults.   We will check in with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. And we will talk with Colorado Governor Jared Polis, whose state is wrestling with a new surge of infections.   (Begin VT)   GOV. JARED POLIS (D-CO): One in every 48 Coloradans are infected and contagious with COVID-19.   (End VT)   MARGARET BRENNAN: Finally, we will ask World Bank President David Malpass about the international commitment to fight climate change in the wake of the United Nations' Glasgow conference. Will wealthy countries fulfill their broken promise to help impoverished nations cope with the cost of a hotter planet?   It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.   Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.   Progress in our slow march back to normal seems to be a continuing series of starts and stops. And there's a lot of confusion about where we are headed.   Most Sundays, we start the broadcast with a look at what's going on that you need to know. And today's no exception.   But one thing that's different is, our Mark Strassmann is actually here in person.   Good morning to you.   MARK STRASSMANN: Good morning. Great to see you in person.   MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there are a lot of conflicting signals on the economy. What can you tell us?   MARK STRASSMANN: There's some fundamental disconnects going on with the economy, right, between what it is we're all looking to buy vs. what's available in store shelves. That's number one.   Number two, people have money in the bank, but they still feel financially vulnerable. And then there's this constant battle with sticker shock.   (Begin VT)   MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): Econ 101 in late 2021. When demand dwarfs supply and supply chains are bottlenecked, prices explode, inflation's peak surge in three decades.   WOMAN: There aren't enough truck drivers. There aren't enough trucks. All the way along, it's just kind of a hot mess this year.   MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): The Consumer Price Index, what we pay for goods and services year to year, jumped 6.2 percent in October, broad-based and eye-popping, the biggest surge since 1991, new car prices up 9 percent, used cars and trucks astonishingly up 26 percent, gas 50 percent. Heating oil has climbed almost 60 percent with temperatures dropping, and food basics, eggs up 12, bacon up 20 percent.   You quickly see why inflation is now chewing into the president's popularity.   JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Many people remain unsettled about the economy. And we all know why.   MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): With pandemic restrictions loosened, consumer demand has roared back. Millions of families with stockpiled savings want to spend.   WOMAN: Two pallets' worth Arctic Animals by Magna-Tiles, love it.   MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): And merchants want to sell. But supply chains from the ports to the highways remain knotted, among the worried, U.S. turkey farmers. It's less than two weeks before their Super Bowl.   MAN: Everything in the last couple years has been a little more challenging, even down to boxes.   MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): Help wanted, another sign fueling inflation. We have become a nation of quitters. More than four million more workers resigned in September. The U.S. Labor Department reports 10.4 million job openings.   Economists disagree whether this inflation will worsen and about the potential impact of trillions in government spending, the infrastructure bill, the social spending bill, on top of all that pandemic relief.   Inflation pressures the Fed, with rates now triple the average 2 percent gains it aims for annually. And with last month's Gallup poll, nearly 70 percent of Americans believe the economy's getting worse. There's also pressure on a president pushing for Washington to spend more.   (End VT)   MARK STRASSMANN: So, again, the irony is, with more money in the bank, millions of Americans are better off, but they don't feel it, and nor do they believe, Margaret, that anyone has a plan for getting inflation under control.   And many, if not most people believe the economy is going to get worse before it gets better.   MARGARET BRENNAN: All-important consumer psychology.   Mark Strassmann, thank you so much for being here.   MARK STRASSMANN: You bet.   MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, we went to the Treasury Department here in Washington and sat down with Secretary Janet Yellen.   She told us, unsurprisingly, that our economic stability depends on the pandemic.   (Begin VT)   MARGARET BRENNAN: You have said that inflation is likely to be with us until the second half of next year. Are you confident that prices for the average American will be down by the time we head into next November and Election Day?   JANET YELLEN: The pandemic has been calling the shots for the economy and for inflation.   And if we want to get inflation down, I think continuing to make progress against the pandemic is the most important thing we can do. I think it's important to realize that the cause of this inflation is the pandemic.   It led to a dramatic increase in demand for products. Households were unable to spend on services, going out to eat and traveling. They shifted as they stayed at home, worked more from home. They shifted their spending on to goods. That led to a surge in the demand for products.   And although the supply of products has increased in the United States and globally, not as much as demand. Americans feel confident about the job market. Quits have increased to record numbers, which is a sign that people are getting outside offers. They're seeing wage increases.   That is something that didn't have to happen, and it really reflects the support that we gave to Americans to keep up their spending and make it through the pandemic.   But with supply disruptions and this huge shift in demand toward products, we are seeing some broad-based price increases. We have shortages of semiconductors. That's really caused new and used car prices to rise, car production to decline.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty-six percent year over year for used cars.   JANET YELLEN: Yes.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Gasoline up 50 percent, eggs 12 percent, milk 6 percent, coffee 6 percent. So when...   JANET YELLEN: We are seeing some big increases in prices.   MARGARET BRENNAN: When does it get better? When do those spikes abate?   JANET YELLEN: You know, when the economy recovers enough from COVID, the demand patterns, people go back to eating out, traveling more, spending more on services, and the demand for products, for goods begins to go back to normal.   And, also, labor supply has been impacted by the pandemic. Labor force participation is down. It hasn't recovered.   And I would expect that, if we're successful with the pandemic, to be sometime in the second half of next year. I would expect prices to go back to normal.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there could be a political cost to this.   JANET YELLEN: Yes.   Well, there's an economic cost. And Americans feel it. And when gas rises - - average is now over $3 a gallon, in some places, quite a bit higher. Americans notice it. And it makes -- it makes a difference.   But I just think it's important to put inflation in context of an economy that is improving a lot from what we had right after the pandemic and is making progress.   MARGARET BRENNAN: China's leaders have repeatedly asked for the Trump era tariffs to be lifted. If the Biden administration did that, would it make things cheaper?   JANET YELLEN: It would make some difference.   Tariffs do tend to raise domestic prices. We put those tariffs in place, President Trump and his administration did, as retaliation for unfair trade practices. And...   MARGARET BRENNAN: Should they stay in place?   JANET YELLEN: You know, we have said -- the U.S. trade representative, Katherine Tai, has said that we are revisiting the phase one trade deal and recognizing requests to reduce tariffs in some areas.   So that's certainly something that's under consideration.   MARGARET BRENNAN: When we talk about the supply part of the challenge you're dealing with here in the United States, is it the private sector's job to unclog the supply chain? Or is there more that you can be doing within the administration right now?   JANET YELLEN: The supply chains are, by -- are, by and large, private.   But, nevertheless, sometimes helping coordinating actions is useful and necessary to unclog supply chains. We have been talking with the operators of ports in Los Angeles, in Long Beach, in Savannah, trying to understand why there is such backlogs of ships waiting to off-load their goods.   Those ports have agreed to stay open 24/7. And we've talked to the retailers about trying to move their containers out to create more room. We're leaving no stone unturned, even though this -- this is mainly private.   MARGARET BRENNAN: There are record level of job openings right now.   JANET YELLEN: That's right.   MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet there's a worker shortage at the same time. What is going on with the supply and demand mismatch here?   JANET YELLEN: The programs that were put in place, the American Rescue Plan and the CARES Act and other programs, really were intended to support households and families to get through this, so that they didn't take a huge hit to their income.   So, financially, Americans say they feel good about their finances, and that's not an accident.   Unemployment is low. Labor force participation is quite depressed, relative to pre-pandemic levels. I think part of it reflects concerns about COVID and exposure to COVID, especially in jobs that involve public- facing activities. And I -- partly, the fact that child care workers, educators are in short supply creates child care problems. That also tends to suppress labor supply.   So, as I say, when we really get control of the pandemic, I think labor supply will go back to normal.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we at a place where we need to increase immigration in order to meet this challenge?   JANET YELLEN: Well, there are a lot of issues involved in immigration, but that -- I believe that is one reason that we do face supply shortages -- shortages of certain kinds of workers.   MARGARET BRENNAN: What does the economic recovery look like without paid leave?   JANET YELLEN: I think we will still have an economic recovery that will be strong and support ongoing growth.   But labor force participation for -- particularly for women, has been a problem in the United States now for some time. Once upon a time, female labor force participation in the United States was higher than almost any developed country.   And now that is absolutely not the case. And when you compare the United States with other developed countries, a big difference that stands out is a lack of support for people working...   MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.   JANET YELLEN: ... and particularly for women.   Now, I'm very hopeful and fully expect the Build Back Better package to become law.   MARGARET BRENNAN: But it was taken out of the framework.   JANET YELLEN: Yes, so paid...   MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's unlikely to have full support in the Senate.   JANET YELLEN: Paid leave is important. It's an important support for people to be able to work.   But there's a great deal of support in that package for child care. It does a lot to make child care more affordable, so that, for most families, child care expense would be reduced from, I think, about 13 percent now down to no more than 7 percent of their income.   MARGARET BRENNAN: But -- so I...   JANET YELLEN: There would be two additional years of early childhood education that would be universal, and a child tax credit that would help families be able to afford to take good care of their children and also participate in the work force.   So, I think that package will help boost labor force participation, particularly that of women.   MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think what's in there is sufficient?   Because, back in February, you told me women's participation is down because they don't have access universally to paid family and medical leave and child care.   Is it essential to full economic recovery?   JANET YELLEN: It's something that we will try to legislate in the future.   It looks like it won't be a component of this package.   MARGARET BRENNAN: The president's expected to make his selection for the Fed chair. Do you believe Jerome Powell should be renominated? How important is continuity?   JANET YELLEN: I am going to leave it to the president to make a decision.   I have said that I think Chair Powell has done a very good job of running the Fed, of addressing the issues, particularly that arose when the pandemic struck. But what's important is that President Biden choose someone who's experienced and credible. And there are a range of candidates.   (End VT)   MARGARET BRENNAN: You can see our full interview with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on our Web site and our YouTube channel.   We will be back in one minute with Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us.   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now is former FDA Commissioner and Pfizer board member Dr. Scott Gottlieb.   Good morning to you.   DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, FORMER FDA COMMISSIONER: Good morning.   MARGARET BRENNAN: You told us last Sunday that we are entering the final end of this pandemic phase, but we could see an uptick in cases as we transition to the next phase.   Twenty different states in this country are seeing an uptick. Should we prepare for a post-Thanksgiving spike?   SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, we're going to see a post-holiday spike. There's no question about that.   People are exhausted right now, but we need to remain vigilant just for a little bit longer. I think we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of declining prevalence on the back end of this Delta wave and also with the deployment of new technology that we have.   We now have orally available drugs that should be available in the first quarter. We have vaccines available to children. So, we see a point in time when this is going to still be a pervasive risk, COVID, but it's not going to be the prevalent risk it is right now, where it's -- where it dominates our lives.   Now, when you look across the country, though, you really have to look at the country in terms of about 10 different regions and how this coronavirus has been experienced all through this pandemic.   So, if you're in parts of the South right now or the Southeast, even if you're in the Pacific Northwest, where cases are coming down quite dramatically, or the Plains states or certain Mountain states, things are looking pretty good. And South -- in the South, the prevalence is very low and unlikely to bump up substantially.   But if you're in the Southwest right now, you're in the Great Lakes region, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, you're in parts of New England or Western Pennsylvania or Northern New York, or certain Mountain states like Colorado, things don't look good. You haven't experienced the Delta wave yet, and things are going to get worse before they get better.   MARGARET BRENNAN: But you heard the Treasury secretary say basically everything is determined by the path of this virus when it comes to the economic recovery.   When do we say COVID's under control?   SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think COVID is going to be under control in the back end of this Delta wave through a combination of population-wide immunity.   We're going to have a lot of people with immunity, either through vaccination or through infection -- people who choose not to get vaccinated are probably going to get infected by this Delta variant -- as well as the more rapid and widespread deployment of the tools that we're now getting available, the orally available antiviral drugs that people should have available in the first quarter, if things go well, including one drug from the company I'm on the board of, Pfizer, as well as the widespread availability of vaccines, including for children.   We now have the tools to really get this under control. Look, COVID is not going away. This is going to be an endemic virus that stays with us. A lot like the flu, we may have to get revaccinated for this on an annual basis. But this is not going to be sort of the pervasive risk that it is right now, where it dominates our lives and dominates the economy.   But there are some parts of the country that still haven't had their -- had their Delta wave that, unfortunately, are going to be hit pretty hard, especially the unvaccinated or undervaccinated parts of the country, like the Southwest right now, or certain states around the Great Lakes.   There's a question of what happens in the tri-state region or the Mid- Atlantic. We have higher vaccination rates and higher rates of prior infection. So far, they're not seeing the big upticks. I think there's still some risk in those parts of the country as well.   MARGARET BRENNAN: So, preparing us for that -- the NBA is telling its players to get a booster shot as soon as possible.   Dr. Fauci is saying publicly, he's leaning in pretty hard to the idea that it is absolutely essential. Why isn't the CDC telling us to go get booster shots now?   SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think the confusing message around the boosters may -- may end up being one of the biggest missed opportunities in this pandemic.   We now see very clear evidence of declining vaccine effectiveness over time. There's different reasons why that may be the case, but the trend is unmistakable. And this has been apparent since the end of the summer. Now it's very clear. Anyone who's eligible for a booster -- and most Americans probably are eligible for a booster at this point -- should be going out and seeking it.   And this is the fastest way that we can increase the total immunity in the population, because someone who has an old vaccine that may only have 50 percent of its effectiveness left, they go out and get a booster, they restore 95 percent effectiveness, based on the data that we've seen, within a matter of days.   So the fastest way that we can get increased immunity in the population, increase the total immunity in the population, may be through boosting people who've already been vaccinated with two doses. Plus, it's going to be easier to convert that person. It's going to be much easier to convince someone who's had two doses of vaccine to go out and get a third than to convince one of the 18 percent of Americans who's chosen to remain unvaccinated this long to get vaccinated for the first time.   MARGARET BRENNAN: You just said that was one of the biggest missteps in this pandemic. This pandemic has been full of mistakes. Why is this the biggest one?   SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, look, I think, when we look back, this may be a very big missed opportunity to try to get ahead of this Delta wave, again, because this is going to be the fastest way that we can increase the total immunity in the population.   We have to look at the immunity in terms of not just how many people have been vaccinated, but also the depth of immunity. How many people have a lot of residual immune protection against this virus and are going to be what we call a dead-end host, are not going to be someone who can catch and spread this virus?   And the fastest way to turn someone into a dead-end host is to get them fully vaccinated. There's a lot of people with declining vaccine effectiveness right now who can both catch and spread this virus. If we give them a booster, we restore the full effectiveness of that vaccine.   The other way, unfortunately, is to -- to get immunity to the population quickly is to get people infected. And, unfortunately, that's the way a lot of people are choosing to do this. If you go out and start vaccinating someone right now for the first time, it might take five or six weeks for them to get full immunity.   In many parts of the country, this Delta wave will be over in five or six weeks, so we need to do what we can right now.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.   We're 10 months into the administration. The president has nominated someone now to run the FDA. What do you think of this candidate?   SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think experience is important in these roles. That's why Janet -- Dr. Janet Woodcock has been very exceptional in this role. She has a lot of experience in the agency.   Robert Califf also has a lot of experience running the FDA. He is a previous FDA commissioner. I inherited his FDA, so I inherited his team. When I came in, he had left at the end of the Obama administration, in the beginning of the Trump administration. I took over at the beginning of the Trump administration. I inherited his team. It was an outstanding team.   I worked to keep them in place. Most of them stayed. I also inherited his policies that he has set in motion, including around opioids, where he had set in motion an aggressive set of measures, increasing regulation on immediate release formulation of opioids, education for providers.   He also started the discussion around looking at the broader public health impact of the availability of opioids, which ultimately resulted in bipartisan legislation in the SUPPORT Act.   So, Rob did a lot. I was the beneficiary of a lot of things that he set in motion.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and opioids, of course, something that may come up in any hearing, and he's already taking fire for.   SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for your perspective, the former FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb.   We'll be right back.   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: You have heard and seen pictures of those fully loaded ships sitting in Southern California's ports.   Tonight, on \"60 Minutes,\" Bill Whitaker takes a closer look at the deep flaws in America's supply chain.   We will be right back.   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: We have a lot more ahead on Face the Nation, including Colorado Governor Jared Polis, the head of the Minneapolis Federal, Neel Kashkari, and David Malpass, the head of the World Bank.   Stay with us.   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.   Colorado is one of several states dealing with a new spike in COVID cases. Their governor, Democrat Jared Polis, joins us this morning from Boulder.   Good morning to you, Governor.   GOV. JARED POLIS (D-CO): Good morning, Margaret.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Your state's health agency says 72 percent of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated. So why is COVID still ravaging your state?   JARED POLIS: You know, right now what we're seeing across the Rocky Mountain west, the upper Midwest, sort of this swath of the country, we were largely spared the delta spike in summer and late summer, but we're getting it now.   Now, we're hopeful, and so far what we're seeing is it's not going to hit the same levels that it did in southeastern states that had 40, 50, 55 percent vaccination rates. But one think we know about the delta variant, Margaret, it is incredibly effective, like a heat-seeking missile, at seeking out the unvaccinated, infecting them, hospitalizing them in large numbers, and killing them in certain -- all -- far too often.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Ninety-five percent of your ICU beds are occupied. I mean people are getting very ill with this.   You, this week, declared the entire state to be at high risk of exposure. And you told adults to go get a booster shot. Do you think other states should follow suit? And are you disappointed that the CDC has not been clear on this?\"   JARED POLIS: Yes. So we have about 1,500 people hospitalized and 81 percent of them, Margaret, are unvaccinated. Now, of the 19 percent that are vaccinated, we can reduce that, come close to eliminating it with the booster.   And, yes, I've been very frustrated with the convoluted messaging out of the CDC and the FDA. Everybody should get the booster after six months. The data is incredibly clear that it increases your personal protection level. That's why my parents got it. I got it. My family members got it. But it also can also -- help improve the epidemiological state of a particular state or of the entire country because you have folks that are ready to roll up their sleeves and add that extra protection, to go from 70 or 80 percent protection, back to that 90 to 95 percent level of protection, which can really have an impact in preventing the spread of the virus.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted.   Well, your state draws a lot of tourists, particularly as we head into ski season. I'm wondering why you aren't mandating more health restriction. I know you're advising people to wear a mask. Why not issue a mandate? Why not roll out more restrictions, distancing and things like that, in places people gather?   JARED POLIS: Well, there's many examples of folks that are doing what works in Colorado. In fact, I'm coming to you live from the University of Colorado at Boulder, where last year, before the vaccine, they had 1,000 cases in the course of a month. This year, just a handful. Why? Everybody's vaccinated. The students are wearing masks.   Likewise, with our outdoor recreation opportunities in winter, our world- class ski resorts, many of them, of course, are -- anybody can ski. But to go to a lot of those indoor places run by many of the ski resorts, they're also making sure that folks are vaccinated to help make sure that we don't have additional unvaccinated tourists filling up Colorado hospitals.   So I think we have a good model to do it. We had a good ski season last year. The thing that we need most right now is some more snow to make sure that we can give visitors from across the world that experience that they expect.   MARGARET BRENNAN: But why not institute more capacity restrictions, do things to try to help contain the spread?   JARED POLIS: Well, these are happening in our state. There's areas of our state where people are -- have to wear masks indoors. There's other areas of our state, like the university, where -- have vaccination requirements. Most of the ski resorts, which are the source of the most --   MARGARET BRENNAN: But you as a governor.   JARED POLIS: Yes.   Well, as I said, there -- I'm very proud of the steps that the ski industry has taken. I think they're doing very well. It's going to be a very safe experience, just like it was last year, even during the national spikes. It's fundamentally an outdoor recreation activity. And if there's one thing we learned about the virus, including the delta variant, it's relatively safe to be outdoors. Nothing is zero risk in this day and age, but it's relatively safe to be enjoying yourself outdoors.   MARGARET BRENNAN: I hear you saying you prefer businesses to do it versus the government putting in some of those restrictions, is that right?   JARED POLIS: Well, right now, if you're vaccinated, your risk is one-tenth or one-twelfth what it was during the highest peak before. And for folks who are vaccinated, you know, this is still a higher risk than usual in the background, but this is like the endemic state of what this virus will always be. It's no longer a pandemic for you.   If you're unvaccinated, this is the most dangerous time for you no matter where you live in the country or in the world because of the highly contagious nature of the delta variant. The most important thing you can do is get vaccinated.   But if you continue to be unvaccinated, please, be careful, wear a mask and don't gather in large indoor areas around others.   MARGARET BRENNAN: You're coming to the White House tomorrow for the signing of the infrastructure bill I understand. Will you have shovel-ready projects by the spring? Because large parts of this bill don't actually take effect until 2023, 2024. How many jobs do you actually benefit from?   JARED POLIS: Yes, we're -- we're ready to go. We were ready to go several months ago. We're ready to go now. I'll be excited to join President Biden and bipartisan members of Congress to sign the bill.   We, in Colorado, passed a bipartisan infrastructure package through our own legislature to complement what we were expecting out of the federal government, but also to get moving. So we have projects underway, including expansion of Highway 70, an additional lane each way around Floyd Hill to better access our high country and ski resorts throughout the year.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have an estimate on job creation from the federal bill and when those jobs will result?   JARED POLIS: Well, it will be, as you know, it's a 10-year investment package. So there will be jobs on the -- you know, again, the fundamental, it's a benefit to people, right? So are there jobs adding broadband to more families and houses. Yes, there are. But the real benefit is this connects our rural communities and helps empower and grow our local economies. Of course we support the jobs in road expansion and electric vehicle infrastructure. But, again, fundamentally, this will fund the transition to electric vehicles, cleaner air, taking action on climate, and les traffic.   MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.   All right, Governor Polis, good luck to you. Thank you for your time today.   And we'll be right back.   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Neel Kashkari. He's the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis and joins us from that city this morning.   Good morning to you.   NEEL KASHKARI, PRESIDENT AND CEO, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF MINNEAPOLIS: Good morning, Margaret.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Neel, core inflation is at a 30-year high. Do you think we are at the peak or is it going to get worse?   NEEL KASHKARI: The math suggests we're probably going to see somewhat higher readings over the next few months before they likely start to taper off. We're seeing both a surge of demand, because Congress has given a lot of money to families and to businesses to get through the pandemic, but we're also seeing supply disruption at the same time because of the COVID virus.   The good news is, both of those should be temporary. The challenge is, these high prices that families are paying, those are real, and people are experiencing that pain right now. And so we take that very seriously. But I'm optimistic that it should be temporary, even though it is causing pain right now.   MARGARET BRENNAN: It is causing pain, but many Americans feel like they're being told what they're experiencing isn't real when they're told it's transitory. That world the White House keeps using and the Fed keeps using.   You said, we won't get back to 2 percent inflation until 2024. Why do you think it's going to take us that long?   NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I think both of these things, the demand side and the supply side, are going to take some time to work out. But it's important from the Fed's perspective that we don't set long-term monetary policy and adjust too much based on temporary factors, even if those temporary factors take a little bit longer than we expect.   You know, if you look at the supply chains, some supply chains have already sorted themselves out. Some are taking longer. We know the auto sectors and semiconductors, it takes a long time to put more capacity online.   So, there are going to be sectors that are going to be struggling for a while, while other sectors right the ship, so to speak, more quickly. And so we need to pay very close attention to this. We need to take it very seriously. But my view is we also need to not over-react to some of these temporary factors, even though the pain is real.   You know, the Federal Reserve, when we adjust monetary policy, it acts with a lag. And so if we overreact to a short-term price increase, that can set the economy back over the long term.   MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't think the Fed should be taking steps faster than they currently are?   NEEL KASHKARI: Right. I think we've taken the appropriate steps. We've -- as you know, we've begun normalizing our balance sheet, quantitative easing. We've now began to taper process, which will probably take six months. That's the first step in reducing monetary policy boost that we're providing the economy.   And over the next three, six, nine months, I think we're going to get a lot more data on both the demand side and the supply side to get a better reading of where the economy is headed.   MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the emergency bond purchases that had been done throughout the course of the pandemic there, and some of the emergency measures.   I want to ask you about what the administration is saying it's doing, and that is pumping in trillions of dollars in these rescue packages. Is the risk worth it? Because most economists do expect some inflation from it.   NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I thinking Congress and the executive branch, both President Trump and under President Biden, were very aggressive in supporting families and businesses through the pandemic. And that was the right thing to do.   You know, the recovery is much stronger than it was, say, after the 2008 financial crisis. That's in part because the fiscal authorities and the monetary authorities were so aggressive.   I think the question is, what does Congress and the executive branch do going forward? What they've done so far is temporary in nature. The question is, are there long-term new spending programs and are they paid for or not?   MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.   NEEL KASHKARI: Whether or not they are paid for is going to have an impact on inflation.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. So it's actually too soon to say it won't add or have an impact.   COVID. We heard your state and your region highlighted by Dr. Gottlieb as an area where infections are climbing right now. Does this latest wave have a big impact in the recovery that you see right now under way?   NEEL KASHKARI: It absolutely will. Right now we are about four or five million jobs and workers short of where we should be had there been no pandemic. You know, six months ago, when I was on your show with you, I focused on schools that were shut and (INAUDIBLE) unemployment benefits and fear of the virus. Well, schools are largely reopened. The unemployment benefits have expired. So, what we're left with, what's keeping people on the sidelines, we think it's fear of the virus, the delta wave and the continued spread.   So the sooner we can get this pandemic really under control, the more quickly people will have confidence to go back to work. That will help the economic recovery, and that will certainly help bring down inflation.   MARGARET BRENNAN: And what about the childcare and other packages that are built into what the president is trying to push through? I know you've been looking at the impact on women dropping out of the workforce.   NEEL KASHKARI: Well, this is a long-term issue facing our country. You know, we have been a laggard relative to other advanced economies in providing childcare for families. You and I both have young children. We know the huge challenges associated with childcare, yet we're both very privileged to be able to afford it. Many families are not as lucky and so it does have a factor-- it does have an effect on women's participation in the labor force and how high our labor force participation is as a whole.   These challenges have been exacerbated in the pandemic, and so I think long term it is an important economic growth issue and competitive issue for the country.   MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you I guess it's kind of an awkward question, but you heard the Treasury secretary seem to indicate that Jerome Powell, the current chair of the Federal Reserve, might not have a lock on the job. Would nominating another top contender, like Lael Brainard, actually affect policy much?   NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I think both Chair Powell and Governor Brainard are outstanding, very seasoned, experienced monetary policy makers. And I think if either of them got the nod from President Biden, I think we would be in very good, capable hands. I have worked with both of them. I think they're both outstanding. And so I think the president has very good choices ahead of him.   MARGARET BRENNAN: So not much of an impact on policy?   NEEL KASHKARI: I think both of them have been instrumental in the new framework that we've adopted in terms of not short-cutting the economy, and I'm confident that either of them as chair would continue to see that through, and that's very important in my view.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.   Neel Kashkari, thank you for your insight.   We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.   Stay with us.   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to COVID and the COVID economy around the world. The head of the World Health Organization said last week the world is at another critical point of pandemic resurgence. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports from London.   ELIZABETH PALMER: Good morning.   Twenty months in, this pandemic, which has now killed more than five million people worldwide, is once again surging in Europe.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)   ELIZABETH PALMER (voice over): Winter arrived in central Siberia, along with a deadly wave of coronavirus infection. One that swept clear across Russia. The vast majority of its victims were unvaccinated. Most Russians don't trust the state or the locally developed Sputnik v. vaccine. So even after a month of record deaths, only roughly 35 percent of Russians have been immunized.   Western Europe, especially Germany, is also seeing a huge spike in COVID cases. Hospitals are filling up and once again most of those seriously ill haven't had a shot.   The Austrian government has said enough is enough. In hard-hit areas, people who get themselves fully vaccinated, it said, can live normal lives. And those who refuse will go back into lockdown.   In the Netherlands, public patience with restrictions is wearing thin. Police brought out water cannons in The Hague as they faced off with protesters furious about new rules to tackle a COVID surge, including early closing times for cafes and restaurants.   And, increasingly, across the continent, anyone looking to enter an indoor public space has to show a vaccine pass.   The exception is Britain, where Remembrance Day ceremonies went ahead pretty much as normal today. Everyone is breathing a little easier after a big spike in October, U.K. COVID infections are finally on the way down.   (END VIDEOTAPE)   ELIZABETH PALMER: But even with high vaccination rates here and a smooth roll out of the booster program, the experts are saying with winter looming, the U.K. is not out of the woods yet.   Margaret.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz Palmer, thank you.   Poor countries continue to wait on COVID shots. The head of the WHO said it is a scandal, in his view, that six times more booster shots are administered globally than first doses are in low-income countries. An organization heavily involved in financing global vaccines and climate change commitments for developing country is the World Bank, and its president, David Malpass, is with us this morning.   Good morning to you.   DAVIS MALPASS, PRESIDENT WORLD BANK GROUP: Good morning, Margaret.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have no shortage of issues. The vaccine crisis. You have, right now, inflation at a 30-year high in the United States, debt crisis, potentially, in China, potential energy issues in Europe. How shaky is this global recovery?   DAVID MALPASS: You know, it's very difficult. And for people at the bottom, for the poor, it's really an unequal situation. They're not getting vaccines. The debt burden is super high. And so this is a challenge for everybody.   Their growth rates are well under the growth rates in the advanced economies. And that's the opposite of what we really want. To get development, we need them to be growing faster, creating even more jobs, but the unemployment rates there are very high.   MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what is the first step in solving that?   DAVID MALPASS: The first step is vaccines. So we can talk about that. But then I think there has to be really a range of policies for the countries themselves. They can do more to help. And then in the advanced economies, there's just not a -- there's not resources that are going worldwide. They're mostly staying in unequal situations in the advanced economies themselves. The people doing the best right now are the people at the top.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the top two biggest economies, the United States and China, also have their issues. China has this debt crisis potentially that you heard the Treasury secretary say they're monitoring very closely. How concerned are you?   DAVID MALPASS: We work closely with China. You know, its system is different from the market-based system of the world. It's a communist party system. And so there are frictions. There are -- there are challenges. But from the standpoint of the World Bank, we're working well with them on marine plastics, reducing that from the -- from the river systems. Also the -- also from a greenhouse gas emission standpoint, we're working with them.   So, you know, China's engaged in the world. It's making vaccines for its own population. And, so, we can look at that as well.   I think we have to recognize there are these frictions on debt transparency, for example. As they -- as they enter into contracts in the developing world, there's often a nondisclosure clause, which makes it very hard for people to know whether they're getting a fair deal.   MARGARET BRENNAN: China's being a predatory lender to poor people is what you're saying.   DAVID MALPASS: You -- you said that. And so we're working with them hard to try to get more transparency in the contracts. And that actually helps them and the developing countries.   MARGARET BRENNAN: The World Bank has warned that because of COVID, low- income countries have an enormous debt level. Are you saying that we are at the point where we could see what we went through a few years ago with the Greek debt crisis, where a country is, you know, basically needing to be bailed out?   DAVID MALPASS: Yes. And so the -- we did a report a year and a half ago, before the pandemic, that was called \"Four Waves of Debt.\" SO there was the Latin debt crisis. There was the Greek debt crisis. And we're at risk of another one now. It would be based on the poorest -- low- income countries, debt went up by 12 percent in 2020. Even in the pandemic, where most of the economic activity was going down, their debts were going up. We've done two big reports just in the last two months on this -- this big challenge.   I've been pushing for debt relief for the poorest countries. That's been hard to achieve. The world just is not set up to think about it this way, of-- you're in the middle of a pandemic, you ought to have a moratorium on the payments from those countries, but there's no mechanism to do that.   MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about climate. We just saw this weekend the big conference, the U.N. conference, wrap up. Rich countries have been pledging for a while that they are going to pitch in $100 billion a year to help low-income countries basically adapt here to extreme weather. Five to 10 times that might be needed.   So, how much did this climate change conference fall short?   DAVID MALPASS: These are huge challenges. I was glad to see them talking about specifics, like coal and methane. You know, methane is one of the most powerful greenhouse gasses. And they are looking for ways to reduce that. The leaking that's coming from wells and from pipelines. That's practical.   The World Bank is very much on that side. We need to find projects that are impactful, and then how do you fund them? And you're exactly right, the amounts of funding need to be many times what's been -- what's been talked about or provided so far.   World Bank can't do it alone, but it -- I think it's going to take the whole world effort. We don't want to punish the poor. And the poor are already getting punished by inflation, as you mentioned.   And, you know, China and Russia are benefiting in some ways from these conditions. China, because it's the core of the supply chain, and Russia because it has so many energy resources. And so we have this big challenge in finding a balance in the world to pay for the climate changes that would actually reduce greenhouse gas. That can be practical. Coal is a practical one. How do you decommission an old coal-fired power plant?   MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.   DAVID MALPASS: Some operating in South Africa are 55 years old. So we're working -- the World Bank is engaged in all these issues, trying to have practical projects that are funded.   MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something you wrote last year. You had an op-ed with Melinda Gates talking about the recovery requiring an investment in women, in particular. And you said, all countries would benefit from appropriate family leave policies and quality childcare.   So, as an economist, are you saying paid leave is essential to a recovery?   DAVID MALPASS: Well, all countries need family leave policies. So, I don't know about paid. That's a -- you know, I don't want to comment on a U.S. political issue. But for the world, the women in the labor force -- and I heard Secretary Yellen talking about that -- this is vital because they're a key part of how countries can grow.   And it's not just in the labor force. Women need to be included in inheritance rights, for example. In some countries they can't do that. And especially girls in education is a vital need for the world. If you're going to develop, that has to be a starting point for it. And some of the world is not at that point. And so we work hard on those issues, gender equality issues and inclusion in the financial system, the labor force, and so on.   MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Making the economic argument, not the political one.   We'll be right back in a moment.   (ANNOUNCEMENTS)   MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.  ",

            "article_content": "For the majority of Americans still concerned about the pandemic as winter approaches, uncertainties remain, because even as cases have started to come down, more suspect the outbreak will get worse than better in the coming months. For parents of younger children, the season may bring a decision on whether to get their kids vaccinated when and if that shot is approved, and we can start to see the context of that public health question forming already. At the moment there are many parents saying they will get their children vaccinated, but nearly as many saying they won't, with plenty of \"maybes\" in between. As you might expect, there's a strong connection here between this stance and whether the parent is vaccinated, or not. These patterns, asking people about a not-yet-widely-available shot, aren't entirely unlike what we saw in early 2021 regarding adults and the vaccine. At the time, there were those eager to get it, and a lot of maybes who eventually did, but the staunch holdouts were there, and have remained.\u00a0 And there's some partisan difference in this, too, with parents who are Democrats more likely than Republicans to say yes, which also echoes some of the adult patterns we've long tracked.\u00a0 Another preventive measure for kids \u2014 requiring masks in school \u2014 does find favor with most parents amid recent controversies and differing state policies. Parents who are themselves vaccinated are more likely to want masks required, continuing a pattern we've seen throughout the pandemic where concern about the virus and risks connects with a broad range of support for preventative measures and behaviors, including getting oneself vaccinated. Among the minority who feel masks should not be required, most give the reason that they feel it a matter of personal choice, echoing the sentiment many opponents have been using. About half pick the view that forcing children to wear masks for a long time is cruel, and four in 10 say children cannot learn effectively with them. Then, there are decisions Americans might need to make about where to go, how to travel, and how to get to their destination. We continue to see large differences by vaccination status. The vaccinated strongly favor mandates and proof of vaccines, and most would themselves be more comfortable going to places and travelling if those requirements were in place. The remaining unvaccinated not only oppose those measures, but largely aren't concerned about the virus to begin with. The vaccinated also voice frustration with the unvaccinated. When asked to pick ways to describe the unvaccinated, the fully vaccinated often choose \"they're putting people like me and my family at risk\" and \"they're being misled\" as descriptors. \u00a0And those who have gotten a shot feel very differently about whether requirements ought to be in place to do things. This debate plays out in politics and campaigns too \u2014 more people want their candidates to encourage people to get vaccinated and support mandates. Most Republicans do want a candidate who encourages vaccination (and a majority of Republicans are themselves vaccinated) \u2014 but at the same time, most Republicans don't want a candidate who supports mandates for it. And in things that could impact the economy as we head into travel season, the vaccinated and their preferences are a strong economic force numerically. Many of the vaccinated would feel more comfortable going on an airplane or to a workplace or a restaurant if they knew it required everyone to be vaccinated. Looking ahead to the holidays, just over a quarter will be visiting friends and family more this year, but for most Americans -- vaccinated or not -- it will be about the same as last year. Most figure they'll either be gathering with a mix of both vaccinated and unvaccinated people or will not be checking on others' vaccine status. A quarter plan to restrict themselves to gathering with only the vaccinated. \u00a0More immediately, most Americans think children who go trick-or treating this year will be safe. Though the percentage of vaccinated Americans continues to creep upwards, as the number of Americans taking a \"wait and see\" approach diminishes, those who are firmly in the \"no\" camp have barely budged. Among the unvaccinated, the few who are still making up their minds give different reasons than those who have firmly decided against the vaccine. Those who are still deciding cite worry about the side effects or that it's too untested, as their top reasons for not getting a vaccine.\u00a0 Most who have no plans to get a vaccine are also worried about the side effects, but more of them say distrust of the government, as well as of the scientists and companies who make the vaccines, are their top reasons. There are also some expressed political sentiments among some of those unwilling to get unvaccinated (as opposed to those just unsure): 40% of them say they are also making a statement about personal freedom, and 36% say that they are taking a stand against the Biden administration. In looking for guidance about how to manage coronavirus risks, about half of Americans feel the information they're hearing from medical professionals and public health agencies has been confusing, and unvaccinated Americans are especially apt to claim this. Those who find the information confusing are responding in different ways. The vaccinated are more likely than the unvaccinated to say this confusion generally makes them take more precautions, while the unvaccinated are relatively more likely to say it makes them take fewer precautions.\u00a0 Many among each group say they are just not sure what to do. Overall, looking ahead to the winter, just over a quarter think the outbreak will get better. More think it will either get worse or stay about the same.\u00a0 Assessments of how things are going for the U.S. in its efforts to deal with the coronavirus outbreak have also declined since the summer. Just over half of Americans now think things are going well.\u00a0 The drop is largely seen among Republicans and independents. Back in July, two out of three Americans said things were going well, including majorities across the partisan spectrum. Now, once again, we see familiar partisan divisions, with Democrats largely seeing things as going well, Republicans seeing things as going badly, and independents evenly divided. Mr. Biden's handling of the coronavirus remains at majority approval, even as his overall approval is split and has stabilized after taking a sharp drop after the events in Afghanistan. It's underpinned today by those positive marks for handling the outbreak, as well as for vaccine distribution. But in that you can see more of the nation's starkly different views of the same situation. When asked specifically why people thought he was doing a good job on the outbreak, top answers were that he was encouraging people to get vaccinated and promoting mandates. For those who think he's doing a bad job, their top answers included that he was promoting mandates. At the same time, his overall ratings are weighed down by negative evaluations for the economy, and low marks on immigration and Afghanistan. Among Democrats, he's come back up from lows from just after the Afghanistan withdrawal, but he hasn't rebounded with independents, while whatever small measure of Republican approval he once had early in his term has since largely eroded. This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,054 U.S. adult residents interviewed between October 6-8, 2021. This sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey, and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as 2020 presidential vote.

And this week on FACE THE NATION, the Biden administration's booster shot plans hit a roadblock, and Congress gets set for a fall budget showdown. There is relief this morning in the nation's capital as the strong show of security at Saturday's rally in support of those arrested following the January 6th insurrection kept the crowds away. Nothing like the scene nine months ago. Now the focus turns to lawmakers, as both Houses of Congress return to Washington for the first time since the end of July. First up, consideration of a massive 3.5-trillion-dollar spending plan that threatens to shatter the fragile fault lines within the Democratic Party. We'll talk with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Plus, an FDA advisory panel overwhelming votes against widespread booster shots for adults, saying that the data is inconclusive. We'll ask the Director of the National Institutes of Health Dr. Francis Collins what happened. Plus, we'll have a special conversation with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. His new book, Uncontrolled Spread takes a hard look at America's covid failures and offers some solutions. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD/Author, Uncontrolled Spread): We cannot allow something like this to hit us this bad again, so we have to prepare differently. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll also talk with United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby about how the travel industry is navigating the persistent pandemic threat. Plus, a look at the fallout from the U.S. military's tragic mistake last month in Afghanistan. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. On the COVID front the news is still bleak. Nearly 10,000 Americans died last week of the virus. We now total more than 673,000 dead. Children, who are still not eligible for vaccines, account for almost 29% of all cases. And according to the AAP, there were nearly a quarter million new pediatric covid infections last week. We begin with Senior National Correspondent Mark Strassmann in Orlando. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): Instead of widespread booster, the Biden White House got a shot of rejection. An FDA advisory panel on Friday recommended Pfizer boosters only for vaccinated seniors and high-risk patients. A decision-making it challenging process even more so. VIVEK MURTHY, M.D. (U.S. Surgeon General): If you want to roll out booster shots to the population, you can't flip a switch and make that happen overnight. MARK STRASSMANN: Not in COVID America, where the virus now kills around nineteen hundred people a day, the highest average in six months. By any measure, COVID sorrow stalks Florida with a vengeance. More than fifty thousand Floridians already dead. An average of three hundred fifty more every day tops in America. DR. VINCENT HSU: We've got to manage our behaviors. We got to get vaccinated. MARK STRASSMANN: Doctor Vincent Hsu, an infectious disease physician, works at AdventHealth, Orlando. Systemwide AdventHealth has fifty hospitals with seventeen hundred COVID patients. More than half of them in Central Florida. DR. VINCENT HSU: There is still a lot of issues with-- with taking care of these patients, supplies, space, as well as staffing. MARK STRASSMANN: Continuous surges remain a threat? DR. VINCENT HSU: We always have to be prepared for another surge. MARK STRASSMANN: Critics blast the state's leadership for failing to protect the youngest Floridians. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner): The decision to keep-- trying to keep kids in school was the right decision. The decision to let the virus spread the way it has and not even employ mitigation in the schools, as they're doing now, I disagree with that decision. MARK STRASSMANN: Pandemic politics surged blood pressures across the country. CROWD (in unison): No more masks. MARK STRASSMANN: In Ohio, state lawmakers threaten to block any mask mandate the governor tried to issue. And like his reaction-- GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE (R-Ohio): Every single county is red-hot. Some counties are almost boiling over. MARK STRASSMANN: At the United Nations, the global worry: a potential superspreader event starting on Tuesday. New York City has a vaccine mandate for conventions, but the U.N. has no power to enforce it. ANT\u00d3NIO GUTERRES (U.N. Secretary General): We, as Secretariat, cannot tell a head of state if he is not vaccinated that he cannot enter the United Nations. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: This hospital, Orlando's largest, is short hundreds of nurses despite retention bonuses and shift bonuses. And it's a crisis across America's hospitals. Early retirements, resignations, and a rash of sick days, staff burned out by this ongoing COVID siege. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, thank you. We'd like to now welcome the director of the National Institutes of Health, Doctor Francis Collins, to the broadcast. Thank you for taking time this morning. FRANCIS COLLINS, M.D. (Director, National Institutes of Health/@NIHDirector): I'm glad to be with you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor, you predicted earlier this month that it may well be boosters are going to be recommended for almost everybody. That didn't happen on Friday. Do you still accept-- expect broad approval? FRANCIS COLLINS: You know, we have to see how this plays out over the coming weeks because the data changes every day. I do think it was very significant that the FDA Advisory Committee voted unanimously in favor of offering boosters to people sixty-five and over and to others who have high-risk exposures like health care professionals. So we're starting down that path. They weren't convinced yet that the data required this for younger individuals who aren't at high risk. But I think some of the data we're seeing coming in, especially from Israel, tells me that it's likely that they will get to that point. But this was a start, and I know people were confused about different messages. But in a certain way, Margaret, this is the way it ought to be. Science sort of playing out in a very transparent way, looking at the data coming from multiple places, our country, other countries-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. FRANCIS COLLINS: --and trying to make the best decision for right now. That's what they did. MARGARET BRENNAN: But as a medical professional, your view is a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine will be necessary for everyone? FRANCIS COLLINS: You know, yeah, I am a physician, a scientist, I'm not a politician, I'm trying to figure out what's the best answer here. The place that might still be somewhat questionable would be the very youngest individuals is the benefit risk needed there. But certainly, I think there will be a decision in-- in the coming weeks to extend boosters beyond the list that they approved on Friday. MARGARET BRENNAN: So this advisory panel, as you said, gave a green light for sixty-five and up and those high risk. Who does that actually mean? Doctor-- Doctor Peter Marks, the FDA official who oversees vaccines, put teachers in that high-risk category. Do you agree with that? FRANCIS COLLINS: I think they could be seen in that space. They are, after all, in circumstances, especially if they're in classrooms with kids under twelve who can't be vaccinated, where they are at higher risk of exposure than most of the rest of us. So maybe in that regard, they kind of fit into the same category as health care providers. The way in which the FDA panel made the vote, it was a little ambiguous. FDA is going to think about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, exactly because you wonder, is it just as risky being in a classroom as a hospital ward? And what does that mean for people like me who live with unvaccinated children? Does that put me in a high-risk category? FRANCIS COLLINS: Margaret, that is a great question. And I think that is one the CDC will probably have their committee discuss in some seriousness on Wednesday and Thursday because, yes, you are in a circumstance with younger kids who can't be immunized where it is more likely that you could be exposed than somebody who's living alone. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll watch for that. If someone got the Moderna or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and they fit into the sixty-five and older category, do they walk into their CVS this week and say, give me a third dose of Pfizer? Can you mix and match? And I know NIH is looking at this, so tell me what you're seeing so far. FRANCIS COLLINS: So we are right in the middle of those trials to see, can you mix and match any one of the three that have emergency use authorization, can you start with one and boost with the others? We're going to know more about that just in the course of the next two or three weeks. Right now we don't have the answer. Moderna and J&J, by the way, have also submitted their booster data, so it's likely that FDA will be able to have a comment on that pretty soon. It's not quite in sync here. So people who got Moderna that would be including me need to sort of hang on here and see what the recommendation is for those of us who were interested in a booster and people shouldn't be rushing out right now and getting a booster before it's actually gone through this process, a fair number of people seem to be doing that. Hang on, people. Let's be clear, the vaccines right now in the U.S. are doing a great job of protecting people against severe disease hospitalization. What we're worried about is that it's beginning to erode and we're seeing more breakthrough cases and we don't want to get behind this virus. We want to stay ahead of it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the White House did want boosters broadly available this week. Do you still believe they will be widely available this week? FRANCIS COLLINS: Well, part of the reason for this to get talked about a month ago was to be sure we were prepared. You know, I kind of think about this like when you're preparing for a hurricane. We have a system that starts noticing a tropical disturbance somewhere out there in the Atlantic long before there's a risk that it's going to hit New Orleans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. FRANCIS COLLINS: This is good. That's kind of what we're trying to do with COVID-19. So part of this announcement that this might very well, if FDA and CDC agree it'd be a good thing, was to get all the pharmacies, all of the other preparations together. So there wouldn't be a mad dash at the end-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. FRANCIS COLLINS: --to try to actually implement this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, which we saw with the Trump administration. FRANCIS COLLINS: I think we are in a pretty good place by the end of this week. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, well-- FRANCIS COLLINS: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: So we know that next month is a target for a vaccine to five- and eleven-year-olds. What about preschoolers and the very young? When do you expect vaccines for them? FRANCIS COLLINS: So the trials on kids under five are still going on. The data won't be submitted to FDA for a bit longer, so I think realistically we're not going to see approval in that space until very much later this year. I wouldn't want to put a precise date on it, though. There are so many uncertainties there about FDA's review and what the data looks like. But, as you said, kids five to eleven, the data is supposed to come in at the end of this month and FDA will be working 24/7 to go through it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. FRANCIS COLLINS: So we all hope that can happen in weeks and not months. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so still potentially within this year for the very young. Quickly, as a doctor, there's going to be a massive gathering in New York City for the U.N. General Assembly this week. Are you concerned it'll be a superspreader event? FRANCIS COLLINS: Well, I sure hope not. We've had enough of those, haven't we? I hope people are taking this with the appropriate seriousness as far as vaccines and mask wearing and not doing silly things, gathering indoors with masks off amongst people who are unvaccinated or even people who are vaccinated since we know they could also be breakthroughs and can be passing it along. So, yeah, New York, let's pay attention here. We're in the midst of a Delta surge. It is not a safe place to throw caution to the winds. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor, thank you for your time this morning. FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who joins us from Burlington. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont/@SenSanders): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lots to get to with you today. But I do want to ask your reaction to news that the U.S. military killed seven children, three civilian adults in this drone strike. You have in the past been very critical of reliance on drone strikes. Are you comfortable with the Biden administration's \"over-the-horizon\" policy? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I certainly hope they understand what happened and make sure that never happens again. And this is not only a human tragedy, it reflects on us before the entire world. It's unacceptable. MARGARET BRENNAN: On immigration, I also want to get your reaction to what the Biden administration just said they're doing this weekend, which is to step up deportations, particularly of some of these Haitian migrants who have gathered in southern Texas, thousands of them. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar has called it inhumane. Do you agree with her and looking at what you're working on right now on Capitol Hill, do you expect immigration will be tucked into this three-and-a-half-trillion-dollar spending plan? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I hope it will in the sense that right now we have many, many millions of undocumented people in this country, people who are working hard. In fact, people who have maintained this economy, people doing the essential work, something like eleven million people. And I would hope very much, and I think the American people agree, that now is the time. And if we can do it through reconciliation, I'm there. I want to do it to move toward a path towards citizenship and comprehensive immigration reform through the reconciliation bill. That's my hope. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that-- whether or not that can be done is still going to be decided. I know you say you want it done. But isn't this exactly the same kind of social policy that moderates are bulking-- balking at here because you're-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, actually-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --tucking it into a mechanism that even you-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Margaret, actually, the truth-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --have said in the past should just be used for budget and spending? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, the truth is that when you because we have no Republican support in trying to pass a significant piece of legislation representing working families, we have to do it through the so-called reconciliation process, which means that you have to obey the Byrd Rules. I won't go into-- bore you with all the details. So, it's something that we are arguing right now. But I do hope as we move toward what I believe is the most consequential piece of legislation for the working class of this country, as we demand that the wealthiest people and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes as we lower the cost of prescription drugs as we expand Medicare-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --to include dental care for seniors and hearing aids and eyeglasses as we lower the childhood poverty as we have already done, maintain that by fifty percent as a result of the American Rescue Plan. I hope that immigration reform is part of that general package. MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't all these very worthy causes you're laying out deserve their own debate and consideration. You in the past have said-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --that this is not how this should happen. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Margaret right now we have-- right now, we have no Republican support. Zero. There's not one Republican who is prepared to stand up to the drug companies and lower the cost of prescription drugs. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you may not have full Democratic support either. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Not one Republican who wants to build affordable housing. We can't do it without the reconciliation package. So right now, what we are doing and let's be clear, and I want the American people to understand it. We're taking on the pharmaceutical industry. We're spending millions and millions of dollars trying to make sure they could charge us ten times more than the people of other countries for drugs. We're taking on the health care industry-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --does not want to expand Medicare. We're taking on the fossil fuel industry who thinks it's okay to continue emitting carbon while destroying the planet. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, but you have to-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: This is really a-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You have to-- you also-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --monumental struggle. MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand it's monumental and it's a struggle within your own party-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: You understand that? MARGARET BRENNAN: --to be frank because Senator Manchin just met this week with President Biden. He continues to say the number you're asking for, it's too big. It's too much. Will you meet with the President this week and do you plan to give anything here to get closer to the numbers-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, Margaret, I'll tell you this-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --that the moderates in your own party say need to be met? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, let me tell you this. We have started off, as you know, with, I would guess, eighty percent of the Democratic caucus supporting a six-trillion-dollar bill. Remember, this is over ten years. Per year it's less than we spend on the military. Now maybe you can tell me, or somebody else can tell me, how much we should spend to save the planet. Because what the scientists are telling us is that if we don't get a handle on climate change within the next few years, there will be irreparable damage. And you know what I got four kids and seven grandchildren. And I think we have a moral responsibility to leave them a planet that is healthy and is habitable-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you sure that President-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: So we are working-- right now we got fifty, we got fifty votes. We're going to have to work it out, as we did with the American Rescue Plan. But I have already made, and my colleagues have made a major compromise, going from six trillion down to three and a half trillion. MARGARET BRENNAN: So am I hearing you correctly when you say you are not willing to move on that three-and-a-half-trillion-dollar number, even if the President asks you to do it? I mean, are you risking losing out for that? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right now-- look, right now what we are doing is we are engaging with the House and the Senate. It is a complicated proposal. All I am telling you is the three and a half trillion is much too low. A compromise has already been made; an agreement has been made. And the American people, by the way, poll after poll after poll are telling us-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --now is the time to stand up to powerful special interests. Now is the time to start representing working families. On all of these issues-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --they are enormously powerful and maybe, just maybe we can work for workers for a change and not just campaign wealthy campaign contributors. MARGARET BRENNAN: You keep saying-- you keep saying the number of fifty votes, but it is well reported that Senator Manchin and Senator Sinema are not with you-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: You know-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --on this within the Democratic Party. Are you certain-- SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, we went through this with the American Rescue Plan. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that President Biden will get them all in line? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We dealt with this with the American Rescue Plan, which, as you know, is the most significant piece of legislation to take us out of the economic decline. And it cut childhood poverty by fifty percent. It provided unemployment benefits. It did what had to be done to get us out of the emergency. We came together. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And I expect because of the pressure of the American people we're going to come together again and do what has to be done. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you meet with President Biden this week, just like Senator Manchin did last? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I talked to, I talked to-- I'm happy to meet with the President any time, but at the end of the day, I think what-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --the overwhelming majority of the American people want us to do is finally stand up for them, not just the drug companies and the health care industry and the fossil fuel industry. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: This is what we are trying to do. It's an enormous fight. We're going to win it. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's an enormous fight and we will track it. Thank you very much, Senator Sanders. We'll be right back in a moment with more FACE THE NATION. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: There were some big developments on the national security beat last week, including the Pentagon's admission of a tragic deadly mistake by U.S. military commanders last month as Americans were pulling out of Afghanistan. For more we turn to CBS senior national security correspondent David Martin. David, it's good to have you here. You heard Senator Sanders say how badly this reflects on the country in the eyes of the rest of the world. But policy-wise, doesn't this show also a flaw with the President's over-the-horizon strategy reliant on strikes like this? DAVID MARTIN (CBS News Senior National Security Correspondent/@CBSDavidMartin): Well, this is the heart of the matter. What happens in Afghanistan matters here in the U.S. only if al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups there are able to make a comeback. The U.S. says it's going to prevent that with surveillance conducted from outside the country, drones flying from outside the country, what they call over the horizon. And that they will be able to detect a-- a plot in the works and then be able to disrupt it with a-- with a drone strike. But you have to say this mistake made in Kabul is not an encouraging precedent. They had six drones over Kabul that day--six. So now everybody is gone. They have to operate these drones from outside the country. Are they really going to be able to sustain that many drones over-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Six drones, and, yet, an aide worker is who they killed, who had no ties to ISIS. DAVID MARTIN: It-- it was just a horrendous mistake and nobody claims it was anything but-- but that it happened in the context of a terrorist attack just a few days before. Communications, intercepts, telling them there was going to be another terrorist attack, and that it was going to evolve a white Toyota Corolla. And this aid worker just happened to be driving a white Toyota Corolla. And as he drive around Kabul just going about his business, at the same time, the drone operators are hearing this intercepts, talking about a white Corolla. And so each one of his entirely innocent stops becomes suspicious to them, especially when they see him loading containers into his trunk. They thought they were explosives when they ordered the strike and after-- after the investigation was done, of course, those containers held water which he was bringing home to his family because his home was without running water. I mean, it was-- it was just the final debacle of the Afghan war. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and, you know, just this week, the-- the deputy CIA director told our Olivia Gazis that they're already tracking al-Qaeda members moving back to Afghanistan. So it raises the stakes on getting things right when it comes to-- DAVID MARTIN: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --protecting the homeland. In this new book Peril that just came out there is extensive reporting about the decisions on both Presidents regarding Afghanistan. The chairman of the chief-- Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chief military advisor to the President said don't do it, don't do it this way. And the Secretary of Defense General Austin said the same thing to President Biden and he dismissed it. DAVID MARTIN: He didn't dismiss it. He listened. They all give him credit for listening. But he just wasn't buying it. He just did not believe that it was worth the candle to remain in Afghanistan. Remember, Lloyd Austin had seen this movie before because he was the commander in Iraq during the Obama administration, when the Obama administration pulled all its combat troops out of Iraq, which gave rise to ISIS. And then he was the commander of the U.S. Central Command when ISIS came storming out of Syria-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DAVID MARTIN: --and we had to basically fight the-- the war of Iraq all over. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. DAVID MARTIN: So not only had he seen this movie before, he played a role in it. And-- and he had a great sense of foreboding. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is why that reporting is so important. David, thank you for your analysis and your time today. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We go now to United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby, who joins us from State College, Pennsylvania. Good morning to you. SCOTT KIRBY (United Airlines CEO): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: United has said ninety percent of your employees are vaccinated following your mandate. What about contractors and for someone buying a ticket on your airline? How confident can they be they won't run into someone unvaccinated? SCOTT KIRBY: Well, there are a lot of people that work in the airports that don't yet have a vaccine requirement, though the administration's role is going to ultimately take care of that. But one of the things that's important when you're traveling on an airplane, particularly once you're on the airplane, it's really the safest place you can be because of the airflow on an airplane, safest place you can be indoors. And so, wear your mask in the airport. That's a rule. And-- and before long, we'll have everyone in the airports vaccinated. Thanks to the administration's order. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Delta variant is causing problems in terms of people's willingness to buy tickets to get on planes. Your company announced that you're going to lose money the next two quarters. Why aren't people flying? SCOTT KIRBY: Well, the Delta variant has obviously caused a downturn in-- in travel, it's particularly business travel. A lot of offices were expecting to be open again in September, and the Delta variant has pushed those opening dates back a few months. My guess is it will now be January. It appears that we've peaked in cases. Let's hope that that's the case. Let's hope that as we continue to get more people vaccinated, we really can get back to normal across the country. But the demand recovery really probably has been pushed back to January. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll watch and see. Would you advise the administration that they roll out another wave of mandates, this time for passengers? You know if TSA screens you to make sure you're not hurting your other passengers, potentially should they also check your card to see if you're vaccinated? SCOTT KIRBY: Well, I think the administration is doing a really admirable job of trying to find all the levers to push to get the whole country vaccinated, and they have really got better data and science. MARGARET BRENNAN: And they're discussing that. Should they do it? SCOTT KIRBY: They-- you hear it sometimes. But I think the administration's perspective has been that getting people vaccinated at work, it's a one shot and you can really get a whole bunch of the country. You can get a high percentage of the country as opposed to making it a burden on people that are vaccinated every time you get on a plane, a train, any kind of public transportation to prove that you're vaccinated. So, for now, I think their approach of focusing on the employment and focusing on work is probably the right way to go. But they've got great data and science, and if they tell us that they want us to check everyone, we're prepared to do that as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to data and science, Doctor Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner, has argued that the Biden administration's travel restrictions that they've kept in place on Europe, on India and China, other countries, they don't really work. Have they given you a timeline on when those restrictions will be lifted? SCOTT KIRBY: They haven't given us a timeline specifically, but they do talk to us a lot, and, you know, I think they're just trying to take a cautious approach and really put safety first as they go through the crisis. And given the case rates, you know, in Europe and the U.S. are similar in the high vaccination rates higher in Europe, actually. I'm hopeful that we'll get those borders, particularly to Europe, open soon, but they're following the data and the science. But we hope that-- that as-- as cases come down that that's something that will happen soon. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that's a political decision? SCOTT KIRBY: I really think that they're just focused on trying to do the right thing here, and this is a lot of-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep. SCOTT KIRBY: --uncertainty around what it means, and I think they're just focused on the right thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of what's being debated here on Capitol Hill. There are two huge bills, one of them, this 1.2-trillion-dollar infrastructure plan, it's got funding in airports included into the package. How necessary is it and how would you want that money to be programmed? What do you need it for? SCOTT KIRBY: Yeah. So I-- I am very supportive of the entire infrastructure package, as is most of the business community. It's a great opportunity to invest in America coming out of-- out of this crisis. In airports, you know, you can fly around and see the airports. It's been a long time since we've had real investment in the airports. Our air traffic control system, you know, still flies in a lot of ways the same way we flew fifty, sixty years ago. And there's real opportunities to make it more efficient and it'd be good for the economy, good for customers, really kind of good for society as a whole. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're for the 1.2. When it comes to the three-and-a-half-trillion-dollar spending bill, there's also some climate change related provisions tucked into it. We talked about that-- SCOTT KIRBY: Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --with Senator Sanders. But for you-- SCOTT KIRBY: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --in-- in private business, is-- is it just so expensive to make some of these changes on your own that you need American taxpayers to provide tax credits and to provide incentives for private businesses to go green? SCOTT KIRBY: Well, particularly for the climate change initiatives, we do need government support, really to fund the investment. If you look at solar and wind, twenty years ago, they couldn't compete with coal or natural gas, and today it's cheaper. That's because the government provided credits to give certainty to invest in the industry, and that's what we need for things like sustainable aviation fuel. This really is an opportunity in America to drive investment, drive the next generation of great jobs that can be green, but also great jobs, great technology that we can export around the world. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, for you, the benefit outweighs the risks here of spending that much money. SCOTT KIRBY: Well, the climate change elements are a part of the three-and-a-half trillion so the climate change elements in particular, and I don't know-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SCOTT KIRBY: --a hundred percent of what they are, but the ones I do know about I'm very supportive of and-- and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. SCOTT KIRBY: --hope that they pass either in this bill or somewhere else. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll watch. Thank you, Mister Kirby, for your time this morning. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb has been a valuable resource for this broadcast and our viewers throughout the COVID crisis, helping us cut through the confusion to tell you what you need to know. His new book, Uncontrolled Spread, takes a critical look at the mistakes America's leaders made in responding to this pandemic and how we need to better prepare for the next one. We sat down with him last week. (Begin VT) SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/Author, Uncontrolled Spread/@ScottGottliebMD): I think that the public health establishment as a whole has taken a hit in the setting of this pandemic. And this isn't just a sort of Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal thing. I think that there's a lot of people around the country who feel that the advice they got from public health officials wasn't precise, changed, wasn't-- wasn't formulated in a way where it was sort of immutable, wasn't carefully explained, wasn't propagated in a way that it could be assimilated into people's lives. You know how do I wear a mask? What mask should I wear? When should I wear a mask? When not? And things changed. And so people were confused by it and lost confidence in it. MARGARET BRENNAN: You say the CDC, which is supposed to be the gold standard public health agency, \"doesn't have an operational ca-- capability to manage a crisis of this scale.\" So if the CDC doesn't, who does? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Nobody does. I mean there was a perception early in the-- this crisis that the CDC has this, that they would have the capacity to develop a diagnostic test and deploy it and gather the data that we would need, sort of scope out what the contours of the response would be, and they would be able to deploy the diagnostic test and deploy the vaccine and stand up this infrastructure. They're not a logistical organization. CDC has a very retrospective mindset. It's a high-science organization that does deep analytical analysis of data that's oftentimes out of sync to when the decisions need to get made. They're not the Joint Special Operations Command. They don't surface real time information to-- to inform current policy making. MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not a quick reaction force. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. They'd-- they'd rather take the data, analyze it for four months and publish it in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. And the idea that they were going to be able to mass manufacture a diagnostic test and forward deploy it, they clearly-- they contaminated their own test. So they-- they-- they botched the manufacturer of their test. But-- MARGARET BRENNAN: We needed to turn to private industry earlier in the pandemic. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: We needed an all, but all-of-the-above approach. Certainly, by the end of January we had enough awareness that this could be a global pandemic, that someone could have hit the red button and said we need it-- an all-of-the-above-- above approach here. But CDC had the ball. CDC was following their standard blueprint. Their blueprint is-- could keep up with a slow-moving outbreak. But in a fast-moving epidemic like this, it was unmatched. Now, CDC should have raised their hand and said we really don't have this. I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't they? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think it's very difficult for an agency to have this self-awareness that they don't have the capacity to respond in a way they're being asked. We needed to get FEMA and the DOD engaged with the CDC in trying to organize a national level response, and that-- that was a failure of political leadership I mean, and it was a failure of vision. But, you know, there were a lot of people who were good political leaders who wrongly assumed the CDC had this mission. MARGARET BRENNAN: You say, \"The point isn't that federal health officials were wrong, the point is they were working with faulty tools, faulty data sets.\" SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so-- MARGARET BRENNAN: They didn't know what they didn't know. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: They didn't understand that this wasn't spreading like flu. If you're just looking for flu symptoms, you might not see coronavirus spreading. So they were very confident early on that there was no community spread. We should have been doing things differently in anticipation that this probably was spreading, we just weren't picking it up, which, in fact, was the case. MARGARET BRENNAN: You also say this should have been viewed as a national security threat, and that's how we need to think of pandemics. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: But I think the intelligence community has different tools that should be focused on this mission. We have to look at public health preparedness through the lens of national security. We make certain preparations for things that are unlikely to happen. But if they happen, they're so catastrophic that we have to prepare. We cannot allow something like this to hit us this bad again. So we have to prepare differently domestically. But, internationally, we rely on other nations to tell us when they have an outbreak. That has repeatedly failed. It failed in this case. China didn't surface the early information. They still haven't shared the source strain. So the question becomes can we still rely on the international health regulations and the W.H.O. and the World Health Assembly? Are we going to all hold hands again and promise that we really mean it this time and we're going to share information? Or do we need to get our clandestine services more engaged in this mission? And I think we're going to need to get our clandestine services more engaged in this mission. There was data very clearly available in China, in Wuhan, that if we were looking for it, we could have detected this much sooner. We could have answered some key questions. We could have seen the asymptomatic spread. We could have seen the human-to-human transmission. You could have had some key questions answered early that could have allowed us to mount a more robust response. And a two- or four-week head-start on something like this can make a very big difference. MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you learn in the course of your research about the origins of COVID? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I learned that we're not going to answer this question absent one or two things happening. Either we find the intermediate host, the animal that was the-- that spread COVID, or there's a whistleblower inside China. Or someone close to this, who knows that this came out of a lab, comes forward, defects, goes overseas, or we intercept some communication that we shouldn't have had access to. Absent something like that, we're not going to be able to answer this question. This is going to be a battle of competing narratives. I think over time the side of the ledger that-- that says that this might have come out of a lab has grown more robust and the side of the ledger that says this came out of a natural species has not really moved. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say, come-- came out of a lab, you are saying through a lab accident, not a construct? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: The administration has said this in the intelligence report they put out. They've sort of firmly debunked the idea that this was something that could have deliberately come out of a lab or was deliberately engineered. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do we need to know who Patient Zero is? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: If we determine that this came out of a lab or we even assess that there's a high probability that this came out of a lab, I think it changes how we try to govern research internationally. The most speculative, most dangerous research often goes to the countries willing to conduct it. And the countries willing to conduct it are oftentimes the countries that have the poorest controls. The other thing we're going to need to look at is do we continue to do things like publish the sequences of novel viruses? Once you publish that sequence as part of normal scientific discourse and-- and part of the scientific process, you basically provide a recipe to anyone who's a rogue actor on how to manufacture that virus. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a quick break, and we'll be back with a lot more of our conversation with Doctor Gottlieb. So, don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with more of our conversation with former FDA Commissioner and Pfizer board member Doctor Scott Gottlieb. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: What is the lesson for the Biden administration as they roll out boosters? Do they need to change the playbook from what the Trump administration did? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah. I think the logistical lesson on the rollout of the boosters is that they need to have in place the infrastructure to actually distribute those vaccines in hard-to-reach communities and hard-to-reach settings. I think what the Biden administration has done here is by backing into an approximate date, they're now able to start that planning process in advance. If FDA does authorize it and the advisory committee of the CDC ultimately judges it to be appropriate for a certain population, they're going to be ready to start making it available in the nursing homes right away. So there's not going to be a delay. So I think they're in a better position. I don't know that the vaccine boosters are going to be controversial from the standpoint of, sort of, right versus left politics. I think where the fault lines are going to be is on some of the mandates that the administration is putting in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: How does it sit with you when you hear members of your party, Republican Party, describe all this along civil liberties lines? Not making the medical argument, but simply around civil liberties. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think it's a misjudgment. There is this argument that this is an individual choice. Your choice to get vaccinated is an individual choice, and it's not an individual choice. This is a decision that affects your community. This is a collective choice. If you go-- and just like with childhood vaccinations. If you go into a school setting and you're not vaccinated for measles and you introduce measles into that setting, you're affecting your community. So I don't think governors should tell schools and businesses you can't mandate a vaccine. If a because makes a decision that the only way that I can protect my employees or my costumers is by having a fully vaccinated workforce, they should have the ability to make that decision. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not just shots. We're talking about masks. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: And the mask debate is inexplicable to me. Like, I can't decouple it, I can't explain it, I can't defend it. People generally have an apprehension about taking a medical product, especially when they're healthy, especially for a preventative purpose. I understand just, sort of, people's general questions and concerns about a novel medical product. But a mask is such a simple intervention. It's not going to cause you any harm. It's just an act of, you know, community responsibility, an act of respect. And I think, you know, the federal government is well within its right to mandate vaccinations for federal workers, for health care workers. I think even mandating vaccination within the Medicare program could be something that's defensible. But when you impose the mandate down to the level of small businesses, now you're setting up the political fault lines. You're taking something that was, sort of, subjectively political and it's going to be objectively political. So are you going to get enough benefit from a public health standpoint or the price you pay in terms of hardening those lines. I think that was worth a very vigorous debate. I hope the White House had it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which governors handled this the worst? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Certainly, looking at South Dakota, where this was just allowed to travel largely unfettered with public health interventions where you saw one of the highest death rates per capita, you have to look back and say that was a bad experience. Once we learned how to treat this, once we're able to reduce the case fatality rate by half, by the summer time, and we got there, we got there pretty quickly, states that were still excessively engulfed by this and had a lot of death and disease, those were, in part, policy decisions. Those were, in part, the result of policy choices that those states made. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think about the first few days where this strange virus that was just surfacing started to make headlines here at home. You were starting to see things that weren't yet really being raised as red flags. How were you, on the outside, seeing things that they weren't seeing on the inside? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There was a presumption that the CDC has this, the department has this, the secretary of Health and Human Services is in control, so they let that health care apparatus run with the ball. It really wasn't until probably more like the end of February, the March timeframe, that you saw the White House really starting to get engaged and pull this away from the secretary of Health and Human Services and the Health Care Institutions and start to at least try to more accurately manage it. And that was the genesis of the coronavirus task force. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's been reported that you were actually considered to come and run that task force. Is that true? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: You know I don't know for sure. The President asked me to come in. I met with him. I met with the vice president, and they asked me to take a position as sort of as an advisor or help him oversee the task force after the vice president had been put in charge. That felt like it was moving along and more real. Ultimately, it didn't come together. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I don't know for sure. There were probably people in the White House who wanted to see me in that position, and probably people in the White House who didn't. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you regret though not being on the inside? You had been with the Trump administration till 2019. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so I regret not being at the FDA. I don't know that there was much that I could have done dramatically differently inside the White House and, eventually, I would have worn out my welcome because there would have been people inside the White House who wouldn't have liked what I was preaching. If I had been at FDA with my staff, working with the-- the career staff in the device center I am pretty confident that we would have made a very hard pivot to try to instigate the private industry to start getting engaged in developing diagnostic tests early in January. MARGARET BRENNAN: And so you wish somebody at the FDA was doing that? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think that would have had to happen at the commissioner level. It couldn't happen below that level. If I would've called any big manufacturer, though, they would have done it. I have no doubt about that. Having been there and having made those calls and having known that CEOs responded positively in moments of public health crisis. That's the one thing I wish I was there to do and, you know, I wrote articles about doing that at the time, I was writing articles in January this is what we should do. But, you know, writing op-eds and putting things on Twitter isn't like being there and actually being able to pick up the phone and effectuate the action. I wish I was there. I think that that's-- the-- the FDA and the optives, the operational divisions of HHS, is where the action happens. That's where you can really affect the outcome. Affecting the outcome from the White House, much harder. MARGARET BRENNAN: You write in March, when you went in to speak with the President that he was serious, he knew the grave risks. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There was a point in time when they were very concerned about this, willing to take dramatic actions. But later on their attitudes really changed to the point where when the President was contagious with COVID, he ceremoniously took his mask off. And so what message does that send to the country? But my view is that they were sold on the idea that you weren't going to be able to really affect the spread and that anything you did was just going to have so many repercussions in terms of impact on children who might not be in school, impact on the economy, that the costs were worse than the disease. And the schools is a perfect example of the lack of effective policy making. So the single reason why most schools remained shut was because the CDC was telling them they had to keep kids six feet apart. If-- if CDC had said you can only-- you have to keep kids three feet apart, then a lot of schools would have been able to open. And, in fact, when the Biden administration wanted to open schools in the spring, this past spring, they got the CDC to change that guidance from six feet to three feet. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you write, the six feet was arbitrary? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: The six feet was arbitrary in and of itself. Nobody knows where it came from. The initial recommendation that the CDC brought to the White House, and I talk about this, was 10 feet. And a political appointee in the White House said, we can't recommend 10 feet. Nobody can measure 10 feet. It's inoperable. Society will shut down. So the compromise was around six feet. Now imagine if that detail had leaked out. Everyone would have said, this is the White House politically interfering with the CDC's judgment. The CDC said 10 feet, it should be 10 feet, but 10 feet was no more right than six feet and, ultimately, became three feet. But when it became three feet, the--the basis for the CDC's decision to ultimately revise it from six to three feet was a study that they conducted the prior fall. So they changed it in the spring. They had done a study in the fall where they showed that if you have two masked individuals, two people wearing masks, the risk of transmission is reduced 70 percent with masks if you're three feet apart. So they said on the basis of that, we can now make a judgment that three feet is an appropriate distance. Which begs the question, if they had that study result in the fall, why didn't they change the advice in the fall? Why did they wait until the spring? This is how the whole thing feels arbitrary and not science based. So we talk about a very careful, science-based process and then these anecdotes get exposed, and that's where Americans start to lose confidence in how the decisions got made. MARGARET BRENNAN: You do put blame on President Trump for a few things, but do you think, fundamentally, looking at everything you've analyzed, that the outcome of this pandemic would have been different if President Trump wasn't in office? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, it would have been different if we had different political decisions and the White House was exercising different leadership. There's no question about that. There's no question that the White House made mistakes, and the lack of consistency was a big mistake, and also the lack of using the White House as an effective bully pulpit to really galvanize a collective action that can make a difference on the margins. Allowing this to sort of get divided along political fault lines in the setting of an election when things were already-- the temperature was already very high, I think really hurt us. But stepping back from that, I think that there were fundamental weaknesses with our response that regardless of who is in power, we had an ill-prepared bureaucracy. We didn't have the right infrastructure. We didn't have the right agencies. The agencies weren't properly empowered. So even if you had competent leadership, very effective leadership up and down the chain, you still would have had some of the same problems.

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - Michael Morell on the CIA, 9/11 and Afghanistan PRODUCER: Olivia Gazis MICHAEL MORELL: Thanks for joining us today.  There has been much talk over the last few weeks about 9/11, to include what happened in the run-up to that tragic day and what happened in its immediate aftermath.  Much of this has focused on questions of what the CIA did and what it didn't do in both of these periods.    Many interviews have been conducted, many articles written, many documentaries made.  What I want to do in this, and in the next episode, is to share my personal thoughts on all this.  Why do I want to do this?  Because many of you, our listeners, have reached out and asked me to do so and because I believe there is much misunderstanding that has swirled around CIA's role, some of it for years.    Let's start with the run-up to 9/11.  This will be chapter one in our story.  Chapter Two - the aftermath - will be next week.  The theme of this period - which runs from the early-1990s into 2001 - is that the CIA provided strategic warning of the al Qaeda threat.  In my view, this was arguably the loudest and most persistent warning in the history of the agency on any issue.  Ever.  The sub-theme is that the then-Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet saw the threat as clearly as anyone; he drove the intelligence community to focus on it, even in an environment of extremely limited resources; and he repeatedly took his concerns to the highest levels of the U.S. government.  How do I know all this?  Because prior to 9/11,I served for six years as the head of the staff that produces the President's Daily Brief, as Tenet's executive assistant, as a deputy in CIA's counterterrorist center, and as President Bush's first intelligence briefer, a job I held from January 4, 2001 to January 4, 2002.  Let me walk through this period.     CIA first identified Osama bin Laden as a threat in 1993, eight years before 9/11. At that time, we saw him as a financier of terrorism.  This put him on our radar.  In 1995, we linked Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, to bin Laden's money and to a bin Laden-run safehouse in Peshawar, Pakistan.  This raised our interest in bin Laden even more.  That same year, the intelligence community published a National Intelligence Estimate, what we call an \"NIE.\"  An NIE is an analytic product representing the considered view of the entire intelligence community.    This particular NIE warned that civil aviation in the United States was a target of terrorists.  This is six years before 9/11.  It said, and I quote, \"If terrorists operating in this country are methodical, they will identify serious vulnerabilities in the security of domestic flights.\"  Unquote.  This paper was provided to not only to the typical national security officials in the executive branch but it was also provided to the FAA and to the airline industry.  And like all NIEs, it was provided to Congress.    Also in 1995, the Philippine police disrupted a plot hatched in the Philippines by Ramzi Yousef and his uncle, a man named Khalid Sheikh Muhammad.  The uncle, who we call KSM, would go on to become the mastermind of 9/11.  This Philippine plot was a multi-faceted attack plan that included hijacking multiple airliners, flying them to the United States, blowing up most of them in flight, and crashing one into CIA headquarters in Virginia.    This was an important reference to terrorists using airplanes as weapons - and it was not the first such reference we had seen and reported on.  At least one other had come before.  Those who say that CIA never imagined terrorists using planes as weapons are just wrong.  Because of all of this, CIA, in early 1996, created a stand-alone unit, called Alec station, to track bin Laden and his activities.  The goal was to figure out exactly what he was doing.  Just months later - that same year and five years before 9/11 - CIA concluded that bin Laden was much more than a terrorist financier.  He was a terrorist himself.  Indeed, we concluded that bin Laden was a leader of a terrorist group, that he was determined to drive the United States out of the Middle East, overthrow Sunni Arab regimes and establish an Islamic caliphate in those countries -- and that he planned to accomplish this by striking the United States wherever he could, most importantly on our own soil, here in the homeland.    We even said in late 1996 that bin Laden was interested in acquiring weapons of mass destruction to accomplish his goals.  As a result of this judgment, the CIA, led by Director Tenet, provided hundreds of classified and unclassified warnings of the threat posed by bin Laden.    These warnings appeared in CIA analytic products, National Intelligence Estimates, and testimonies before congress, both open and closed, over multiple years.  One of the National Intelligence Estimates, published in 1997, said and I quote, \"Civil aviation remains a particularly attractive target for terrorist attacks in light of the fear and publicity that downing of an airliner would evoke.\" Unquote.  Tenet even wrote personal memos to President Clinton and to his National Security Council counterparts about the threat.  The writing of such personal memos by a director was unprecedented.  I never saw a director do that before, and i have never seen one do it since.    Then the first evidence that CIA's warnings were on the mark appeared with crystal clarity.  On the morning of August 7th, 1998, two of our embassies in East Africa, one in Kenya and one in Tanzania, within seconds of each other, were hit by massive suicide truck bombs - killing 12 Americans and over 200 Africans.    Within two days, CIA concluded that al Qaeda was behind the bombings.  President Clinton responded with cruise missile strikes, but they did little to no damage to al Qaeda.   These attacks drove Tenet to push the intelligence community even harder.  He asked for a detailed plan to improve CIA's collection against al Qaeda.  He wrote what came to be called the \"we are at war\" memo to drive the rest of the intelligence community to do the same.   Contrary to conventional wisdom, both the CIA and the broader community responded.  Resources were moved from other critical issues to terrorism.  The focus on al Qaeda across the community was raised.  Relationships with other intelligence services were expanded.  Our collection improved.   Part of these efforts included developing drones to collect intelligence, including to find bin Laden.  They also included seeking increasingly aggressive covert action authorities to go after bin Laden.  And they included the US military working to weaponize a drone to give a president the option to take direct action against the terrorist leader.  The military's work on being able to hit a target who was outdoors was completed before 9/11.  Only policy approvals remained.  The increased effort to collect intelligence paid off.  CIA and the rest of the intelligence community identified in 1999 multiple al Qaeda plots timed to the millennium.  Tenet told President Clinton to expect 5 to 15 attacks against the US, our allies, and our interests.  In response, President Clinton ordered a worldwide operation to disrupt al Qaeda wherever we could.     With the help of intelligence and security services around the world, CIA launched operations against 38 targets in 55 countries. The pace was frenetic, with significant coordination between CIA, NSC, DOJ and the FBI.  Dozens of arrests were made around the world.  The disruption operation worked.  There were no successful attacks during the millennium.  The disruption effort, by tightening security at US border crossings, even helped thwart an attack on the homeland -- an attack on Los Angeles international airport.    Indeed, the arrest of the LAX plotter, Ahmad Ressam, trying to cross the border from Canada into the United States with explosives and detonators not only stopped that particular attack.  It also was a manifestation of bin Laden's desire to bring the fight to the homeland.  Then suddenly another wake-up call.  In mid October 2000, just weeks before the presidential election, the USS Cole, a guided missile destroyer, anchored off the coast of Yemen, was hit by a suicide boat, killing 17 U.S. sailors, and injuring 37.  At this point, the Clinton administration had been through the first world trade center bombing, the African embassy bombings, the millennium threats, and now the attack on the Cole.  The president and his national security advisor, Sandy Berger, had themselves become seized with al Qaeda.   As a result, Berger asked Tenet: If there were no constraints on covert action authorities and no constraints on resources, how would you go after al Qaeda in order to degrade its ability to attack us?    The result was a CIA memo that was called the \"Blue Sky Memo.\"  It was delivered to Berger, but the Clinton administration came to an end before the plan could be discussed within the interagency and before it - in some form - could become policy.  So, how to assess the Clinton administration's performance on al Qaeda?  Hindsight is 20/20, and it is therefore, I think, fundamentally unfair to ask such a question, but, with that caveat, I believe the Clinton administration should have come earlier to the realization that we needed to get much more aggressive with al Qaeda.  Sandy Berger should have asked his question and run a policy process on the answer after either the East Africa bombings or at minimum after the millennium threat.    Why didn't this happen?  I don't know.  I don't think the work has ever been done to answer this question.  To be sure, the Clinton administration had other things on its plate - the war in the Balkans, the emergence of the Pakistani nuclear program, and others.  And, of course, the administration was dealing with the political fallout from the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Still, I think a detailed answer to this question remains to be produced.  In December of 2000, George W. Bush is declared the winner of the presidential election and the transition to a new administration begins.  The warnings that the CIA had been providing the Clinton administration are now made loud and clear to the Bush administration.   Terrorism in general and al Qaeda in particular was a priority topic in Bush's first intelligence briefing -- when he became the Republican nominee for president.  The deputy director of Central Intelligence at the time, John McLaughlin, Tenet's second in command, presided over this briefing.  Because the al Qaeda issue was such an important part of the briefing, McLaughlin brought with him a senior official from CIA's counterterrorism center to walk bush through the threat.  In this session, McLaughlin told candidate Bush that, if he became president, Americans were likely to die from terrorism on his watch.  In their first meeting after Bush was declared the winner of the election, Clinton told Bush that al Qaeda would be the most significant national security issue he would face as president.  Sandy Berger said the same to his successor as national security advisor, Condoleezza Rice.  The al Qaeda threat was a main topic of conversation when Tenet and his head of operations, Jim Pavitt, briefed both Bush and VP-elect Cheney on CIA covert actions at Blair house a week before the inauguration.    Only five days after the inauguration, Dick Clarke, the man responsible for counterterrorism policy at the White House and a holdover from the Clinton administration, repackaged the Blue Sky Memo, which had been sitting in his safe since the departure of Berger.  Clarke sent it to Rice, and he said that there was an urgent need for an early NSC Principals meeting on al Qaeda.  Like Tenet and Berger, Clarke wanted to take the gloves off.    On the very same day, CIA wrote a PDB item for the new president pinning responsibility for the Cole attack on bin Laden.  No action was taken against al Qaeda.    Just a little over a month after the inauguration, Tenet gave a package of draft covert action authorities to Rice's deputy, Steve Hadley.  The package included the authorities that would be required to carry out the activities in the Blue Sky Memo.  The White House, for reasons that I don't know, asked that the package be withdrawn.   Then the lights started to blinking red:  threat reporting spiked in the spring and early summer of 2001. The PDB for two months was filled with such reporting.  The titles of these pieces included \"bin Laden planning multiple operations,\" \"bin Laden attacks may be imminent,\" \"bin Laden planning high profile attacks,\" and \"UBL threats are real.\"  Words such as \"catastrophic\" and \"multiple simultaneous attacks\" were used in the pieces.  On April 18, Tenet, after having been briefed the night before on new threat reporting took over the PDB briefing, switching seats with me, expressing in words, his tone, and his body language that he believed we were going to get hit and hit hard.  On May 30, Tenet took McLaughlin, his head of counterterrorism Cofer Black, and the head of Alec station to his weekly meeting with Rice because he was so concerned about the threat reporting.  \"How bad do you think it is?\" Rice asked Black.  Black told her that during the millennium the threat level was at an 8, on a ten scale. \"Right now,\" Black said, \"we are at 7.\"    On July 10, Tenet again took his CT team to see Rice.  The head of Alec Station told her, and I quote, \"There will be a significant terrorist attack in the coming weeks or months,\" end quote.  Tenet and his deputies said the United States must go on the offense against al Qaeda.  In response, three days later, the White House held a deputies meeting on al Qaeda, but no action was taken.  I should add, and this is the first time I've ever said this publicly, is that I strongly sensed during the spring and summer of 2001 that Tenet was deeply frustrated with the White House.  I sensed that Tenet felt that the White House just did not get it.  I think this is why he went to such great lengths - taking over the briefing from me, taking his CT team to see Rice twice.  I think he was trying anything he could to get their attention.  Then the threat reporting dried up. Gone. It turned out that al Qaeda, expecting another round of cruise missile strikes after the 9/11 attacks, went to ground.  They went to the hills, literally.  Our sources lost access.  Despite the lack of new reporting, Tenet remained deeply concerned.  He asked for a review of all the previous threat reporting, of everything we then knew, to make sure we had not miss anything.    In this process, CIA's leadership learned that officers in the counter terrorist center had learned in early 2000 that two al Qaeda terrorists had Visas to enter the united states but that they had failed to alert their chain of command or to formally watchlist them.  Now both were in the United States.  So, Tenet ordered an immediate fix to the mistake, and the two were watch-listed in mid-August.  Their names were Khalid al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi.  They turned out to part of the 9/11 plot.  The next data point in this story line is 9/11 itself, with 3,000 people killed.  It was the largest attack on the American homeland in the history of the country.  So, how to assess CIA's performance in the run-up to 9/11?    On one level, perhaps the most important level, CIA never got an issue more right than it got al Qaeda before 9/11.  Never did CIA warn as much and as loudly about something as it did about bin Laden and al Qaeda.  CIA was created to warn of strategic surprise, and it did that in spades with bin Laden.  On another level, there was a shortcoming.  CIA - and our partners at NSA - did not, pre-9/11, penetrate bin Laden's inner circle to the point where we would have learned enough information to stop the plot, to stop the attack.  We did this after 9/11 routinely, which we will talk about in the next episode, but we did not do it beforehand.  I think there were two reasons for this.  First, al Qaeda had safe haven, given to them by the Taliban, which made them very difficult to get at from an intelligence perspective.  And, perhaps most important, CIA, when Tenet took over, was nearly broken by a decade of budget cuts - the so-called Cold War peace dividend.    CIA was under great pressure on resources.  We needed much more than we had.  Tenet made repeated requests to the Office of Management and Budget for more resources.    Tenet even wrote a personal letter to President Clinton asking for more resources to fund a bigger effort against bin Laden and al Qaeda.  This too was unprecedented for a director.  The administration did not respond to these requests.  It was only in 1999, when then-Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich saw the need, that the intelligence community received additional resources, and this was done over the objections of the administration.  But even this resource infusion was for only one year, so it was of little help in sustaining our operations over the next two years - the two years immediately before 9/11.  CIA also made a mistake.  It was the watch-listing error I just spoke about.  It was an honest mistake - born of a massive workload in Alec station.  That's not an excuse; it's just an explanation.  But, at the end of the day, it was still a mistake.    It is worth asking what would have happened if the CIA had watch-listed the two when it first learned about them in the early 2000.  We don't know, of course, but most likely, they would have been denied entry to the United States.  And, in this case, we would not have discovered the 9/11 plot.  Indeed, the individual who was supposed to have been the 20th hijacker was not allowed entry to the United States because an alert immigration agent concluded that he was attempting to illegally enter the United States and sent him back to point of origin, which was Dubai, but with no knowledge gained on what he was really up to.  I should note that CIA was not the only organization to misstep prior to 9/11.  The FBI officers working in Alec station at the time, of which there were several, all with computer access, also missed the Mihdhar and Hamzi information.    Several were aware of the information but did not act on it.  And when we did watch-list them in mid-August the FBI assigned the case to an agent who had just finished his rookie year and the bureau labeled the case \"routine,\" the lowest possible priority level. But, again, if they had been found, they probably would simply have been deported.  There was also a memo from the FBI's Phoenix field office of multiple Arabs taking flight training and not being interested in takeoffs and landings.  This reporting was not acted on by FBI headquarters nor was it shared with the interagency, including CIA.  And then there was Zacarias Moussaoui.  The FBI arrested him on August 16th, 2001 on immigration charges.  Moussaoui, too, was training to fly airplanes, and suspicious flight instructors had called the FBI.  Moussaoui was in the country illegally, and he was arrested.  But, the FBI, for legal reasons, did not search Moussaoui's luggage, the contents of which tied him to al Qaeda.  It turned out that Moussaoui knew about the 9/11 plot, and he was in our custody.  KSM would later say that had he known about Moussaoui's arrest that he would have postponed the attacks, believing them compromised.  What about policy in the Bush administration?  How to think about that?  I think this question has confused many people as there are two distinct issues that need to be addressed - the first is the strategic warning about al Qaeda that the Bush team received even before they took office and the second is the threat reporting that came across their desks in the spring and summer.  You have to look at these separately to assess the administration's performance on policy.  On the first issue:  I think it is fair to say that despite the strategic warnings from the intelligence community and from the outgoing Clinton team, and despite strong recommendations coming from Dick Clarke inside the White House, the Bush team did not do a policy review on al Qaeda as early as it should have, given the compelling nature of the strategic threat.  I believe that that policy review should have occurred immediately after the inauguration.  Had it, perhaps it would have resulted in a much more aggressive policy, perhaps it would have resulted in the Blue Sky recommendations being approved.  But also, perhaps not.  With regard to the second issue: senior Bush administration officials have always said that the threat reporting from the spring and summer was never specific as to time, place, and method.  That is a fair and an accurate statement.  But the threat reporting for the millennium was also not particularly specific, but President Clinton nonetheless ordered a comprehensive disruption effort that ended up paying huge dividends.  I believe this should have been done by the Bush administration as well.  To be fair to the Bush administration, the al Qaeda posed was a new kind of threat.  It was a threat from a non-state actor.  Non-state actors were not an issue the last time republicans had in power.  The Bush national security team initially focused on nation states and the threat they could pose to the United States.  It took them time to learn that a rag-tag group of extremists, operating in dirt training camps in the middle of Afghanistan, could pose an immense threat to America.  Congress should not be left out of this assessment either.  The Gore commission on airline safety recommended in early 1997 a number of improvements to airline security, including many of the changes that would eventually be implemented after 9/11.  But, Congress, before 9/11, did not pass into law a single one of these recommendations, largely under pressure from an airline industry that feared the security enhancements would inconvenience passengers.  Would any of the intel, law enforcement, policy, or legislative missteps have made a difference?  Would any of them have prevented the 9/11 attacks?  That is very hard to say.  It is easy to make arguments for why they could have made a difference, but it is hard to make an argument that they would have made a difference. Unfortunately, we will never know.    But all of these, particularly when put together, are why I have always called 9/11 a 'national failure.'  One more thought:  in the context of what I just outlined, one way of looking at bin Laden's success on 9/11 is that he got lucky with timing.  Time ran out on the Clinton administration when it wanted to take the gloves off and time ran out for the Bush team to fully understand the threat.  Bin Laden threaded the needle.  That concludes chapter one of this story.  Join us next week for the second chapter - the immediate aftermath of 9/11. ",

            "article_content": "Most Californians say they are optimistic about the future of their state when they look to the future for the next generation \u2014 even if they are more mixed on how things are going right now. Younger adults are among the most optimistic. We asked Californians what they think are good and bad things about the state. For most, here's the good: the food (Californians' top answer!), the diversity of its people, nature and the outdoors, its culture, and \u2014 maybe no surprise, as it's always been a lure to California \u2014 the weather. But it's not all sunshine. Few like the traffic, overwhelmingly seen as a bad thing, and with big implications for a lot of Californians, many struggle with the cost of living. A majority of Californians report their own financial situation as at least fairly good. This is higher for those with higher incomes and those with college degrees. \u00a0But even if their financial situation is okay at the moment, it may not be easy to manage living in California.\u00a0 Most say the cost of living is at least somewhat unmanageable. This feeling is expressed by majorities in all regions of the state, as well as in cities, suburbs, and rural areas. Though it is felt across the state, it is not felt equally by all Californians. California's lowest earners \u2014 those with family incomes below $50,000 a year \u2014 are the most likely to say the cost of living is unmanageable. Income differences are also seen in views about the price of homes and real estate. On balance, Californians earning over $100,000 a year say the price of homes and real estate in their area has been good, rather than bad for their family financially, while most earning under $50,000 a year say it's been a bad thing for them. Most of these lower-income residents are renters, and those who rent their homes are twice as likely as those who own their homes to say the price of real estate in their area has hurt them. And so the \"California Dream\" remains something in the state's collective imagination\u2026. But not everyone thinks they have attained it, or will\u2026 and it differs by age and income. Older Californians over 65 are more likely than other age groups to feel they have attained it, even though fewer than half of them say they have. The younger adult Californians under 45, by comparison, are more likely to say they will attain it, than say they already have.\u00a0 The \"California Dream\" may be more elusive for those with less money: most earning under $50,000 a year think things in California are going badly, are more negative about the state's economy and businesses, and just over a third think they will ever achieve the \"California Dream\". If they had their choice, many are not eager to move -- though some are. Two-thirds of Californians say that if they had their choice, they would continue to live in California. Some would move to a different part of California.\u00a0 But a third would move away somewhere else entirely. People who say their financial situation isn't as good are much more likely to say they would consider leaving, if they had to choose. One of the things that has lured people to California over the years is the tech industry. Californians really like the state's status as a \"tech hub.\" Eight in 10 think having a lot of the U.S. technology industry located in the state is good for California.\u00a0 While high tech may be associated with the Bay Area, California residents across the state tend to feel this way, as well as people of all income and education levels. The most enthusiastic supporters of the tech industry are young people: nearly 9 in 10 adults under thirty think the tech industry has been good for California (compared three in four older Californians). On balance, Californians tend to think immigration from other countries make things better rather than worse for their state. A slight majority of Republicans do feel immigration has made life in the state worse. This CBS News survey was fielded by YouGov with a representative sample of 1,856 California adult residents interviewed between August 6-12, 2021. This sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on\u00a0 the U.S. Census American Community Survey, and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as 2020 Presidential vote. The margin of error is \u00b14.0 points for the total sample. Toplines:",

            "article_content": "In this episode of \"Intelligence Matters,\" President Biden's deputy homeland security adviser at the National Security Council, Russ Travers, speaks with host Michael Morell about the varied and diffuse array of terrorist threats to the United States. A career intelligence officer and former acting and deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Travers offers a history of Islamist terrorism and describes how splintered, geographically dispersed networks tied to ISIS and al Qaeda continue to pose a threat to the U.S.. Travers and Morell also discuss the increase in racially and ethnically motivated attacks by domestic groups, and why preventing them poses a complex set of challenges for U.S. law enforcement and intelligence communities. Travers also shares thoughts on how to responsibly move resources away from counterterrorism toward Great Power competition.\u00a0Editor's note: This conversation was taped before a decision was made by the Biden Administration on troop levels in Afghanistan. HIGHLIGHTS Rise of domestic violent extremism:\u00a0\"[U]nfortunately, the broad view of the community is that it's likely to get worse. I think there's the general concern that biases against minorities and perceived government overreach is going to continue to drive domestic extremism, radicalization and eventually the mobilization of violence.

I think that's perfectly appropriate. But I also think that we need to have a very candid conversation about risk. \u00a0And invariably, if we know less about a problem, we are accepting some additional degree of risk. And it just needs to be done with open eyes, as it's a difficult proposition in terms of comparing and contrasting the risk posed by Country X or Y or function X or Y against terrorism. But that's the kind of work that I think that we're going to have to do to ensure that \u2013 the prime directive for me is that we don't go back to some of the maladies that affected us before 9/11.\"\u00a0 Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - RUSS TRAVERS PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS MICHAEL MORELL: Russ, welcome, welcome again to our show, it's great to have you back on Intelligence Matters. RUSS TRAVERS: Michael, it's great to be with you again.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So, Russ, the last time you were on the show, you were serving as the deputy director of the National Counterterrorism Center. Now you're at the White House serving as President Biden's Deputy Homeland Security Advisor. We're going to spend most of our time talking about terrorism. But your remit in your new job is larger than just terrorism. And I just wanted to ask you, for the sake of people who don't understand how broad that remit is, is to ask you what does your job, your new job cover? What are the issues that it covers? RUSS TRAVERS: So Dr. Liz Sherwood-Randall is the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security. She's also a Deputy National Security Advisor. And I am her deputy. As you say, the notion of a homeland security account could seem somewhat narrow. It's actually a very broad account. I think that's partly just a reflection of an interconnected world. Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor, also says that foreign policy is domestic policy and domestic policy is foreign policy. And that's sort of symptomatic of the homeland security account.  We've got probably about a half dozen major muscle movements. We reestablished the pandemic office under the Bush administration; that's to ensure that the government is really planning for the future so that we're better prepared next time around. That office also has a role in current COVID activities under the auspices of the overall Task Force, and they work the full range of biosecurity and biodefense initiatives. The second major directorate is response and resilience. The response side works with FEMA, hurricanes, floods and so forth. Resilience has a longer time horizon. Last year we had, I think, the the highest number of billion-dollar climate disasters in history. And so as we gear up for long-term climate change initiatives, we need to ensure that the current infrastructure is up to the task. And so there's a great deal of work along those lines.  We've got border security in its broadest sense, so that we work with other parts of the White House and the government on southern border issues. We do asylee and refugee policy, meaning that they comport with our values. We work Arctic issues with other regional components of the NSC, and we've got the watch list in screening and vetting architecture that has to handle something like two million people a day - probably the most complicated issue that I've worked in my career. We share responsibility for a new office that's focused on democratization and human rights. Among other things, they work things like malign influence and so forth. And then we've got officers to deal with the more traditional homeland accounts. So transnational organized crime kills far more Americans than terrorism ever will. We stood up a domestic violent extremism office because that simply wasn't getting enough attention. And then, as you say, the account the probably people are most familiar with, which is the international terrorism account, and that's been a mainstay since 9/11. I guess the key point I would make to all of these is that our role is really to keep bad things from happening, demonstrating competence along the way, I hope. It's not geopolitical chess. It's really a great deal of blocking and tackling, how to ensure that the government works together in the best interests of the American public. MICHAEL MORELL: That's a lot of stuff. So, Russ, we are coming up on the 20th anniversary of 9/11 in just a few months. And I'd love for you to take a moment to reflect on that a bit and tell us what comes to mind when you think about the 20th anniversary. RUSS TRAVERS: Yeah, we are just under five months away. Twenty years ago, the plot was really well underway. There had been that infamous meeting in Kuala Lumpur. By now, the hijackers were in the country. They had their visas. They've been through the flight training. And so we were in the closing months before the attack. Reflections for me - this is almost a generation ago. Between Americans that were not yet born or those that were too young to remember, 9/11 has got no context. And for almost a third of our population and for people like you and me, it's amongst the most traumatic experiences, I think, of our lives. It worries me a bit that memories are fading. In my case, I was posted overseas at the time I got called home. And so I was flying back and forth across the Atlantic before taking a new job. With my family home, I actually wrote good-bye letters to my kids because we, just as a country, we didn't know what was coming or how bad this was going to be. If you had told me then that we could fast forward 20 years without having seen another attack on the scale of 9/11, I think I would have taken that in a heartbeat. The key point, though, is that success didn't just happen. There was a lot of plotting that got stopped. In my opinion, the counterterrorism architecture is the single best example we've got of whole-of-government, and we saw a consensus that developed across the Republican and Democratic administrations that we had to do a series of things. We had to carry the fight overseas. We had to push borders out. We had to defend the homeland. We had to share information and work with partners and all that, all that really important kind of activity. And that consensus lasted for really a decade and a half. I started to get a little worried towards the end of the latter part of the last administration, because we were hearing things like 'ISIS is defeated' or 'We just need to kill a few more people and al-Qaida will be gone,' or on the other extreme, that maybe terrorism was worse then than it was before 9/11. None of those, in my view, were correct. I'm certainly someplace in the middle. But I guess I hope that over the next four or five months, there will be a lot of commentary, a lot of looks back at what we did right, what we did wrong. We need to think about our risk equation, I think going forward, as these are really important issues. MICHAEL MORELL: Russ, perhaps this is a good place to to transition to the current threat itself. How has the Islamist threat changed over the years? And and where are we today? RUSS TRAVERS: Well, 20 years ago, we were looking primarily at a threat that emanated from a little piece of real estate along the Afghan border. And after the attacks, we took a great deal of operational pressure directed against the al-Qaida leadership, forcing them to to modify posture tactics. Frankly, they made a bit of a virtue out of necessity, opting for a bit of a franchise model that would develop really over years, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb of North Africa or al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, what would eventually become Shabab in East Africa and al-Qaida in Iraq. Generally, each one of these franchises were led by people who was close to bin Laden in Afghanistan. Al-Qaida in Iraq in particular would split from AQ, become ISIS and eventually declare a caliphate in 2014. They held that for five years until the massive global coalition led by the United States eliminated the caliphate. It was during that time that ISIS also created branches and networks really around the globe, Far East Africa, Middle East, quite small, often built around pre-existing insurgencies. And at the same time, we had the phenomena of homegrown violent extremism, so lone actors in the United States that would radicalize largely on the Internet and conduct attacks. So you've got this entire array: You got centrally directed attacks, you've got enabled attacks, you've got inspired attacks, all of which we needed to deal with. And then you had kind of second- and third-order issues that complicated the problem, we would see prison radicalization or we saw foreign fighters that would flock to the caliphate and then disperse around the globe. Right now, we've got a massive displacement camp in northeast Syria, something called al-Hawl, which is a kind of a breeding ground for future radicalization. And then we've got Hezbollah and all the Shia militia groups in Iraq. So really, several years ago, we started referring to the threat as diverse and diffuse. I think that is a completely accurate characterization, has been really now for a number of years. And it does mean that we've got a very broad but very different threat landscape than we had 20 years ago. MICHAEL MORELL: Is the homeland safe today from the Islamist threat? RUSS TRAVERS: To answer that, I think you need to hang on to a couple of competing narratives because there is a tremendous amount of good news as a result of that consensus I talked about: the caliphate was destroyed. Hundreds of al-Qaida and ISIS leaders and plotters were eliminated. We degraded a great deal of the propaganda infrastructure. We've cut into funding and we're doing all the smart things: sharing information, working with partners. So there's been lots of success. And I think that's been manifested in the fact that we haven't seen an attack against the homeland in a long time. And we have to go back to Paris and Brussels to see any major attacks in Europe. On the other hand, there is some news it isn't quite so good. All those al-Qaida and ISIS branches and networks do still exist. Last month alone, we had in excess of 100 al-Qaida attacks in the Middle East and Africa, and ISIS over 200 attacks in Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East. And we see coordination between and amongst these branches and affiliates. So they are both playing a bit of a long game here and they are both enabled by the downside of globalization. So, things like encrypted communications, that makes it really hard for us to understand what's going on. The change UAV use, over the last five or six years, from low level surveillance to being able to weaponize them. Increasing counterfeit passports and ID cards - so they are innovative users of technology. And that's a challenge for us. And so for me, when I think about the risk calculus, I tend to look at things in three levels beyond core ISIS, core al-Qaida. You've got local insurgencies. They've been around forever. They are primarily focused on local conditions, not an immediate threat to our interests. The next step up is when these insurgencies - there's ISIS emissary outreach and they further radicalize them such that we may see threats to U.S. and allied interests. So maybe kidnapping of U.S. persons or threatening of embassies or threatening of private sector interests, which is exactly what we saw a couple of weeks ago with ISIS in Mozambique. This was a low-level insurgency, but they were able to mount a multi-prong attack against the of Palma, took it over for a while and their actions over the last really year, but going back several years has adversely impacted on tens of billions of dollars of liquefied natural gas investments off the coast of Mozambique. And then there's a third level, which is these radicalized insurgent efforts that wrap the ISIS flag around themselves when they can reach out and touch the United States. Being able to assess where we are on that spectrum is a challenge for us, and we we haven't always done it right. In 2009, we thought of AQAP as being largely a regional threat, and yet it was able to - Umar Farouk was able to get on Northwest Flight 253 and try to blow up his underwear over Detroit on Christmas Day. The following year, Faisal Shahzad tries to blow a car up in Times Square. He was trained by the Pakistani Taliban, also thought of as a regional actor. And more recently, we have a Shabab operative, Cholo Abdi Abdullah, to flight training in the Philippines. We don't know what the target was, but according to the indictment, he was researching U.S. visas in tall buildings in the United States. This was somebody on nobody's radar. And so it highlights just how challenging it is to be an intelligence analyst. We were focused on this very diverse, very diffuse threat. That's people and networks, hard to detect, enabled by the downsides of globalisation. MICHAEL MORELL: A couple more questions about the Islamist threat before we move to the domestic threat here at home. Not only are we coming up on the 20th anniversary of 9/11, but we're also coming up on the 10th anniversary of the operation to bring Osama bin Laden to justice. And I'm wondering, I know this is not an easy question, but I'm wondering what you think bin Laden, if he were still alive, might think about what he started so many years ago. How would he feel about the movement, do you think? RUSS TRAVERS: Well, to the extent that these guys have all taken the long view, his perspective 20 years ago was that of a small piece of real estate in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Afghanistan. And now we see an ISIS that is in 20-odd locations around the globe. All of the al-Qaida affiliates that were started are still there. I think he probably would like to have seen a closer relationship between ISIS and al-Qaida in many places around the globe. They are in conflict with one another. But I have to believe that the the trend for him, albeit with some setbacks, to be sure, has been in the right direction. MICHAEL MORELL: Russ, let's shift the conversation to talk about domestic terrorism. It's come to the fore over the last few years and was certainly punctuated by January 6th. The IC just released an assessment that warned, quote, of an \"elevated threat\" from domestic violent extremism. Can you kind of paint the landscape on domestic terrorism for us? What is this all about? How do you think about it? RUSS TRAVERS: Sure, remember, terrorism is by definition politically motivated violence directed against noncombatants. The bureau has a sort of a broad array of the way they talk about domestic politically motivated violence. The biggest category is probably what they would refer to as racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, what they refer to as RMVE. There's also a host of anti-government, anti-authority violent extremists. So these would be militias and anarchists and so forth. We've had animal rights, environmental violent extremism, for a long time, as we have had abortion-related violent extremists as well. If you looked at a Venn diagram, you would see some overlap between and amongst many of these. And the phenomena has been around forever. It ebbs and flows depending on societal conditions. At the time, there was a so-called left wing extremist violence in the 60s and 70s. We would see a half dozen pipe bombs a day blowing up - and you and I were in middle school - partially related to Vietnam, to be sure. And there still is some left wing violence, as President Biden said, completely unacceptable. But by any objective standard, the the vast majority of attacks that we've seen over the last four years has fallen into really two categories, either what the bureau calls racially/ethnically motivated extremism, principally white supremacist, or, in the past year, it's been more militia violence. What we've primarily seen - again, not new; long, sordid history; white supremacy violence was worse in the 20s than it is now - but it was really Charlottesville that brought it front and center a few years ago. Your audience will have heard President Biden talk about this and the impact it had on him. In my case, my two kids attended UVA, one just starting and one just finishing when the Unite the Right protests and violence occurred on Charlottesville. And that was really a wake up call for a lot of people.  It increased in 2018, and 2019 was the worst year for this form of violence since Oklahoma City. 2020 was more militia-oriented, the alleged plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan, and then we, of course, saw all the violence associated with the breach of the Capitol on January 6. And as you say, unfortunately, the broad view of the community is that it's likely to get worse. I think there's the general concern that biases against minorities and perceived government overreach is going to continue to drive domestic extremism, radicalization and eventually the mobilization of violence. And then we've got all the kind of newer sociopolitical developments, the narrative surrounding election fraud and the breach of the Capitol, conditions related to COVID and various conspiracy theories that promote violence. Almost certainly they're going to make matters worse. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Russ, we we seem to be having difficulty - struggling a bit, I would say, coming to grips with how to address this threat. Why is that? What is it about this threat that makes it so challenging? RUSS TRAVERS: It is a pretty complex phenomenon, and the very nature of the threat is it's different in that it's not as much group-oriented as is the case with ISIS and al-Qaida. The phrase 'leaderless resistance' is used. And that harkens back to 1960S anti-communist doctrine, it was a phrase that was picked up by a KKK guy as a strategy for white nationalists to fight against the government. There's actually an analogue in Islamist terrorism. It's kind of the leaderless jihad thing, homegrown violent extremism.   But it's a simple fact that most of all of the mass casualty attacks over the last several years have been conducted by individuals with no affiliation to any group or movement. And the movement itself is really amorphous. There's not a lot of structureD hierarchy. Some of these groups only exist on the Internet. They come and go. They will disappear and reappear under a different name. Frankly, the the leaders don't like one another very much. So you see lots of squabbling and fracturing and they don't have a coherent ideology. That's what we see. In the case of the Boogaloo movement, for instance, there's another complexity in that the legal framework is very different. And there is no domestic terrorism statute. There's a definition, but there's no federal charge - though there are state charges that can be brought. And so as a result, there's no mechanism for designations of 'groups,' quote unquote, in the United States. And even designations of overseas analogues of domestic terrorism groups as foreign terrorist organizations is really challenging because of the legal regime. And that gets really to the third complexity, I think, which is, I think, we would all agree that ideally we want to prevent domestic extremist violence before it happens. Law enforcement does a fabulous job of investigating violence after the fact, but the question is, can you get kind of left of boom? And now it gets really challenging, because first and foremost, we absolutely need to operate within the constraints of constitutionally protected speech. Probably implies that we need to have a closer partnership with the social media companies because they have to be part of the answer. They've done a much better job, I think, working with the government on Islamist terrorism over the last few years. In part, that was easier because ISIS and Al are designated foreign terrorist organizations. But it gets harder with domestic violence. Extremism gets questions of, kind of, terms of service. At what point does abhorrent conspiracy-laden speech get pulled down? Because we know Americans are being influenced by this stuff. So the question, I think, is how do we get our arms around an effective prevention program? We're getting increasingly confident with the research that shows that a substantial majority of the attacks, somebody knew something. Research would tell us that 60 or 70 percent of homegrown violent extremist attacks, somebody had relevant information, might be a relative, a friend, like a soccer coach, but somebody knew. So that would suggest there's a role for call centers here. We do have DHS grant programs that are focused on targeted violence and terrorism prevention. At the same time, there is a campaign promise to ensure that we look hard at what works and what doesn't work and that the programs are being executed in accordance with values. So we need to do all that. But I think the key point for me, I think, is that these programs can work. I mean, we've got just last week, the Secret Service put out a report not about ideologically motivated violence, but about school shootings. And their conclusion was, looking back over 50 years, I think, that vigilant community members stopped something like 67 school shootings because they saw something of concern and then reported it. So the real key here is building of trust between community and law enforcement. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Russ, the IC assessment that I referenced earlier said that a small number of domestic extremists have traveled abroad to, quote, 'network with like-minded individuals,' unquote. And we know from other media reports about communications between some domestic extremists here and folks overseas. So what what can you tell us about the international dimension of this problem and how much we should worry about that? RUSS TRAVERS: And that adds really an additional layer of complexity to this problem, but we talk about domestic violent extremism or some domestic terrorism, but aspects of this really are - it's almost a variant of international terrorism. And in particular, one segment of the racially and ethnically motivated violent extremist category is there's something of a global movement going on here amongst those who are kind of convinced of the superiority of the white race. It's not just the United States. We see many of the same demographic issues, societal pressures you will hear sometimes reference to, quote unquote, a 'Great Replacement' theory. And that's a French book that came out a decade ago, very dystopian, xenophobic view of the of the white race and the pressure that it's under. And we've seen violence conducted with this justification of sufficient concern that many of our partners in Europe, in Australia, New Zealand, have put right wing violence or terrorism on a par with Islamist terrorism. We've seen attacks in the U.K., in Germany, killing politicians who took pro-immigration stances, obviously the mass killings at the mosque in Christchurch a couple of years ago and many others. And the linkage, as you talk about those, there's a lot of transnational influence, to be sure. Manifestos and demonstrations of influence will often trace back to Anders Breivik, who conducted the attack in Norway ten years ago. The Norwegian, along with an American and a Canadian, then influenced Brenton Tarrant, who conducted the Christchurch attack.  Tarrant, in turn, influenced a bunch of American attacks, as well as that by a German, and influenced a Singaporean kid who wanted to conduct another Christchurch-like attack but was pre-empted. So there's a tremendous amount of cross-pollination between and amongst these individuals and those manifestos share tactics, techniques, procedures. Beyond that, as you suggest, there's some limited interaction. After the fact was determined that the Tarrant had both been in contact with and provided money to Identitarians in Europe. We have seen individuals in the United States being encouraged to conduct an attack by an overseas sort of quasi-group. We've seen some travel abroad for training. We've seen some cross-border outreach. But in general, it's mostly this notion of leaderless resistance, which is a massive challenge for the intelligence and law enforcement community. I thought New Zealand did a really good job looking at the the full array of issues after Christchurch. They put up like a 900-page document that acknowledged mistakes, to be sure, but basically concluded at the end of the day they couldn't have prevented the attack. And so that's pretty challenging for those of us in the law enforcement and intelligence community. As maybe the last couple international issues in Europe in particular, we're seeing some very blurry distinctions between extremist groups and political parties, and that poses a challenge. And we're also seeing the presence of violent extremists in the police and the military. The Germans in particular, have been investigating many hundreds of military police for extremism in their ranks, even forcing them to eliminate some units in the military. And obviously, Secretary Austin is taking that on as a major issue within the Defense Department. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Russ, you mentioned that some countries are putting this new kind of domestic extremism on the same level, the same par as Islamic terrorism. Do you? RUSS TRAVERS: Well, I think in terms of just cases, the last time I testified with Chris Wray was probably 18 months ago or so, he talked about roughly equivalent, I think, 850 domestic terrorism cases at the time, roughly a thousand homegrown violent extremism cases at the time. When he testified a couple of months ago, he said that domestic terrorism investigations were now, I think, at 2,000. So it is a substantially increased concern. And whether you put one above the other, they are both of significant concern to the entire counterterrorism community. MICHAEL MORELL: Russ, you and I have talked a lot about the resources dedicated to terrorism, and obviously, you know this better than anyone, the tremendous amount of resources that have been expended over the last 20 years on the Islamist threat. Yet at the same time, right, today, we have so many needs, right? From recovering from COVID to revitalizing our economy to dealing with the Russians to China's rise to the domestic terrorist threat. So how do you think about resource allocation in the terrorism world? How do you think about that? RUSS TRAVERS: I think it's going to be one of the key national security questions for the next four or five years. I was actually supportive when the former Secretary Mattis, basically, when he put out his military strategy in the beginning of 2018, said that we need to elevate great powers and Iran and North Korea relative to terrorism. We, up to that point, terrorism had been unequivocally number one. And we built a huge architecture, a huge enterprise that did extraordinary work, I think. So now we have a far more complicated global national security environment. And terrorism has been paying bills now for for several years. We just need to ensure that we do this rationally. And the kind of lessons learned from CT, how do we ensure that we maintain an integrated national security posture that is almost certainly going to get smaller. We are going to move collection resources away from CT to support other national security threats. I think that's perfectly appropriate. But I also think that we need to have a very candid conversation about risk. And invariably, if we know less about a problem, we are accepting some additional degree of risk. And it just needs to be done with open eyes, as it's a difficult proposition in terms of comparing and contrasting the risk posed by Country X or Y or function X or Y against terrorism. But that's the kind of work that I think that we're going to have to do to ensure that - the prime directive for me is that we don't go back to some of the maladies that affected us before 9/11. MICHAEL MORELL: Russ, we're running out of time. And I'd like to ask you one more question, and I'd love to flip back to the Islamist threat for a moment. This all started in Afghanistan, as you know. And so I'm just wondering - and I'm not asking you to forecast policy here at all, but I'm just wondering, what's your view of what happens to al-Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan in a world in which the coalition is no longer in Afghanistan? How do you think about that? RUSS TRAVERS: Well, the premise assumes that a decision has been made; it hasn't. The, I think everyone agrees, that a negotiated agreement, political agreement is the only way that Afghanistan is brought to a successful conclusion. I think the president has said that it would obviously be very difficult for us to depart by 1 May, but that he doesn't envision forces on the ground in the next year. However that plays out, there is, as you suggest, a small al-Qaida and kind of a diffuse ISIS force in Afghanistan. And the the sort of prime directive for our community will be to ensure that Afghanistan itself doesn't become a launching pad for attacks against the United States going forward. MICHAEL MORELL: And you guys are focused on making sure that that doesn't happen. RUSS TRAVERS: That's what we do. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. Russ, thank you. Thank you very much for joining us. It has been it's been an honor to have you back on the show. And it's great to talk to you again. RUSS TRAVERS: Thanks very much, Michael. It was a pleasure to be with you.\u00a0",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, we'll talk exclusively with two key players in the drama that's likely to impact every American. President Biden is pitching the most ambitious and most expensive set of domestic reforms in decades. Together his proposals total more than six trillion dollars in new spending. Do we need it all, and how are we going to pay for it? PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Well, it's real simple. It's about time the very wealthy and corporations start paying their fair share. JOHN DICKERSON: White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain joins us for a one-on-one. Republicans, for their part, are sounding the alarm about big government run amok. SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Even more taxing, even more spending to put Washington even more in the middle of your life from the cradle to college. JOHN DICKERSON: We'll hear from South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott. He's also the party's lead negotiator on police reform. Then, a COVID check-in. Cases are down, but so are vaccinations. How can we pick up the pace to overtake the virus. We'll talk with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. And one hundred days into the Biden presidency, Americans weigh in. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin this morning with White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain. Good morning, Ron. RON KLAIN (White House Chief of Staff/@WHCOS): Good morning, John. Thanks for having me. JOHN DICKERSON: We are having-- we have-- as we come on the air this morning, there are reports that the Iranian government has agreed with the west to release some detainees. What can you tell us about that? RON KLAIN: John, I can tell you, unfortunately, that report is untrue. There is no agreement to release these four Americans. We're working very hard to get them released. We raised this with Iran and our interlocutors all the time. But so far there's no agreement to bring these four Americans home. JOHN DICKERSON: Sometimes in these kind of things the other country will rush to the microphones to force your hand. Do you feel that? RON KLAIN: No. Again, we're working hard to bring these Americans home. When we get that done, we'll obviously be delighted to announce that news. JOHN DICKERSON: Let's talk to-- let's talk about the President's number one priority vaccinations. There is something called vaccine hesitancy. This week vaccinations were down ten percent. The director of the CDC says places the virus will strike next are where there have not been vaccinations. Given the President's focus on this, what can he do to increase incentives for people to get vaccinated? Our Doctor Scott Gottlieb says it's people who-- there's a big portion of people who just aren't finding the time for it. It's not that they're against it it's just not convenient. RON KLAIN: Yeah. Well, I agree with Doctor Gottlieb on that. We're doing a lot to make it more convenient. Starting just a week ago, forty thousand pharmacies now have the vaccine. Many of them have-- already walk-in hours. We're trying to expand that. We launched last week a way you can text. You can text your ZIP code to 468862 and get text back to you locations near your home where you can go get vaccinated. So we definitely need to make it easier. Look, we've made so much progress, Scott-- more-- John. More than fifty percent-- close to fifty-five percent of Americans have gotten one shot. This program is still moving with amazing pace. One in ten Americans got a shot in the last ten days. One in ten Americans will get a shot in the next ten days. We're still vaccinating millions of people a day. We've got a lot of work left to do. We do want to make it easier and more convenient for the next group of people to get the shot. JOHN DICKERSON: Yesterday in India, four hun-- a staggering four hundred thousand cases. The Indian prime minister called the President and asked him to join an effort to lift patents on the vaccinations so they can be produced. Where-- where is the President's head on that? RON KLAIN: You know, we are rushing aid to India. We are sending five of those giant C-5 planes, which include medicine supplies and the supplies for India to make its vaccines. India has its own vaccine, the Covishield vaccine. Production's slowed there because they don't have the scarce raw materials to make that. We've sent enough raw materials to make twenty million doses immediately more of their vaccine. Intellectual property rights is part of the problem. But really, manufacturing is the biggest problem. We have a factory here in the U.S. that has the full intellectual property rights to make the vaccine. They're aren't making doses because the factory has problems. JOHN DICKERSON: But, quickly, the prime minister asked the President to lift it, yes or no, will he? Or call for lifting? RON KLAIN: The-- our-- our U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai is going to the WTO next week to start talks on how we can get this vaccine more widely distributed, more widely licensed, more widely shared. We're going to have more to say about that in the days to come. JOHN DICKERSON: Okay, Ron, on the-- on the domestic front, the President's proposals, it seems like he's trying to do two things, sell a whole bunch of programs and a mindset. So there's family leave, broadband. It's quite a list. But he's also arguing basically that-- that-- that-- that government is good in American life. And what I wonder is at a time where we have low faith in government and institutions, can the American people handle that big of a-- that much change in their life that the President's offering them? RON KLAIN: Well, you know, John, I think what the President's offering them is what political figures, Democrat and Republican, have talked about for decades. Let's fix our bridges and roads. Let's give people a family leave when they have a new child or a sick parent. Let's get kids, universal pre-K. These are pretty basic things. And I think that the-- Washington has talked about them for decades. The bold thing that President Biden is doing is laying out a plan to actually deliver them. A way that these things, these long-promised things finally, actually happen. That's what we're trying to do. I-- I think the American people are long overdue. They've been promised that their infrastructure will be fixed for fifty years. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. RON KLAIN: Where is the delivery on that? And I think that's really what this is all about. JOHN DICKERSON: The President is going to finance a lot of this with increasing taxes. And the argument from Republicans is that that throws a blanket on ec-- economic activity. Is your view that that won't happen, that there will be no diminution in corporate activity, or is your view? There will be maybe some, but that's worth the risk to have this reorientation of American life. RON KLAIN: Well, let's be clear, first of all, more Americans, many more Americans will see their taxes go down if the President's plan is passed than see them go up. JOHN DICKERSON: I'm talking about corporate America. RON KLAIN: Only those at the very-- okay, well, so for corporations, obviously, they got that giant tax cut in 2017, what we're talking about is just rolling some of that tax cut back. Okay. So we're talking about putting the rate back up to twenty-eight percent. It was thirty-five before that tax cut came. So corporates will-- corporations would still have the lower-- a lower tax rate than the rate they had prior to 2017. We think that 2017 tax cut didn't meet its promise. You didn't see massive investments in R&D, you didn't see wages go up. What you saw was-- JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. RON KLAIN: --CEA pay-- CEO pay go up. You know CEOs now make three hundred and twenty times what the average worker makes. So we think we can raise those taxes on corporations and fund the things that make the economy grow. Bridges, roads, airports, rail. That's what creates jobs. That's what gets this economy humming. JOHN DICKERSON: Even believers in activist government think that the government can be very inefficient. With a government plan that is this big is the President going to offer any spending cuts at all? RON KLAIN: John, first of all, I think people have watched their government deliver two hundred and twenty million COVID shots in a hundred days. They've watched us deliver a rescue plan that took this economy that was dead in the water a hundred days ago and created more new jobs in the President's first hundred days than any President in history has created in his first hundred days. So I think what the public is saying is that America is on the move again and these common sense measures to give people some help with their child care, to give people some money, a tax cut to help raise their kids are the-- is the kind of common sense action they want to see this country take now. JOHN DICKERSON: I-- I didn't hear an answer on spending cuts, but we're going to move on. Here's your-- my question about how the President's going to work this through Congress. Seventy percent of Republicans, according to our poll and many others, think that the President was elected through fraud. What does that tell you about the environment for his proposals in Congress? RON KLAIN: Well, what I know is those same polls show that large number of Americans, overwhelming number of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, favor more bridges, roads, and infrastructure. They favor investing in child care, giving people help, taking care of their elderly relatives. They favor broadband. They favor these things. So the-- the proposals the President's put forward have broad support. They have broad support in the country. They have support from Republican governors, Republican mayors. I think what we'll have to see is whether or not Republicans in Washington join the rest of America in broadly supporting these common sense ideas to grow our economy and to make our families better. JOHN DICKERSON: That's why I'm focused on that seventy percent number, because people have talked about the President's plan being as big as what LBJ offered. Well, if you and I were talking in the mid-60s, I'd say, well, who is the President going to cajole and schmooze with and have bourbon and branch water and put together a coalition? There are a lot of Democrats, including former President Obama, who say that old idea of bipartisanship is basically a myth now, that Washington is too partisan and that to spend a lot of time making-- trying to make deals is ultimately going to get you nowhere. It's going to waste time and you'll be punished at the ballot box. Do you believe that? Do you see that-- that basically bipartisanship is nice when you can get it, but this is not really the way things work these days in Washington? RON KLAIN: Well, I think, John, the President had a great conversation with Senator Capito this week. We've invited her and a group of Republican senators to the White House in the next few days, hopefully. We're going to work with Republicans. We're going to find common ground. You know the Senate last week passed by an overwhelming margin, a part of a water infrastructure bill that's part of-- related to our jobs plan. So I think you're starting to see some progress here. Look, the President has said he's going to work hard with anyone, Democrat or Republican, who shares our goals of getting this economy moving, beating this virus and helping American families. And I think there are people in the Republican Party who share those goals. And we're going to try to work with them. JOHN DICKERSON: But there are a lot of Democrats who say, sure, try to work with them, but then you've got to do what you can through the reconciliation process, which requires just fifty votes. And that that's really the way you're going to work this out. And the more time you spend following the fool's gold of bipartisanship, the less you're really going to get done. And so the route of reconciliation, it seems to me, it-- based on the conversations I have with Democrats, is really the way you're ultimately going to go for a lot of the President's agenda. RON KLAIN: John, we're going to take this one step at a time. This is an eight-year plan to rebuild the country. We have time to talk to people in both parties, find where the common ground is, find what people agree is mutually shared interests. I'm optimistic that we can make progress on that in the weeks ahead. As the President said, there's only two red lines for him in this entire process. He's not going to raise taxes on people making more than four-- making less than four hundred thousand dollars a year. The middle class are not going to see their taxes go up. And two, that everything is on the table. And that the only-- only other red line is that inaction is not an option. And so we're going to work hard-- JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. RON KLAIN: --to try to find a path forward on these widely popular economic matters. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about immigration as we go out here. The President-- every President makes promises and then runs into reality. The Washington Post had a headline that you can't have liked, which was \"At the border, a widely predicted crisis that caught Biden off guard.\" The question is whether the President's move to take away some of the Trump-era restrictions on immigration ended up creating an-- a draw for those migrants at the southern border? RON KLAIN: No, I don't think so, John. Look, I think people who are sending their children here unaccompanied, that's what we're talking about, children as young as six, seven years old, coming here with no adult who are sent on a dangerous journey. I don't think that's because of a speech Joe Biden gave. That's because of horrible conditions in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. We're working hard to get those children reunited with family members here in the U.S. The number of children, a recent report came out this week that said the number of children we have stuck in our Border Patrol stations are down eighty-four percent in the past month. We're making progress on resolving this problem and getting these kids reunited with their family members. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Ron Klain, we're going to have to leave it there. Thanks so much for being with us. FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute with South Carolina Senator Tim Scott. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina gave the Republican response to President Biden's address to Congress. He joins us now from Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. Good morning, Senator. SENATOR TIM SCOTT (R-South Carolina/@SenatorTimScott): Good morning, John. I hope you're doing well. JOHN DICKERSON: I am. Last time we were talking we got cut a little tight there in conversations about your effort to pass some police reform through the Senate. So we're going to start there today. SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: When we talked, it was in the summer, you were pessimistic. You have recently said you are optimistic about the-- the course of negotiations. What gives you that optimism? SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Well, John, let me just say this, one of the reasons why I asked to lead this police reform conversation on my side of the aisle is because I have-- I personally understand the-- the pain of being stopped eighteen times driving while black. I also have seen the-- the beauty of when officers go door-to-door with me on Christmas morning delivering presents to-- to kids in the most underserved communities. So I think I bring an equilibrium to the conversation. One of the reasons why I'm hopeful is because in a way, this time my friends on the left aren't looking for the issue. They're looking for a solution. And the things that I offered last-- last year are more popular this year. That gives me reasons to be hopeful. And, frankly, John, I was thinking about this. Think about the parts of the two bills that are in common, data collection. I think through negotiations and conversations, we are now closer on no-knock warrants and-- and chokeholds. And-- and there's something called Section 10.33 that has to do with getting government equipment from the military for local police. I think we're making progress there, too. So we have literally been able to bring these two bills very close together. And if we remember the goal isn't for Republicans or Democrats to win, but for communities to feel safer and our officers to feel respected. If we can accomplish those two major goals, the rest will be history. JOHN DICKERSON: A lot sunnier picture than when we talked during the summer. Let me ask you about the question of qualified immunity. Just to remind people this is a-- SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Yes, Sir. JOHN DICKERSON: --a legal framework that on the one hand, some people say protects police who are acting in good faith. Critics say that it's a shield when police cross the line. That has been a major sticking point. You have offered a proposal that says-- SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Yes. SENATOR TIM SCOTT: --allow civil suits to sue the department and not the individual police officer. Are you finding Democratic support for that? SENATOR TIM SCOTT: I am actually, which is another reason why I'm more optimistic this time, what we want to do is make sure that the bad apples are punished. And we've seen that through convictions from Michael Slager in 2015 when he shot Walter Scott in the back and to recently just last several days on the George Floyd convictions. Those-- those are promising signs. But the real question is how do we change the culture of policing? I think we do that by making the employer responsible for the actions of the employee. We do that with doctors. We do that with lawyers. We do that in almost all of our industries. And if we do that in law enforcement, the employer will change the culture. So as opposed to having one officer change or not change, we'll have all officers transforming because the departments are taking on more of that burden. And, frankly, as I spoke with the family members on Thursday, they were very receptive to that proposal because what they're looking for is something that shows progress. I think that does it. JOHN DICKERSON: When-- when you talk about changing the culture, I wonder what your assessment is of in your own party. How many people think that there is a need for police reform at all? Tucker Carlson is very influential with Republicans. And he quoted you and many others who said after the Chauvin verdict, there's more work to be done. You're talking about changing that culture. And he seemed to think that was not a legitimate position. What's your feeling about that? SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Well, one of the reasons why I started our conversation, John, with reality that as a United States Senator, I've been stopped several times in the last three years in the Capitol and on the streets throughout the country. So I'm not having a conversation about some theory or philosophy. I'm saying that there is a way for us to restore more confidence from communities of color and say to our officers, we want character-driven officers responding to crises in neighborhoods. Those are two things that we can accomplish. I think my party, significant numbers in my party have already said to me, we will go where you go on this issue as long as I can explain my position. And we're going to do that. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about your-- your theory about race. You said America is not a racist country. And your response to the President. The President has subsequently said he agrees with you. SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Yes. JOHN DICKERSON: But you've-- and you've-- and you've also said so there's some common ground there. You've also said \"\u2026to suggest there aren't racial challenges and patterns is for someone to be blind.\" And you've also said that-- that the system-- SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Yes. JOHN DICKERSON: --is \u2026breaking the back and breaking the spirit of millions of people in [our] country.\" And you're talking about Black Americans who are being affected by that system. So help people understand when you say it's not a racist country, but then you do talk about a system that targets Black Americans. You've talked about it today, help people square those two statements. SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Sure. Actually well, first, let me say thank goodness that finally our President, our vice president and one of the leaders in the Democrat-- Democrat caucus in the House, Jim Clyburn, have all come forward and said exactly what I've been saying for a long time. America is not a racist country. The question is is there a lingering effect after a couple of centuries of racism and discrimination in this nation? The answer is absolutely. The question we should be debating and fighting over is how do we resolve those issues going forward. One side says I'm going to take from some to give to others. Fighting bigotry with bigotry is hypocrisy. It just doesn't work. The second-- our side, what I've suggested is let's expand opportunity and make sure that we are fully equipped for the challenges of the future. One of the reasons why we have fought for and won the highest level of funding for historically black colleges, Republicans leading that fight is because I understand that if I can level the playing field in education, we will actually see human flourishing like we've never seen before. JOHN DICKERSON: But, Senator-- SENATOR TIM SCOTT: We focus our attention in health care as we have on sickle cell anemia or on opportunity zones for bringing resources into poor communities. We'll see what we have seen, which is the unemployment rates hitting all-time lows for African-Americans, Hispanics, seventy-year low for women. Those things actually matter, John. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah, but-- but when you say there's-- one side is talking about taking from one side to the other. I mean this is, you know, people pay taxes and there's an argument that that the taxes that are paid should go to communities that-- that we've seen, especially under COVID-19 have been disproportionately affected and that that's laid bare a lot of the inequity. So you're-- you're not saying that then making sure that there's money that goes to those Black communities is a bad thing? SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Well, John, let me say it differently. When you pass the COVID package with two trillion dollars of spending and in your package, you hide in there if you are a Black farmer, we will give you resources. But if you are a white farmer, you are excluded from those same resources that's taking from one to give to the other. It's one of the reasons why in the 1990s, the USDA had to pay out the Pigford settlements to Black farmers for taking from them to give to the white farmers. JOHN DICKERSON: But-- SENATOR TIM SCOTT: So we're going to reverse that and call that a way of creating fairness in our country? That doesn't really work. JOHN DICKERSON: Of course, they would argue that-- that-- that they're trying to deal with that system and the inequities you talk about. But let me ask you about taxes here because that's a part of this argument, too. SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Sure. JOHN DICKERSON: The President says fifty-five of the largest corporations pay no corporate taxes. Polls consistently show seventy percent of the country thinks that-- that the system is tilted towards the powerful. Why is it not-- why isn't it just making corporations pay their fair share to inch up the corporate tax rate, as the President has suggested? SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Well, the real reason, John, is a simple reason, and this is what I think is kind of stunning that we're missing in the conversation and you asked that of the White House chief of staff recently or earlier. We have competition. America has global competitors whose tax rates are lower than we are right now at twenty-one percent. Therefore, by taking it to twenty-eight percent, you actually rebalance the world against American workers. It's one of the reasons why the Biden plan makes wages-- suppresses wages long term and slows the growth of our economy because our competition is significantly lower than ours. You cannot compete in a global competition with higher taxes versus lower taxes and expect to win more of the contracts. That's kind of simple. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get your-- your-- you on the record about one final thing, if I may, Senator. SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Yes, Sir. JOHN DICKERSON: You talked about -having an honest conversation about common sense and common ground. Seventy percent of your-- your party-- SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Absolutely. JOHN DICKERSON: --think that Joe Biden is illegitimate because the election was stolen. How do you have common ground with that belief? SENATOR TIM SCOTT: Well, by moving on. The election is over. Joe-- Joe Biden is a President of the United States. JOHN DICKERSON: The legitimate president. SENATOR TIM SCOTT: And now, what we have to wrestle with-- of course, he is. Well, now, what we have to wrestle with is can we spend six to six and a half trillion dollars and raise taxes by four to four and a half trillion dollars and create a better America? JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Senator. SENATOR TIM SCOTT: My answer is no, because the American government-- JOHN DICKERSON: We're going to have to-- SENATOR TIM SCOTT: --can't be responsible for everything. JOHN DICKERSON: Senator, thank you so much. We got to go there and we'll be right back with more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: If you're not able to watch the full FACE THE NATION, you can set your DVR or we're available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS and Paramount+ apps. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We'll be right back with former FDA commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Plus, a conference with voters on FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We turn now to the battle against COVID-19. Mark Strassmann has more from Atlanta. (Begin VT) (Woman #1 yelling) MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): COVID America is eager for moments of magic. Disneyland obliged. MAN #1: Welcome back everyone. Welcome home. MARK STRASSMANN: Thirteen months after viral dread sidelined Mickey and Minnie, the California Park has reopened, though changed, like all of us. WOMAN #2: You have to have the ears, the whole outfit and now you have to have the mask, too. MARK STRASSMANN: To pandemic officials, the real pixie dust is injected, not sprinkled and needs more believers. MAYOR DAVID HOLT (R-Oklahoma City): If you go to a hospital, or worse you die, all because you chose to not get vaccinated, that would really be a tragedy. MARK STRASSMANN: More than one in four Americans has been fully vaccinated. As a daily average, 2.6 million more people got a shot over the last week. That's down sharply. The shortfall is demand, not supply. In the Northwest, a plea for young people to get the shot as cases start to spike again. Take Oregon, hospitalizations have nearly doubled in the past week. GOVERNOR KATE BROWN (D-Oregon): COVID-19 is now knocking more younger people off their feet. MARK STRASSMANN: Millions of Americans refuse to give the vaccine a shot. CROWD (in unison): We will not be silenced. MARK STRASSMANN: Some are not never Vaxxers. Others assert freedom of choice. But to most objectors, it's the science, a vague, visceral skepticism that Operation Warp Speed moved too fast. At stake America's herd immunity, keeping new variants at bay and getting fully on the other side of this pandemic. MAN #2: Is this your first time here? WOMAN #3: It is. MARK STRASSMANN: The economy is getting there. MAN #3: In general, we're already back to-- to the pre-COVID levels. MARK STRASSMANN: People want to spend. \"\"Help-wanted signs are everywhere, even on the menu. WOMAN #4: I've hired more people now that never worked in restaurants before than ever. MARK STRASSMANN: They're gearing up for a hot summer in Las Vegas, the Disneyland for adults. GOVERNOR STEVE SISOLAK (D-Nevada): When will Vegas be back? To all those who ask, the comeback is here now. MARK STRASSMANN: Same for here in Georgia. A rollback of COVID restrictions starting this weekend for businesses, including gyms and movie theaters. Restaurant staff no longer have to wear masks, and all of that is worrisome to health officials. John. JOHN DICKERSON: Mark Strassmann, thank you. The situation in the United States is definitely improving, but that's not the case in some other parts of the world. Here is senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer. ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent): Good morning. Mass vaccination is, at last, bringing COVID under control in Europe. But there are still hotspots across the world. Right now first and foremost in India. (Begin VT) (Woman speaking foreign language) ELIZABETH PALMER: Yesterday, it set a grim record, more than four hundred thousand new cases. To say hospitals are overwhelmed is an understatement. Medical staff are working flat-out against huge odds, and everywhere there's a shortage of oxygen. People wait for hours in the street to refill tanks for home care. A Sikh temple in East Delhi even set up curbside oxygen distribution for the very sickest like Abu Sadat (ph), whose brother has been trying to get him into the hospital for a week. MAN: No more beds in the hospital. ELIZABETH PALMER: More than three and a half thousand Indians died yesterday. Makeshift crematoriums have even sprung up in parking lots with the fires going day and night. International aid, including oxygen from the U.S., is arriving, but not enough to end this crisis any time soon. The other hotspot on the planet is Brazil. With a per capita death rate right now even higher than India's and the virus is still spreading fast. Thanks to people obeying rules on mask wearing and social distancing sporadically or not at all. Speaking of no social distancing, how about this, a government-sponsored rave. Three thousand young people tested to make sure they didn't have COVID were invited to party in Liverpool. They will now be tested every day to find out if mass events like this can take place safely over the summer. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: Liz Palmer reporting from London. Thanks, Liz. We go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He sits on the board of Pfizer and he joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning, Doctor Gottlieb. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: Before we get to the international picture, I want to get your weekly update on where things stand right now in the United States. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, the con-- the situation in the U.S. continues to improve, and I think in the coming weeks we're going to see an acceleration, the-- the decline in cases. And one of the big reasons is vaccination. We've vaccinated a hundred and forty-five million Americans who've had at least one dose. About a hundred million Americans have been fully vaccinated at this point. This has been a monumental achievement, rolling out this vaccine, getting that many Americans vaccinated. And it's going to continue. We'll continue to chip away at it. The rate of vaccination is going to slow in the coming weeks, but we'll continue to pick up more people as we get into the summer. And if you want to get a harbinger of what it's going to look like look at San Francisco right now. About seventy-one percent of people in San Francisco have had at least one dose of vaccine. Forty-seven percent have been fully vaccinated. They're recording about twenty cases a day. They have about twenty people who have been hospitalized. So they've dramatically reduced COVID in that city. And it's largely a result of vaccination. I think that right now the gains that we're seeing across the country are locked in. We're entering warm months when this is going to create a backstop against continued spread of the coronavirus. And so we're locking in these gains. JOHN DICKERSON: You've mentioned San Francisco. Let me ask you about New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said New York City will fully reopen on July 1st. Even though New York State has the sixth highest count of new cases over the last seven days. What's your assessment of that decision by the New York mayor? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think as we look out into the summer, we're going to be able to resume normal activity or something resembling normal activity. It's still going to be a layer of protection on top of what we do. I think people are still going to be cautious. But this is going to be a relatively quiescent summer when it comes to coronavirus spread. New York's doing a lot of testing. New York's leading the country really in testing. So they're turning over a lot of their cases and we're not even capturing all the negative tests. There's a lot of testing going on at home now with at-home tests that aren't necessarily getting reported unless they're positive cases. So I think the positivity rate around the country is even lower than what we're recording. But we're seeing cases come down with seeing hospitalizations come down, which is really the hardest measure of the overall impact of COVID. Hospitalizations are a pretty good indicator of where the direction is heading and they're coming down as well. So I think these gains are pretty sustainable at this point. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about India. There-- there is a travel ban for--travel from India. Do you think that's a good idea? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I'm not sure what we're hoping to accomplish. If the goal is to try to prevent introduction of virus into the United States, there's plenty of virus here already. If the goal is to try to prevent introduction of that new variant, 6.1.7., that's circulating in India, I assure you it's here already. So we're not going to be able to prevent its introduction. These travel restrictions could serve a purpose, but we need to be clearly-- clear about what that purpose is. Right now we still have restrictions in place against travel from China and the U.K. That doesn't make a lot of sense. So I'm not really sure what the overall strategy is around these continued travel restrictions that we have in place. JOHN DICKERSON: When people see these-- an enormous number of cases and-- and the virus blooming in different parts of the world, how should they process that with respect to variants, in other words, more disease. Does that create the conditions for more variants that could then come back to the United States and cause us issues here? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, that's absolutely the case, the more that this virus continues to circulate, the more it's going to continue to mutate. But the reality is that these variants aren't just cropping up in one market and in migrating around the world. They're cropping up simultaneously in every market. You're getting what we call convergent evolution where the same mutations that are arising in other parts of the world are also arising here spontaneously. There's probably a finite number of ways that this virus is going to try to mutate to evade our immunity. And it's testing us everywhere in the world. So the same mutations that are arising in other parts of the world are arising here as well. They just haven't gotten a foothold here, in part, because we've been vaccinating our public. JOHN DICKERSON: A lot of people are thinking about what they're going to do with their kids this summer. What is your assessment? What's going to happen, do you think, in terms of being able to vaccinate those under age sixteen, say, in the twelve to sixteen age range? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I'm hopeful that the FDA is going to authorize the Pfizer vaccine, the company I'm on the board of as applied for permission to start giving its vaccine to twelve- to fifteen-year-olds. I'm hopeful the FDA is going to authorize that in a very short time period. And I think when-- once that gets authorized, I think you'll pick up probably five million kids will get immediately vaccinated. There's about seventeen million children between the age of twelve and fifteen. I think we'll pick up about five million immediately. I think probably another five million, five to seven million would get vaccinated over the course of the summer before the school year. So that'll be incremental. Americans getting vaccinated against COVID and hopefully providing protection in an age group that has been susceptible to the infection. Older kids are-- are more susceptible, certainly than younger kids. JOHN DICKERSON: Will vaccinating kids, is there-- is there-- will that go through the regular system we've had or will parents be going through pediatricians? Is there a different way when you're talking about those younger ages to get the vaccine passed? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, it's a great question. There's a lot of effort underway right now to try to break the vaccine down into units that can be distributed to doctors' offices to allow pediatricians to provide those vaccinations. And I think that's ultimately the way we're going to get more kids vaccinated. I think initially you're going to see vaccination sites start to offer vaccines to children. Pharmacies will as well. But, really, the key to getting kids vaccinated is doing it through pediatricians. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Doctor Scott Gottlieb, thanks so much, as always. See you next week. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: To mark the first one hundred days of the Biden administration, we asked voters what was most important to them about the President's campaign promises. (Begin VT) RAY (North Carolina): The thing that concerns me the most, and it was probably an unspoken promise, and that is that my kids will be-- will be safer, potentially safer. I myself have been placed in jail multiple times of-- for no reason of my own just because of the color of my skin. And to hear our leader come in and-- and try to bring in and try to bridge this country and bring it back together, for me is what was desperately needed. JOHN DICKERSON: In-- Senator Tim Scott, in giving the Republican response on Wednesday night after the President spoke, said America is not a racist country. How did-- did you hear that, and what was your response? RAY: I did hear that. My great-grandfather was lynched. People came to-- to their home in the middle of the night and grabbed him, lynched him, and my grandfather and all of his siblings were separated, never to be seen again. I'm living that-- I have relatives that I have never seen again. And for-- but also, Tim Scott-- for Tim Scott to state that he's been stopped and he's been profiled, he has been stereotyped and all of those things, and then the turnaround and say that America is not a racist country, it-- it-- I mean, it's sad to say, but it looks like the guy just bought out-- JOHN DICKERSON: But do-- is it-- RAY: --by going to the other side. BECKY (North Carolina): I was disappointed with his speech, but I don't think that America is a racist country overall. But I do think there has been a disgusting amount of not only systemic racism, but coming from-- before I'm-- I'm going to be talking about our families, but coming from a family of mixed ethnicity and having a lot of friends of-- of all, you know, races and everything and living in the south, you know, I mean, I-- I almost started crying hearing your story. Because, I mean, I-- I do agree that it's a huge problem. RAY: There are a lot of good people in the United States. So not everyone is racist. JOHN DICKERSON: Is it your view that-- that-- that it's a racist country or that there are racists in America? RAY: I believe that this is a racist country. JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. April, you're shaking your head-- RAY: And-- and I've lived it. And I've lived it. APRIL (New York): Yeah. I don't agree that the United States is a racist country. I don't know why so many people will be coming across our border who are not white would want to come here so badly if we were so racist. I disagree with that premise totally. JOHN DICKERSON: April-- RAY: I'm happy but you can live that. JOHN DICKERSON: Allen, go ahead. Allen, you want to jump in there? ALLEN (California): My father was Puerto Rican, so he was born in America. My mother, however, was from Honduras. And I can tell you right now, I mean, she left for safety reasons. Because nobody leaves their home, their family just on a lark, you know, or-- or looking for a better job, you know, just for that reason. I mean they leave and go through that hardship because they feel genuinely in danger. And I don't think America is a racist country per se, but I don't think that a lot of people even realize when they're being racist. And when they are looking down at someone, you know, and-- and unless you've been the target of that, you know, either verbally or by looks, you don't know. JOHN DICKERSON: President Biden, is it your feeling that he's spending a lot of money, even given the fact that America's just been through a pandemic and a lot of people are out work? APRIL: I believe more people would be back to work if he'd spend less money on unemployment. We have local people with small businesses who can't hire enough people to take care of their clients because the people are getting six hundred-- whatever, four hundred, six hundred dollars more in unemployment, so they don't want to go back to work. JOHN DICKERSON: When Joe Biden ran for President, what was it that he said that you would like him to deliver on? ALLEN: Well, the health message, making health affordable to all families, creating jobs through actually working toward fixing the infrastructure. Another thing that-- that he-- he's-- he's touched on as well is education. You know, I mean, my sister got her master's, but she, you know, she's a year older than I am, and I'm sixty-five, and she's still paying off a student loan. So, I mean, you know, what is the incentive for a-- a person to get educated if there's no light at the end of the tunnel. I mean-- BECKY: I-- I bartend with my master's degree. ALLEN: Well, that's what I'm saying. I mean, that-- that's atrocious. That shouldn't be happening. BECKY: Well, I like-- I mean-- ALLEN: But, yes, it is-- but yet it is. And-- and where are these jobs going? JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. ALLEN: I mean, a lot of these jobs are getting-- going overseas. JOHN DICKERSON: Kate, did you watch the President's speech? KATE (New York): I did. And I, again, I feel like, you know, the jobs answer isn't really on a federal-level answer. It's really a state-level answer. So him promising jobs is just a pie in the sky thing to appease American people. The minute he raises the corporate tax, back to where he wants it to be, where the liberals want it, you can kiss the rest of-- whatever jobs are left in this administration goodbye, because it is all about the money. We are a capitalist country. And you can't just say you have to produce jobs but we're going to tax you at forty-five percent. They're going to send all their jobs-- BECKY: I believe the number was twenty-eight percent, but I think that even so that was a stretch and they don't-- well, they don't-- you know, I-- I'd been-- he'd been saying that it won't be that high, you know, I mean. KATE: (INDISTINCT) trillion dollars expenditure plan, you're going to have to go higher than what he's saying. JOHN DICKERSON: And, Kate, what did you make of his argument that by raising corporate tax rate, corporations that have paid no taxes will pay their fair share? KATE: To me, it-- it all goes down to if the economy is robust and that the corporations are paying less, but the jobs are there, there is more money going back into the economy. JOHN DICKERSON: If you heard that the Republicans worked with President Biden on some piece of legislation, you don't-- that would be fine with you if they worked together? KATE: Yes. I have no problem with that. I have no pro-- I'm-- I'm from New York. I-- I have to deal with the liberals every day of my life. So, to me, yeah, if you work with bipartisanship, it's a little bit better for the country. JOHN DICKERSON: Becky, do you feel like the-- the American economic system is basically fair? BECKY: I mean no. I always worked-- you know, I have two to three, sometimes four different, you know, like, three part-time jobs and then a freelance job, and whatever. I think that we've gone backwards with women also in the business, in just, like, as far as what we earn, that's-- that's taken a hit again, you know, compared to men. JOHN DICKERSON: Kate, you were shaking your head. Do-- do you think that the American economic system is basically-- basically fair as it is set up in the moment? KATE: It-- it's the greatest in the world, honestly. I mean I'm a female. I'm a business owner. I do my own business. I worked really hard for a living. I come from a single mom, a poor background. You know I put myself through college. No, I-- I don't think that can happen in any other country in this whole entire world than United States. JOHN DICKERSON: Allen, as you look at the next year, what gives you hope? ALLEN: I think that-- what gives me hope is, again, trying to unify the country. Yeah, you know, we're always going to have us against them, obviously. However, if we can look past our own egos and our own hardships and try to see the other person's viewpoint a little bit clearer and more respectfully I think that we can go forward. JOHN DICKERSON: April, what gives-- what gives you hope? APRIL: That there's another election coming up in 2022. And hopefully we'll get the House back. KATE: I'm with April, 2022, making sure that tech is not going to censor for the next two years, for the next elections. And also tightening our election laws. Making sure that if I have to show a license to get on a plane or to get-- buy a beer, that-- I should have to prove who I am to vote. JOHN DICKERSON: Becky, what gives you hope? BECKY: I'm hopeful that we are headed-- well, first of all, to be out of this, you know what, pandemic. I look forward to being able to work. I look forward to seeing people again. But I look forward, you know, I look forward to less violence, hopefully. JOHN DICKERSON: Ray, what gives you hope? RAY: I think all of us were just tired of waking up every day, looking at our phones to see what in the heck has happened over the night. And what other fear-mongering was taking place as-- as a-- as a result of some tweets or whatever. But I think that now we have a good leader in-- in place who's going to help us move forward in the right direction. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We end today with a tribute to all the people who paved the path to Americans becoming vaccinated. (Begin VT) JOHN DICKERSON: When Doctors Katalin Kariko and Drew Weissman got their COVID-19 vaccines last December, they received a standing ovation. They were at the end of a global vaccine bucket brigade that they had helped start. Their life's work with mRNA was at the center of the cure in those syringes going into their arms. It had helped doctors like BioNTech's Ugur \u015eahin and Ozlem Tureci who joined the vaccine push with Pfizer scientist Kathrin Jansen. KATHRIN JANSEN (60 MINUTES, 12/21/2020): We can call it a miracle, but a miracle always has a sense of it just happened. It didn't just happen. JOHN DICKERSON: Next in the brigade were the volunteers who tested the new vaccine. Jennifer Haller was the very first to participate in the Moderna trial. JENNIFER HALLER: The value that I'm going to add to hopefully for everybody will-- will certainly outweigh any risks that-- that could happen. JOHN DICKERSON: The vials spun through their factory shoots quickened by Operation Warp Speed. GUSTAVE F. PERNA: D-Day was the beginning of the end and that's where we are today. JOHN DICKERSON: Airlines and shipping companies took it from there. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Do you feel like you were delivering hope this morning? MAN #1: Absolutely. We know it's going to make a meaningful difference in the lives of so many. JOHN DICKERSON: Pilots handed to truck drivers. MAN #2: After many years at UPS this has been the most important load that I've hauled. JOHN DICKERSON: The supply was spread over sixty thousand vaccination sites, including the one at the New York Department of Health where it went into my arm. The visit was an efficient ballet of injection, where nurses and volunteers ministered to people from all walks of life who were polite, orderly and grateful. This is not an exhaustive list of all those who lent a hand in turning an idea into a cure, but the winding chain of effort illustrates the magnitude of the toil of thousands, most of them out of sight which has led to over one hundred and forty-six million Americans being vaccinated. Hearts lightened, summer plans opened, hugs finally deployed. We are grateful beneficiaries. Our gratitude is tempered, though, by the stark sorrow of the pandemic that is still shaking our world. The links in the chain of vaccination have given those of us who've received it a chance at the future. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: As a recipient, thank you. I hope that all of that work will inspire all of us to be worthy of it. Back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Before we go, some very happy news to share. There's a new member of our FACE THE NATION family. Malek Murphy Yakub arrived Wednesday. Margaret, her husband, Yado, and big brother, Eamon, sent us this photo to share with you. Welcome to the world, Malek. For FACE THE NATION, I'm John Dickerson.",

            "article_content": "Madame Speaker.\u00a0Madame Vice President.\u00a0No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it's about time.\u00a0The First Lady.\u00a0The Second Gentleman.\u00a0Mr. Chief Justice.\u00a0Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet \u2013 and distinguished guests.\u00a0My fellow Americans.\u00a0While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different \u2013 a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in.\u00a0Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world.\u00a0To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities.\u00a0Tonight, I come to talk about crisis \u2014 and opportunity.\u00a0About rebuilding our nation \u2014 and revitalizing our democracy.\u00a0And winning the future for America.\u00a0As I stand here tonight \u2014 just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration.\u00a0100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis.\u00a0The worst pandemic in a century.\u00a0The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.\u00a0The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\u00a0Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again.\u00a0Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength.\u00a0Life can knock us down.\u00a0But in America, we never stay down.\u00a0In America, we always get up.\u00a0And today, that's what we're doing: America is rising anew.\u00a0Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness.\u00a0After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff.\u00a0We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again.\u00a0We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America.\u00a0100 days ago, America's house was on fire.\u00a0We had to act.\u00a0And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer \u2013 and with the overwhelming support of the American people \u2013 Democrats, Independents, and Republicans \u2013 we did act.\u00a0Together \u2014 we passed the American Rescue Plan.One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history.\u00a0We're already seeing the results.\u00a0After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days \u2013 we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days.\u00a0We're marshalling every federal resource. We've gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers.\u00a0We're setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas.\u00a0Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site.\u00a0Everyone over the age of 16, everyone \u2013 is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away.\u00a0So get vaccinated now.\u00a0When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\u00a0100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected.\u00a0Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%.\u00a0And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot.\u00a0At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what it's like.\u00a0She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope.\u00a0A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease.\u00a0She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home.\u00a0When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried.\u00a0Cried out of joy, cried out of relief.\u00a0Parents are seeing smiles on their kids' faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.\u00a0Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbye\u00a0It means everything to both of them.\u00a0There's still more work to do to beat this virus. We can't let our guard down now.\u00a0But tonight, I can say because of you \u2014 the American people \u2013 our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen.\u00a0What else have we done these first 100 days?\u00a0We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households.\u00a0We've already sent more than 160 million checks out the door.\u00a0It's making a difference.\u00a0For many people, it's making all the difference in the world.\u00a0A single mom in Texas wrote to me. She said when she couldn't work, this relief check put food on the tableand saved her and her son from eviction.\u00a0A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor \u2014 something she put off for months because she didn't have the money.\u00a0One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk.\u00a0Did you ever think you'd see that in America?\u00a0That's why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger \u2013 and hunger is down sharply already.\u00a0We're also providing: Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job.\u00a0During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that.\u00a0We're making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans.\u00a0Critical investments to address the opioid crisis.\u00a0And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.\u00a0In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days.\u00a0More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record.\u00a0The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year.\u00a0That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.\u00a0America is moving. Moving forward. And we can't stop now.\u00a0We're in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century.\u00a0We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better.\u00a0Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America.\u00a0The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress.\u00a0Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity.\u00a0Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more. These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future.\u00a0That's why I proposed The American Jobs Plan \u2014 a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself.\u00a0The largest jobs plan since World War II.\u00a0It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. It's clean water.\u00a0Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water. A clear and present danger to our children's health. The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation's lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child \u2013 can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water.\u00a0It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still don't have it.\u00a0This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort.\u00a0It creates jobs by building a modern power grid.\u00a0Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures \u2013 with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms.\u00a0The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid.\u00a0The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers.\u00a02 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldn't get the care they need for their family, their children.\u00a0800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability.\u00a0This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits.\u00a0For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis.\u00a0Jobs. Jobs.\u00a0For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs.\u00a0The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes.\u00a0Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways.\u00a0Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.\u00a0There's no reason the blades for wind turbines can't be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing.\u00a0No reason why American workers can't lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries.\u00a0The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs \u2013 jobs Americans can raise their families on.\u00a0And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: \"Buy American.\"\u00a0American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs.\u00a0The way it should be.\u00a0Now \u2013 I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you.\u00a0You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that's rapidly changing.\u00a0I want to speak speak directly to you.\u00a0Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come.\u00a0These are good-paying jobs that can't be outsourced.\u00a0Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree.\u00a075% do not require an associate's degree.\u00a0The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America.\u00a0And, it recognizes something I've always said.\u00a0Wall Street didn't build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class.\u00a0And that's why I'm calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act \u2013 the PRO Act \u2014 and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize.\u00a0By the way \u2013 let's also pass the $15 minimum wage.\u00a0No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line.\u00a0And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women.\u00a0Let's get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay.\u00a0It's long past time.\u00a0Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record.\u00a0We will see more technological change in the next 10 years \u2013 than we saw in the last 50 years.\u00a0And we're falling behind in that competition.\u00a0Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development.\u00a0Today, we spend less than 1%.\u00a0China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy. The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA \u2013 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency \u2013 that's there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security \u2013 which led to the internet and GPS and so much more. The National Institutes of Health, the NIH \u2013 should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. To develop breakthroughs \u2013 to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cancer.\u00a0This is personal to so many of us.I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan.\u00a0Let's end cancer as we know it. It's within our power\u00a0Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we're talking about have often had bipartisan support.\u00a0Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan.\u00a0And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their proposal.\u00a0So, let's get to work. We welcome ideas.\u00a0But, the rest of the world isn't waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option. Secretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi. Spent over 24 hours in private discussions. When he called to congratulate, we had a two hour discussion. He's deadly earnest about becoming most significant consequential nation in the world. He ant others, autocrats, think that democracy can't compete in the 21st century. It takes too long to get consensus.\u00a0 To win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families \u2013 in our children. That's why I'm introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today. First, access to a good education.\u00a0When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world.\u00a0But the world is catching up. They are not waiting.\u00a012 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st Century.\u00a0My American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America \u2013 starting as early as we can.\u00a0 A great university in this country conducted studies of the last 10 years that shows adding two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old, no matter what background they come from, puts them in a position of being able to compete all the way through 12 years.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The research shows that when a young child goes to school\u2014not day care\u2014they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college.\u00a0And then we add two years of free community college.\u00a0And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions.\u00a0Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady.\u00a0She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us \u2013 and she'll be leading this effort.\u00a0Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care. I'm proposing legislation that would guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5.\u00a0 The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.\u00a0No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one \u2013 a parent, spouse, or child.\u00a0And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families.\u00a0In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family.\u00a0Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 \u2014 and $3,600 for children under 6.\u00a0With two parents, two kids, that's up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family.\u00a0This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year.\u00a0Together, let's extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025.\u00a0The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\u00a0Let's make that provision permanent so their premiums don't go back up.\u00a0In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address \u2013 this year \u2013 other critical priorities for America's families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans \u2013protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women's health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed.\u00a0Let's lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and let's lower prescription drug costs.\u00a0We all know how outrageously expensive they are.\u00a0In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America \u2013 nearly three times as much as other countries.\u00a0We can change that.\u00a0Let's do what we've always talked about for all of years I was down here in this body.\u00a0  \u00a0Let's give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs.\u00a0That won't just help people on Medicare \u2013 it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone.\u00a0The money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act \u2013 expand Medicare coverage and benefits \u2013 without costing taxpayers one additional penny. It's within our power to do it. Let's do it now.\u00a0  \u00a0We've talked about it long enough \u2013 Democrats and Republicans.\u00a0Let's get it done this year.\u00a0This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America.\u00a0So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans?\u00a0I've made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits.\u00a0Let's start with what I will not do.\u00a0I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year.\u00a0It's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share.\u00a0Just pay their fair share.\u00a0A recent study shows that 55 of the nation's biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year.\u00a0No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits.\u00a0A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands.\u00a0And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas.\u00a0That's not right.\u00a0We're going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share \u2013 and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from.\u00a0And, we're going to reward work, not wealth.\u00a0We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans \u2013 those making $400,000 or more \u2013 back up to 39.6%. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans \u2013 those making $400,000 or more \u2013 back up to 39.6%.\u00a0That's where it was when George W. Bush became president.\u00a0We're going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work.\u00a0This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans.\u00a0And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes.\u00a0That's estimated to be billions of dollars.\u00a0Look, I'm not out to punish anyone. But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They're already paying enough. What I've proposed is fair. It's fiscally responsible. It raises the revenue to pay for the plans I've proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy.\u00a0When you hear someone say that they don't want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America \u2013 ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut?\u00a0Look at the big tax cut in 2017.\u00a0It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth.\u00a0Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit.\u00a0It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.\u00a0Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development \u2013 it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs.\u00a0In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history.\u00a0According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make.\u00a0The pandemic has only made things worse.\u00a020 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic \u2013 working- and middle-class Americans.\u00a0At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion.\u00a0Let me say that again. Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion.\u00a0My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics hasnever worked.\u00a0It's time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out.\u00a0A broad consensus of economists \u2013 left, right, center \u2013 agree that what I'm proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth.\u00a0These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation.\u00a0I've often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example \u2013 not just the example of our power.\u00a0And in my conversations with world leaders \u2013 many I've known for a long time \u2013 the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back \u2013\u00a0but for how long?\u00a0My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay.\u00a0And that we aren't going it alone \u2013 we're going to be leading with our allies.\u00a0No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone \u2013 from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change \u2013 and as we're experiencing now, pandemics.\u00a0There's no wall high enough to keep any virus away.\u00a0As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs \u2013 and we are meeting them \u2013 we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries \u2013 just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2.\u00a0The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either.\u00a0It's a global fight.\u00a0The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions.\u00a0The rest of the world accounts for 85%.\u00a0That's why \u2013 I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office.\u00a0And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world \u2013 from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days.\u00a0I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history.\u00a0And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet \u2013 and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world.\u00a0The investments I've proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class.\u00a0That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China.\u00a0In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition \u2013 and that we are not looking for conflict.\u00a0But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board.\u00a0America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property.\u00a0I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo\u2014Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe \u2013 not to start conflict \u2013 but to prevent conflict.\u00a0And, I told him what I've said to many world leaders \u2013 that America won't back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u00a0No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country.\u00a0America is an idea \u2013 unique in the world.\u00a0We are all created equal. It's who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle.\u00a0With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we don't seek escalation, their actions have consequences.\u00a0I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia's interference in our elections and cyber\u2014attacks on our government and businesses \u2013 and they did both of those things and I did respond.\u00a0But we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interests.\u00a0As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms \u2013 and as we're working to do on the climate crisis.\u00a0On Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs that present a serious threat to America's security and world security \u2013 we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence.\u00a0And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan.\u00a0We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.\u00a0And I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone.\u00a0Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did.\u00a0We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11.\u00a0War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi\u2014generational undertaking of nation\u2014building.\u00a0We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11.\u00a0We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. If you've been to the upper valley, you've seen the gates of hell. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it's time to bring our troops home.\u00a0Even as we do, we will maintain an over\u2014the\u2014horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland.\u00a0But make no mistake \u2013\u00a0the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from.\u00a0Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond.\u00a0And, we won't ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined \u2013 the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism.\u00a0And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation.\u00a0It was nearly a year ago before her father's funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd's young daughter.\u00a0As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye\u2014to\u2014eye, she said to me, \"Daddy changed the world.\"\u00a0After the conviction of George Floyd's murderer, we can see how right she was \u2013 if we have the courage to act.\u00a0We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America.\u00a0Now is our opportunity to make real progress.\u00a0Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably.\u00a0I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well.\u00a0My fellow Americans, we have to come together.\u00a0To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve.\u00a0To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system.\u00a0And to enact police reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already.\u00a0I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats.\u00a0We need to work together to find a consensus.\u00a0Let's get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd's death.\u00a0The country supports this reform.Congress should act.\u00a0We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice.\u00a0Real justice.\u00a0And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways.\u00a0A chance to deliver real equity.\u00a0Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water.\u00a0Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations.\u00a0Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans \u2013 Black, White, Latino, Asian American, Native American.\u00a0I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94\u20141 to pass the COVID\u201419 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we've seen this past year \u2013 and for too long.\u00a0I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible.\u00a0I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans.\u00a0To all the transgender Americans watching at home \u2013 especially the young people who are so brave \u2013 I want you to know that your president has your back.\u00a0And another thing.\u00a0Let's reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it.\u00a0It will close the so\u2014called \"boyfriend\" loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers.\u00a0It's estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner \u2013 every month in America.\u00a0Pass it and save lives.\u00a0And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America.\u00a0Our flag at the White House was still flying at half\u2014staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.\u00a0In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead.\u00a0250 shot dead.\u00a0I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue.\u00a0In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high\u2014capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds.\u00a0We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined.\u00a0But in the early 2000's, that law expired and we've seen the daily bloodshed since.\u00a0More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know \u2013 the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence \u2013 I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic.\u00a0One of them is banning so\u2014called \"ghost guns.\"\u00a0They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm.\u00a0The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can't be traced.\u00a0The buyers of ghost gun kits aren't required to pass a background check.\u00a0Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon.\u00a0But not anymore.\u00a0I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence.\u00a0But it's time for Congress to act as well. I don't want to become confrontational, but we need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun.\u00a0 And we need a ban on assault weapons and high\u2014capacity magazines again. Don't tell me it can't be done. We've done it before \u2026 and it worked.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters \u2013 they'll tell you there's no possible justification for having 100 rounds \u2013 100 bullets \u2013 in a weapon.\u00a0They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldn't be able to.\u00a0These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people \u2013 including many gun owners.\u00a0The country supports reform, and the Congress should act.\u00a0This shouldn't be a Red vs. Blue issue. It's an American issue.\u00a0And here's what else we can do.\u00a0Immigration has always been essential to America.\u00a0Let's end our exhausting war over immigration.\u00a0For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it.\u00a0It's time to fix it.\u00a0On Day One of my presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress.\u00a0If you believe we need a secure border \u2013 pass it.\u00a0If you believe in a pathway to citizenship \u2013 pass it.\u00a0If you actually want to solve the problem \u2013 I have sent you a bill, now pass it.\u00a0We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador.\u00a0The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes.\u00a0When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration.\u00a0It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave.\u00a0Our plan worked.\u00a0But the last administration shut it down.\u00a0I'm restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts.\u00a0I have absolute confidence she will get the job done.\u00a0Now, if Congress won't pass my plan \u2013 let's at least pass what we agree on.\u00a0Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers \u2013 the young people who have only known America as their home.\u00a0And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man\u2014made and natural made violence and disaster.\u00a0As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables.\u00a0Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic \u2013 as they have throughout our history.\u00a0The country supports immigration reform.\u00a0Congress should act.\u00a0And if we are to truly restore the soul of America \u2013 we need to protect the sacred right to vote.\u00a0More people voted in the last presidential election than ever before in our history \u2013 in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever.\u00a0That should be celebrated. Instead it's being attacked.\u00a0Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away.\u00a0The country supports it.\u00a0Congress should act.\u00a0As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol\u2014desecrating our democracy\u2014remain vivid in our minds.\u00a0Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned.\u00a0The insurrection was an existential crisis\u2014a test of whether our democracy could survive.\u00a0It did.\u00a0But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy\u00a0 will long endure is both ancient and urgent.\u00a0As old as our Republic. Still vital today.\u00a0Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us \u2013 created equal in the image of God \u2013 have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?\u00a0Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people?\u00a0Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart?\u00a0America's adversaries \u2013 the autocrats of the world \u2013 are betting it can't. I promise you, they're betting we can't. They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage.\u00a0\u00a0They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong.\u00a0We have to prove democracy still works.\u00a0That our government still works \u2013 and can deliver for the people.\u00a0In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people's faith in our democracy to deliver.\u00a0We're vaccinating the nation. We're creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We're delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives.\u00a0Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice.\u00a0That's the essence of America. That's democracy in action.\u00a0Our Constitution opens with the words, \"We the People\".\u00a0It's time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I.\u00a0Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over.\u00a0It's us. It's \"We the people.\"\u00a0In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us\u2014In America: we do our part.\u00a0That's all I'm asking. That we all do our part.\u00a0And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong.\u00a0The autocrats will not win the future.\u00a0America will.\u00a0The future will belong to America.\u00a0I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation.\u00a0And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America.\u00a0We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy \u2014 of pandemic and pain \u2014 and \"We the People\" did not flinch.\u00a0At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail.\u00a0We came together.\u00a0United.\u00a0With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve.\u00a0To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century.\u00a0On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just.\u00a0As one people. One nation. One America.\u00a0It's never been a good bet to bet against America.\u00a0And it still isn't.\u00a0We are the United States of America.\u00a0There is nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 beyond our capacity \u2013 nothing we can't do \u2013 if we do it together.\u00a0May God bless you all.\u00a0May God protect our troops.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, as President Biden prepares to unveil the next phase of his economic agenda, the continuing threat of COVID and a growing crisis at the border may complicate his plans. Health officials are warning Americans the virus could be heading in the wrong direction as new cases of COVID continue to plateau at high levels every day.\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: If we don't control things now, there is a real potential for the epidemic curve to soar again.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It comes as President Biden sets new ambitious vaccine goals, promising two hundred million shots in his first one hundred days.\u00a0PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Twice our original goal. But no other country in the world has even come close.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Can we vaccinate quickly enough to put the pandemic to rest? We'll check in with Doctor Anthony Fauci and former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. And the dire situation along the U.S.-Mexico border. A surge of migrants has overwhelmed some shelters in the region. The President grew defensive when pressed by reporters.\u00a0CECILIA VEGA: Is what's happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed?\u00a0PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That's a serious question, right? Is it acceptable to me? Come on. That's why we're going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans have identified their culprit.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: It is a crisis that was created by the Biden administration, by their own policies.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Lawmakers leak their own images while journalists are barred from visiting many of the overcrowded facilities. We'll hear from Congressman Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from Texas, who shared with us these new exclusive photos from inside a holding facility. We'll also hear from Doctor Julia Letlow. She was just elected to Congress, replacing her late husband who passed away from COVID last year. Plus, fewer industries were hit harder by this pandemic than tourism and travel. What's the roadmap for recovery? We'll speak with the CEO of Marriott International, Tony Capuano.\u00a0It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. This weekend the race to vaccinate America marks a new milestone: The daily number of doses administered is at a record level. Despite that ramp up in vaccinations, infections are also on the rise in thirty states, plus, Washington, DC. We begin with senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0(Crowd cheering)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): COVID immunity. To these California seniors it's a shot of liberation in the season of renewal.\u00a0MAN: It gives you a feeling of normalcy again.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: On Saturday alone nearly 3.5 million Americans got the COVID vaccine, a single day record. Across the country more than fifty million adults, roughly one in five, now fully vaccinated. Clearly, it's progress. Now here comes the disclaimer.\u00a0WOMAN: Too many people feel like the pandemic is over.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Immunologists worry with the vaccine we're confusing immunity with invulnerability. TSA agents now screen more than one million fliers every day, including many returning spring breakers.\u00a0NED LAMONT: Watch out for Miami Beach. Get tested before you come back.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: In Michigan, new cases over the last week jumped more than fifty percent and climbed generally in New England and the Great Lakes region, where it's colder. Despite pleas from health officials, seventeen states now don't have masking requirements, even though the virus still kills roughly one thousand more Americans every day.\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY, M.D., MPH (CDC Director): I remain deeply concerned about this trajectory. Please take this moment very seriously.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: COVID also complicates the U.S. response along the Mexican border. The daily surge of more Central American arrivals, refugees from squalor and gun violence. A nine-year-old girl drowned last week trying to cross into Texas.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): We also saw a group of children who just today tested positive for COVID-19.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Images from congressmen show overcrowded border crossings. Packed facilities are challenged by COVID protocols. Unaccompanied children are allowed to stay, and hundreds have tested positive. FEMA is helping put up more temporary housing. Bob Fenton talked to us about the challenge.\u00a0ROBERT J. FENTON, JR. (Acting FEMA Administrator): So, we have to find the right facility. We need to have the staffing for the facility to be-- be able to feed and take care of them and provide the-- the wrap-around care services for them.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Officially, the Biden administration won't label its struggle to control the border a crisis. But no question COVID remains a continuing one in America.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: At mass vaccination sites like this one at Delta headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia this week became the sixth state to offer shots to anyone age sixteen and up. Universal eligibility--all adults, that is the goal. And more than forty states have committed to it by May 1st. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann, thank you.\u00a0We go now to the President's chief medical adviser, Doctor Anthony Fauci. Good morning to you, Doctor.\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI, M.D. (Chief Medical Adviser to President Biden/Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been warning all month that we are stuck. We are plateauing at a high level of infection. You just heard that Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, we're seeing spikes. What's driving these infections? Is it the new variants?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, you know, the variants are playing a part, but it is not completely the variants. What we're likely seeing is because of things like spring break and pulling back on the mitigation methods that you've seen. Now, several states have done that. I believe it's premature, Margaret, because when I've said many times to you that when you're coming down from a big peak and you reach a point and start to plateau, once you stay at that plateau, you're really in danger of a surge coming up. And, unfortunately, that's what we're starting to see. We got stuck at around fifty thousand new cases per day, went up to sixty thousand the other day. And that's really a risk. We've seen that in our own country. And that's exactly what's happened in Europe in several of the countries in the European Union where they plateaued and then started to come back. And that's why we say it really is almost a race between getting people vaccinated and having this peak that we may want to see. And we don't want to see that. And again, it isn't just the variants. Variants we take seriously and are concerned, but it is not only the variants that are doing that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC director said this week it is not the time to travel. What specifically is the problem with travel?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, when you see travel and-- and what-- and what Doctor Walensky was referring to is that whenever we see surges in travel, be that around the holidays or around certain-- certain situations like we did over the Christmas and New Year's holiday and other types of holidays, you get congregation of people. Even if on the planes people are wearing masks, when you get to the airport, the check-in lines, the food lines for restaurants, the boarding that you see, how people sometimes can be congregating together, those are the kind of things that invariably increase the risk of getting infected. That's what she was referring to. The travel phenomenon in general does that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: It's still high risk then? So when you were last with us--\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: Yeah. It is.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were last with us, you said that your expectation was that elementary school kids likely wouldn't be vaccinated until the first quarter of 2022. For parents who are trying to plan their summers, what does that mean? Can they send their kids to summer camp? Can they allow them to play again on playgrounds?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: You know it is conceivable that that will be possible, Margaret, because what we're seeing is, you know, as you just mentioned on the piece, we now have 3 to 3.5 million vaccinations each day. If we keep up at that pace, invariably, that's going to drive the rate and the level of infections per day to a much, much lower level. If we get into the summer and you have a considerable percentage of the-- of the population vaccinated and the level in the community gets below that plateau that's worrying me and my colleagues in public health, it is conceivable that you would have a good degree of flexibility during the summer, even with the children, with things like camps. We don't know that for sure, but I think that's an aspirational goal that we should go for.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So if parents are vaccinated, they still do need to be concerned about their unvaccinated children playing together in groups. Is that right?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: Yeah, the children can clearly wind up getting infected. When we talk about what you can do when you're vaccinated, you can certainly have members of a family if the adults are vaccinated and you're in the home with your child, you don't need to wear a mask and you can have physical contact. When the children go out into the community, you want them to continue to wear masks when they're interacting with groups from multiple households.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: People are excited about the return of big events. Baseball, for example, is coming back next week. When would you feel comfortable attending in a stadium?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: You know what I think you're going to see, Margaret, is you're going to see an incremental relaxation of some of the restrictions. Again, related to the question you asked me about camp for the kids. As we get into the late spring and early summer, we're going to have a greater proportion of the population that will have been vaccinated. As you mentioned in the beginning of the piece, there are fifty million people in this country that are fully vaccinated. That's a lot of people. And every day we get more and more. I would expect that as we get through the summer, late spring, early summer, there's going to be a relaxation where you're going to have more and more people who will be allowed into baseball parks, very likely separated with seating, very likely continuing to wear masks. As we get a really, really low level of infection, you're going to start seeing a pulling back on some of those restrictions. I hope and I think that's going to happen. I think if we do it correctly and we get the vaccines out at the rate we're doing that will happen.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What about you? You going back to a baseball park to throw out an opening pitch again this year?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, I certainly miss the Nats. I really am looking forward to this season. I hope that we have a situation where we can get out to the park and that we can get a limited number at first, but then more and more people into the ballpark.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I meant your-- your own pitching arm from-- from last year, but I'm just teasing you there. I want to ask you about this forthcoming report from the World Health Organization, but also, specifically, guidance from the chief of the World Health Organization this week who has endorsed this idea that intellectual property rights for pharmaceutical companies that produce pharma-- produce the COVID vaccines, that those should be waived. South Africa has asked for this. India has asked for this. Do you expect the White House to get on board and-- and waive patent protections for pharma companies?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, Margaret, I-- I can't go out and say what the White House is ultimately going to do. I can tell you that everything is on the table, discussions on every aspect of this. And, you know, we are playing a major role in helping other countries get vaccination. We have the four-billion-dollar pledge that we have going into this. We've joined COVAX. We have given away surplus types of vaccines to Mexico and to Canada. And we will be certainly seriously considering more. But with regard to the intellectual property, that's something we always will consider and keep that open.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We'll watch what happens in that space. On the report that's forthcoming from the World Health Organization, it's supposed to be about the origins of COVID. And the Biden administration has been clear that they are concerned that Beijing helped write it. I want to play for you a sound bite from a scientist named Doctor Jamie Metzl, who spoke to 60 MINUTES and said the WHO did not even ask for key samples of the virus.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0DR. JAMIE METZL (60 MINUTES): It was agreed first that China would have veto power over-- over who even got to be on the mission. Secondly--\u00a0LESLEY STAHL (60 MINUTES): And WHO agreed to that?\u00a0DR. JAMIE METZL: WHO agreed to that. On top of that the WHO agreed that in most instances China would do the primary investigation and then just share its findings with these international experts. So these international experts weren't allowed to do their own primary investigation.\u00a0LESLEY STAHL: Wait. You're saying that China did the investigation and showed the results to the committee, and that was it?\u00a0DR. JAMIE METZL: Pretty much that was it.\u00a0LESLEY STAHL: Woah.\u00a0DR. JAMIE METZL: Not entirely, but pretty much that was it. Imagine if we had asked the Soviet Union to do a co-investigation of Chernobyl. It doesn't really make sense.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect this World Health Organization report to be a whitewash?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, I don't know, Margaret. What I would like to do is first see the report. I think that's really important. You're getting a lot of conjecture around about what they did and what they were allowed to do or not. No one has been speaking specifically about that. When the report comes out, I'd like to take a really close look at that. And if, in fact, obviously there was a lot of restrictions on the ability of the people who went there to really take a look, then I'm going to have some considerable concern about that. But let me take a look at the report first.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What is your opinion on how COVID became so well adapted to humans?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, Margaret, that's an argument that goes back and forth. A-- a very plausible explanation for this is that this virus jumped from an animal host, a bat to maybe an intermediate host and then to a human. And we didn't see it, we being at first the Chinese. And it was under the radar screen. And we know that infections, many of them, are without symptoms. So it's entirely conceivable that it was spreading considerably for weeks, if not months, before we recognized it at the end of December, giving it plenty of time to adapt to a human. And that would really be completely consistent with just jumping species in the wild. The other theory that people have is that somehow it did that in a lab and it accidentally escaped. I mean those are just varying opinions. I think the most likely one that in nature, in the wild, it adapted itself.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. And-- and as you're acknowledging there, no evidence. We're still looking at it. We'll continue to following it. Doctor Fauci, thank you for your opinion and your perspective.\u00a0FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute with Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Now to the surge of migrants at the southern border. More than eighteen thousand unaccompanied children are being held in federal custody. Pictures from inside a Customs and Border Patrol facility in Donna, Texas, that you are seeing right now show children waiting to be processed, held in overcrowded conditions, sitting on the floor with foil blankets. These images have been shared with us by Congressman Henry Cuellar of Texas, a Democrat who joins us from Laredo. Good morning to you, Congressman.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR (D-Texas/@RepCuellar): Good morning to you, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about some of these pictures that you have shared with us and-- and start with some of the others, the pictures that we want to put up on screen right here. You say that they show dozens of young girls who have been held for far longer than the seventy-two-hour legal time limit. Why are these young girls being held for that long? Where are they going? What is their status?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Well, certainly, first of all, Border Patrol does not want to keep people there longer than seventy-two hours, but there's two issues-- two factors coming into play. One, there are so many number-- there's a large number of people coming across every single days--groups of over a hundred individuals coming in into the Border Patrol custody, number one. Number two, the flow through-- that is through HHS, they're moving and they're trying to get more shelters open. For example, the one in San Diego, the one in Carrizo Springs, San Antonio is going to have two places, different places. So they've got to flow those people out as soon as possible. And what we're seeing is at-- at first the priority was given to young boys. For example, Carrizo Springs has young boys from thirteen to seventeen. San Diego is-- is going to be now taking five hundred of the young girls-- or have taken that. They've been flown from there. They were supposed to fly out seven hundred, but only five hundred went out. So the other two hundred are part of the over five thousand individuals that they have only in the Rio Grande. And out of the five thousand plus that they have at the Rio Grande, sixty-five percent, about sixty-five percent are unaccompanied kids.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to put up on the screen some of the other pictures of families that you say are being detained under a bridge, it appears. They're being given foil blankets. You tell us this is a temporary processing site and that they are waiting to get into a holding facility. These look like families outside under the elements, are-- are all of the people we're seeing here, were they expelled from the U.S. or were they released into the U.S.?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Combination of two is what we see. Title 42, which is a 1944 law, the health-- public health rationale, is used mainly for seventy-one percent of the crossers which are single adults. There are some family units that have been returned to Mexico depending on the age of the kids that are with them. So what we're seeing is at that particular facilities, they might want to move them into another Border Patrol facility. And if they don't, this is what's happening. Some will be returned, but over two thousand of them have been released into the United States without a notice to appear. I emphasize, without a notice to appear at a immigration court. They're supposed to appear, show up, maybe in sixty days, report to a ICE office. This is unprecedented.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said this week that-- that the majority of people were to be expelled under Title 42. What you are saying and what Customs and Border Patrol has also said to-- to CBS News is that this is essentially not being fully enforced as he explained it. You're saying people are being released.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Well, adults are pretty much returned. You know seventy-one percent out of the one hundred thousand people that passed in-- in February are adults. Those are being returned, expelled back. Some family units are ex-- are turned back into Mexico depending on the age of the kids. Thirteen and above are being returned. I know the President's right about they're working with Mexico, so Mexico do more.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: But the rest of them, the family units--the family units are being released into the United States. That's where the burden of the border communities are felt. The cities, the counties, the NGOs. We're feeling the brunt of what's happening with the family units. Unaccompanied kids are different.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Those are taken under the HHS.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And I just want to point out that we're showing your photos because journalists are being blocked largely by the Biden administration from bringing our own cameras inside to do that firsthand reporting, which is why we've identified as being provided by you. On-- on the point you just made about Mexico, you've said you're hearing more from Mexico than you are from Washington. The president of Mexico said this week that President Biden created the expectations that migrants would be treated better here than they were under his predecessor. And that's what's feeding this. Do you think Mexico is just trying to use this as leverage right now over the United States? Is that why they are not accepting those families trying to be expelled back?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Well, I don't want to put any motives in the words of the Mexicans. They need to answer that. But I will tell you that they have started raids in the southern part where they've sent the National Guard. They've sent immigration officers where now they're trying to do more to stop people from coming across. And that is key. Roberta Jacobson knows this. She's a friend of mine. She's going to be concentrating on getting Mexico to do more. They can do more. I promise you. They can do more.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The vice president was handed this portfolio this week, along with some of the diplomatic initiatives. Have you spoken to her or her office about your concerns?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Not since November. I have spoken to Secretary Mayorkas. I've spoken to some folks at the White House, I've spoken to the CBP acting commissioner, I've talked-- talked to a lot of folks on the ground. But I-- certainly myself, the other congressmen down here, Congressman Vicente Gonzalez and of course, Vela, Congressman Filemon Vela, we all want to be helpful to the vice president. I'm glad that the President put the second-- the vice president in charge, because we need somebody that can look at the comprehensive view--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: --of what we're seeing here. It's-- it's not a simple solution.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: No.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: I grant that. But you've got to start from what we do in Central America, because remember--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: --we have, since 2016 to now, we've given them over 3.6 billion dollars--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: --appropriated money. Now some of that has been held because of some conditions--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: --that the Senate added. But we've got to help them.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congressman, we have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us today.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with more FACE THE NATION in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: On our latest Facing Forward podcast, I spoke with Rich Gelfond, the CEO of IMAX. You can subscribe on Apple Podcasts or on your favorite podcast platform.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We go now to Louisiana Congresswoman-elect Doctor Julia Letlow. Welcome to FACE THE NATION.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW (R-Louisiana/@jbletlow): Thank you so much for having me, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor, you are the first Republican congresswoman in Louisiana's history, and you won your seat in a special election that was held after your husband. Luke Letlow recently passed away from COVID in December. And I'm wondering how that experience firsthand with COVID is going to inform your work here in Washington.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DR. JULIA LETLOW: Well, it's definitely going to inform my work. You know, I just want to take a second to acknowledge all of the Americans out there who have lost loved ones to COVID. I want to say that I-- I see you. I hear you. I, most importantly, pray with you. I'm a huge proponent of the vaccine. It has lifesaving capabilities. And I want to encourage anybody out there who's eligible to go ahead and get that vaccine. It's so important.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's a resonant message coming from you, not just because of your personal experience, but also, I mean, frankly, looking at your district. Louisiana is going to open up eligibility on Monday, right? For everyone sixteen and up. One group, though--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: That's right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But every-- but we're seeing in our own polling, though, is a new level of hesitation among self-identified Republicans sixty-five and younger. So when you were speaking to voters, what is your message to them about why they should trust this vaccine?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: That's right, that's why I want to be an advocate and a voice for-- for everyone. Look at my family, use my story. You know I experienced a tragedy in my immediate family and COVID can touch every family out there. And so, you know, there is a vaccine that has lifesaving capabilities. I want to encourage everyone to trust it and get the vaccine.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you spoke with former President Trump. You also received a phone call from President Biden who talked to you about your loss. Can you share with us anything about that phone call?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: Sure. They were both so gracious and expressed their condolences and President Biden, you know, who is no stranger to loss, as well as shared with me that he understood the pain that I was walking through and that it will get better. And I know it will.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I know we all hope it certainly does for you, and you have a lot of business to carry on on behalf of your constituents when you get here. I mean looking at your district, you have one of the highest poverty rates in the country, about twenty-five percent. You've said for you a priority is expanding broadband access infrastructure. That's high on President Biden's list. Does that mean as a Republican in the House, you are going to get on board with his proposals?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: Well, I'm definitely going to get on board with any proposal that is going to provide rural broadband to my district. Just like you said we have some of the highest poverty rates in the nation right here. My background is in higher education. I believe if you can educate a child, you give them a future. And so I want to champion education all the way from early childhood K through twelve, our underutilized trade schools and community colleges to our four-year institutions. And there's nothing like a pandemic, Margaret, to bring to light how vital rural broadband is in educating our children, but also providing health care to the constituents in my district.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So there has already been apprehension. The bill hasn't even been proposed yet. You know it's just being talked about. But the price tag on it, you know, another two trillion or more. Does this mean as a Republican, you would vote for anything that would expand broadband access?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: Well, I would definitely have to take a close look at the bill. You know I'm not up there yet, so I would definitely have to analyze it. But I'm going to be looking for avenues to find a way to expand rural broadband in my district. So I'll look at everything that's on the table.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You are joining a record-breaking number of women in the House of Representatives. When we looked at Louisiana, it's at around the bottom of the country when it comes to equal pay for women, particularly black women, it's about forty-seven cents on the dollar. Latina women about fifty-two cents. Women writ large, about seventy-four cents. Is addressing pay equity a priority for you?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: It's definitely something that I will look into. I believe women should be paid equitably, but I am so proud to be the first Republican woman elected to represent the state of Louisiana. You know, when you look at our-- the population, the makeup of Louisiana, roughly fifty-two percent is female. Every issue is a woman's issue. And so it's a wonderful opportunity for Louisiana to have a woman to have a seat at the table.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be watching what you do with that. I want to ask you to-- just to share some of your personal experience. You-- you talked about your personal loss here. And I know when we looked at your background, you've experienced quite a lot of grief in your life. You also lost your seventeen-year-old brother in a car accident when he was in college. You wrote a thesis and a dissertation on grief itself. What is your lesson, as you said, for those who have lost during this pandemic? How do you continue moving forward, as you did with, you know, bringing your children here to Washington, continuing to push forward with a career in the mass of-- of such a loss?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: That's right. Well, you know, I happen to be a woman of faith. I believe that the Lord doesn't waste an experience good or bad. And so all of those experiences that I've had prior, even writing a dissertation, just like you said, on finding meaning after the loss of a family member, is helping guide me through. You know, one of the findings of my dissertation was that when a person can get outside of themselves during the grieving process and find ways to serve others, that can actually be cathartic in-- in helping guide them through the grieving process. So I just see everything in my life and in my marriage has led me to this one moment in time. I am so honored and excited to serve the people of the Fifth District.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman-elect, we will be watching. Thank you for joining us today.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Most regions of the world are seeing an increase in COVID infections as highly contagious variants continue to spread. The World Health Organization called it a worrying sign. Senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports from Tel Aviv.\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@CBSLizpalmer): Good morning. Israel, where I am, has now vaccinated almost three-quarters of adults over sixteen years old. And the effect has been dramatic. The number of people who died, on average every day last week, was down to twelve.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: By contrast, Europe is in big trouble. Czechs stopped for a minute of silence on Monday, a year after the first COVID patient died there. In the Old Town Square, white crosses marked the lives lost so far, and now deaths are climbing again. Most European countries are either heading for or are in a third wave of infection that German health authorities warned could be the worst yet. Europe's vaccine rollout has been crippled by politics and supply problems, but it isn't last accelerating with temporary centers springing up everywhere, including this French velodrome. And three new vaccine manufacturing sites have just been approved, which will also help. Then there is Brazil, now responsible for a quarter of COVID deaths worldwide every day. Regional governments have closed beaches, restricted traffic, and told people to stay home. Medical teams are doing their best, but poverty, disinformation, and a more contagious variant means eighty thousand new cases every day. And a warning that Brazil may end up with more coronavirus deaths overall even than the United States.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: As for the World Health Organization report by the team that had traveled to China to look for the origins of the virus has been much delayed, once again it was due out on Friday. So far no sign of it. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz, thank you.\u00a0We go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, he sits on the board of Pfizer as well as Illumina, and he joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree with Doctor Fauci in terms of his projections on where we are headed with this sort of stuck at about sixty thousand infections a day level?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: You know we've now vaccinated ninety-two million Americans. It's about twenty-eight percent of the public. About fifty million have been fully vaccinated, that's fifteen percent. Israel started to see the big declines in cases when they hit about twenty-five percent of their population vaccinated. So I think that's a pretty big backstop against a true fourth surge. What we're seeing around the nation right now, which is worrisome, are outbreaks in certain states, Michigan, the metro Detroit area, Boston around Massachusetts, the Tri-State Region, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, are experiencing an upsurge of infection. And I think what we need to do is try to continue to vaccinate, surge vaccine into those parts of the country. So the incremental vaccine that's coming onto the market, I think the Bush administration can allocate it to parts of the country that look hot right now. But if we could just get two or three more weeks of around three million vaccines a day, that's going to be a pretty big backstop, against a true fourth surge.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, three-- three million a day or so, the president's benchmark was two hundred million by the end of April. We're already at a hundred and forty. So that is it sounds like you're saying, a very hittable target, but how do you overcome that sort of last hurdle of-- of skepticism, particularly among Republicans? I mean is the government going to be the best-- best messenger in this case?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: They won't be. And you need to get the vaccine into community sites that have relationships with patients and get it into more doctor's offices, get it into pharmacies. You know, the administration is starting to push a lot of vaccine out through different channels. They've given the pharmacies a big role. They'll be marketing the vaccine very aggressively. They're going to community sites, community health centers. So that's what we should be doing. They're going to start vaccinating patients who present to dialysis centers. We should be vaccinating patients on discharge from the hospital, patients who go into infusion sites. So we should be looking at every single interaction that patients have with the medical system and trying to offer a vaccination at those points of care through a provider that patients know. That's ultimately how we're going to get some people who are more hesitant about being vaccinated to take up the vaccine.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: People you trust, not necessarily people you would-- celebrities.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Exactly.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: On the World Health Organization, I-- I want to add--nothing against celebrity endorsements of vaccines--on the World Health Organization and what Doctor Fauci was saying, I know you must be looking at this. He said, yes, the White House is talking about it, but he has no indication of what policies there might be regarding patent protections and pharmaceutical companies who make COVID vaccines. The World Health Organization chief has endorsed this idea of-- of lifting it in order to help some developing countries get access. What is the implication if that happens?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think the implication is you're going to provide disincentives to the future, but the reality is just looking at the practicality of it, the rate-limiting step here is not the intellectual property around these vaccines. These companies are producing, including Pfizer, the company I'm on the board of, as much as they can. The rate limiting factor here, the raw ingredients, the inputs to making those vaccines. There's just a limited global supply of those highly specialized inputs. If you appropriate the intellectual property and give it to a bunch of other companies to try to make these vaccines, they're not going to be able to make them efficiently. And they're not going to be able to stand up the supply because they don't have the supply chain either. If they manage to secure, it is just going to come at the expense of companies like Pfizer, Moderna that are making these vaccines far more efficiently. I think what we have to be doing is trying to get more resources into expanding that manufacturing capacity. This really is an opportunity for President Biden to do what President Bush did around the PEPFAR program and create a global campaign to try to supply vaccine around the world using the U.S. intellectual property. These companies have already donated vaccine. They'd be willing to provide more to low- and middle-income countries if the U.S. government would backstop some of the legal protections around doing that. So there are opportunities here to dramatically expand global supply. Unfortunately, I think just giving away our intellectual property is going to be an empty promise. It's not going to result in more vaccine in these countries.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So when someone looks at what Liz Palmer was just describing happen in Brazil with this surge where it seems almost uncontrolled within their borders, this is not something you would point to as a solution to surge vaccine into a-- a problem country.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It would be a solution. Right now we don't have the supply to do that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think we can get the supply, but not in time probably for Brazil. And Brazil has been reluctant to take up the vaccine. That's part of the problem, too, is policy failure down there.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to the World Health Organization report on the origins of this, you and I have spoken about this in the past. We've had Matt Pottinger, the former deputy national security adviser to President Trump on. I know Doctor Redfield has spoken to CNN, the former CDC director, about his theories on the origin of COVID. To be clear here, when it comes to this report, you've said you believe the most likely scenario on the origins of COVID was that it was just bouncing back and forth between people and animals for a period of time and finally broke out. But you said the lab theory is never going to be fully dispelled and the World Health Organization shouldn't walk away from that so easily. Do you expect them to walk away from that when this report comes out?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It looks like the WHO report was an attempt to try to support the China narrative, Chinese narrative around this-- this origin of the vaccine. You know, the lab leak theory doesn't seem like a plausible theory unless you aggregate the biggest collection of coronaviruses and put them in a lab, a minimum-security lab in the middle of a densely populated center and experiment on animals, which is exactly what the Wuhan Institute of Virology did. They were using these viruses in a BSL-2 lab and, we now know, infecting animals. So that creates the opportunity for a lab leak. It might not be the most likely scenario on how this virus got out, but it has to remain a scenario. And I think at the end of the day, we're never going to fully discharge that possibility. What we're going to have here is a battle of competing narratives.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. And we will continue to cover it. Thank you very much, Doctor Gottlieb, for your analysis.\u00a0We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Tony Capuano, CEO of the world's largest hotel company, Marriott International. He joins us from Bethesda, Maryland. Good morning.\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO (Marriott International CEO): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We just heard Doctor Fauci say that travel remains high risk, and yet we see numbers from TSA reporting people are getting on planes in-- in record numbers, in terms of the pandemic. Are you seeing a similar surge in spring bookings?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: We are seeing pretty significant acceleration of demand. The reality is people are traveling, which is why we can't let our guard down. We've got to continue to adhere to the CDC protocols and keep our cleaning and operating protocols in place.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So vaccination, you have said, is going to be key to business, to the economy reopening it. You have actually opened a program to try to incentivize your employees to take that vaccine by offering them, what, four hours of pay. Why did you need to give that incentive? And is it working?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: We didn't need to. We chose to. Our culture is very much an employee-first culture, and we wanted to make sure they had access to education about the vaccinations and the flexibility to take time off work if they chose to get vaccinated.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So that four hours of pay is to allow them to take the time off work to get the shot in the arm?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: That's correct.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So last March, your predecessor said the financial impact of the pandemic was on par with 9/11, the-- the Great Recession, and the financial crisis around that time. Marriott cut thousands of jobs. You lost about two hundred and seventy-six million dollars. When do you expect to get back to that pre-pandemic level of both jobs and business?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: It really depends on demand recovery. And demand recovery will be driven by consumer confidence. The good news is we have such great visibility into real-time data. In certain markets where the vacc-- the-- the virus containment seems to be proceeding well and where you're seeing broad distribution of vaccine, we are seeing demand recover and that's allowing us to bring many of our employees back.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So demand is up, Arizona, Texas and Florida I see. But it's still low in some of the big cities. Is that a trend you think is going to stay with us for some time?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: We'll continue to see growth in demand in drive-to destinations and I think leisure destinations. One of the really interesting phenomenon we've seen over the last year is a blending of trip purposes. People have learned that they can, in fact, work from almost anywhere. And as a result we're seeing our guests combine business travel with leisure travel.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Gas prices aren't going to impact those drive-to destination bookings?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: Certainly, they'll have some measure of impact, but we've really not seen it yet. There is enormous pent-up demand and because of concerns about safety, we continue to see lots of appeal of drive-to destinations.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know when we look at the jobless rate in the country your industry is so frequently turned-- pointed to as one of the biggest places of losses, particularly for women. I'm wondering of all the adaptations that you have had to make in your hotels for safety reasons and protocols with, you know, not checking in in-person, but doing it on your phone or doing it, you know, digitally, haven't you managed your way towards just needing to employ fewer people? I mean are these jobs actually coming back?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: In markets where demand is recovering, we're absolutely seeing those jobs come back and in many of the markets you described we're actively hiring. I think what those technological advances allow us to do is really engage our employees more in interacting with the guests and meeting their needs.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So desk clerk is not a job that's going to disappear?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: Absolutely not.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: In New York state, they're kind of experimenting with something I'm interested in getting your view on, which is this idea of having some kind of vaccine passport, so to speak, some kind of digital stamp to show that you have been vaccinated. Is this something that you think business-wise you would encourage other states to adopt? I mean would it help give you some reassurance?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: Time will tell what the right platform is. What we know with certainty, however, is a global, coordinated, reliable health credential system will be key to giving folks comfort about traveling to-- and to giving jurisdictions comfort in opening their borders.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But who is going to run that since the states are administering these vaccine programs? You know the-- the particulars of how you actually get this up and running are-- are kind of a big stumbling point.\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: It's the right question to ask. I-- I worry a bit that the approach to date is a bit fragmented. And, again, we need a comprehensive and global solution for it to be effective.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you talked to the White House about that?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: We're in active discussions with the administration with our industry colleagues to try and identify opportunities to inform borders as they consider opening.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, two dozen or so industry groups wrote a letter to the White House pushing for international travel to be reopened by this summer, saying that's really key time frame for them. Do you have any indication that any of the travel restrictions will be lifted, that international travel will return?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: It really varies by jurisdiction. We know there's enormous pent-up demand for international travel and we know those destinations, like many European cities, are struggling mightily because they rely so heavily on inbound international travel. The markets that have recovered most quickly are those that have depths of demand domestically. So we've seen that in drive-to destinations in the U.S. and we've seen it across China.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But no promise from the White House? We're lifting the travel restrictions on countries by the summer. Nothing yet?\u00a0ANTHONY CAPUANO: Not yet.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Not yet. All right. Thank you very much, Tony Capuano, for your time and your perspective.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. And before we go, we did want to extend a thank you to broadcast producer, Jillian Hughes, who is leaving our program and our network. She will be missed. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "article_content": "After being banned by most large social networks in January, former President Donald Trump is planning a dramatic return to social media. According to his close advisers, the former president is on the verge of launching a Trump-branded social network to compete with Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the former president, remarked on the Fox News program \u00a0#MediaBuzz that Mr. Trump is holding \"high-powered meetings\" with \"numerous companies\" to build a social network for \"tens of millions of people.\" Another Trump adviser, Corey Lewandowski, told Newsmax host Joe Pinion that the Trump social media site will launch in \"three to four months\" and will be a place for people to \"communicate in a free format without fear of reprisal or being canceled.\"\u00a0 Miller and Lewandowski did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\u00a0 While in office, Mr. Trump often complained, without evidence, about alleged censorship by technology firms. As his false claims about voter fraud escalated during the 2020 presidential campaign, the large social networks started attaching fact-check labels to his posts. \"The choices that Twitter makes when it chooses to suppress, edit, blacklist, shadow, ban are editorial decisions, pure and simple,\" Mr. Trump said last May, after signing an executive order calling for revisions to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the regulation that shields tech platforms from liability for user-generated content.\u00a0 But is it possible for the Trump team to develop a technologically robust and secure new social media platform in less than a year? CBS News spoke with developers, engineers, project managers and executives. Each shared unique insights about the technical, logistical, economic and human challenges the Trump effort \u2014 or any new startup \u2014 faces in trying to compete with tech incumbents. Most said yes, Mr. Trump can set up a good-looking, functional social media site. But they saw definite limits. \"The bar is gonna be sooooo low for those users,\" said one former Google community manager. \"It'll be like Trump's personalized OnlyFans, the exclusive place to get access to his special brand. He'll have no pressure to monetize, except for political fundraising. He won't worry about investors or an IPO. Doubtful he'll worry about content moderation, and bots are gonna be plentiful. The brand value of that is significant.\" But can Mr. Trump attract top-tier tech talent who will maintain, grow and secure the site?\u00a0 \"Will it scale? Doubt it,\" he said. Here's why the experts say Trump tech might be buggy. Each expert said the Trump team can probably build a new social network in less than a year because programming a social media site is relatively simple. Most of the front-end website and mobile app code that users interact with \u2014 languages like C++, Python, JavaScript, PHP and Swift, for example \u2014 is free and reasonably easy to learn. \"Anyone can, and should, learn to code,\" said Bryson Bort, CEO of cybersecurity firm Scythe. \"But not being able to use cloud infrastructure is going to be a real problem \u2014 cloud providers have earned their reputation with scalable technical expertise, not just words. Cloud services provide a good measure of service continuity and performance. There is a lot built into a cloud service, as opposed to the DIY approach of building your own server farm.\"\u00a0 One tech executive, who chose not to share his name because he didn't want his comments to be perceived as partisan, said that Mr. Trump's biggest challenge will be developing technological infrastructure. The large social networks, he said, are not just websites and apps. \"These companies are innovators that develop, test and deploy new technologies. Some tech companies are worth billions of dollars because they innovated and can attract millions of users. Trump can attract his base, but he can't innovate in the same way. He will literally have to rely on tech built by other companies.\" While Mr. Trump could use second-tier hosting providers, like SkySilk, the firm that provides hosting for the alternative social network Parler, his capacity to host \"tens of millions of users\" will be limited.\u00a0 \"He might try with Cloudflare,\" said another tech executive, referring to the ubiquitous hosting company, \"but it's doubtful they will do much more than provide hosting.\" Cloudflare did not respond to a request for comment. A third executive speculated that of the major cloud service providers, \"only Oracle could be politically aligned to service his needs. Once that is done, then he has to worry about building the software that is consumer-friendly and without any privacy and security bugs, which unfortunately takes an experienced team.\" \"Trump's team is following the right hunch,\" said Amy Webb, CEO of the Future Today Institute. \"There is a new paradigm in how social networks will be built, deployed and moderated. But kludging together a Twitter clone to win back the attention he commanded won't be successful or sustainable. If they were intent on building a long-lasting network that is obsessively user-focused, then they need to anticipate the future use cases for social media.\"\u00a0 Every tech expert who commented for this story remarked that scaling a new technology is hard, but it's far easier than acquiring and retaining top tech talent. Each warned about underestimating the scale of big tech, an industry that is populated by thousands of the word's best engineers. \"Human problems are harder than tech problems,\" said one executive. \"Look, no matter what you feel about Trump's politics, his policies \u2014 especially regarding H1B visas, which our industry relies on \u2014 his immigration policies pretty much cut off his access to top tech talent. You want cut-rate programmers? You can find cheap development talent. And you'll get a product to match.\" Even programmers who agree with Mr. Trump's politics would be loath to give up real money for a \"fake website,\" said one programmer who spent time at a startup currently exploring an IPO. Several questioned Mr. Trump's ability to delegate responsibility and focus, and noted that a competitive technology site needs a knowledgeable leadership team including a chief technology officer and chief information and security officer. A Trump site is going to get hacked, said Bryson Bort.\u00a0 \"It's likely that a social media network backed by Trump would be a plum target for a whole list of attackers, from other countries to hacktivists just trying to take it down with denial of service attacks,\" Bort said. \"The more the Trump team tries to go this on their own instead of using industry-leading best practices, the more likely they're going to get hacked.\" A security professional at Microsoft predicted Mr. Trump will have big problems attracting cybersecurity professionals because he burned bridges in the industry. \"Few people in the [information security] industry have more credibility than Krebs,\" remarked the manager, referring to Chris Krebs, a lifelong Republican who was in charge of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency until President Trump fired him for disputing the false claim that the election was stolen.\u00a0 \"If you can't trust Chris, who will you trust?\" the manager said. Tech is a bit like politics, said the former Google manager who worked on Google+, the company's social network that was shuttered in 2019. \"Incumbents are hard to beat. We were overconfident and thought we'd beat Facebook because Google invested gobs of resources. But no one associated us with social media, while Facebook was the market leader. Facebook won because social media is what they do.\" When asked if a Trump social network could compete in a crowded consumer technology market, the manager responded, \"lol.\" Dan Patterson is a reporter for CBS News.

And this week on FACE THE NATION, as President Biden prepares to unveil the next phase of his economic agenda, the continuing threat of COVID and a growing crisis at the border may complicate his plans. Health officials are warning Americans the virus could be heading in the wrong direction as new cases of COVID continue to plateau at high levels every day. ROCHELLE WALENSKY: If we don't control things now, there is a real potential for the epidemic curve to soar again. MARGARET BRENNAN: It comes as President Biden sets new ambitious vaccine goals, promising two hundred million shots in his first one hundred days. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Twice our original goal. But no other country in the world has even come close. MARGARET BRENNAN: Can we vaccinate quickly enough to put the pandemic to rest? We'll check in with Doctor Anthony Fauci and former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. And the dire situation along the U.S.-Mexico border. A surge of migrants has overwhelmed some shelters in the region. The President grew defensive when pressed by reporters. CECILIA VEGA: Is what's happening inside acceptable to you? And when is this going to be fixed? PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: That's a serious question, right? Is it acceptable to me? Come on. That's why we're going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. MARGARET BRENNAN: Republicans have identified their culprit. SENATOR TED CRUZ: It is a crisis that was created by the Biden administration, by their own policies. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lawmakers leak their own images while journalists are barred from visiting many of the overcrowded facilities. We'll hear from Congressman Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from Texas, who shared with us these new exclusive photos from inside a holding facility. We'll also hear from Doctor Julia Letlow. She was just elected to Congress, replacing her late husband who passed away from COVID last year. Plus, fewer industries were hit harder by this pandemic than tourism and travel. What's the roadmap for recovery? We'll speak with the CEO of Marriott International, Tony Capuano. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. This weekend the race to vaccinate America marks a new milestone: The daily number of doses administered is at a record level. Despite that ramp up in vaccinations, infections are also on the rise in thirty states, plus, Washington, DC. We begin with senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann. (Begin VT) (Crowd cheering) MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): COVID immunity. To these California seniors it's a shot of liberation in the season of renewal. MAN: It gives you a feeling of normalcy again. MARK STRASSMANN: On Saturday alone nearly 3.5 million Americans got the COVID vaccine, a single day record. Across the country more than fifty million adults, roughly one in five, now fully vaccinated. Clearly, it's progress. Now here comes the disclaimer. WOMAN: Too many people feel like the pandemic is over. MARK STRASSMANN: Immunologists worry with the vaccine we're confusing immunity with invulnerability. TSA agents now screen more than one million fliers every day, including many returning spring breakers. NED LAMONT: Watch out for Miami Beach. Get tested before you come back. MARK STRASSMANN: In Michigan, new cases over the last week jumped more than fifty percent and climbed generally in New England and the Great Lakes region, where it's colder. Despite pleas from health officials, seventeen states now don't have masking requirements, even though the virus still kills roughly one thousand more Americans every day. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, M.D., MPH (CDC Director): I remain deeply concerned about this trajectory. Please take this moment very seriously. MARK STRASSMANN: COVID also complicates the U.S. response along the Mexican border. The daily surge of more Central American arrivals, refugees from squalor and gun violence. A nine-year-old girl drowned last week trying to cross into Texas. SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): We also saw a group of children who just today tested positive for COVID-19. MARK STRASSMANN: Images from congressmen show overcrowded border crossings. Packed facilities are challenged by COVID protocols. Unaccompanied children are allowed to stay, and hundreds have tested positive. FEMA is helping put up more temporary housing. Bob Fenton talked to us about the challenge. ROBERT J. FENTON, JR. (Acting FEMA Administrator): So, we have to find the right facility. We need to have the staffing for the facility to be-- be able to feed and take care of them and provide the-- the wrap-around care services for them. MARK STRASSMANN: Officially, the Biden administration won't label its struggle to control the border a crisis. But no question COVID remains a continuing one in America. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: At mass vaccination sites like this one at Delta headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia this week became the sixth state to offer shots to anyone age sixteen and up. Universal eligibility--all adults, that is the goal. And more than forty states have committed to it by May 1st. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann, thank you. We go now to the President's chief medical adviser, Doctor Anthony Fauci. Good morning to you, Doctor. ANTHONY FAUCI, M.D. (Chief Medical Adviser to President Biden/Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have been warning all month that we are stuck. We are plateauing at a high level of infection. You just heard that Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, we're seeing spikes. What's driving these infections? Is it the new variants? ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, you know, the variants are playing a part, but it is not completely the variants. What we're likely seeing is because of things like spring break and pulling back on the mitigation methods that you've seen. Now, several states have done that. I believe it's premature, Margaret, because when I've said many times to you that when you're coming down from a big peak and you reach a point and start to plateau, once you stay at that plateau, you're really in danger of a surge coming up. And, unfortunately, that's what we're starting to see. We got stuck at around fifty thousand new cases per day, went up to sixty thousand the other day. And that's really a risk. We've seen that in our own country. And that's exactly what's happened in Europe in several of the countries in the European Union where they plateaued and then started to come back. And that's why we say it really is almost a race between getting people vaccinated and having this peak that we may want to see. And we don't want to see that. And again, it isn't just the variants. Variants we take seriously and are concerned, but it is not only the variants that are doing that. MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC director said this week it is not the time to travel. What specifically is the problem with travel? ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, when you see travel and-- and what-- and what Doctor Walensky was referring to is that whenever we see surges in travel, be that around the holidays or around certain-- certain situations like we did over the Christmas and New Year's holiday and other types of holidays, you get congregation of people. Even if on the planes people are wearing masks, when you get to the airport, the check-in lines, the food lines for restaurants, the boarding that you see, how people sometimes can be congregating together, those are the kind of things that invariably increase the risk of getting infected. That's what she was referring to. The travel phenomenon in general does that. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's still high risk then? So when you were last with us-- ANTHONY FAUCI: Yeah. It is. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were last with us, you said that your expectation was that elementary school kids likely wouldn't be vaccinated until the first quarter of 2022. For parents who are trying to plan their summers, what does that mean? Can they send their kids to summer camp? Can they allow them to play again on playgrounds? ANTHONY FAUCI: You know it is conceivable that that will be possible, Margaret, because what we're seeing is, you know, as you just mentioned on the piece, we now have 3 to 3.5 million vaccinations each day. If we keep up at that pace, invariably, that's going to drive the rate and the level of infections per day to a much, much lower level. If we get into the summer and you have a considerable percentage of the-- of the population vaccinated and the level in the community gets below that plateau that's worrying me and my colleagues in public health, it is conceivable that you would have a good degree of flexibility during the summer, even with the children, with things like camps. We don't know that for sure, but I think that's an aspirational goal that we should go for. MARGARET BRENNAN: So if parents are vaccinated, they still do need to be concerned about their unvaccinated children playing together in groups. Is that right? ANTHONY FAUCI: Yeah, the children can clearly wind up getting infected. When we talk about what you can do when you're vaccinated, you can certainly have members of a family if the adults are vaccinated and you're in the home with your child, you don't need to wear a mask and you can have physical contact. When the children go out into the community, you want them to continue to wear masks when they're interacting with groups from multiple households. MARGARET BRENNAN: People are excited about the return of big events. Baseball, for example, is coming back next week. When would you feel comfortable attending in a stadium? ANTHONY FAUCI: You know what I think you're going to see, Margaret, is you're going to see an incremental relaxation of some of the restrictions. Again, related to the question you asked me about camp for the kids. As we get into the late spring and early summer, we're going to have a greater proportion of the population that will have been vaccinated. As you mentioned in the beginning of the piece, there are fifty million people in this country that are fully vaccinated. That's a lot of people. And every day we get more and more. I would expect that as we get through the summer, late spring, early summer, there's going to be a relaxation where you're going to have more and more people who will be allowed into baseball parks, very likely separated with seating, very likely continuing to wear masks. As we get a really, really low level of infection, you're going to start seeing a pulling back on some of those restrictions. I hope and I think that's going to happen. I think if we do it correctly and we get the vaccines out at the rate we're doing that will happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about you? You going back to a baseball park to throw out an opening pitch again this year? ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, I certainly miss the Nats. I really am looking forward to this season. I hope that we have a situation where we can get out to the park and that we can get a limited number at first, but then more and more people into the ballpark. MARGARET BRENNAN: I meant your-- your own pitching arm from-- from last year, but I'm just teasing you there. I want to ask you about this forthcoming report from the World Health Organization, but also, specifically, guidance from the chief of the World Health Organization this week who has endorsed this idea that intellectual property rights for pharmaceutical companies that produce pharma-- produce the COVID vaccines, that those should be waived. South Africa has asked for this. India has asked for this. Do you expect the White House to get on board and-- and waive patent protections for pharma companies? ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, Margaret, I-- I can't go out and say what the White House is ultimately going to do. I can tell you that everything is on the table, discussions on every aspect of this. And, you know, we are playing a major role in helping other countries get vaccination. We have the four-billion-dollar pledge that we have going into this. We've joined COVAX. We have given away surplus types of vaccines to Mexico and to Canada. And we will be certainly seriously considering more. But with regard to the intellectual property, that's something we always will consider and keep that open. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We'll watch what happens in that space. On the report that's forthcoming from the World Health Organization, it's supposed to be about the origins of COVID. And the Biden administration has been clear that they are concerned that Beijing helped write it. I want to play for you a sound bite from a scientist named Doctor Jamie Metzl, who spoke to 60 MINUTES and said the WHO did not even ask for key samples of the virus. (Begin VT) DR. JAMIE METZL (60 MINUTES): It was agreed first that China would have veto power over-- over who even got to be on the mission. Secondly-- LESLEY STAHL (60 MINUTES): And WHO agreed to that? DR. JAMIE METZL: WHO agreed to that. On top of that the WHO agreed that in most instances China would do the primary investigation and then just share its findings with these international experts. So these international experts weren't allowed to do their own primary investigation. LESLEY STAHL: Wait. You're saying that China did the investigation and showed the results to the committee, and that was it? DR. JAMIE METZL: Pretty much that was it. LESLEY STAHL: Woah. DR. JAMIE METZL: Not entirely, but pretty much that was it. Imagine if we had asked the Soviet Union to do a co-investigation of Chernobyl. It doesn't really make sense. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect this World Health Organization report to be a whitewash? ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, I don't know, Margaret. What I would like to do is first see the report. I think that's really important. You're getting a lot of conjecture around about what they did and what they were allowed to do or not. No one has been speaking specifically about that. When the report comes out, I'd like to take a really close look at that. And if, in fact, obviously there was a lot of restrictions on the ability of the people who went there to really take a look, then I'm going to have some considerable concern about that. But let me take a look at the report first. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is your opinion on how COVID became so well adapted to humans? ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, Margaret, that's an argument that goes back and forth. A-- a very plausible explanation for this is that this virus jumped from an animal host, a bat to maybe an intermediate host and then to a human. And we didn't see it, we being at first the Chinese. And it was under the radar screen. And we know that infections, many of them, are without symptoms. So it's entirely conceivable that it was spreading considerably for weeks, if not months, before we recognized it at the end of December, giving it plenty of time to adapt to a human. And that would really be completely consistent with just jumping species in the wild. The other theory that people have is that somehow it did that in a lab and it accidentally escaped. I mean those are just varying opinions. I think the most likely one that in nature, in the wild, it adapted itself. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. And-- and as you're acknowledging there, no evidence. We're still looking at it. We'll continue to following it. Doctor Fauci, thank you for your opinion and your perspective. FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute with Texas Congressman Henry Cuellar. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Now to the surge of migrants at the southern border. More than eighteen thousand unaccompanied children are being held in federal custody. Pictures from inside a Customs and Border Patrol facility in Donna, Texas, that you are seeing right now show children waiting to be processed, held in overcrowded conditions, sitting on the floor with foil blankets. These images have been shared with us by Congressman Henry Cuellar of Texas, a Democrat who joins us from Laredo. Good morning to you, Congressman. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR (D-Texas/@RepCuellar): Good morning to you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about some of these pictures that you have shared with us and-- and start with some of the others, the pictures that we want to put up on screen right here. You say that they show dozens of young girls who have been held for far longer than the seventy-two-hour legal time limit. Why are these young girls being held for that long? Where are they going? What is their status? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Well, certainly, first of all, Border Patrol does not want to keep people there longer than seventy-two hours, but there's two issues-- two factors coming into play. One, there are so many number-- there's a large number of people coming across every single days--groups of over a hundred individuals coming in into the Border Patrol custody, number one. Number two, the flow through-- that is through HHS, they're moving and they're trying to get more shelters open. For example, the one in San Diego, the one in Carrizo Springs, San Antonio is going to have two places, different places. So they've got to flow those people out as soon as possible. And what we're seeing is at-- at first the priority was given to young boys. For example, Carrizo Springs has young boys from thirteen to seventeen. San Diego is-- is going to be now taking five hundred of the young girls-- or have taken that. They've been flown from there. They were supposed to fly out seven hundred, but only five hundred went out. So the other two hundred are part of the over five thousand individuals that they have only in the Rio Grande. And out of the five thousand plus that they have at the Rio Grande, sixty-five percent, about sixty-five percent are unaccompanied kids. MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to put up on the screen some of the other pictures of families that you say are being detained under a bridge, it appears. They're being given foil blankets. You tell us this is a temporary processing site and that they are waiting to get into a holding facility. These look like families outside under the elements, are-- are all of the people we're seeing here, were they expelled from the U.S. or were they released into the U.S.? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Combination of two is what we see. Title 42, which is a 1944 law, the health-- public health rationale, is used mainly for seventy-one percent of the crossers which are single adults. There are some family units that have been returned to Mexico depending on the age of the kids that are with them. So what we're seeing is at that particular facilities, they might want to move them into another Border Patrol facility. And if they don't, this is what's happening. Some will be returned, but over two thousand of them have been released into the United States without a notice to appear. I emphasize, without a notice to appear at a immigration court. They're supposed to appear, show up, maybe in sixty days, report to a ICE office. This is unprecedented. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said this week that-- that the majority of people were to be expelled under Title 42. What you are saying and what Customs and Border Patrol has also said to-- to CBS News is that this is essentially not being fully enforced as he explained it. You're saying people are being released. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Well, adults are pretty much returned. You know seventy-one percent out of the one hundred thousand people that passed in-- in February are adults. Those are being returned, expelled back. Some family units are ex-- are turned back into Mexico depending on the age of the kids. Thirteen and above are being returned. I know the President's right about they're working with Mexico, so Mexico do more. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: But the rest of them, the family units--the family units are being released into the United States. That's where the burden of the border communities are felt. The cities, the counties, the NGOs. We're feeling the brunt of what's happening with the family units. Unaccompanied kids are different. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Those are taken under the HHS. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I just want to point out that we're showing your photos because journalists are being blocked largely by the Biden administration from bringing our own cameras inside to do that firsthand reporting, which is why we've identified as being provided by you. On-- on the point you just made about Mexico, you've said you're hearing more from Mexico than you are from Washington. The president of Mexico said this week that President Biden created the expectations that migrants would be treated better here than they were under his predecessor. And that's what's feeding this. Do you think Mexico is just trying to use this as leverage right now over the United States? Is that why they are not accepting those families trying to be expelled back? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Well, I don't want to put any motives in the words of the Mexicans. They need to answer that. But I will tell you that they have started raids in the southern part where they've sent the National Guard. They've sent immigration officers where now they're trying to do more to stop people from coming across. And that is key. Roberta Jacobson knows this. She's a friend of mine. She's going to be concentrating on getting Mexico to do more. They can do more. I promise you. They can do more. MARGARET BRENNAN: The vice president was handed this portfolio this week, along with some of the diplomatic initiatives. Have you spoken to her or her office about your concerns? REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Not since November. I have spoken to Secretary Mayorkas. I've spoken to some folks at the White House, I've spoken to the CBP acting commissioner, I've talked-- talked to a lot of folks on the ground. But I-- certainly myself, the other congressmen down here, Congressman Vicente Gonzalez and of course, Vela, Congressman Filemon Vela, we all want to be helpful to the vice president. I'm glad that the President put the second-- the vice president in charge, because we need somebody that can look at the comprehensive view-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: --of what we're seeing here. It's-- it's not a simple solution. MARGARET BRENNAN: No. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: I grant that. But you've got to start from what we do in Central America, because remember-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: --we have, since 2016 to now, we've given them over 3.6 billion dollars-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: --appropriated money. Now some of that has been held because of some conditions-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: --that the Senate added. But we've got to help them. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congressman, we have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us today. REPRESENTATIVE HENRY CUELLAR: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with more FACE THE NATION in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: On our latest Facing Forward podcast, I spoke with Rich Gelfond, the CEO of IMAX. You can subscribe on Apple Podcasts or on your favorite podcast platform. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We go now to Louisiana Congresswoman-elect Doctor Julia Letlow. Welcome to FACE THE NATION. REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW (R-Louisiana/@jbletlow): Thank you so much for having me, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor, you are the first Republican congresswoman in Louisiana's history, and you won your seat in a special election that was held after your husband. Luke Letlow recently passed away from COVID in December. And I'm wondering how that experience firsthand with COVID is going to inform your work here in Washington. REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT DR. JULIA LETLOW: Well, it's definitely going to inform my work. You know, I just want to take a second to acknowledge all of the Americans out there who have lost loved ones to COVID. I want to say that I-- I see you. I hear you. I, most importantly, pray with you. I'm a huge proponent of the vaccine. It has lifesaving capabilities. And I want to encourage anybody out there who's eligible to go ahead and get that vaccine. It's so important. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's a resonant message coming from you, not just because of your personal experience, but also, I mean, frankly, looking at your district. Louisiana is going to open up eligibility on Monday, right? For everyone sixteen and up. One group, though-- REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But every-- but we're seeing in our own polling, though, is a new level of hesitation among self-identified Republicans sixty-five and younger. So when you were speaking to voters, what is your message to them about why they should trust this vaccine? REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: That's right, that's why I want to be an advocate and a voice for-- for everyone. Look at my family, use my story. You know I experienced a tragedy in my immediate family and COVID can touch every family out there. And so, you know, there is a vaccine that has lifesaving capabilities. I want to encourage everyone to trust it and get the vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you spoke with former President Trump. You also received a phone call from President Biden who talked to you about your loss. Can you share with us anything about that phone call? REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: Sure. They were both so gracious and expressed their condolences and President Biden, you know, who is no stranger to loss, as well as shared with me that he understood the pain that I was walking through and that it will get better. And I know it will. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I know we all hope it certainly does for you, and you have a lot of business to carry on on behalf of your constituents when you get here. I mean looking at your district, you have one of the highest poverty rates in the country, about twenty-five percent. You've said for you a priority is expanding broadband access infrastructure. That's high on President Biden's list. Does that mean as a Republican in the House, you are going to get on board with his proposals? REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: Well, I'm definitely going to get on board with any proposal that is going to provide rural broadband to my district. Just like you said we have some of the highest poverty rates in the nation right here. My background is in higher education. I believe if you can educate a child, you give them a future. And so I want to champion education all the way from early childhood K through twelve, our underutilized trade schools and community colleges to our four-year institutions. And there's nothing like a pandemic, Margaret, to bring to light how vital rural broadband is in educating our children, but also providing health care to the constituents in my district. MARGARET BRENNAN: So there has already been apprehension. The bill hasn't even been proposed yet. You know it's just being talked about. But the price tag on it, you know, another two trillion or more. Does this mean as a Republican, you would vote for anything that would expand broadband access? REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: Well, I would definitely have to take a close look at the bill. You know I'm not up there yet, so I would definitely have to analyze it. But I'm going to be looking for avenues to find a way to expand rural broadband in my district. So I'll look at everything that's on the table. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are joining a record-breaking number of women in the House of Representatives. When we looked at Louisiana, it's at around the bottom of the country when it comes to equal pay for women, particularly black women, it's about forty-seven cents on the dollar. Latina women about fifty-two cents. Women writ large, about seventy-four cents. Is addressing pay equity a priority for you? REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: It's definitely something that I will look into. I believe women should be paid equitably, but I am so proud to be the first Republican woman elected to represent the state of Louisiana. You know, when you look at our-- the population, the makeup of Louisiana, roughly fifty-two percent is female. Every issue is a woman's issue. And so it's a wonderful opportunity for Louisiana to have a woman to have a seat at the table. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be watching what you do with that. I want to ask you to-- just to share some of your personal experience. You-- you talked about your personal loss here. And I know when we looked at your background, you've experienced quite a lot of grief in your life. You also lost your seventeen-year-old brother in a car accident when he was in college. You wrote a thesis and a dissertation on grief itself. What is your lesson, as you said, for those who have lost during this pandemic? How do you continue moving forward, as you did with, you know, bringing your children here to Washington, continuing to push forward with a career in the mass of-- of such a loss? REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT JULIA LETLOW: That's right. Well, you know, I happen to be a woman of faith. I believe that the Lord doesn't waste an experience good or bad. And so all of those experiences that I've had prior, even writing a dissertation, just like you said, on finding meaning after the loss of a family member, is helping guide me through. You know, one of the findings of my dissertation was that when a person can get outside of themselves during the grieving process and find ways to serve others, that can actually be cathartic in-- in helping guide them through the grieving process. So I just see everything in my life and in my marriage has led me to this one moment in time. I am so honored and excited to serve the people of the Fifth District. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman-elect, we will be watching. Thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Most regions of the world are seeing an increase in COVID infections as highly contagious variants continue to spread. The World Health Organization called it a worrying sign. Senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports from Tel Aviv. ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@CBSLizpalmer): Good morning. Israel, where I am, has now vaccinated almost three-quarters of adults over sixteen years old. And the effect has been dramatic. The number of people who died, on average every day last week, was down to twelve. (Begin VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: By contrast, Europe is in big trouble. Czechs stopped for a minute of silence on Monday, a year after the first COVID patient died there. In the Old Town Square, white crosses marked the lives lost so far, and now deaths are climbing again. Most European countries are either heading for or are in a third wave of infection that German health authorities warned could be the worst yet. Europe's vaccine rollout has been crippled by politics and supply problems, but it isn't last accelerating with temporary centers springing up everywhere, including this French velodrome. And three new vaccine manufacturing sites have just been approved, which will also help. Then there is Brazil, now responsible for a quarter of COVID deaths worldwide every day. Regional governments have closed beaches, restricted traffic, and told people to stay home. Medical teams are doing their best, but poverty, disinformation, and a more contagious variant means eighty thousand new cases every day. And a warning that Brazil may end up with more coronavirus deaths overall even than the United States. (End VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: As for the World Health Organization report by the team that had traveled to China to look for the origins of the virus has been much delayed, once again it was due out on Friday. So far no sign of it. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz, thank you. We go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, he sits on the board of Pfizer as well as Illumina, and he joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree with Doctor Fauci in terms of his projections on where we are headed with this sort of stuck at about sixty thousand infections a day level? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: You know we've now vaccinated ninety-two million Americans. It's about twenty-eight percent of the public. About fifty million have been fully vaccinated, that's fifteen percent. Israel started to see the big declines in cases when they hit about twenty-five percent of their population vaccinated. So I think that's a pretty big backstop against a true fourth surge. What we're seeing around the nation right now, which is worrisome, are outbreaks in certain states, Michigan, the metro Detroit area, Boston around Massachusetts, the Tri-State Region, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, are experiencing an upsurge of infection. And I think what we need to do is try to continue to vaccinate, surge vaccine into those parts of the country. So the incremental vaccine that's coming onto the market, I think the Bush administration can allocate it to parts of the country that look hot right now. But if we could just get two or three more weeks of around three million vaccines a day, that's going to be a pretty big backstop, against a true fourth surge. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, three-- three million a day or so, the president's benchmark was two hundred million by the end of April. We're already at a hundred and forty. So that is it sounds like you're saying, a very hittable target, but how do you overcome that sort of last hurdle of-- of skepticism, particularly among Republicans? I mean is the government going to be the best-- best messenger in this case? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: They won't be. And you need to get the vaccine into community sites that have relationships with patients and get it into more doctor's offices, get it into pharmacies. You know, the administration is starting to push a lot of vaccine out through different channels. They've given the pharmacies a big role. They'll be marketing the vaccine very aggressively. They're going to community sites, community health centers. So that's what we should be doing. They're going to start vaccinating patients who present to dialysis centers. We should be vaccinating patients on discharge from the hospital, patients who go into infusion sites. So we should be looking at every single interaction that patients have with the medical system and trying to offer a vaccination at those points of care through a provider that patients know. That's ultimately how we're going to get some people who are more hesitant about being vaccinated to take up the vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: People you trust, not necessarily people you would-- celebrities. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Exactly. MARGARET BRENNAN: On the World Health Organization, I-- I want to add--nothing against celebrity endorsements of vaccines--on the World Health Organization and what Doctor Fauci was saying, I know you must be looking at this. He said, yes, the White House is talking about it, but he has no indication of what policies there might be regarding patent protections and pharmaceutical companies who make COVID vaccines. The World Health Organization chief has endorsed this idea of-- of lifting it in order to help some developing countries get access. What is the implication if that happens? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think the implication is you're going to provide disincentives to the future, but the reality is just looking at the practicality of it, the rate-limiting step here is not the intellectual property around these vaccines. These companies are producing, including Pfizer, the company I'm on the board of, as much as they can. The rate limiting factor here, the raw ingredients, the inputs to making those vaccines. There's just a limited global supply of those highly specialized inputs. If you appropriate the intellectual property and give it to a bunch of other companies to try to make these vaccines, they're not going to be able to make them efficiently. And they're not going to be able to stand up the supply because they don't have the supply chain either. If they manage to secure, it is just going to come at the expense of companies like Pfizer, Moderna that are making these vaccines far more efficiently. I think what we have to be doing is trying to get more resources into expanding that manufacturing capacity. This really is an opportunity for President Biden to do what President Bush did around the PEPFAR program and create a global campaign to try to supply vaccine around the world using the U.S. intellectual property. These companies have already donated vaccine. They'd be willing to provide more to low- and middle-income countries if the U.S. government would backstop some of the legal protections around doing that. So there are opportunities here to dramatically expand global supply. Unfortunately, I think just giving away our intellectual property is going to be an empty promise. It's not going to result in more vaccine in these countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when someone looks at what Liz Palmer was just describing happen in Brazil with this surge where it seems almost uncontrolled within their borders, this is not something you would point to as a solution to surge vaccine into a-- a problem country. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It would be a solution. Right now we don't have the supply to do that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think we can get the supply, but not in time probably for Brazil. And Brazil has been reluctant to take up the vaccine. That's part of the problem, too, is policy failure down there. MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to the World Health Organization report on the origins of this, you and I have spoken about this in the past. We've had Matt Pottinger, the former deputy national security adviser to President Trump on. I know Doctor Redfield has spoken to CNN, the former CDC director, about his theories on the origin of COVID. To be clear here, when it comes to this report, you've said you believe the most likely scenario on the origins of COVID was that it was just bouncing back and forth between people and animals for a period of time and finally broke out. But you said the lab theory is never going to be fully dispelled and the World Health Organization shouldn't walk away from that so easily. Do you expect them to walk away from that when this report comes out? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It looks like the WHO report was an attempt to try to support the China narrative, Chinese narrative around this-- this origin of the vaccine. You know, the lab leak theory doesn't seem like a plausible theory unless you aggregate the biggest collection of coronaviruses and put them in a lab, a minimum-security lab in the middle of a densely populated center and experiment on animals, which is exactly what the Wuhan Institute of Virology did. They were using these viruses in a BSL-2 lab and, we now know, infecting animals. So that creates the opportunity for a lab leak. It might not be the most likely scenario on how this virus got out, but it has to remain a scenario. And I think at the end of the day, we're never going to fully discharge that possibility. What we're going to have here is a battle of competing narratives. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. And we will continue to cover it. Thank you very much, Doctor Gottlieb, for your analysis. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Tony Capuano, CEO of the world's largest hotel company, Marriott International. He joins us from Bethesda, Maryland. Good morning. ANTHONY CAPUANO (Marriott International CEO): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: We just heard Doctor Fauci say that travel remains high risk, and yet we see numbers from TSA reporting people are getting on planes in-- in record numbers, in terms of the pandemic. Are you seeing a similar surge in spring bookings? ANTHONY CAPUANO: We are seeing pretty significant acceleration of demand. The reality is people are traveling, which is why we can't let our guard down. We've got to continue to adhere to the CDC protocols and keep our cleaning and operating protocols in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: So vaccination, you have said, is going to be key to business, to the economy reopening it. You have actually opened a program to try to incentivize your employees to take that vaccine by offering them, what, four hours of pay. Why did you need to give that incentive? And is it working? ANTHONY CAPUANO: We didn't need to. We chose to. Our culture is very much an employee-first culture, and we wanted to make sure they had access to education about the vaccinations and the flexibility to take time off work if they chose to get vaccinated. MARGARET BRENNAN: So that four hours of pay is to allow them to take the time off work to get the shot in the arm? ANTHONY CAPUANO: That's correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: So last March, your predecessor said the financial impact of the pandemic was on par with 9/11, the-- the Great Recession, and the financial crisis around that time. Marriott cut thousands of jobs. You lost about two hundred and seventy-six million dollars. When do you expect to get back to that pre-pandemic level of both jobs and business? ANTHONY CAPUANO: It really depends on demand recovery. And demand recovery will be driven by consumer confidence. The good news is we have such great visibility into real-time data. In certain markets where the vacc-- the-- the virus containment seems to be proceeding well and where you're seeing broad distribution of vaccine, we are seeing demand recover and that's allowing us to bring many of our employees back. MARGARET BRENNAN: So demand is up, Arizona, Texas and Florida I see. But it's still low in some of the big cities. Is that a trend you think is going to stay with us for some time? ANTHONY CAPUANO: We'll continue to see growth in demand in drive-to destinations and I think leisure destinations. One of the really interesting phenomenon we've seen over the last year is a blending of trip purposes. People have learned that they can, in fact, work from almost anywhere. And as a result we're seeing our guests combine business travel with leisure travel. MARGARET BRENNAN: Gas prices aren't going to impact those drive-to destination bookings? ANTHONY CAPUANO: Certainly, they'll have some measure of impact, but we've really not seen it yet. There is enormous pent-up demand and because of concerns about safety, we continue to see lots of appeal of drive-to destinations. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know when we look at the jobless rate in the country your industry is so frequently turned-- pointed to as one of the biggest places of losses, particularly for women. I'm wondering of all the adaptations that you have had to make in your hotels for safety reasons and protocols with, you know, not checking in in-person, but doing it on your phone or doing it, you know, digitally, haven't you managed your way towards just needing to employ fewer people? I mean are these jobs actually coming back? ANTHONY CAPUANO: In markets where demand is recovering, we're absolutely seeing those jobs come back and in many of the markets you described we're actively hiring. I think what those technological advances allow us to do is really engage our employees more in interacting with the guests and meeting their needs. MARGARET BRENNAN: So desk clerk is not a job that's going to disappear? ANTHONY CAPUANO: Absolutely not. MARGARET BRENNAN: In New York state, they're kind of experimenting with something I'm interested in getting your view on, which is this idea of having some kind of vaccine passport, so to speak, some kind of digital stamp to show that you have been vaccinated. Is this something that you think business-wise you would encourage other states to adopt? I mean would it help give you some reassurance? ANTHONY CAPUANO: Time will tell what the right platform is. What we know with certainty, however, is a global, coordinated, reliable health credential system will be key to giving folks comfort about traveling to-- and to giving jurisdictions comfort in opening their borders. MARGARET BRENNAN: But who is going to run that since the states are administering these vaccine programs? You know the-- the particulars of how you actually get this up and running are-- are kind of a big stumbling point. ANTHONY CAPUANO: It's the right question to ask. I-- I worry a bit that the approach to date is a bit fragmented. And, again, we need a comprehensive and global solution for it to be effective. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you talked to the White House about that? ANTHONY CAPUANO: We're in active discussions with the administration with our industry colleagues to try and identify opportunities to inform borders as they consider opening. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, two dozen or so industry groups wrote a letter to the White House pushing for international travel to be reopened by this summer, saying that's really key time frame for them. Do you have any indication that any of the travel restrictions will be lifted, that international travel will return? ANTHONY CAPUANO: It really varies by jurisdiction. We know there's enormous pent-up demand for international travel and we know those destinations, like many European cities, are struggling mightily because they rely so heavily on inbound international travel. The markets that have recovered most quickly are those that have depths of demand domestically. So we've seen that in drive-to destinations in the U.S. and we've seen it across China.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But no promise from the White House? We're lifting the travel restrictions on countries by the summer. Nothing yet? ANTHONY CAPUANO: Not yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: Not yet. All right. Thank you very much, Tony Capuano, for your time and your perspective. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. And before we go, we did want to extend a thank you to broadcast producer, Jillian Hughes, who is leaving our program and our network. She will be missed. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, familiar crises challenge this country and the Biden administration. One presidential goal down: One hundred million COVID vaccinations in not one hundred but only fifty-eight days. But is the race to reopen outpacing the dash to vaccinate enough Americans in order to shut down the virus. Los Angeles County was the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak just two months ago; now they're reopening. We'll hear from L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. Former Operation Warp Speed chief scientific adviser Doctor Moncef Slaoui and former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb will also be here. A shooting rampage in Atlanta puts the spotlight on an ugly consequence of the coronavirus. A steep increase in violence against Asian-Americans particularly women.\u00a0KAMALA HARRIS: Racism is real in America, and it has always been. Xenophobia is real in America, and always has been. Sexism, too.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth about the push to pass new laws protecting Asian-Americans from hate crimes. Plus, the ping-pong politics of blame starts up again with a record number of migrant children crossing the southern border. President Biden has faced this challenge before as VP. Does he have any new solutions now?\u00a0PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Do you repeat what Trump did? Take them from their mothers, to move them away, hold them in cells, etcetera? We're not doing that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The top Republican on the Senate Committee that deals with border security, Ohio's Rob Portman is just back from the region.\u00a0It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It is the second official day of spring, a season that brings with it the complications of warmer weather. This year it's spring break, and a spring surge in unaccompanied children at the southern border as they seek a better life in the U.S. We've got a lot to get to today, and we begin with senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): Despite a curfew and the pandemic, Miami Beach jammed with spring breakers last night until police fired pepper balls to break up the party.\u00a0MAN #1: We've got too many people coming, and we have COVID at the same time.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Irresponsibility unmasked. To health officials, this is the other March Madness.\u00a0MAN #2: You can hardly see the sand because all of the umbrellas on the beach.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: And reverse COVID progress. Over the last two months, new cases and daily deaths both have plummeted. But--\u00a0DR. ANTHONY FAUCI (Chief Medical Adviser to President Biden): You are seeing increases in number of cases per day.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: The so-called U.K. variant blamed for up to thirty percent of new infections. Viral spread. The TSA reports eight straight days of more than one million people flying. Relaxed COVID restrictions, and resentful attitudes, like this mask burning in Arizona.\u00a0WOMAN #1: We are the people, and we're done putting a muzzle on our face.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: In the vaccine rollout, more than forty-three million Americans have been fully vaccinated. Over half of them age sixty-five and over.\u00a0But there's no vaccine for COVID-era racism. Three spas here in Atlanta became homicide scenes, eight murder victims, six of them Asian women. The confessed killer could face Georgia's new hate crime law. And the murders spotlight at the increasing risk to Asian-Americans.\u00a0(Woman #2 speaking foreign language)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: \"You bump,\" this seventy-five-year-old woman yelled in Chinese. In San Francisco she beat her attacker bloody with a stick.\u00a0GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM (D-California): It's painful and infuriating at the same time. The hell is wrong with us?\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: During the pandemic, thousands of Asian-Americans have been assaulted, physically and verbally.\u00a0PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: They've been attacked, blamed, scapegoated and harassed. We cannot be complicit.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: It's a COVID contradiction. Vaccines have made millions of us feel more protected, but many Asian-Americans feel more vulnerable than ever.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Mark Strassmann in Atlanta.\u00a0And we want to go now to the West Coast and the mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti. Good morning to you, Mister Mayor. You--\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI (D-Los Angeles/@MayorOfLA): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You run the second largest city in the country. When we spoke last in January, it was the epicenter of a COVID outbreak. Now we're at fifty thousand infections a day. Are you confident there is not a fourth wave coming?\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Oh, COVID makes you never confident, but hope really hangs on the horizon. I haven't felt this optimism in twelve months, Margaret. Here in Los Angeles we have a positivity rate of 1.9 percent, and we estimate that anywhere between half and two-thirds of our population has antibodies in it now--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Wow.\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: --either because of exposure to COVID-19 and vaccination. So it is a very different context than when openings happened last July or when openings didn't happen in December. But we still saw this virus burn through our city. So this is a very, very optimistic moment. And we're doing a lot of work to make sure that vaccines don't just get to all of our population, but get to every community as well through a lot of equity programs Doctor Fauci has praised--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: --as some of the best in the country.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yet the CDC said this week that you have two variants of concern, B.1.427 and 1.429. How do you know that L.A. isn't opening fast-- too fast, too soon?\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, you never know, but you have to follow the data and the data is very clear. If we were a state right now, we'd have the second lowest positivity rate. And our state of California right now, I think, is the third lowest case rate in the country. I believe that some of those variants have burned through Los Angeles. It's the only way to really explain what happened in December and January when we still had the same level of closures as a month or two before and we didn't have that case rate. So I think that our population really is much stronger, our vaccinations are accelerating and we can take these steps. It was a year to the date that we closed down movie theaters, restaurants, first big city in America--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: --to do that, March 12th. It was that date that we now have reopened those places cautiously, with the lessons learned. But it's time to get things moving. It's time to get our economy started. It's time to start hugging our loved ones again. And, certainly, that comes from getting a vaccine.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: On vaccines, since before the Biden administration took office, you have been petitioning Joe Biden for direct shipments to your city instead of going first through the state. Why are they blowing off your requests?\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, we still keep asking as cities. And I want to praise the Biden administration where we've seen them hit their targets early. We've seen vaccines ramp up, a lot of support--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But you said--\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: --for the mega sites, mobile teams--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You said a few days ago you can't meet the President's target of May 1st opening up all vaccinations because he's not giving you enough supply.\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: I didn't say those words. What I've said is you give us more and we have double the capacity today. So I look forward to when those deliveries come in for us to be able to do that. And I think cities across our country, mayors have been very clear, are the right places to add more vaccines. And I'll continue saying that to our friends in the administration. I'll keep saying that especially when cities are larger sometimes than most states. We're larger than twenty-three states.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: L.A. County is larger than forty-five states. Give us more, we'll get them into arms.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So now you think you can hit that deadline. So California, though, when you rank it by the CDC numbers that we looked at, it is among the most unequal states. I know you're talking about the city you control, but you also said in a speech at Harvard that many of these deaths could have been prevented if it had been distributed by zip code, really targeted. Have you talked to your friend--\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Yes. No, I believe that--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --Gavin Newsom about his plan? And-- and did you tell him you were frustrated?\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Mm-Hm. Yes, we've talked and he actually did-- did a great move by making sure that forty percent of all of our vaccines, and I don't know if other states have done this, but forty percent of them are targeted now towards the most vulnerable. That's allowing us to be able to put that into zip codes with mobile teams. We actually deliver vaccines now to people in their homes, and we're working with local, community-based organizations. But I look forward to when the federal regulations release our handcuffs and allow us to target anybody in a hotspot. I think that is probably two or three weeks away. And when we can do that, we can make sure even as our numbers have plummeted here, some of our lowest hospitalizations in a year, that'll allow us, if there is anything that comes up quickly, go into the geography of a neighborhood, knock it down before it spreads throughout a city.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say two to three weeks away, what are you talking about? Which restrictions?\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: I think that is the time when we'll have enough supply to be able to have states and, or the federal government to allow us to go into the hardest-hit zip codes and just say, look, anybody, regardless of age, can be vaccinated there.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about this really troubling spike in hate crimes because your city has really experiencing--\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --experienced them when it comes to Asian Americans. Last year, you cut around a hundred and fifty million dollars from the police budget. Because of these Black Lives Matter protests you reprogrammed those funds. Do you need to push that money back to the LAPD so they can police this kind of ethnic targeting?\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: No, I think that's the wrong frame. We are reimagining public safety together with our police department. We know that things like hate crime need both a police response and education, reporting mechanism, civilians and community-based groups that can help be the eyes and ears. And we have no tolerance for this hate here in Los Angeles, a great city filled with folks of Asian American and Pacific Islander descent. And we have seen attacks, footsteps away from where I'm talking from you today. We had an attack here in Koreatown just a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: And we are putting together some of the best programs in the country. LAPD is absolutely part of that. But that-- no, that's absolutely the false kind of dichotomy. For us you need to make sure that there is a police officer to answer. And we have more patrols this year, even with cuts that every department--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: --including our police department hit because of the fiscal crisis and also making investments in the human side of this to make sure community organizations are well-funded, too.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Mister Mayor, thank you for your time this morning. We want to take a closer look at this specific issue with this wave of racist attacks on Asian-Americans. Illinois Democratic Senator Tammy Duckworth joins us now from Capitol Hill. Good morning to you, Senator.\u00a0SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-Illinois/@SenDuckworth): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard Mayor Garcetti talk about what's happening in his city. I want to ask you as well about what happened this week in Atlanta. The FBI director, Chris Wray, says that local investigators, they've got the lead, but from where he sits so far, it doesn't look like these shootings were racially motivated. From where you sit, is he wrong?\u00a0SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, from where I sit, I want to see a deeper investigation into whether or not these shootings and other similar crimes are racially motivated. It looks racially motivated to me, but I'm not, you know, I'm-- I'm not a police officer. I'm not investigating the crimes. What I have done, though, is I have actually sent a letter to Director Wray and to Attorney General Garland asking for a deeper investigation into crimes that involve Asian-Americans to see how many crimes have actually been underreported as hate crimes. We know that crimes against Asian-Americans that have been ca-- categorized as hate crimes have increased by over hundred and fifty percent in our nation's major cities. That's over thirty-eight hundred additional crimes last year. But we also know that many of these crimes go underreported as hate crimes and are just classified as a mugging or harassment or vandalism when really they were targeted at Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders in particular.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Earlier this month, when Director Wray appeared before Congress, he was pressed on what he was doing. He said that the FBI is already trying to address this with training, liaison events. He said they put out intelligence reports about what's happening in the Asian community. What more does federal law enforcement need to be doing? And-- and don't they already have a civil rights division dealing with these kind of crimes?\u00a0SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, they do, but the problem is the crimes often are not reported as a hate crime or race-motivated crime at the scene with the local police officers because people just don't see Asian-Americans as a minority group that gets attacked on a regular basis. Now, if you're Asian-American like me and my family, you know it happens on a regular basis. But oftentimes these crimes just get reported in some other way. Or when you say, hey, I think it was race motivated, it doesn't-- the authorities don't pay attention to that and just reclassify them. And that is what I've asked Director Wray and Attorney General Garland to take a deeper dive into. Let's-- let's relook at all of these crimes involving Asian-Americans. And let's see how-- how bad is this underreported.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. I want to ask you about another dimension to this issue that I thought was raised in an interesting framing by the Atlanta Journal and Constitution. They have a front-page story saying before the killing spree in that city, Georgia let an industry that exploits Asian women flourish. Given the national conversation around commodification and exploitation of Asian women in this country, I wonder what you think of this idea. Were those women in Atlanta essentially being exploited and-- and victimized twice?\u00a0SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I think that any time that you're part of a minority group, especially one with reduced power, you are much more susceptible to being exploited. And that's why I want us to take a deeper look at the situation here. Asian women in particular have been commoditized. Asian women in particular have this stereotype against them that they are weak and submissive, and they've been over-sexualized. And so what happens is that they become the victims of crimes far more often. I mean, these increases in hate crimes against Asian-Americans in the last year, two-thirds of them were against Asian women.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN;' Mm-Hm.\u00a0SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: We really have to deal with this situation, but we need the real data as to what is going on here so we can fix it.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The president on Friday endorsed a bill I know you are a co-sponsor of-- of called the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act. All the co-sponsors are Democrats. Do you have any pledges from Republicans to sign on?\u00a0SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: We don't at this time. And it's astonishing to me. I mean, the House passed a bill that actually condemn-- was a resolution against hate crimes against Asian-Americans tied to COVID. And, you know, we had actually Republicans who voted against it. And Mitch McConnell at the time, because Republicans were in charge, wouldn't even let us vote on it in the Senate. I mean how-- where can you be that you would not be willing to vote on a bill that would condemn violence against any group of Americans?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We will look for an answer to that question. On immigration, I want to ask you, President Obama, as you recall, was heavily criticized. He was even called the deporter-in-chief. President Biden now is coming under heavy criticism for this crisis at the U.S. border. From where you sit, does the administration need to send a stronger message to discourage migrants from making the trek to the U.S.?\u00a0SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, let's-- let's make that clear. We have a situation at the border, and that is as a result of four years of failed policies, inhumane policies and a systematic dismantling of the asylum system by Donald Trump. We all saw what Donald Trump can do in terms of damages in a single day on January 6th. And he's had four years to basically undermine our nation's immigration system. He dismantled--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But they're coming now.\u00a0SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Right. But they-- but you know what? It's-- as a result of him dismantling the asylum system and the pathways to-- for seeking asylum that used to exist, I know that President Biden is going to be committed to repairing that system that Donald Trump broke in order to make it not only more-- work better, but also to make it humane so that these kids and other migrants can actually apply for asylum in their home countries without coming here.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: You know, Donald Trump stopped aid to the Northern Triangle countries. He did everything he could to dismantle the system which led to the crisis we're in now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly, Secretary of Defense Austin was in Afghanistan this morning. In about forty days, U.S. troops are scheduled to be pulled out. Do you think President Biden should leave a residual force? And how big and for how long?\u00a0SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Well, I think that Secretary Austin is there taking a look on the ground and I would listen to the military commanders. I've long said what we need to do is to eliminate the old AUMF, the Authorization for Use of Military Force, vote on a new one. But listen to the military commanders on the ground along with our allies. So I'm-- I'm really anxiously waiting to hear back from Secretary Austin, what he finds in Afghanistan and what his recommendations are going to be. Again, I want American troops to come home, but I also want to fight the bad guys over there instead of allowing them to come here.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Duckworth, thank you for your time this morning.\u00a0SENATOR TAMMY DUCKWORTH: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: FACE THE NATION will be back in a minute. Don't go away.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration is faced with a growing crisis at the southern border as the number of unaccompanied migrant children in custody has now surpassed fifteen thousand. Ohio Republican Senator Rob Portman toured several border facilities in Texas last week. He joins us from Cincinnati. Good morning to you, Senator.\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN (R-Ohio/@senrobportman): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me on.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the numbers. You heard your Democratic colleague, Senator Duckworth, lay this at the feet of the last President. The problem right now is with this current administration. Their message this morning is a clear, do not come. Will those words change what is happening?\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: No. I mean people are going to listen to actions and watch actions and not listen to words, and-- and I spoke to a number of migrants. I spoke to single individuals who are coming over at night, men who told me that they'd heard what President Biden said and they were coming anyway because they could make a lot more, ten times more in the United States. I talked to children and talked to them about the messaging. And what they're hearing is that you can now come into the United States, which you can as-- as a kid. And so they're going to keep coming. And the-- the problem here is that the Biden administration on day one made about a half-dozen changes and since then have made several more that encouraged more people to come to the border. And they didn't put anything in place to deal with it, either another policy to discourage people from coming, which the President says he wants to do. Or to put the preparations in place, including the shelters and the holding facilities that are-- that have been so criticized. And I saw some of them the other day. Kids are overcrowded. They're in situations you would never want your kid to be in. And so it's irresponsible. And, you know, they say, well, it's more humane. I don't think it's humane to encourage kids to make this treacherous journey north and then have to live in these kind of conditions--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So--\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: --so we need to change course.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, on that issue of children. You know, the-- the Biden administration has kept the Trump administration policy, that-- that Title 42, of during the pandemic, pushing people back across the border without due process because of this pandemic. But they are allowing children to stay. Are you saying children should be expelled even if they're trying to seek asylum?\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: Well, it's not so much a matter of expelling kids it's a matter of telling them that they're not going to be able to come across the border during the public health crisis and, yes, I think Title 42 ought to stay in--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they are in U.S. custody because they're not being expelled.\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: Well, exactly. So-- so now it's a different situation. But what I'm saying is that we ought to put in place the provisions that were in place previously while we prepare ourselves. I mean, I think there are five things that we-- we can do and should do right away. One is to help the Border Patrol, they're overwhelmed. Finish the small parts of the wall that haven't been completed because it's silly. You've got openings in the wall that's making the Border Patrol job impossible. Provide the technology for them, even more important than-- than the wall. Second, stop the magnet of-- of work by putting a mandatory E-Verify system in place. And then third, let's deal with this asylum issue in a-- in a much more logical way. Let's have rapid adjudications at the border. This was a pilot program started in the Trump administration. It was stopped. Let's put that back in place. Let's put the resources into that so people can find out right away. Do they-- do they qualify or not? Right now, as you know, it's four or five, six years before they know. Meanwhile, they're living in the United States. We know that only about half of them even show up for their court cases. No wonder they're in the United States for-- for several years. And at the end of the day, only fifteen percent of them qualify. So it's-- it's a bad situation. Finally, in terms of the third country agreements--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: --that the Biden administration entered right away, let's allow these-- these kids to seek asylum and families and individuals in their country of origin, but also in third countries. So as an example if you're in Honduras and you're coming up, you can apply in Guatemala--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: --or you can apply in Mexico. That makes a lot more sense. So encouraging these kids to come is not a humane thing, and it's certainly overwhelming our system. So--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well. I want to-\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: --there's a much better way to do this.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, let me ask you about one thing in particular the White House is asking for. They want four billion in aid over the next four years, a billion a year for Central America to help the countries of origin basically keep their people within their own borders. You have oversight. Is that a reasonable number?\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: Probably. I mean, let's face it, Margaret, we've spent 3.6 billion dollars, so roughly that amount, in the last five years in those three countries in the Northern Triangle, alone, so El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras. There's a lot of corruption down there. They've also had issues and natural disasters, including the hurricanes. So, you know, it hasn't made much of a difference in terms of the poverty rates. It's a little better. And, of course, we should work on that. Everything I talked about earlier, were sort of to stop the pull-factors because there are obviously millions of people around the world who would love to come, so you need to reduce the pull-factors. On the push-factors, I'm for that, but it's going to take many years, some say a decade to make any substantial difference. So let's begin the process. But let's be sure we do two things. One, let's tie that aid to them helping us in terms of the asylum process and working through this issue that otherwise overwhelms our system. And second, let's tie the aid to actually dealing with the corruption and make sure that there-- there is transparency, there-- there is a-- an adherence to the rule of law so that we can actually make the fundamental changes in these countries to be able to help those people rather than just sending--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: --more money down as we-- as we have been doing.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, will you press DHS to give journalists access, yes or no?\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: Absolutely. I mean this should be transparent.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you.\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: I mean, it's amazing to me how little my constituents know about what's going on down along the border. And--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: --it was a situation spiraling out of control.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you.\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: As the Rio Grande Valley sector chief--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: --just said in-- in a tweet yesterday, there is no end in sight. I mean this is not fair to the Border Patrol and others within our immigration system trying to--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: --deal with it. And there are things that can and should be done to deal with it. And I hope--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right.\u00a0SENATOR ROB PORTMAN: --the Biden administration will do that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Portman, I appreciate your time this morning. Thank you. We'll be right back. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: On our new episode of Facing Forward, I spoke with the founder of the world's largest hedge fund Ray Dalio. A new episode drops every Friday. You can subscribe on Apple podcast or your favorite podcast platform.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with former chief advisor to Operation Warp Speed, Doctor Moncef Slaoui and former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to take a look at the COVID situation around the world. Senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports from Tel Aviv.\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@CBSLizpalmer): Margaret, good morning from Israel, which leads the world in vaccinations. Eighty percent of the people over sixty here have been immunized.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: The U.K. is doing well, too. Nine out of ten adults over sixty-five have now had a shot. At the hospital where he almost died of COVID a year ago, Prime Minister Boris Johnson got his.\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: I literally did not feel a thing.\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: But in mainland Europe, things are going from bad to worse. Its COVID death toll passed the million marked on Friday and infections are surging. Parisians rushed to leave the city before a new lockdown put a stop to travel as of this weekend. Those left behind will be able to meet outside for exercise, but not much else. The vaccine rollout in Europe has been slow, plagued with politics, supply problems and last week a shutdown in the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine because of an alleged link to blood clots. Regulators say there's nothing to worry about, but this facility in Germany shows the fallout, plenty of vaccine, just no costumers. Scientists say this mess will cost thousands of lives. Also struggling is Brazil, where authorities closed Copacabana Beach in Rio. With infections rising almost three thousand Brazilians died of COVID-19 on Friday alone. And, finally, in Mexico, public health in action. Wrestlers took masks to the maskless. Resistance was futile.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: Here in Israel, the effect of the mass vaccinations is clear, deaths are down to under ten a day, and the economy has pretty much fully reopened. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz, thank you.\u00a0As part of our continuing efforts to learn from experience in terms of the coronavirus pandemic, we spoke Saturday with Doctor Moncef Slaoui, the former chief scientific adviser of Operation Warp Speed, the vaccine development effort under the Trump administration.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden has said that the Trump administration had not contracted for enough vaccine doses when he took office. As recently as a month ago, Biden blamed the Trump administration, saying:\u00a0PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN (February 18): America had no real plan to vaccinate most of the country. My predecessor had failed to order enough vaccines, failed to mobilize the effort to administer the shots, failed to set up vaccine centers. That changed the moment we took office.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that fair?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI (Former Chief Scientific Adviser for Operation Warp Speed): I think this is a very negative description of the reality. I do think that we had plans. And, in fact, ninety percent of what's happening now is the plan that we had. Of course, the first thing was to accelerate the development of the vaccine. We contracted specifically a hundred million doses of vaccine, but also built into the contract options to acquire more vaccines once we knew they are effective. And the plan was to order more vaccines when-- when we knew they are more effective. So I think what's happening is right. But I think what's happening is, frankly, what was the plan. Substantially, what was the plan.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You say ninety percent of what's happening now is what you put into place?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: I think in terms of manufacturing and supply and distribution, which is the physical shipment of vaccine to immunization site, the answer is yes, because there's a ramp up in manufacturing, as always happens. And that's what we are experiencing and seeing. I do think that in terms of immunization and shots in arms, in particular, the large vaccination sites in sports arenas and-- and the likes and the participation of FEMA, those were not parts of the plan and they are participating to accelerate, I think to some extent, the immunization. But the bulk of vaccine distribution is happening in the health care centers and now in the pharmacies. And that was all part of the plan.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Where do you think that there were flaws in-- in the strategy because certainly on the vaccine rollout, we hear from governors, we hear from those who have to do this last mile of administering it, that there were problems, that there still are problems.\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: I think we have failed to communicate the fact that vaccine doses availability is going to be, you know, slow over time because-- because we went so fast. There is no stock of vaccine. It was impossible to have enough vaccine doses quickly enough compared to the expectations. So we were unable, as we communicated in the month of November and December and January, to-- to manage the expectation. In the actual immunization, the approach taken was a philosophical approach that was frankly part of what the previous administration philosophy is, which is the federal government is going to provide vaccine. The states should be accountable for actually immunizing. And that's-- that's the principle on which we have worked. Clearly, there was a need for the states to actually learn, which they did in reality. And that-- that's how improvements are happening now and also for the central government to participate to that learning process and-- and accelerate it.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things that President Biden did do was to get Merck, a competitor to Johnson & Johnson, to step up and help them produce supply to make up for their own shortfall. Did Operation Warp Speed have the manufacturing plan like that in place?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: So the discussion with Merck had started already prior to the new administration taking office, including discussions around making available their facilities for-- definitely on the short term doing what's called the fill finish, which-- which is the putting vaccines into the sterile vials and then over a longer period of time to manufacture the bulk vaccine itself. And they have been completed under this administration. And I think it's very, very good.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to clarify, was President Trump going to order Merck to do this?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: No, no, no. But we had discussion, the HHS had discussions with Merck to come to an agreement to use Merck's facilities for pandemic purposes. Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that President Trump's refusal to concede the election caused problems in the handoff to the Biden administration when it comes to vaccines?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: Things didn't start very quickly. I don't think there's been in terms of execution and operations, I don't think there was any changes or delays. Maybe in terms of ownership and full understanding by the new administration of what was going on, it's possible that it was not as-- as fast as normally it should have been.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What we are seeing now, Doctor Slaoui, in our own CBS polling is that Republicans, particularly those under the age of sixty-five, are showing hesitation to taking a shot in the arm. What do you attribute that to?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: I'm very concerned, very concerned that for political motivation, people decide to actually place themselves and the people around them in harms' way by refusing to be vaccinated. I think-- I think we need to do every effort we can to explain to people that vaccines have nothing to do with politics. These vaccines are safe. They are highly effective. They're going to help them protect themselves and protect the people around them from the spread of this virus and critically from the potential appearance of new variants.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think Republicans are now hesitant to take it?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: I-- I don't know. It's beyond my rational thinking. I'm a scientist, not a politician, but I would hope that President Trump and others in the Republican Party should really work hard to engage more Republicans to accept to be vaccinated.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump has said he's taken the vaccine, but he chose not to do so on camera. Do you think that would have made a difference?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: I do think it makes a difference. I think people project images and can convey important messaging.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The response to the virus continues to be a political issue. This week Senator Rand Paul mocked Doctor Fauci for continuing to mask after he was vaccinated.\u00a0SENATOR RAND PAUL (Thursday): We're not spreading the infection. Isn't it just theater?\u00a0DR. ANTHONY FAUCI (Thursday): No, it's not.\u00a0SENATOR RAND PAUL: You have the vaccine and you're wearing two masks. Isn't that theater?\u00a0DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: No, this is not-- here we go again with the theater.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think people who've been vaccinated need to still wear masks?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: I do think as long as the herd immunity levels have not yet been attained, that people who have been vaccinated should continue wearing a mask when in public and in crowded areas because what we don't know yet is whether the vaccine prevents replication of the virus. It's an act of, frankly, you know, civility I would say, vis-a-vis the people around us who have not yet been vaccinated. So, yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel like you're stigmatized for having worked for the Trump administration?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: With time, the one thing I want to focus on is I feel extremely fortunate to have been able to help and participate to allow us to have vaccine and control this pandemic. That's the only thing that counts. There were moments, frankly, where I told myself, oh, my God, why did I get myself into this? But they never lasted long because the-- the mission is way more important than-- than-- than those emotional moments. I do believe that it's a mistake to politicize a health issue. It's a big mistake. Many people probably have died or suffered because the whole situation became so political that, you know, emotions overtook rationality.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Elizabeth Warren took aim at you because you had worked for Moderna, a company that was part of Operation Warp Speed. You then went and you sold your stock in the company, so this came at a cost to you. But you're saying you think it was worth it?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: It did come at a very significant financial cost to me, to be honest, and it is worth it. I had major issues with Senator Elizabeth Warren because, as I told her in a video, I don't know you and, therefore, I don't judge your values. You don't know me. You can't decide because I was a pharmaceutical executive that I am a corrupt person and I'm doing this to make money because that's-- I know that's not the case. And I worked for nine months, day and night. I wasn't paid. I didn't ask to be paid. I didn't want to be paid. I sold my shares in Moderna. The one thing I decided I didn't want to do was my-- selling my shares in GlaxoSmithKline, but I agreed to give any gains, if they were to happen, to research. I couldn't do more than that. And, frankly, now it's behind me. The one thing that counts is we have vaccines, and I'm glad I was part of the team that helped deliver that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Bottom line, do you think America is prepared for the next pandemic, and what do you think needs to be done differently now by the current administration?\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: We have to be better prepared, and the preparedness, in my view, should in particular include availability of manufacturing capabilities, which means manufacturing sites, manufacturing equipment and manufacturing people that are running the manufacturing of vaccines on an ongoing basis. We should be having laboratories and manufacturing sites dedicated to discovering, developing, manufacturing, and stockpiling vaccines, even if they are not useful now against known potential pathogens that can be pandemic agents. I think it's imperative. I think it's a matter that may cost five hundred million or a billion dollars a year. It's a drop in the ocean compared to the cost of the pandemic on a daily basis.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Slaoui, thank you for your time today.\u00a0DR. MONCEF SLAOUI: Thank you very much. Thank you for having me.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Our full interview with Doctor Slaoui is on our website at facethenation.com.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He sits on the board of Pfizer as well as Illumina, and he joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We-- when we spoke last Sunday you were very concerned about New York City and this new variant, 1.526 that's been circulating. You said you would be very cautious. What do we know now?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I'm still concerned about it. We're seeing cases and hospitalizations go down across New York, so that's a good-- good sign. Although testing has also plummeted. When you look in certain parts of New York, Brooklyn, parts of Queens, parts of Staten Island, the positivity rate is approaching fifteen percent. So you're seeing a lot of infection surging in pockets of New York City. What we don't understand with 1.526 is whether or not people are being reinfected with it and whether or not people who might have been vaccinated are now getting infected with it. One of the concerns about this particular variant is that it has that mutation that's also in the South African variant, the-- in the 1.351 variant, that we know in certain cases is causing people who have already had coronavirus to get reinfected with it. And so the question is-- is whether 1.526 is responsible for some of the increases that we're seeing in New York right now and whether this is the-- the beginning of a new outbreak inside the city. We're just not very good right now at collecting the cases and linking it back to the clinical experience. So we need to step in much more aggressively and start sequencing cases, especially people who report that they either were previously vaccinated or already had COVID.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say we, you mean the CDC. Who needs to do that?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: The CDC, I mean, they need to work with the New York City Public Health Department, but the city alone isn't going to have the resources to do this on a systematic basis. I think they're going to step in and start to do that. But they need to be aggressively marketing to doctors, asking doctors to come forward and report cases where they're seeing situations where people who were previously infected with COVID may be getting reinfected. We don't know that's happening. But, anecdotally, some doctors are reporting that now and that could potentially explain why you're seeing an upsurge in cases. It could just be that, you know, 1.526 and B.1.1.7 is becoming more prevalent and that's responsible in and of itself. But you want to make sure that it's not reinfecting people. Right now more than fifty percent of the infections in New York we know are with variants. And B1-- B1-- 1.526 is the most prevalent variant right now. We're probably undercounting it because we're biasing our-- our screening, our sequencing towards B.1.1.7. So we're probably missing cases of B.1.526 right now. It's probably more prevalent than what we're detecting.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to B.1.1.7, the variant first detected in the U.K., Doctor Fauci said this week it's about thirty percent of U.S. infections and it's, what, fifty percent more transmissible? It's also potentially more lethal. When you see these pictures of these spring break gatherings in Florida and elsewhere, does that make you rethink your projections here and worry about a fourth wave?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I don't think we're going to have a fourth wave, I think what we're seeing around the country is parts of the country that are plateauing, and we're seeing upticks in certain parts of the country. I think the fact that we have so much prior infection, a hundred twenty million Americans have been infected with this virus, the fact that we've now vaccinated, we've gotten one shot in at least seventy million Americans, even if you account for the fact that maybe about thirty percent of the people being vaccinated previously had COVID, we're talking about some form of protective immunity in about fifty-five percent of the population. So there's enough of a backstop here that I don't think you're going to see a fourth surge. I think what you could see is a plateauing for a period of time before we continue on a downward decline, in large part because B.1.1.7 is becoming more prevalent, in large part because we're pulling back too quickly with respect to taking off our masks and lifting the mitigation. But I still don't think that it's going to be enough to create a true fourth wave. If you look at in Europe, where they're having a true fourth wave, they've only vaccinated one in-- one in nine adults.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Here in the U.S., we've vaccinated one in three. In the U.K., which is seeing consistent declines, they've vaccinated one in two. So the vaccination is going to be a backstop, and we're continuing to vaccinate about three million people a day right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Mayor Garcetti of Los Angeles was essentially saying that. His hunch, it sounds like, is that these variants of concern in California already ripped through his population, that that's just what they saw with the epidemic in January. What do you think of his thesis?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's probably right. The-- the two variants that we're tracking in California probably have already become epidemic in that part of the country, and they probably have a level of prior immunity in the population that you're not going to see a true fourth wave. You might see a tick up, but once you get fifty, sixty percent of the public with some form of immunity, which is where we are in many parts of the country, there's not a lot of people left to infect. And, again, we're vaccinating against that. So we're continuing to put protective immunity into the population. I do think that the fact that we've sort of taken our foot off the brake a little too early here, March was always going to be a difficult month. People want to lean forward, but we really should have waited till April. The fact that we've done that now probably means that we're probably going to plateau. Maybe we'll see an uptick in certain parts of the country. The only thing that can be a real game-changer here is if we have a variant that pierces prior immunity, meaning it reinfects people who've either already been infected or who have been vaccinated, like the 1.351 variant, older P.1 variant, the one in Brazil. Now, those variants aren't epidemic in the U.S. They're just sporadic. But 1.526, the reason why people are concerned about it, including me, is it could be such a variant. We need to figure it out. We don't know right now. We need to get better at determining these things.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Gottlieb, thank you for your analysis.\u00a0We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The number of unaccompanied minors at the U.S.-Mexico border this spring is on track to be the highest ever. CBS News correspondent Mireya Villarreal has been covering the story from both sides of the border. We asked her to share what she's been seeing.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MIREYA VILLARREAL: Every day they see between two and three hundred people, every day.\u00a0As a journalist, you're taught to just report the facts, but riding in the back of a pickup truck along the banks of the Rio Grande River provides perspective most people don't usually get.\u00a0(Roger Rich speaking foreign language)\u00a0(Man #1 speaking foreign language)\u00a0MIREYA VILLARREAL: When you see a group of migrants--\u00a0She's scared.\u00a0There's more?\u00a0ROGER RICH: Yeah, there's more coming.\u00a0MIREYA VILLARREAL: --filled with children, babies, a ten-year-old boy traveling alone from Honduras.\u00a0He said God-- God is watching over him. That's why he's not scared.\u00a0It's hard to contain your emotions as a human.\u00a0So he's ten. And he doesn't know where he dad is. His mom is in Honduras. There's a family up there that's going to kind of watch over him.\u00a0Fleeing violence, poor living conditions and corruption in their home countries, many travel for months to get here. They are hungry, wet, and desperate for a chance to request asylum, a right afforded to everyone, no matter how they get here, by a United Nations Treaty in 1951 and U.S. law in 1980.\u00a0ROGER RICH: Well, this is one of the main crossing areas where they like to cross because it's-- it's very secluded out here.\u00a0MIREYA VILLARREAL: We embedded with local constables who are helping respond to the latest surge of migrants in South Texas.\u00a0MAN #2: You have to be escorted to film.\u00a0MIREYA VILLARREAL: Because federal agencies won't allow media access to shelters or processing facilities.\u00a0MAN #2: But you cannot be here.\u00a0MIREYA VILLARREAL: For decades the border has been used as a pawn to push political agendas forward, but all efforts to find any kind of solution have failed. Local leaders on the ground on both sides of the border are tired of the federal government's inability to fix the system.\u00a0This is actually a church school that has now been converted into a shelter for migrants. Have a lot of people from a lot of different areas. One thing they have in common is they-- they want to be able to have their chance to go into the U.S., ask for asylum.\u00a0City governments, nonprofits and faith-based organizations are once again bearing the brunt of this humanitarian crisis.\u00a0(Man #3 speaking foreign language)\u00a0MIREYA VILLARREAL: So we just spoke with this family over here. She's six years old. They crossed the river. They'll be asking for asylum. And he said he wasn't scared.\u00a0SISTER NORMA PIMENTEL: It is not about whether they should be here or not. They are here. So what we need to do is work together to care for them correctly.\u00a0MIREYA VILLARREAL: The Biden administration refuses to call this a crisis. Instead, they see it as a very serious challenge. But the word crisis is defined as a situation that has reached a critical phase--\u00a0(Man #4 speaking foreign language)\u00a0MIREYA VILLARREAL: --a sentiment we clearly saw from the back of that pickup truck along the banks of the Rio Grande.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Our Mireya Villarreal reporting from the U.S.-Mexico border.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today.

            "article_content": "U.S. Capitol Police initially rejected help from the Department of Homeland Security during the assault on the Capitol on January 6, according to former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf.\u00a0 Wolf says that he offered to send DHS law enforcement backup just after 2 p.m. that day, after a violent mob of Trump supporters had begun to infiltrate the Capitol. That initial offer was rebuffed by Capitol Police, Wolf told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. \"Capitol Police turned us down, initially. And they said 'No, we've got it under control,'\" Wolf said in an interview for \"The Takeout\" podcast this week. DHS eventually dispatched about 100 Secret Service personnel to help quell the insurrection. \"I'm not sure that there was a lot of clarity that was coming out of Capitol Police at that time.\" Wolf criticized the Capitol Police response to the attack, suggesting that leadership should have been more prepared, given the large number of protesters expected in Washington on January 6. \"You're gonna have 35,000 people show up in D.C., you have to plan for the worst. That is your job as law enforcement and a first responder is you plan for the worst. We did that at DHS,\" Wolf told Garrett. \"I think the Capitol Police are having to explain why they did not plan for the very worst.\"\u00a0 Wolf says he never saw the intelligence assessment issued by the Norfolk, Virginia, FBI field office on the eve of the attack \u2014 it notified law enforcement of an anonymous social media thread threatening war at the U.S. Capitol. The assessment was forwarded by email to a lieutenant in the House's protective and intelligence operations but went no further up the chain of command. Still, Wolf doesn't believe that the events of January 6 were an \"intelligence failure\" because law enforcement agencies were aware of the potential threat.\u00a0 \"I think what is most critical that most folks are taking a look at is, why didn't we have more intelligence saying that they were going to storm the Capitol, that they were going to try to break through the barriers. You always want that type of granular intelligence for any type of law enforcement operation. We'd love to have that, and if it was out there to that level of degree and clarity and credibility, and that wasn't shared, I would say 'yes, that is a failure.' That's not what occurred here,\" Wolf said. \"There was a lot of intelligence there.\" \"It was a lack of execution of a plan, if one was in place,\" he said. Congress has held hearings on the security and planning failures that precipitated the insurrection, which resulted in the deaths of five people. Wolf told Garrett he's willing to testify before Congress, but hasn't yet been asked to do so. His main concern is that DHS determine \"how do we provide information to our state and local partners.\" \"I think the general information that was being shared was just a general heightened threat environment and that 'you need to scale up your protective measures accordingly.' And we certainly did that at DHS, and I think others will have to question and answer why they didn't do that as well,\" Wolf said.\u00a0 DHS \"immediately established a crisis action team to monitor the situation\" as the events of January 6 unfolded,\" Melissa Smislova, the acting undersecretary in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) at DHS, told lawmakers this week. But Capitol Police also faced other hurdles in securing the Capitol. Major General William Walker, the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, testified before Congress Wednesday that it took Pentagon leaders more than three hours to approve a request for National Guard troops to assist Capitol Police officers overwhelmed by the violent mob. \"The word that I kept hearing was the 'optics' of it,\" Walker said. \"There was some concern that it could inflame the protesters.\" Wolf says he has no insight into the delay in deploying troops; he told Garrett he wasn't involved in those discussions. Wolf also weighed in on the 2020 election, calling it \"free and fair,\" which former President Trump has still refused to acknowledge. However, he acknowledged that DHS does not address voter fraud. When asked if there were any issues with the election from the perspective of the DHS, Wolf said that \"from a cyber and foreign influence standpoint, we saw very little to almost none.\" Wolf also criticized the executive orders and actions the Biden administration had taken with regard to immigration, including rolling back some Trump administration policies. \"A lot of these actions are actually very, very dangerous. Because what they are doing, taken together, is they are fueling the crisis that we see on the border today,\" Wolf said. \"They're incentivizing vulnerable populations to continue to come to that border.\" For more of Major's conversation with Wolf, download \"The Takeout\" podcast on\u00a0Art19,\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0GooglePlay,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher.

And this week on FACE THE NATION, it's Super Bowl Sunday. We'll look at how to prevent it from becoming superspreader Sunday. Plus, we'll have more of CBS' exclusive interview with President Biden. For the first time in months, COVID-19 numbers are moving in the right direction. Infection and hospitalization rates in the U.S. are all headed down, and the number of Americans vaccinated is going up. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Job number one of the American Rescue Plan is vaccines. Vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: That American Rescue Plan is President Biden's two-trillion-dollar economic aid package moving through Congress. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Once-in-a-century virus has decimated our economy, and it's still wreaking havoc on our economy today. And so much of it is still about the virus. We're still in the teeth of this pandemic. MARGARET BRENNAN: But will that effort slow down due to distractions on Capitol Hill, such as the second impeachment trial of former President Trump revisiting a dark and terrifying day in American history. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (January 6): And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. (January 6): So go home. We love you. You're very special. MARGARET BRENNAN: Republican Senator Lindsey Graham will join us, along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. We'll talk with the World Health Organization's COVID-19 lead, Doctor Maria Van Kerkhove. And, finally, a look at the NFL struggles in the pandemic with our own CBS News special correspondent and host of the NFL Today James Brown. It's all just ahead this Super Bowl Sunday here on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. More than a hundred million people are expected to tune into Super Bowl LV later today. Either on the CBS broadcast or streaming networks. And another COVID record will be set, that of the least number of in-stadium spectators for a Super Bowl. Just twenty-five thousand fans will see the game in person, including seventy-five hundred vaccinated health care workers. Senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann reports from Tampa. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): Super Bowl LV in Tampa faces one known threat: COVID-19, the NFL blitz with adjustments, a stadium one-third full, cardboard-like cutouts will outnumber people. Mandatory face masks. ROGER GOODELL (NFL Commissioner): We had a lot of unknowns ourselves. We had to adapt at every stage, just like everybody else. MARK STRASSMANN: For fans watching anywhere, the CDC urges no chanting or cheering and mask up. ALEX VILLANUEVA: It's the Super Bowl, not the stupid bowl. MARK STRASSMANN: But parties outside the stadiums spread worry or worse about masks, social distancing, and potential spikes unrelated to a touchdown celebration. Concerns already realized overnight in North Carolina. Now some good news: COVID America's various benchmarks suggest transmission has dropped to pre-Thanksgiving levels. This week new cases fell below one million nationally, at least a ten-percent drop at nineteen states, more than twenty-five percent in twenty others. COVID hospitalizations down more than twenty percent the past two weeks. ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Now is not the time to let our guard down. Keep taking steps to protect each other. MARK STRASSMANN: And vaccinate quickly. Of the nearly sixty million doses delivered, less than two-thirds have actually made it into arms. Starting Thursday the first of sixty-five hundred retail pharmacies, big players like CVS and Walgreens will become vaccination centers. The federal government will ship them roughly one million doses weekly. Maryland's building this mass vaccination site. But America's frustrated. Demand still dwarfs supply. GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN (R-Maryland): We can vaccinate everyone in the state, that's why we're building all of this. But we can't do anything without the vaccines. MARK STRASSMANN: Other vaccination issues, long lines, line jumping, lack of access, lack of equity, and who gets priority. Nearly half of states now say its teachers with CDC guidance expected this week on reopening schools. GIRL: Learning on Zoom has been really hard, especially because I can't always get the help I need. KAREN TURNER: No, no, no, no. MAN: Stop resisting. MARK STRASSMANN: Unbridled, unmasked, like this belligerent woman in an Ohio grocery store, a year into the pandemic. KAREN TURNER: Let-- get-- oh, illegal search. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Health officials worry that Super Bowl Sunday could become superspreader Sunday. They're encouraging virtual parties and for all fans to watch the game at home only with people they live with. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, thank you. One Super Bowl tradition that is going on as planned this year, the pre-game interview with the President. Our Norah O'Donnell sat down with President Biden on Friday. She talked to him about China and also about the challenges of reentering the nuclear deal with Iran, which has begun enriching nuclear fuel close to weapons-grade levels. (Begin VT) NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS EVENING NEWS): The U.S.-China relationship is probably one of the most important in the entire world. Why haven't you called Xi Jinping? PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN (CBS EVENING NEWS): Well, we haven't had occasion to-- to talk to one another yet. There's no reason not to call him. I probably spent more time with Xi Jinping, I'm told, than any world leader has because I-- I had twenty-four, twenty-five hours of private meetings with him when I was vice president, traveled seventeen thousand miles with him. I know him pretty well. NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS EVENING NEWS): There is a lot to talk about? PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN (CBS EVENING NEWS): A lot to talk about, a whole lot to talk about. And he's very bright. He's very tough. He doesn't have-- and I don't mean this is a criticism, just the reality, he doesn't have a democratic, small D, bone in his body. But he is-- the question is I've said to him all along that we need not have a-- a conflict. But there's going to be extreme competition. And I'm not going to do it the way that he knows and that's because he's sending signals as well. And I'm not going to do it the way Trump did. We're going to focus on international rules of the road. NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS EVENING NEWS): Will the U.S. lift sanctions first in order to get Iran back to the negotiating table? PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN (CBS EVENING NEWS): No. NORAH O'DONNELL (CBS EVENING NEWS): They have to stop enriching uranium first? (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: It appears there is a standoff. Overnight Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Iran will not scale back its atomic work until the U.S. removes all sanctions. More of Norah's interview will air on the 4:00 PM hour of Super Bowl pregame coverage right here on CBS. We want to go now to Senator Lindsey Graham in Clemson, South Carolina. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina/@LindseyGrahamSC): Good morning. Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran has threatened to kick out U.N. inspectors within the next three weeks if sanctions are not lifted. You heard the President. Where do you think the stalemate goes from here? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, the Trump administration put Iran in a box. As a result, you got four or five Arab nations doing peace agreements with Israel. I think Iran is weaker today than they've been since the regime was started about forty years ago. So if I were President Biden, I would keep the sanctions on until Iran changed its behavior. I would not want to go into an old deal with Iran because they've been up to no good for too long. So he's going to have three problems here: what to do with Iran differently than Trump, what to do with China different than Trump and how to change Trump immigration policies without creating a run on the border. I would caution President Biden because Trump did it doesn't mean it's wrong. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: So I would slow down if I were President Biden and re-evaluate some of these Trump policies and keep them in place if they make sense. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've known the Biden family for years. Have you spoken to the President since inauguration? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: No, I haven't. Congratulations \u00a0to-- to him. He's the legitimate President. I talked to Secretary Blinken two days ago. I'm very pleased with what the Biden administration is proposing for Afghanistan. We're going to keep troops there on a conditions-based approach. MARGARET BRENNAN: Past May? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: The Afghan study group came out with a good-- say again? MARGARET BRENNAN: Past May, which is when the Trump deal would call for conditions-based drawdown? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think it's-- I think it was-- yeah, I think we're not going to leave in May. We're going to leave when the conditions are right. The-- the Taliban have been cheating. They haven't been complying. And so I like what Tony Blinken and the Biden administration is doing. They are reevaluating our presence in Afghanistan to keep the footprint low, but not to walk away and lose all the gains we've achieved. If we leave too soon without a conditions-based withdrawal ISIS and al Qaeda will come roaring back. Women will suffer greatly. So they're in a good spot, I think, on Afghanistan. When it comes to Iran, I would caution the Biden administration to go back into the Iranian deal. There's a proposal by myself and Senator Menendez-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --that the Iranians can have all the nuclear power they want. They just can't enrich. And I think Arabs would sign up for that deal, which would be a good deal for the world. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll stay tuned for-- for what the policy is. I want to ask you about what's happening here at home with the scheduled trial that is supposed to begin on Tuesday of former President Donald Trump. You voted against holding that trial, but you said this on the morning after the siege of the Capitol: SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (Jan 7, 2021): When it comes to accountability, the President needs to understand that his actions were the problem, not the solution, that the rally yesterday was unseemly. It got out of hand. It breaks my heart that my friend, a President of a consequence would allow yesterday to happen. And it will be a major part of his presidency. It was a self-inflicted wound. It was going too far. MARGARET BRENNAN: What changed? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, it's not a crime. I mean the House is impeaching him under the theory that his speech created a riot. When you look at the facts, many people had already planned the-- to attack the Capitol before he ever spoke. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the trial memorandum from the-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: The President said at the rally I think was-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The trial memorandum from the House impeachment managers actually lays out a pattern of behavior. They say it wasn't just the speech. They say this was cultivated over time. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, well, here's what I would say, that if you believe you committed a crime, he can be prosecuted like any other citizen. Impeachment is a political process. We've never impeached a president once they're out of office. I think this is a very bad idea. Forty-five plus Republicans are going to vote early on that it's unconstitutional. It's not a question of how the trial ends. It's a question of when it ends. Republicans are going to view this as an unconstitutional exercise. And the only question is, will they call witnesses? How long does the trial take? But the outcome is really not in doubt. That doesn't mean what happened on January the 6th was okay. It means his impeachment, in the eyes of most Republicans, is an unconstitutional exercise. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: The President's behavior, in my view, is not a crime, but he can be charged with one if people think he committed it because he's now a private citizen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some Republicans, your colleague, Pat Toomey, a Republican, believe that this is constitutional since the President was impeached while he was still in office. But, you know, people can look at this and say, look, when you can't argue a case on its merits, you argue on process. And that's what Republicans are doing right now. Because I want to ask you to clarify this. You said on January 7th, this about Mike Pence: SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: The things he were-- he was asked to do in the name of loyalty were over the top, unconstitutional, illegal, and would have been wrong for the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Unconstitutional and illegal sounds a lot like high crimes and misdemeanors. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, well, he wasn't charged with that. The bottom line is the impeachment articles, I think, are unconstitutional because the President is in Florida. He's not in office. Impeachment for a president requires the chief justice to preside over the trial. He's not at the trial because President Trump is not the \"President.\" So this is not process. The Constitution, I think, is being flagrantly violated because, when it comes to Trump, there seems to be no end to all of this. So, the trial is going to result in an acquittal. Most Republicans, I don't know what Senator Toomey is going to do, is going to view this as unconstitutional and the President's behavior is not incitement under the law. And the longer it takes, the worse off for the country, I believe. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said if the President committed a crime, he should be charged. Do you think any of the President's actions, the tweets calling for the rally, the language leading up to the rally, the lying to the public about the ability to overturn the election, what you described he said about Mike Pence, does any of that deserve a reprimand? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I mean, he's going to have a place in history for all this, but the point of the matter is that we're in Congress. We're not prosecutors. Impeachment is never meant to be a prosecution. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you have oversight of the Justice Department. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: We don't do bill of attainders. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah, I think I'm ready to move on. I'm ready to end the impeachment trial because I think it is blatantly unconstitutional. I'm ready to get on with trying to solve the nation's problems. And as to Donald Trump, he is the most popular figure in the Republican Party. He had a consequential presidency. January the 6th was a very bad day for America, and he'll get his share of blame in history. But I do believe that in 2022, the Republican Party is going to come roaring back because our friends on the Democratic Party-- on the Democratic side are going to change immigration policy to have caravan after caravan hit our borders. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you still believe he is the head of the Republican Party? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: They're going to raise our taxes, and they are going to weaken us across the board. Excuse me again? I'm sorry. MARGARET BRENNAN: You still believe President Trump is the best face for the Republican Party? Yes or no? SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think he's-- I think he's the-- yeah, I think, yeah. I think-- I think Donald Trump's policies served the country well. I think Donald Trump has to rehabilitate-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --himself as a politician. But here's what I think. I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Wait-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --most Americans are going to look-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --at the Biden administration and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm-- I'm sorry we are-- we are out of time. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I'm sorry go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I'm sorry here to-- SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Okay. MARGARET BRENNAN: --cut you off, I have to take us to a commercial break. Thank you for your time this morning. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to the former Fed chairwoman and new Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen. She joins us in Washington. Good morning to you, Madam Secretary. JANET YELLEN (Treasury Secretary/@JanetYellen): Good morning, and thank you so much for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know the U.S. is still ten million jobs short of where we were before this pandemic. Many people have stopped looking for work. Is the jobs market stalling? JANET YELLEN: Well, I'm afraid that the job market is stalling. We saw that in Friday's employment report, just six thousand private sector jobs created, forty-nine thousand overall, and that's after a month in which we actually saw job loss. So, yeah, we have ten million people unemployed. Four million have dropped out of the labor market and another two million are working part time who really would like full-time work. So we have-- we're in a deep hole with respect to the job market and a long way to dig out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, the unemployment rate for men and women is relatively similar. But the President's economic adviser, Jared Bernstein, said this past week the number of women who've left the workforce is of great concern and unusual in a recession. What's driving that and how do you get women back into the workforce? JANET YELLEN: Well, you know, women really are-- many face just an impossible situation in which they have children they have to take care of who weren't in school and would be facing increasing demands on the job. And many, over two million, have dropped out of the labor force because it's so hard to manage that-- that conflict. And the-- the package, the American Rescue package that President Biden has proposed really addresses the problems that women face. It places huge emphasis on getting our schools open safely, getting children back into school, providing paid family and medical leave during this crisis so that women don't have to leave their jobs when they're faced with health issues or family issues that they have to address. There's emphasis on providing more childcare and-- and payments, tax credits expanded for children to help families address these needs. And I think this is really necessary to get women back to work. They've faced a-- a disproportionate burden because of this crisis, especially low-wage women and women of color. MARGARET BRENNAN: Those emergency paid leave provisions would expire in September. During your confirmation hearings you talked about the U.S. needing to make these more permanent, essentially, to stay competitive with the rest of the developed world. Is getting U.S. to adopt a legal mandate for expanded paid leave and childcare your ultimate goal? JANET YELLEN: Well, it's certainly something that President Biden is interested in and, you know, the current package that he's proposed, the American rescue package, is intended to deal with the immediate crisis, the economic crisis and the healthcare crisis. But beyond that he looks forward to proposing ideas to-- to address longstanding challenges that our economy has faced. MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a yes in the future. Let's talk about now. In this current rescue-- JANET YELLEN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: --package, who-- what should determine who is eligible for a stimulus check? Should it be your-- your 2019 income level or your unemployment status? JANET YELLEN: Well, you know, President Biden wants to make sure that the-- the payments that he's proposed, fourteen-hundred-dollar hundred payments to make good on the total two-thousand-dollar pledge, goes to families that really need it, that are struggling. And, of course, it shouldn't go to very well-off family-- families that don't need the funds and haven't been hard hit by the crisis. So, he's discussing the appropriate cutoffs and phase-ins with members of Congress and is open to negotiating on those. But there are a lot of families that are struggling with lower income and need-- need those payments. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know sending people checks in the mail, though, the criticism is that this is more about politics than economics. Some of your fellow economists have been very critical. Stanford's John Cogan claims seventy percent of stimulus payments from last year were either saved or used to pay debt. Mark Zandi of Moody's, who-- who the President often references, said stimulus checks are not the most effective type of support and said much of it goes to households that don't need the funds. Given that how do you justify writing these checks? JANET YELLEN: Well, it has to go to people and households that do need the money and those are lower income households, and we need to make sure that the cut-offs are appropriate so that households that are doing really well maybe have seen their stock portfolios rise and make a lot of income and haven't lost their jobs, those households shouldn't be getting it. There is a lot more-- MARGARET BRENNAN: What's your floor and ceiling on that? JANET YELLEN: --targeted relief also. Well, I-- I don't have specifics for you today. These are matters that President Biden is discussing with members of Congress and is open to reviewing what's-- what's appropriate. But he is committed to providing the fourteen hundred dollars of payments to those who qualify. MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's no jobs creation program in here. The President says he wants that massive infrastructure bill to be next. And job creation is what we need to see. Don't you risk spending your political capital now when you need to create jobs in this next bill? JANET YELLEN: Well, there will be another bill that addresses job creation through infrastructure development, through investment in people, in education and training, addresses climate change, improves the competitiveness of our economy and is designed to create good jobs with good pay that involve create-- careers for people. But right now this package will do a huge amount to create jobs. The spending it will generate is going to lead to demand for workers, help put people back to work, especially when we can get vaccinations and the public health situation to the point where the economy can begin to open up again. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, there's been some wild swings in the price of GameStop. Are markets functioning properly? JANET YELLEN: We really need to look in detail to understand what happened in those-- in those stocks over the last couple of weeks. I would say that the core infrastructure of the markets, the plumbing, ability to trade, clearing settlement, those infrastructures performed well. But we need to make sure that investors are adequately protected, that they understand the risks, and that we have fair and efficient markets. And we'll be looking into all of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Secretary, thank you for your time. And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up in our next half hour, a Super Bowl preview with our own James Brown. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Vaccine efforts around the world are also picking up speed. Senior foreign correspondent Liz Palmer reports from London. (Begin VT) ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@CBSLizpalmer): Good morning. There was a good news milestone this week: The number of vaccinations given worldwide was greater for the first time than the number of new recorded COVID cases. (Begin VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: That's partly due to aggressive public health action. Like here in Brazil teams pushed into the Amazon to vaccinate people in remote villages who wouldn't have a hope of getting to an ICU, and the very first vaccine shipment arrived in South Africa this week. Such a big deal that officials, including the president, came out to welcome it in the pouring rain. But wherever there is vaccine in both the developing and the developed world there are plenty of takers. From Morocco to Sweden, where the majestic hall normally used to award the Nobel Peace Prize was being repurposed as a vaccination center. In spite of the progress, though, this pandemic is more lethal now than it was last spring. Twice as many people are dying daily than in mid-April 2020. With terrifying local surges, the worst of them at the moment in Portugal. It's got the highest death rate anywhere in the world. And it had to welcome German doctors and equipment to help. COVID has reminded millions that life in fleeting and precious. Take Rosario, hospitalized with COVID in Madrid, she was wheeled to see Fernando, her partner of fourteen years. He'd finally proposed to her, by text, from his bed, and she joyfully replied. ROSARIO: Yes. (End VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: It's also worth noting, Margaret, that in this push to vaccine, there are some deliberate holdouts, notably New Zealand and Australia. They closed their borders early on. They have virtually no COVID cases. And so for now they have decided just to watch and wait. MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz Palmer in London, thank you. We want to go now to the World Health Organization's COVID-19 lead. That's Doctor Maria Van Kerkhove. She joins us from Geneva, Switzerland. Good to have you with us, Doctor. MARIA VAN KERKHOVE, PhD (World Health Organization COVID-19 Lead/@mvankerkhove): Hi, Margaret. Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're an epidemiologist. You specialize in zoonotics, which means you know a lot about how these viruses jump between species like COVID did. These new variants, you've described them as a combination of mutations all at the same time. What does that mean? MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: Mm-Hm. Well, these viruses change all the time, and-- and every time they replicate, the more they spread, the more changes that they can have. These are called mutations. These are individual changes in the genome itself. These variants have had a combination of mutations, which mean a number of mutations identified at the same time. And so that means that this clustering of these-- of these mutations happening at the same time are quite different than individual-level mutations. And we've had three such variants being reported, actually four such variants being reported in the last few months. The first in Denmark, the second reported from the United Kingdom, the third from the-- South Africa and the fourth from Brazil. MARGARET BRENNAN: So which countries have actually been successful in-- in containing the virus and is there a common approach to their success? MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: Well, that's a great question. There's-- there is a common approach that many countries have taken to control the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including these virus variants that have been detected. And it's a combination of factors. It's in-- it's individual levels that we've-- individual-level measures that we've seen people take, you and I, in terms of our physical distancing, our mask wearing, our avoiding of crowded spaces, our opening of windows, our sneezing into our elbow. All of those measures are really critical, as well as government-led responses where we have all-of-government, all-of-society approach, where we're conducting active case finding, where we know where the virus is. We can support people who are infected through good clinical care. We make sure that those individuals are isolated. Any contacts of confirmed cases are provided supported quarantine so that if they are infected themselves, there is no opportunity for them to pass the virus to others, making sure that we open up our workplaces safely, our schools safely. It's a combination of factors, and many countries have done well in-- in having an aggressive approach to making sure that they have the testing, the tracing, the clinical care and really strong, empowered, enabled, and engaged communities. It's all of this. You hear us say a lot, do it all. This is what we mean by when we say do it all. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you're talking about things like enforcing quarantine, I-- it sounds like you're talking about Australia, New Zealand. Are those the best examples? MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: We have great examples all over the world of how countries have used these-- these combinations of factors. When I use the word \"quarantine,\" I'm using this in the sense of contacts of confirmed cases. So when you have a case that is infected, that individual who is infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus needs to be provided with good clinical care, and they need to be isolated from others so that they don't have the opportunity to pass it to someone else. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: But before they go into isolation, they may have many contacts, and those contacts of individuals who-- of cases need to be provided supported quarantine, which means they're separated from others and provided food and care and safety and security for fourteen days while they wait and make sure that they're not infected themselves, they get a test themselves, but they don't have the opportunity to pass to others. South-- South Africa is-- is a good example where they got through their first peak, countries across Asia and the Pacific, including Australia and New Zealand. But, in fact, we've actually seen really strong responses across Europe during their first peak-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: --where over the summer months in Europe cases were down to single digits. And they showed us, and many countries across Africa, across Europe, across the Americas, have shown that they can drive transmission down. And this is really, really critical now that we have these virus variants being detected because the more opportunities this virus has to spread-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: --the more opportunities it has to change. So we need to make sure we prevent as many infections as we can. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which part of the world is going to be most complicated to vaccinate? MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: Ooh. That's a great question. We need to vaccinate people at-risk all over the world. So, I think there are different complicating factors in-- in different parts of the world for different reasons. But what we want to make sure that we do is, number one, that we have multiple safe and effective vaccines that are in production, that continue to be tested, continue to be studied, to continue to come online-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you concerned by this AstraZeneca report? MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: That we have good production capacities all over the world. Say that again-- say that again. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you-- are you concerned by this reporting that AstraZeneca's vaccine may not be effective against the South African variant, B1351? MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: Yes. So the B1351 variant was identified-- first identified in South Africa, there's a number of studies that are underway to look at the response of the body, the immune response of the body, but also the impact of vaccination. There are some preliminary studies suggesting reduced efficacy, but, again, those studies aren't fully published yet. And our group, our-- our independent panel group on vaccinations, is meeting tomorrow to specifically discuss the AstraZeneca vaccine, as well as the results coming out of South Africa to determine what does this mean in terms of the vaccines going forward. But this is why it's really, really critical that we have more than one safe and effective vaccine. We cannot rely on only one product, and that is not the goal of anyone around the world. So, that is definitely something we need to continue to push forward. But, again, vaccines are not just enough. It's vaccination that's really critical. We need to make sure everyone who is at risk, you know, the old-- elderly, people who are most at risk for severe disease, receive the vaccine-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: --in all countries around the world, as well as health workers all around the world, as opposed to everybody in just a handful of countries. MARGARET BRENNAN: World Health Organization investigators a year after the outbreak began in China have now been allowed in to look at what happened on the ground. Is this just a show by the Chinese government? MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: No, it's not. In fact, we have a team of ten international scientists. You called them investigators, but, indeed, they're-- they're scientists from a number of different technical fields, as well as people from WHO, my colleagues. And we have colleagues from FAO and OIE who are supporting the mission, as well. And this is-- these are studies that are ongoing to find the virus origins and understand the intermediate hosts. You know what were the zoonotic origins of this pandemic? And this is really, really critical from a public health perspective so that we know and we can take steps further to prevent this from happening again. They're very good discussions that are having on the ground. There are constructive exchanges between this international team from ten different countries, as well as the Chinese counterparts, looking at the earliest cases, looking at studies from the markets. They've had visits to hospitals. They've had visits to two laboratories, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARIA VAN KERKHOVE: --as well as visiting different levels of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control. So, we're hoping for the reports as soon as possible, and that will be made available as soon as it can be. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Doctor, thank you for your time this morning. Good luck to you. We'll be right back with Doctor Scott Gottlieb. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He sits on the board of Pfizer as well as Illumina, and he joins us this morning from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard from Doctor Van Kerkhove, and-- and she outlined all the mutations here. What is the bottom line from what she was laying out? I mean she did seem to indicate there are concerns about this AstraZeneca vaccine and its efficacy against B1351 out of South Africa. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think there's a rule of thumb we can assume that the vaccines are probably going to be about twenty percent less effective against these new variants from Brazil and South Africa, which has mutated some key regions of the protein that we target with our vaccines. We've seen that now in a Novavax trial, in the J&J trial, as well as with the AstraZeneca vaccine. The mRNA vaccines-- and I'm on the board of Pfizer, which developed one of those, are very efficacious. And so even if we see a reduction in the efficacy of those vaccines, and it may not be as profound with those vaccines, you're still getting very good protection with those vaccines. And, frankly, you're getting very good protection with the J&J vaccine as well. So I do think that the existing vaccines are going to offer reasonable protection against these new variants. And we also may be able to develop in a timely fashion, maybe in four to six months, a consensus strain that bakes in a lot of the different variation that we're seeing to have boosters available for the fall. So I think that there is a reasonable chance that we're going to be able to stay ahead of this virus as it mutates. Trevor Bedford at the Hutch has done some good work on this, and some people are speculating right now that this virus may have gone-- undergone a really significant evolutionary leap, if you will. It's mutated a lot all at once in different parts of the world, but it's not going to continue to mutate at the same rate. It may have reached a new fitness level, but-- but it's going to slow down. It's not going to continue to change as much. So we're going to be able to keep up with it. MARGARET BRENNAN: I asked the doctor about the probe underway in China. From your view, how important is it to know the origins of the first strain that-- that we learned of with COVID-19 in China? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think it's important from a political standpoint, and I think it's important from a public health standpoint, so we know what the risk is for future transmission, for future jumps from zoonotic sources into-- into the human population. And we kind of better understand the risk from coronaviruses more generally. I don't think we're going to find out and we're certainly not going to be able to find out with any level of certainty that's going to put to rest some of the speculation that this could have been a lab source. Now, most people believe that this was a zoonotic source. You know as well as I do, there's still speculation even in the government that it could have been from an accident in a laboratory. We know that that Wuhan laboratory was doing a lot of experimentation. It had a big repository of coronaviruses. I don't expect that the WHO mission is going to firmly put that to rest. We would need access to the source strains. I suspect they're not going to get that. That information, if it's available, the Chinese government would have that. And so far they have not made that available. MARGARET BRENNAN: You told us on this program last Sunday that it was Miami and Southern California that you were most concerned about as hot spots for this B117 strain detected in the U.K. Are there-- are those still the areas of greatest concern for you? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, and Florida's growing pretty significantly right now, between five and ten percent of the infections in Florida are B117, that U.K. variant, the more contagious variant and that's centered in southern Florida. I think that what's going to happen in Florida right now, they're continuing to show declines in new infections like the rest of the country. I think as the rest of the country continues to come down that curve, you're going to see a leveling off in Florida. And while I don't think that they're going to have another surge of infection, they could have persistent high infection because B117 is gaining a better-- better foothold in that part of the country. Southern California is probably right now about five percent of infections are B117. So they're a little further behind Florida. For the rest of the country, it's probably less than one percent all around the country. Now, there could be localized hotspots-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --particular counties where you have an outbreak of B117 but I think for the most part around the country it's probably too little, too late. We'll probably be able to get ahead of it with our vaccines and the seasonal effect from the warming weather. MARGARET BRENNAN: Getting ahead of it's a good thing. The CDC is expected to release guidelines this week on how to safely reopen schools. The CDC director said vaccination of teachers is not a prerequisite. What should be a prerequisite? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think the prerequisite is putting in place mitigation steps in the schools. The school districts that have reopened successfully and it was good data out of North Carolina where they did some sys-- systematic research looking at the experience in those schools which were open, showed that when they wear masks, when they distance, when they try to take precautions in the classroom, there's very little transmission within the classroom. The schools are not a vector of transmission and especially children under the age of fourteen are less likely to both get infected and transmit the infection. I think it certainly would be good to be able to prioritize teachers to get them vaccinated so they're not at risk from contracting the infection and spreading the infection. But I don't think it's necessarily a prerequisite. I think schools have demonstrated that they can open safely if they take precautions in the classroom. MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to getting vaccines out there, we know retail pharmacies will begin receiving shipments this week. The Biden administration is sticking with that Trump plan of giving doses based on population. Is this the best way to get doses into the arms of the public? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think for now. You know they've made a lot of progress. We've had some days where there's two million vaccines that have been delivered. I think we're going to see that more consistently. That's going to be the run rate. As we get into March, by the end of March, we'll have delivered two hundred and fifty million vaccines onto the market if the J&J vaccine gets authorized and in April we'll probably deliver another hundred million vaccines onto the market. If you assume a sixty-forty split between first doses and second doses, you assume about sixty percent of the supply that's coming onto the market is going to first doses-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --by the end of March we'll have delivered a hundred and fifty million vaccines and in April, another sixty million, we're going to run out of demand. I mean I think we need to start thinking about the demand side of this equation soon. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Doctor Gottlieb, good to talk to you as always. And we'll be back with a preview of Super Bowl LV. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) KENAN THOMPSON (SNL/Broadway Video): Hello, and welcome to the Super Bowl, four hours of television for eleven minutes of action. I am James, no, not that one, Brown. As everyone at home knows, this year has been anything but normal. The pandemic, racial and political divisions, Armie Hammer, but today we come together in a spirit of unity to watch football and murder billions of chickens for their delicious wings. MARGARET BRENNAN: That, of course, was not CBS, but about last night's Saturday Night Live. And we want to go now to the real James Brown. JB is CBS News special correspondent and host of the NFL Today. But really, JB, you don't need any introduction here. How are you doing? JAMES BROWN (CBS News Special Correspondent/@JBsportscaster/Host, The NFL Today): Margaret, I didn't see the beginning of SNL. My text messages started blowing up as I'm trying to go to bed last night, but that's an appropriate opening to say the least. So I'm looking forward to it. And thank you for giving me a little bit of levity to start. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, congratulations . This is your tenth Super Bowl, I understand. But, I mean, you-- I have no doubt, have never seen anything quite like pulling this off in the midst of a pandemic. What is going to be different this year? JAMES BROWN: Well, the fact that we won't have a packed house, that adds immeasurably to any big event, the pomp and circumstance of it and the excitement of the fans, we won't have that. But the players will be thrilled to have at least the twenty-two to twenty-five thousand who will be there. That really does influence them significantly. Obviously, a lot of the pomp and circumstance surrounding the Super Bowl, the parties, the celebrations and all of those things have been nonexistent. So it's a little different that way, but we're glad to get to this point. Heavens, who would've thunk it that we would have gone through seventeen weeks of the regular season, getting two hundred and fifty-six games in, and now we're at the Super Bowl, but that's a real tribute to the players, the teams, and the coaches who have-- who have adhered to the COVID protocols, by and large, throughout this season. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's significant that there even is a Super Bowl. But I'm wondering, JB, what are you hearing about what comes next for the league? Are we going to see athletics get vaccinated or be part of sort of a public relations push to encourage Americans to go get that shot in the arm? JAMES BROWN: Excellent question. A number of players are doing that at present. And I'm certain, given that you're involved in news full time, you know that there has been a bit of a challenge in communities of color to embrace the vaccinations. So you see a number of the athletes, especially those of color, who are doing PSAs to encourage people. You know, personally, it's-- I say it's a personal decision, do your homework and examine it to see what makes sense for you. But there is a push. I would think we'll see a lot more of that. However, the other elephant in the room is I've been told by league officials that they will not advocate for having a priority position in terms of being vaccinated, because as you well know with the sobering news surrounding this, there are far more people who are in need of that as opposed to athletes trying to move to the front of the line. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. We spoke to the head of the Players Association about that question the other day, DeMaurice Smith. And-- and he shared with us something else that I want to get your reaction to, and that is frustration, frankly, among many players, with the lack of diversity among coaching staff in particular. And he said, \"Unfortunately, we've had some former coaches of color who I think have given excuses, or cover, for the league in this.\" There's some sharp words. What do you make of that assessment? JAMES BROWN: Well, you know, today on our pre-game show, I'm going to address that very issue with a commentary of my own, coming off of an excellent but sobering piece that's entitled \"Before Jackie,\" meaning before Jackie Robinson. And that would be in the four o'clock hour of our pregame show. And it addresses, sadly, part of the history was there were a number of owners back in 1953, who collaborated and consciously deliberately made a decision to eliminate Black players from the league. And it was thirteen years later before when the team moved to California, Los Angeles, specifically, playing in a stadium that was in a minority community, meaning they paid taxpayer dollars, and they said they weren't going to allow it. And that's when Kenny Washington broke the color barrier. So the fact is, sadly, there is a history that I know definitively, that Roger Goodell, the commissioner, Troy Vincent, the highest ranking African-American, have done everything possible to create an environment and a culture to that. And the bottom line is equality of opportunity is all that is sought. Male and female, there's no division. I'm so happy to see full-time female assistants on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that you'll get a chance to see. And bottom line, there's a McKinsey report that came out in May 2020 that said, \"Diversity wins; inclusion matters.\" We have a wonderful mosaic here in America, people of all hues and stripes. And excellence comes in all hues and stripes, so why not take advantage of that to improve the bottom line and the culture and winning with that attitude. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know-- you know, football and activism really became a-- a hot topic in the past few years. Where does that conversation go next? Is it coaches or is it in another direction? JAMES BROWN: Coaches, quite frankly, are low-hanging fruit. Look, when the league was opened up to diversity, it's not surprising that half the number of players who are in the Hall of Fame are players of color, Black players, specifically. The same thing I'm going to be talking with Amy Trask who is, has been and still is, sadly, the only female CEO of a team. It's going to continue to move forward because I think people see that and embrace it, and it only makes sense. MARGARET BRENNAN: JB, it's always good to get your reflections. Good luck to you today. Thanks for joining us. JAMES BROWN: Hey, by the way, Margaret, Kenan Alan-- Kenan on SNL, he had a better hairline than me, and his mini Afro looked a lot better than my micro Afro. But thank you for having me on, anyway. MARGARET BRENNAN: I like the real JB. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: There's more from the head of the NFL Players union, DeMaurice Smith, on our latest podcast. We hope you'll listen and enjoy today's game safely.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Tuesday approved the nomination of Alejandro Mayorkas to become secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), confirming the former federal prosecutor and Obama-era immigration official to lead the department by a vote of 56 to 43. The final tally reflected opposition from some Republican senators to the new administration's immigration policies, as well as concerns about an internal 2015 DHS investigation into Mayorkas' actions as head of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) under the Obama administration.\u00a0 Six Republican senators \u2014 Susan Collins, Mitt Romney, Dan Sullivan, Shelley Moore Capito, Lisa Murkowski and Rob Portman \u2014 joined Democrats in voting to approve the nomination. Portman is the top Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which has oversight authority over the department. As secretary of the sprawling department, Mayorkas will be tasked with tackling some of the nation's most pressing issues, including the coronavirus pandemic, domestic terrorism, cyberattacks and migration to the U.S. southern border. DHS is responsible for a diverse range of federal functions, ranging from immigration and border policy to transportation security and natural disaster management. A Cuban immigrant who arrived in the U.S. 1960s as a political refugee with his family, Mayorkas is the first immigrant and first Latino to lead the 240,000-person department, which was created in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. He served as the head of USCIS from 2009 to 2013 before becoming the second-highest ranking official at the department as deputy secretary until 2016. Mayorkas' nomination stalled last week, after Republican senators contended he had not been adequately vetted on immigration policy and raised questions about a 2015 report by the DHS inspector general. The report found Mayorkas had pushed for the approval of applications in a visa program for wealthy immigrant investors on the behalf of well-connected Democrats when he served as USCIS director. At his confirmation hearing, Mayorkas denied any wrongdoing and defended his actions, but conceded that the report taught him \"to better guard\" against the perception of impropriety to ensure \"trust and confidence in the decision making of government leaders.\" Mayorkas was the first of Mr. Biden's Cabinet nominees to face a GOP filibuster. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer overcame the last procedural hurdle to his approval last Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote before the full Senate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell sharply criticized the selection of Mayorkas to lead DHS in a speech on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, calling him an \"ethically compromised partisan lawyer.\" \"It's frankly remarkable that someone with this record is even up for a Cabinet appointment,\" McConnell said. Delays in the confirmation vote last month spurred a press conference featuring two former DHS secretaries, who urged Congress to swiftly take action on Mayorkas' nomination. \"It really mystifies me what benefit is being served by this continued delay in his confirmation,\" said Janet Napolitano, former President Barack Obama's first DHS secretary. Former DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, who served under President George W. Bush, criticized senators for hindering the confirmation to voice their policy disagreements. \"First of all, whether you agree or disagree with elements of President Biden's proposal should not be a basis to reject his nominee, particularly because the nominee has a much broader agenda than just immigration,\" he said.\u00a0 Last week, the White House delayed executive actions on immigration \u2014 including a new task force dedicated to reuniting migrant families affected by the Trump-era \"zero tolerance\" border crackdown \u2014 as Mayorkas' confirmation stalled. Mr. Biden is set to sign those orders later on Tuesday. The first Senate-confirmed DHS secretary since April 2019, Mayorkas inherits a department that has been plagued by politicization for four years and used to advance former President Donald Trump's restrictive immigration agenda. As the leader of the DHS, Mayorkas will be tasked with fulfilling Mr. Biden's pledges to undo many Trump-era immigration policies, while also ensuring the U.S. can adequately respond to a potential sharp increase in crossings along the southern border. Mayorkas will also be expected to tackle the rise of domestic terrorism and anti-government militia groups, which has assumed new urgency following the deadly Capitol riot on January 6. \"The president-elect could not have found a more qualified person to be the next homeland security secretary,\" four former homeland security secretaries \u2014 Chertoff, Napolitano, Tom Ridge and Jeh Johnson \u2014\u00a0 wrote in a Washington Post op-ed days after the attack. The department's new head also faces pressure to confront December's unprecedented Solar Winds breach after hackers inserted malicious code into software from the company SolarWinds that was used by government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. Questions remain about the full scope of the data breach following the months-long global cyberespionage campaign, as investigators uncover new details of the suspected Russian operation. Mr. Biden is expected to appoint Rob Silvers, a former Obama administration official, to lead the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, a division of DHS, though his role is yet to be made official. DHS' cyber arm has been steered by career officials serving in acting roles since Mr. Trump fired Chris Krebs, after the top cybersecurity official called the election \"the most secure in American history.\" Mayorkas' start date at the U.S. government's third largest department comes later into the new administration as compared to his predecessors. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama had secretaries confirmed at DHS on their first days in the Oval Office. Since Mr. Biden took office, TSA Administrator David Pekoske has led DHS in an acting capacity. Under Pekoske's leadership, DHS issued a rare terrorism advisory last week, warning the public of a \"heightened threat environment\" across the U.S. in the wake of the Capitol attack.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Former President George W. Bush spoke virtually at South by Southwest on Thursday, saying the nation needs a path to citizenship to bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. The ex-president, in a conversation hosted by the Texas Tribune, said it's a political pipe dream to convince Americans that undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. a long time and paid taxes are going to go home.\u00a0 Mr. Bush's comments come as the\u00a0Democrat-controlled House\u00a0is set to vote on two immigration bills that would legalize subsets of the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission. The bills passed despite fierce opposition by some Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who went to the U.S.-Mexico border earlier this week and accused President Joe Biden of inflaming the crisis. McCarthy and Republicans have not put forward their own plan. Mr. Bush said Thursday that instead of ignoring the situation, the nation needs to address it with a path to citizenship. He said it's in the nation's interest to bring people out of the shadows. Mr. Bush also said a whole toolbox of tools is necessary to enforce the border, including electronic equipment and manpower.\u00a0 \"Rather than ignore the situation, we've got to address it, and I do believe there should be a path to citizenship,\" Mr. Bush said on Thursday. Mr. Bush's views on immigration are not ones broadly accepted in the Republican Party of today. \u00a0 The Texas Republican also spoke about the Capitol riot, immigration in the United States, and his new book, \"Out of Many, One: Portraits of America's Immigrants.\"\u00a0 Mr. Bush said he was \"sick to my stomach\" to watch the nation's capitol \"under siege by hostile forces\" on January 6. The former president said the day's events \"really disturbed me to the point where I did put out a statement, and I'm still disturbed when I think about it.\" \"It undermines rule of law and the ability to express yourself in peaceful ways in the public square,\" he also said on Thursday, adding that the expression was \"not peaceful.\"\u00a0 Mr. Bush had a simple answer when asked if he thinks the election was stolen, something many in his own party believe: \"No.\" The former president, who said he called President Biden on Election Day 2020, gave him a little advice.

            "article_content": "Poland, near the Belarusian border \u2014\u00a0Belarus' autocratic leader said on Monday that thousands of migrants \u2014 many of them seeking asylum from the violence in Iraq, Syria and other nations torn by strife \u2014 didn't want to be flown back to their homelands, as he doubled down in a tense standoff with the European Union. President Alexander Lukashenko's Russian-backed regime is accused by the EU and the United States of luring desperate people to the country, easing travel into and through Belarus, with the unwritten promise being an easy land border to cross onto EU soil in Poland or another neighboring country. But Poland, which had already taken a tougher line on immigration than some of its EU neighbors, has sealed its border. Hundreds of Polish security forces now pace along one side of the barbed wire fence, which groups of migrants have sporadically challenged from the other side, wielding logs and whatever else they can find to attack the fencing. While those attempts are relatively easy for the Polish forces to put down, some people do make it out of the makeshift camps in the freezing Belarusian forest and get across the long border into Poland. Once there, they must navigate through the woods and hope to be picked up by one of the humanitarian groups operating in the region, which can offer help.  But Polish immigration authorities and police are also on patrol, and they have been accused \u2014 along with Belarusian authorities on the other side \u2014 of forcing migrants back and forth across the border. Senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata was in Poland, near the border, when his CBS News team got a call from an aid group on Sunday night to say that two migrants had been found in the forest. As the team neared the location, an ambulance passed at speed, going the other direction. Where the two men were found, aid workers told CBS News they had been put into the ambulance barely conscious. Both men, who said they were from Syria, were in their early 40s.  They had no food or water with them, and they were found about 30 miles from the Belarusian border. They'd likely been walking for days through the swampy woodland, where temperatures dip below freezing at night. Lukashenko, who has ruled over Belarus for almost three decades backed by his ally in Moscow, Vladimir Putin, is accused by Europe and America of \"instrumentalizing\" immigration in his standoff with the West. The feud began when the EU sanctioned Lukashenko's regime over his harsh crackdown on opposition members, dissidents and journalists in the wake of an election that he claims to have won in a landslide, but many say was far from democratic. On Monday, Belarus' state-run Belta news agency quoted Lukashenko as saying his country was now trying to send the migrants back home, but that they didn't want to go. He said if Poland refused to open a \"humanitarian corridor\" to let them cross the border, Belarus would fly them to Germany. \"Active work is underway in this area, to convince people \u2014 please, return home. But nobody wants to go back,\" Lukashenko said, according to Belta. \"We will send them to Munich by our own planes, if necessary.\" The president, who's often referred to as Europe's last dictator, said he did not want to see the standoff at the Polish border spiral into a \"conflict,\" which he said would be \"completely detrimental for\" Belarus. Lukashenko has also threatened to cut off Western Europe's gas supply as the coldest months of winter approach, which he could do by locking down pipelines that carry Russian natural gas through his country to the west. Russia promised on Monday that it would not breach its supply contracts with Europe. A Kremlin spokesman in Moscow warned that any move by Lukashenko to interrupt the supply, \"would not contribute to the development of relations between Russia and Belarus.\"  But Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, also said it was \"absolutely wrong to place all the blame for the situation at the border on President Lukashenko and on the Belarusian side.\" He suggested that Western European countries where governments have been more welcoming of migrants were to blame, for giving people hope that they would be taken in.

            "article_content": "Berlin\u00a0\u2014 Germany has seen a rapid influx in recent months of migrants and refugees entering the country from Poland. The migrants got into Poland \u2014 and onto European Union soil \u2014 by braving a trek through frigid forests along that country's border with Belarus. They are among thousands of people caught up in what the EU considers a concerted effort by Belarus' authoritarian leader to use immigration as a weapon in a standoff over sanctions and human rights. The soaring tension between the EU and Belarus' Russian-backed strongman leader, Alexander Lukashenko, is driving a new European migrant crisis. The EU and the U.S. have accused Lukashenko of luring migrants from the Iraq, Syria and other conflict-torn nations to the capital Minsk, with the promise of safe passage to the EU via the Polish border.  The European Commission claims the Belarusian autocrat's motivation has been to destabilise the region by enabling irregular immigration. It is retaliation, the EU says, for harsh economic sanctions imposed on his regime by the EU over a crackdown on pro-democracy voices following a discredited election.\u00a0 If stoking internal tension in EU states was his aim, Lukashenko's efforts appear to be paying off. The recent influx of refugees into Germany \u2014 mainly Syrian, Iraqi and Afghan nationals \u2014 has put the German nation back on edge, sparking fears of a repeat of the overwhelming wave of asylum seekers and migrants that Europe saw in 2015. That mass-exodus from war-torn Syria divided opinion across Europe, and many believe it fuelled a wave of populist politics.  The current spike in migrant arrivals has sparked tough conversations about reinstating border checks with neighboring Poland, something that hasn't happened in more than a decade and would mar the EU's blanket policy of open borders. The biggest refugee processing center in the German-Polish border region is in the east German town of Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt. Officials there told CBS News that they have seen a rapid influx of migrants and refugees in recent months, with 4,500 people processed since August, all of whom came via Belarus. About 2,400 migrants arrived in Germany after crossing from Belarus and then through Poland in October alone.  The rise in numbers prompted Germany's Federal Police to urge the government to put up temporary control measures to stem the flow, but both countries have said the shared 286-mile frontier will not be completely sealed.\u00a0 What many in Germany fear are scenes like the ones that played out during the 2015 refugee crisis, which saw German Chancellor Angela Merkel make the controversial decision to admit one million refugees.  \"Germany feels helpless,\" said Gerald Knaus, chairman of the European Stability Initiative and an advisor on migration issues to German politicians. \"The number of people who have come across a border where, normally, there are no irregular migrants in any significant numbers, from Belarus to Poland and the Baltic states and then on to Germany, that number creates more concern here than the much larger number that crosses the Mediterranean.\" Knaus told CBS News that while the number of people arriving in Germany compared to 2015 is still very low, the situation is worrying Germans for other, less logistical reasons. \"What makes this so politically, morally and strategically difficult is the sense of loss of control,\" he explained. \"It is the sense in Europe that it is Lukashenko alone who determines how many people come.\" At the refugee processing center in Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt, CBS News met migrants who spoke of their journey to reach Germany. Nihad and Dahir, from northern Iraq, said they flew to Minsk via Turkey. After spending days in the woods near Belarus' border with Poland, they finally got the GPS locations they had been promised by smugglers to meet up for an illicit trip across the border. For a fee of about $2,400 each, they were put into a truck. \"Fourteen hours standing up in the car, together with 20 people,\" recalled Nihad. This route has become an attractive one for migrants who have the means to pay smugglers and are willing to face the risks of traversing the no man's land between Poland and Belarus.  But as the numbers rise, so does the fear in Germany of another massive migrant crisis, and this time it seems that Germany may be unwilling to carry the burden alone.",

            "article_content": "Perla, 46, a Nicaraguan political dissident, has been living with her daughter and grandchildren in a squalid migrant tent camp in the Mexican border city of Matamoros for a year and half.\u00a0 A former local councilwoman who was threatened for publicly opposing Daniel Ortega's regime, Perla is waiting for a U.S. immigration judge to adjudicate her asylum request, with her final court hearing postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic. \"It's been really difficult. You don't know what can happen to you here,\" she told CBS News in Spanish. \"We try to make the most of it, but we have to deal with the rain, the sun and the bathrooms that are not clean.\" Perla said the encampment is not a place for children like her granddaughters, who are 10 and 7 years old. \"Not a day goes by without me crying, without me saying, 'I want to leave,'\" she said. For nine months, Angela, 24, and her family have been stranded in Reynosa, another Mexican border town and hotspot for turf wars between warring cartels. The Honduran mother crossed the U.S. border with her partner and toddler in March and had a baby girl at a hospital in McAllen, Texas, while in Border Patrol custody, according to medical records.\u00a0 After her daughter's birth, Angela and her family were not allowed to stay in the U.S. Instead, they were expelled to Mexico without a court hearing under a pandemic-related measure authorized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last spring, according to lawyers. Thousands of asylum-seekers waiting at America's doorstep face similar predicaments as a result of a network of policies the Trump administration implemented to deter would-be migrants, whom it accused of gaming the country's humanitarian programs to gain easy entry into the U.S. President Biden decried these measures as \"inhumane\" and vowed to end them during the campaign, accusing the Trump administration of forcing asylum applicants to live \"in squalor.\" After winning the election, his advisers said unwinding the many policies would take time, largely due to the pandemic. During Mr. Biden's first day in office, his administration stopped placing asylum-seekers in the so-called \"Remain-in Mexico\" program. He is also set to formally end the policy and other asylum limits this week as part of an executive order to retool how U.S. border officials will process migrants going forward. But the new administration continues to use the Trump-era CDC order to quickly expel migrants \u2014 including families with children \u2014 without allowing them to request U.S. refuge, according to court documents and interviews with attorneys. The government has also not said whether it will allow the estimated 20,000 migrants in Mexico with pending asylum applications to continue their cases inside the U.S.\u00a0 Mr. Biden has yet to publicly order a review of the expulsions order, despite a pledge made by his campaign. The CDC deferred requests for comment to the White House, which did not offer any. U.S. diplomats have instead been warning would-be migrants in Central America that the expulsions will continue indefinitely. \"Under the currently operational CDC order, certain individuals encountered at the border, including those encountered while attempting to enter the United States between ports of entry, are subject to expulsion during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Matt Leas said in a statement to CBS News on Sunday.\u00a0 \u00a0 The Biden administration's continuation of Trump-era border policies, even if short-lived, has left thousands of asylum-seekers stranded in dangerous Mexican towns or facing swift expulsion to the countries they fled. Many are hopeful that their fortunes will change under a new U.S. administration \u2014 but it's unclear when and if that may happen. \"I can't return to Cuba,\" Jes\u00fas, 47, an asylum-seeker waiting in Matamoros for his U.S. court hearing, told CBS News in Spanish. \"God willing, Biden's government will understand us.\" Jes\u00fas said he fled Cuba in 2019 after being discriminated by the government there because of his identity as a gay man. He said he does not feel safe in Matamoros, a crime-ridden city located in the state of Tamaulipas, which carries a \"Do Not Travel\" warning from the U.S. State Department. By continuing the border expulsions, the Biden administration is also enforcing a policy implemented under political pressure that has so far failed to pass legal muster in court. While the Trump administration said the directive was designed to protect immigration agents and the U.S. public from migrants who may be infected with the coronavirus, three former government officials who worked on public health issues told CBS News last fall that the Trump White House pressured former CDC director Robert Redfield to sign it over objections from agency experts. One former CDC official said the agency was \"forced to do it,\" while another called the policy a \"misappropriation\" of public health laws.\u00a0 Three federal judges have also concluded that the late 19th-century public health authority the Trump administration invoked does not authorize expulsions. Lee Gelernt, a civil rights lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, sued the Trump administration over the expulsions, and convinced a federal judge in November to prohibit the government from expelling unaccompanied children. On Friday, however, an appeals court lifted the injunction. Asked if border officials will resume expelling unaccompanied migrant children in light of Friday's court order, Leas, the DHS spokesperson, said he could not comment \"due to ongoing litigation.\" The Justice Department declined to comment. Gelernt filed another lawsuit earlier this month seeking to halt the expulsion of migrant families who the ACLU said could face persecution if expelled. According to filings in the case, asylum-seeking parents and children as young as 23 months old continue to face expulsion, even since Mr. Biden took office. Gelernt said the policy should be scrapped in its entirety, and vowed to continue suing the government unless Mr. Biden ends the practice. \"It is flatly illegal and was enacted by the Trump administration as a pretext to shut the border, despite the view of medical experts that it was unnecessary from a public health standpoint,\" Gelernt told CBS News. Andrea Meza, an attorney with the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, is currently helping a group of parents and children detained at a family detention facility in Karnes City, Texas. Immigration and Customs Enforcement confirmed the facility is being used to hold families facing expulsion. Like Gelernt, Meza called on the Biden administration to act quickly. \"Each day that Biden fails to rescind the use of Title 42 for pretextual border enforcement means more families expelled to the dangerous situations from which they fled,\" Meza told CBS News, using the government term for the expulsion process. Lawyers are not the only ones calling for an end to the expulsions. U.S. government asylum officers recently told their leadership at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that the policy should be discarded, saying it was enacted \"under the guise of public health measures,\" according to a white paper of recommendations authored by the officers' union, AFGE Local 1924. Last week, 89 public health experts sent a letter to Rochelle Walensky, Mr. Biden's CDC director, urging her to rescind the order that has authorized the border expulsions, denouncing it as a discriminatory edict with \"no scientific basis.\" \"Rather than subverting public health principles to ban people seeking protection from harm, the CDC should rescind the October 2020 order and put in place effective, science-based measures to safely process asylum seekers and others seeking protection,\" the experts wrote, outlining several recommendations for border officials. Angela, the young mother who was expelled alongside her family last spring, said they left Honduras after gang members tried to recruit her partner. Life in Mexico with a 4-year-old and infant has not been easy, she added. \"It's very dangerous here. You can't even go outside,\" Angela said in Spanish, citing cartel violence and kidnappings. Lawyers with the group Al Otro Lado are preparing to ask the Biden administration to parole Angela and her family inside the U.S., arguing that her infant was illegally expelled since she was born on American soil, and U.S. citizens are supposed to be exempt from the expulsions order. \"What they did to us was illegal,\" Angela said. In Matamoros, Perla, the asylum-seeking grandmother from Nicaragua, said she believes the Biden administration will help her family and other migrants waiting in Mexico.\u00a0 Perla attributed her cautious optimism to first lady Jill Biden's visit to Matamoros in December 2019. \"She knows the conditions we're enduring,\" Perla said, recounting a conversation she said she had with the first lady. On Sunday, I walked across the Gateway International Bridge into Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico to meet with asylum seekers. I witnessed both the cruelty of our policy and the grace of acts of kindness. pic.twitter.com/Xz2SbMJuzK \"That's the hope we have. That he'll get us out here soon,\" she said, referring to the president. \"After being here on the banks of the river for a year and a half, as a human being, I would not wish this on anybody.\" Editor's note: Perla and Jes\u00fas asked for their surnames to be omitted because they have pending U.S. asylum cases. Angela's representatives asked for her name to be changed to protect her identify. Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

            "article_content": "More than four dozen special agents within an investigative unit of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will be equipped with body cameras in the new year as part of a six month-long pilot program mandated by Congress, senior homeland security officials said Tuesday. Agents stationed at Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) offices in New York, Newark, New Jersey and Houston will be outfitted for cameras \u2014 mounted to their vest, shirt or helmet \u2014 and required to turn them on during \"pre-planned law enforcement operations,\" including execution of search warrants, pre-planned arrests and interrogation of suspects. The footage will be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests and available to defense lawyers in criminal cases during the discovery process, a senior ICE official indicated. The official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity to provide details on the program before the announcement, noted the pilot program will evaluate the effectiveness of the equipment and overall cost of operations, with a summary of the findings to be released. The use of body-worn cameras was mandated as part of Congress' fiscal year 2021 appropriations bill, but ICE asserts that it is also rolling out the program in the spirit of providing \"greater transparency\" about the work of its agents. \"With its body-worn camera pilot, ICE is making an important statement that transparency and accountability are essential components of our ability to fulfill our law enforcement mission and keep communities safe,\" said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whose department oversees ICE.\u00a0 But body-worn cameras will not immediately be allocated to Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers, the side of the agency responsible for immigration enforcement raids, operation of ICE detention facilities and prosecution of undocumented immigrants subject to deportation. According to the official, an additional 55 officers will eventually be granted body-worn cameras, pending negotiations with the National ICE Council, the AFL-CIO-affiliated ERO union. Chris Crane, the president of the union, told CBS News that while the organization is open to exploring a possible pilot program, they're opposed to the agency's planned rollout. Crane said there is \"no way\" the agency will be ready to run the pilot this soon, calling the timeline \"ridiculous.\" \"Suspecting they may lose control of the House in the next election, Democrats on the Hill are forcing the program before it's ready while they're still in control,\" Crane said, calling it \"reckless\" and \"irresponsible.\" \"We don't know enough about the feasibility of its use at ICE,\" the union leader added. \"As an example, we're not uniformed beat cops driving around in marked cars pulling people over for traffic violations. How exactly are we even using this equipment? We don't have those answers yet.\" The pilot program is the first of its kind for the agency, but it follows a long line of body camera programs rolled out in local and state law enforcement agencies over the past several years. \"My first reaction is, this is long overdue,\" said John Amaya, a former ICE deputy chief of staff who served under the Obama administration. \"I'm a little underwhelmed by the fact that it's being instituted on such a small scale, but better late than never.\" In August, the Biden administration greenlit the allocation of 6,000 body cameras for U.S. border agents in a massive operational change aimed at \"reinforcing trust and transparency\" within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The Department of Justice also announced earlier this year that its federal agents \u2014 including officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI and Marshals Service \u2014 would be required to wear body cameras when executing search warrants or making pre-planned arrests. And while the move is largely welcomed by advocates seeking greater transparency in federal law enforcement, experts say the merits of ICE's body camera program will largely depend on its wider implementation. \"The proof will be in the pudding once it's completely rolled out, agency wide to include ERO and HSI,\" Amaya said. \"ICE is an agency that is often seen by both sides of the aisle as doing their job poorly,\" Amaya added. \"There's this sense that no matter what they say, no matter what they do, no matter how transparent they are, it's never going to be enough. So the idea of putting themselves out there has always been one that comes with reservations.\" \"There are significant questions around the precise policies that will surround use of body cameras by ICE,\" said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The difference between good policies and bad policies is the difference between whether this is something that provides accountability or whether it becomes just another surveillance tool.\" Similar to CBP's body camera program, the contract for the ICE program was awarded to Axon Enterprise Inc., a public technology company. Ron Vitiello, a former ICE director during the Trump administration now serves as the company's head of DHS programs and strategy. Axon Enterprise, Inc. and ICE have not indicated how much the contract is worth in response to inquiries from CBS News. \"If the video remains under the firm control of bureaucracy, then what we will see is what we've seen with police departments that have too much control,\" Stanley added. \"Video is released when it makes them look good and buried when it doesn't. And that is not something that helps accountability, which should be the primary purpose of body cameras, and what I strongly suspect was Congress' intent when it directed the agency to institute the program.\" CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

            "article_content": "Poland, near the border with Belarus\u00a0\u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin and his ally, Belarus' long-time autocratic leader Alexander Lukashenko, are being accused of using immigration to stoke tensions in Eastern Europe. Belarus now faces new sanctions from the European Union over the worsening migrant crisis along its border with Poland. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports, Polish authorities used water cannon and other means to keep thousands of increasingly frustrated migrants massed along the frontier out on Tuesday. There were chaotic scenes as a group of migrants charged the fence. One of the migrants told CBS News that Polish police responded with a volley of tear gas and rubber bullets, as well as the water cannon. Migrants were seen hurling rocks and stones at the barbed wire fence.\u00a0 \u00a0 The EU and the U.S. have accused Belarus of encouraging thousands of refugees to try to cross into Poland. D'Agata and his team tried to get to the border where, on the other side of the barbed wire, at least 2,000 migrants and refugees have camped out for days in freezing weather, hoping to find a path into Poland. But our CBS News team only made it as far as a Polish police checkpoint about two miles from the standoff. The Polish authorities don't want journalists to see what's unfolding along the heavily defended border. Desperate people have flocked to the area. Stranded and freezing, they've become pawns in an increasingly tense standoff between Russia and its Eastern European allies, and U.S. and NATO-aligned Western Europe.  Poland has flatly refused to let any of the migrants in, accusing Belarus of \"weaponizing\" immigration in a bid to destabilize the European Union.  Every night, some of the people gathered at the makeshift camp on the Belarusian side make a break for it, attempting to reach the woods on Polish side under the cover of night. In doing so, they risk arrest, or worse. Two brothers from Syria were recently rescued inside Poland, about 30 miles from the border, and were rushed to a hospital suffering from suspected hypothermia. D'Agata and his team saw an ambulance take them away after they were found by one of the humanitarian groups operating in the area. Aid worker Agata Kolodziej told CBS News they were barely conscious, and had they not been found, they might not have survived.   \"This is something that we are seeing every day,\" Kolodziej said. \"It's going to get worse, because it's getting colder at night and in the day, and we find people in worse and worse conditions.\" The U.S. and Europe accuse Lukashenko of manufacturing this migrant crisis by granting tourist visas and even organizing flights for migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere, with the promise of easy entry to the EU via the Polish border. Belarus' leader \u2014 often referred to as Europe's \"last dictator\" \u2014 is suspected of using the \"hybrid warfare\" tactic in retaliation for EU sanctions imposed after last year's disputed election in Belarus, and Lukashenko's ensuing crackdown on dissent. There's concern that new EU sanctions, if imposed on Lukashenko's regime over the current border standoff as now threatened, will only make things worse. The Belarusian strongman has made it clear that he's not about to back down, warning on Tuesday that he was ready to ask Putin for help, \"if necessary.\" \"I will talk with the President of Russia and ask him to get involved and, if necessary, provide appropriate assistance, without drawing them [Russia] into this refugee crisis,\" Lukashenko said before a phone call with Putin. He accused \"these scoundrels of the collective West\" of blaming Russia for the standoff, which he insisted had nothing to do with the migration crisis on his border, \"yet.\" But while his actions, purportedly designed to stoke tension within the EU, may help Lukashenko and his vital ally in Moscow, it is innocent people trying to escape desperate situations in their own countries who are paying the price. Akram, from Northern Iraq, told D'Agata that he and his travelling companion were beaten by Belarusian soldiers before making it across the border to Poland, and things didn't get much better on the other side.  \"It was very hard, no water, no food,\" he told CBS News. \"We were arrested by Polish police and brought to this isolation camp.\" Speaking Tuesday ahead of a meeting with EU defense ministers, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance was \"deeply concerned about the way the Lukashenko regime is using vulnerable migrants as a hybrid tactic against other countries and he is putting the lives of the migrants at risk.\"  \"We stand in solidarity with Poland and other affected allies,\" said the NATO chief. The dispute has escalated with accusations of Russian interference. Poland has sent some 15,000 troops to help defend its border, while Russia has sent bombers to patrol Belarusian airspace as its paratroopers conduct joint exercises along the border. NATO has warned Russia against any \"further provocation,\" and suggested the dispute may be intended as a distraction from what's going on another highly contentious border: Around 100,000 Russian troops have gathered along Ukraine's frontier with Russia. Russia insists there's no threat, and that it will move its forces around as it likes on its own soil.  Europe and the U.S. have voiced increasing concern, however, that Russia could be preparing for another incursion into Ukrainian territory, as it did when Putin unilaterally annexed Crimea away from Ukraine in 2014.

            "article_content": "When he turned 15 in 2017, Agustin became eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, the Obama-era policy that provides protection from deportation and work permits to undocumented immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children. But Agustin and his family decided it would be best to hold off on applying, fearing that any information sent to the government could be used against them, given Donald Trump's election in 2016. \"It was very clear [President Trump] was not interested in keeping DACA as a program, and we felt that it would be unwise to apply for a program that would give the government our location \u2014 and we could be deported easily,\" Agustin, who is now 18, told CBS News. The Trump administration ended up suspending DACA in September 2017. While it was not able to end the work permits and deportation protections of current recipients because of court rulings, the administration closed DACA to new applications, leaving prospective applicants like Agustin in limbo. In December 2020, a federal court ordered the Trump administration to reopen DACA to new applicants. The news elated Agustin, who submitted his application this spring. \"I was so happy,\" he remembered. But Agustin's excitement was short-lived. Earlier this month, a federal judge in Texas directed the Biden administration to stop granting new DACA requests, calling the program illegal. Agustin was locked out of DACA \u2014 again. \"It was devastating,\" said Agustin, who was brought to the U.S from Mexico as a 3-year-old. \"I don't know if I have fully processed it yet. It was like I was in a state of shock. I was so close to being able to do so much and a judge says, 'No, you're not allowed to do this.'\" This month's court ruling has dashed the hopes of up to 300,000 immigrant teenagers and young adults living in the U.S without legal permission who could qualify for DACA. As of late June, at least 81,000 immigrants had pending first-time DACA requests, which the government is now barred from approving. For teenagers in U.S. high schools, the court ruling means not being able to obtain a driver's license or a summer job. For college-bound or university students, it blocks them from working legally in the U.S. For young adults, it means not being able to provide financially for their families, including their own children who are U.S. citizens. \"For these youngsters, these teenagers who are aging into eligibility in a really critical developmental period of their lives and not being able to get DACA, it's really detrimental to their future trajectories,\" Roberto Gonzales, a University of Pennsylvania professor who has studied undocumented youth since 2002, told CBS News. \"It curves, if not cuts off, possibilities for them.\" Agustin, who graduated from a Virginia high school last year, is currently volunteering in a local rescue squad, running ambulance calls. He wants to become a certified EMT and study nursing. But he's aware that he currently can't legally start a paid profession. \"I've lived here my whole life,\" Agustin said. \"Dreamers have lived here our whole lives. And there's no reason to think of us as anything but Americans. We want to do everything that American can do and it seems like there's this barrier that has just been put up against us.\" Arlette Morales, 18, also applied for DACA this year. She even completed the biometric appointment most first-time applicants have to attend in May. Like Agustin, she became eligible for DACA during the Trump administration and now finds herself locked out of the program once again. \"It was heartbreaking again to go through this battle that we constantly are going through,\" Morales told CBS News, saying the uncertainty surrounding the fate of DACA has inflicted \"a lot of emotional damage.\" Morales, who graduated from a Pennsylvania high school this spring, said she was looking forward to getting a job, as well as a driver's license to take her younger siblings to school. DACA, she added, would have also allowed her to feel protected from the threat of deportation. \"I thought I was basically close to the finish line,\" Morales added. \"But unfortunately, I was not.\" The Biden administration has pledged to appeal this month's court order and to publish a rule that would codify DACA into a regulatory policy, but it hasn't given any timeframe for these actions. On Capitol Hill, the recent court ruling has injected a renewed sense of urgency into the debate over whether to permit DACA enrollees and other so-called \"Dreamers\" to request permanent legal status.\u00a0 Given the evenly divided makeup of the Senate, a growing number of Democratic lawmakers back the idea of legalizing Dreamers through the budget reconciliation process, which can be authorized by a simple majority. \"I think we have to do everything we can to protect our Dreamers. And if it means getting a pathway to citizenship for our Dreamers passed through reconciliation, then that is the path we have to take,\" Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, a Democrat who represents 11,000 DACA beneficiaries, told CBS News. Cortez Masto noted that first-time DACA applicants were not responsible for processing delays at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversees the program. As of May 31, only 1,900 \u2014 or 3% \u2014 of more than 62,000 first-time DACA applications filed this year had been adjudicated, according to USCIS data shared with Congress. USCIS announced on Tuesday that it would place pending first-time DACA applications \"on hold\" while the Texas court ruling remains in effect. Immigrants with these pending requests will not get a refund for the $495 application fee they paid, USCIS said. Agustin, the first-time DACA applicant who lives in Virginia, expressed bewilderment about Congress' longstanding failure to legalize undocumented immigrants brought to the country as minors. \"I'm very frustrated that it has to be a debate that we as people are worthy of rights,\" he said. \"I feel frustrated that there's significant opposition to giving us an opportunity for something we didn't choose to do. We were kids. We didn't choose this.\" Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News. Based in Washington, he covers immigration policy and politics.",

            "article_content": "Brownsville, Texas \u2014 After a months-long trek across four countries, Dayana and Lazaro, two political dissidents from Cuba, reached the U.S. southern border in 2019 hoping to apply for asylum. But the spouses met starkly different fates. Dayana, who was pregnant at the time, was allowed to enter and stay in the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. Lazaro, however, was sent back to Mexico and instructed to wait there indefinitely for his U.S. asylum court hearings. Lazaro said he was not given an explanation for being turned back to Mexico. \"It was difficult for me, because it was a forced separation,\" he told CBS News in Spanish. \"They didn't let us say goodbye,\" Dayana said. The Trump administration required Lazaro and 70,000 other asylum-seekers from Latin America to wait in Mexico while their cases were adjudicated. It argued the policy, known as Remain in Mexico, was needed to reduce unauthorized migration and discourage economic migrants from using the asylum process to enter the U.S. Individuals and families with children were sent to some of the most dangerous and crime-ridden areas of Mexico. Hundreds were kidnapped, extorted, assaulted and even murdered, according to human rights groups. A sprawling and squalid migrant tent camp sprung up in the Mexican city of Matamoros and became a symbol of the Trump administration's hard-line asylum policies. Lazaro and Dayana said their separation took a heavy emotional toll. Dayana said she worried about losing her baby because of the adverse emotional impact of the separation. \"It was very difficult,\" Dayana said. \"I was very unwell for days. In fact, I was unwell for months. I had depression during the pregnancy. And I had postpartum depression as well.\" Lazaro was stranded in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, for a year and seven months and missed the birth of his daughter, Ashley, who was born in the Dallas area last July. He said he hit an emotional low point during the coronavirus pandemic, when the court hearings for his asylum case \u2014 the gateway to reuniting with Dayana and meeting Ashley \u2014 were postponed indefinitely.\u00a0 \"It was a very big blow,\" Lazaro recounted. \"I had that expectation of meeting the baby and being with my wife and suddenly all of it fell apart.\" Disillusioned, the family placed their hopes on Joe Biden, who campaigned on ending Trump administration border policies he derided as inhumane and draconian. Mr. Biden vowed to scrap the Remain in Mexico program, which he said had forced asylum-seekers to live \"in squalor.\" \"I didn't sleep on Election Day,\" Lazaro said. On the day of Mr. Biden's inauguration, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) suspended the Remain in Mexico policy. In February, the Biden administration said it would allow some of those returned to Mexico to continue their asylum proceedings in the U.S. as long as they had pending cases. Working with Mexico, the United Nations and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Biden administration established a process to admit these asylum-seekers at selected ports of entry. The U.N. set up a website for eligible asylum applicants to register for an appointment to enter the U.S., while IOM stood up COVID-19 testing sites. Late last month, CBS News was granted exclusive access to the Brownsville port of entry, one of six official border crossings that has been processing asylum petitioners with pending cases. More than 20 asylum-seekers arrived at the Brownsville port of entry that day through the Gateway International Bridge after testing negative for COVID-19 in Mexico. The group of asylum-seekers, which included families with children, was greeted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. Their belongings were checked for contraband, and they were then taken inside a tent facility, where government personnel checked their case information and collected biometric data. All asylum-seekers wore face shields and masks. Barring a few cases delayed by computer glitches, the asylum applicants were processed in a matter of minutes.\u00a0 \"These are people that we already knew who they were,\" said Aaron Bowker, director of communications for the Office of Field Operations, the CBP branch that oversees ports of entry. \"We were able to leverage that technology and, with the help of those NGOs and those international organizations in Mexico, to get the information sent to us in advance so that when they were metered to arrive at the port of entry, it could be as smooth a process as possible.\" Once the processing was completed, the group was escorted outside the port of entry and officially released from U.S. custody. A bus came to pick them up so they could begin their journey to their respective destinations, often the homes of family and friends, where they have been allowed to live while their cases are adjudicated by U.S. courts. \"We're very happy and thankful,\" a mother from Honduras told CBS News as she prepared to board the bus with her young daughter. According to DHS figures, more than 10,000 asylum-seekers have been admitted into the U.S. through this new process, including Lazaro, who was allowed to enter the country in March. Asked how he felt when he reunited with Dayana and met Ashley, Lazaro called the moment \"indescribable.\" \"It was a very strong feeling,\" Dayana interjected. \"I spent two days with headaches. I would look at him every day and tell him that I couldn't believe that he was here.\" \"When I saw the baby and held her \u2014 I still can't believe it,\" Lazaro added. The Biden administration has touted its drawdown of the Remain in Mexico policy as a model for the future of asylum processing at the U.S.-Mexico border, highlighting the COVID-19 testing and digital registration process. The program is a safe and orderly alternative to crossing the border illegally to request U.S. refuge, officials have said. \"Under the leadership of President Biden, we have put in place a safe and humane system to process individuals with active MPP cases as the first phase of a program to restore orderly processing at the Southwest Border,\" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement to CBS News. \"We are moving quickly to rebuild our immigration system and undo the cruelty and chaos of the prior administration so our country again shows the world we are a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.\" \u00a0 So far, however, the Biden administration has kept ports of entry closed to most asylum-seekers without pending cases through \"non-essential travel\" pandemic-era restrictions. It has also continued to use the public health authority known as Title 42 invoked under former President Donald Trump to expel most migrant adults and some families to Mexico without allowing them to apply for U.S. asylum. While there has been some small-scale processing of vulnerable asylum petitioners at ports of entry in recent weeks, Biden administration officials have not said when and if large-scale processing will start, frustrating some advocates and human rights groups. \"If the administration is talking about essentially using this system for new asylum seekers, all that means is once again just having metering again,\" said Taylor Levy, an immigration attorney who helped Lazaro and Dayana, referring to the pre-pandemic U.S. practice of placing migrants on waitlists to request protection at a port of entry.\u00a0 \"That cannot be the only system that exists for people to be able to exercise their legal rights. It is legal to seek asylum. It is enshrined in our laws,\" Levy continued. Meanwhile, Lazaro and Dayana are looking forward to starting a new life with their daughter in the U.S. Like other asylum-seekers admitted into the U.S., they still have to continue their immigration proceedings to pursue asylum or other forms of permanent legal status. \"We hope to push forward in this country. To work and raise the baby,\" Lazaro said. \"May she grow up loving her country, loving her homeland. She is one more American that we have here.\"",

            "article_content": "Approaching one hundred days in the presidency, President Biden maintains fairly strong approval ratings for what look like fairly straightforward reasons: most Americans like the way he's handling the country's top priorities, with especially strong marks on the pandemic and vaccine rollout; his major legislative pieces are popular so far. And then, more stylistically perhaps, a majority of Americans pick words to describe him like \"presidential,\" \"focused\" and \"competent.\"\u00a0  At the same time they also say they'd generally like politics for the next four years to be \"steady,\" and \"normal\" (even though, we should note, they don't expect it to be) more so than they want it \"shaken up\" or even \"exciting.\"  Specifically, most view the recent stimulus package as helpful to the economy, and infrastructure, too, is very popular: spending more on roads, bridges, and broadband find widespread favor, in principle, and Mr. Biden's proposal overall nets majority backing.\u00a0  The removal of troops from Afghanistan also meets with broad approval. A range of items from his handling of economy to race relations, to foreign policy get majority nods. All told, on a lot of metrics for both policy and approach, there's resonance \u2014 at least with those open to it.  But there are clearly challenges ahead for Biden, leading a nation that's remains polarized and going through large-scale challenges. Three-fourths of Americans feel the verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial was the right one, but far fewer expect race relations, generally, to improve in the coming months.\u00a0  The president's handling of immigration, in particular, finds lower approval than other items. And while most do feel he's reaching out for bipartisanship in Congress, aside from some backing on the pandemic and infrastructure, Republicans' rank-and-file mostly oppose him, describe him negatively, and most still will not say he legitimately won.  A large majority would see more spend on roads and bridges, at least in principle.  Along political lines, Biden draws approval from Democrats, from a majority of independents and from almost everyone who voted for him in 2020. This is much less true of Republicans, though they do give him better marks for the pandemic than they do overall.  Politically though, there is still plenty of resistance from the nation's Republicans. Biden gets only about half the overall Republican approval that Obama got in early 2009, just before the party splits on presidential approvals got even more polarized, where they've remained for years.  Part of this is that most Republicans still do not say Biden was the legitimate winner of the election, and six in 10 of former President Trump's voters now want to see their congressional representatives oppose Biden at every turn. This isn't just politics. That particular group who wants opposition \u2014 while constituting a minority of Americans \u2014 also has very different views on issues from most Democrats, moderates and independents as well. For instance, most of them think efforts at racial equality are making American society worse; they say illegal immigration should be the top priority, as opposed to the pandemic or even the economy.  This CBS News survey was conducted by YouGov using a nationally representative sample of 2,527 U.S. residents interviewed between April 21-24, 2021. This sample was weighted according to gender, age, race and education based on the American Community Survey, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, as well as the 2020 presidential vote and registration status.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Former President Trump's reshaping of the federal judiciary is likely to be a legacy felt for years to come, with a total of 242 judges appointed to the courts, as well as three justices to the Supreme Court. But that impact could be felt even more acutely now that Mr. Trump has left Washington for Florida, as President Biden moves to rapidly implement items from his agenda with executive action in order to bypass the partisan gridlock on Capitol Hill. \"There certainly is the potential for collisions between the Biden administration and Trump's judges, depending on the issue and depending on the venue,\" Kenneth Manning, a professor at University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth who examined the ideological direction of judges appointed by Mr. Trump, told CBS News. \"The tendency is to oversimplify the judicial decision-making to some extent, as if it's all partisan. Of course it isn't, but some issues tend to lend themselves to more partisan and ideological decision-making than others.\" Mr. Biden has been in office fewer than 100 days, yet already Republican state attorneys general have targeted several of his policies with legal challenges, many filed in more conservative courts stacked with judges appointed by Mr. Trump and who favor limiting the power of the so-called \"administrative state.\" Mr. Biden suffered an early loss just days after he took office, when a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked his administration from enforcing a 100-day moratorium on most deportations of immigrants already in the U.S. The judge, Drew Tipton, was appointed by Mr. Trump and acted on a request by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to halt the Department of Homeland Security's freeze. Tipton then indefinitely barred the Biden administration from enforcing the 100-day pause, this time granting a request from Texas for a nationwide preliminary injunction. Meanwhile, a group of attorneys general from 21 states sued the president and his administration last week over his executive order rescinding the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. The case was filed in the federal district court in Galveston, Texas, and assigned to Judge Jeffrey Brown, also tapped by Mr. Trump. Thirteen states filed suit Wednesday in Louisiana targeting Mr. Biden's executive order halting new oil and gas leasing and drilling permits for federal lands and offshore waters, arguing it \"contravenes congressional commands\" and should be blocked. Mr. Biden is also facing a legal challenge to his first major legislative victory, the sweeping $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package he signed into law this month. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost asked a federal district court in the state last week to halt enforcement of a provision in the plan that prohibits states from using a pot of $350 billion in state aid to offset tax cuts. A second legal challenge to the provision was brought by Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich there on Thursday. It's not unusual for attorneys general to file suits involving multiple states in courts that may be more open to their claims \u2014 during the Trump administration, many legal challenges from Democrats were filed in California or New York \u2014 and the trend is continuing into the Biden administration. But Elizabeth Wydra, the president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, said this practice highlights the importance of judicial appointments. \"Who is on the bench really matters,\" she told CBS News. \"Right now you have progressives in control of the White House and you have a Democratic majority in Congress. But even if you get laws passed and signed into law, they can still be thwarted by the judiciary. The fact is, judicial appointments are a legacy of an administration that last far longer than the administration itself in many instances.\"\u00a0 For Mr. Biden, aspects of his environmental agenda \u2014 much of which will be implemented through regulations from federal agencies \u2014 as well as legislation on voting rights and civil rights could face resistance from a federal judiciary remade by his predecessor. \"Trump appointed hard-right ideological judges, so if you give them, generally speaking, a defensible legal argument on an issue like climate change or voting rights where we know there are partisan, ideological differences, you would very much tend to expect those judges to support that in their decision-making,\" Manning said. But Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, said Mr. Biden's potential legal headwinds are less about judges appointed by Mr. Trump, specifically, and rather broader legal trends that pose difficulties for executive and regulatory actions to advance larger policy goals. \"There are legal challenges to the Biden administration being able to do things without legislative support or legislative buy-in, and that's particularly true in areas where the administration is seeking broad changes in areas through the administrative process, like climate change and perhaps immigration,\" he told CBS News. \"It's certainly something this administration should be and will be attentive to.\" Already, Mr. Biden has issued 37 executive orders on a range of topics, including the climate crisis, coronavirus pandemic and immigration. But with the political gridlock in Congress \u2013 Democrats control the House but the Senate is evenly divided \u2014 the president faces an uphill battle to enact his broader agenda, possibly making regulatory action more appealing. Those regulations, though, could bump up against the current legal landscape shaped by Mr. Trump. Former White House counsel Don McGahn, who was instrumental in the former president's judicial selection process, told the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2018 the Trump administration asked prospective judges for their views on administrative law and focused on nominees wary of giving too much deference to unelected agency heads. \"It's often a more pitched battle when it comes to progressive policies because we do need action to protect workers, to enforce civil rights, to ensure our environment is protected,\" Wydra said. \"So actions that must be taken to achieve those goals often are met with greater resistance from big business or other well-organized conservative forces.\" Wydra, though, said deference to agencies \"cuts both ways\" and worked to the benefit of progressives that took aim at Mr. Trump's policies. The Supreme Court, for example, blocked the former president's attempts to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) and add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. Those setbacks, and others from courts at all levels, stemmed from the Trump administration's failure to comply with the federal law governing the rulemaking process, the Administrative Procedure Act. Mr. Trump, too, was handed a string of losses by the very judges he named to the bench as he unsuccessfully fought to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election. Manning said he expects the Biden administration to handle the regulatory process more effectively than his predecessor. \"The administrative rules and regulations that come out of this administration are going to be much tighter, much less subject to litigation or at least struck down than we saw during the Trump administration, which was very sloppy,\" he said. \"I don't see Biden being sloppy.\" While some of the challenges target Mr. Biden's executive actions on a host of areas, Wydra said they could tee up a battle royal on fundamental issues. Climate change rules, she said, \"could go to the heart of whether the executive has the authority to vigorously enforce the environmental protection laws passed by Congress.\" \"When we talk about words like Chevron doctrine or agency deference, people's eyes glaze over,\" she said. \"But when you think about what the agencies are doing, it's things Americans care deeply about \u2014 what happens in your schools, in your workplaces, whether the water you drink is safe, the food you eat is safe. It's about your civil rights. Agency action might sound boring, but it is not.\" While Republican attorneys general are pursuing their challenges to Mr. Biden's policies in more conservative courts, there is no guarantee who a case will be assigned to. Decisions appealed to the federal circuit courts are heard by panels of three judges selected at random, adding a crucial caveat to parties hoping to present their cases to friendly judges. Still, Mr. Trump prioritized filling vacancies on the federal courts of appeals and appointed 54 appellate judges. The former president also flipped three of those 12 regional courts \u2014 the 2nd, 3rd and 11th Circuits \u2014 establishing a majority of Republican-appointed judges.\u00a0 \"That's the way the system is supposed to work,\" Manning said. \"The idea is that the judges aren't supposed to be hand-picked representatives of some constituency. They're supposed to look at the facts and precedent and apply them with a blindfold on, ideally. That's the way the system works, and it makes it messy and somewhat unpredictable.\"",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump plans to reaffirm his leadership of the Republican Party and sharply criticize President Biden for an early focus on immigration policy and \"identity politics\" in his speech Sunday, the first major speech of his post-White House life. While the former president is expected to call out some of his most vocal critics, including Congresswoman Liz Cheney, he has no plans to announce a 2024 campaign to win back the presidency, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump tells CBS News. Mr. Trump's\u00a0hotly anticipated\u00a0speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida will serve as the formal launch of an unprecedented moment in modern American history: Not since Grover Cleveland lost his reelection bid in 1889 has a one-term president left office cultivating and encouraging such a large political following. \u00a0 \"We are in uncharted territory because no other former one-term presidents in modern times have ever had as large a post-election following,\" said the senior adviser, who requested anonymity to speak frankly. \u00a0 Mr. Trump's remarks in Orlando are expected to focus on two main pillars: First, strong attacks on Mr. Biden and concerns that the far left of the Democratic Party is controlling the White House and administration policy. Secondly, Trump will focus on his hopes for the future of the Republican Party and the conservative movement.\u00a0 The former president, who used to rely on social media to air his grievances and attack perceived rivals, is expected to use his remarks on Sunday to settle some scores. \u00a0 \"There's a very strong chance almost certainty that a few of those Beltway elites will be name checked,\" said the senior adviser. But, \"Kevin McCarthy is not one of those.\"\u00a0 The senior adviser strongly disputed a Politico report on Saturday that McCarthy, the House minority leader, is once again in the former president's crosshairs because he continues to stand by Cheney, the Wyoming congresswoman and third-ranking House Republican. Cheney is among just a handful of national GOP leaders who strongly denounced the former president's words and actions on and before the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. In the weeks since, she has continued to express her hope that the party moves on from Mr. Trump. \u00a0 While the former president and McCarthy are on good terms, the senior adviser said, \"There's a 99.99% chance Liz Cheney gets brought up.\"\u00a0 As for Mr. Trump's thoughts on Mr. Biden, \"Immigration will be like issue one, two and three \u2014  \u00a0amnesty, stopping wall constriction and expanding refugee access from dangerous countries,\" the senior adviser said.\u00a0 But the former president is also expected to attack the Biden administration's failure thus far to oversee a national reopening of schools and he will strongly defend the Trump administration's work to help fund the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. \u00a0 \"He will defend his vaccine work and be about as subtle as a two by four about it,\" the senior adviser said.\u00a0 In recent weeks, Mr. Biden has incorrectly said that there was \"no real plan to vaccinate most of the country\" from the outgoing Trump administration, a claim he's backed off of in recent public remarks about vaccine development. Mr. Trump on Sunday is likely to tout his administration's \"Operation Warp Speed,\" which provided government funding for the private-sector development of COVID-19 vaccines now being produced and distributed around the world.\u00a0 Mr. Trump is also expected to train his ire on the Biden administration's early use of executive authorities to halt multibillion construction of new wall along the U.S.-Mexico border; lift historically low limits on the number of refugees that can be admitted annually into the United States; and plans to extend protections to tens of thousands of people under Temporary Protected Status from countries including El Salvador, Haiti and Syria. \u00a0 The senior adviser said the former president is also concerned about the Biden administration's early focus on diversity and tackling systemic racism across society. \u00a0 \"The efforts that they've been pushing, like social engineering nonsense, is what the former president is very concerned about,\" said the adviser. \u00a0 Mr. Biden took early steps to fulfill campaign pledges to promote racial equity, diversity and gay and transgender rights. On his first day in office, he signed an executive order mandating an \"ambitious whole-of-government equity agenda\" designed to address concerns about systemic racism and a lack of diversity in federal policy-making and hiring. The administration is also taking steps to rewrite federal application forms and documents to offer or mention gender-neutral options. Mr. Biden also reversed a Pentagon ban on transgender military service members. \u00a0 The White House also touts the historic diversity of the Biden Cabinet and senior government hires, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the first African American man to lead the Pentagon; Xavier Becerra, poised to be the first Latino to lead the Department of Health and Human Services; and Rachel Levine, nominated to serve as Becerra's deputy, who would be the first openly transgender person ever confirmed by the Senate.\u00a0 In his remarks, Mr. Trump is expected to dismiss concerns about a potential Republican civil war and express his belief that the party's grassroots are firmly in his corner, with just a handful of party leaders opposed to his continued oversight of the party. \u00a0 Mr. Trump is also expected to focus his time on the party's need to win back congressional seats next year. He has already joined the fray, endorsing one of his former aides, Max Miller, who launched a primary challenge against Ohio Republican congressman Anthony Gonzalez on Friday. Gonzalez is one of the 10 House Republicans who voted in January to impeach Trump.\u00a0 Part of the reason Mr. Trump isn't planning to announce a rematch with Mr. Biden is that for now he's launching multiple political entities designed to help elect GOP congressional and gubernatorial candidates next year \u2013 and keep his own options open.\u00a0 \u00a0His 2020 campaign committee has been converted and renamed the Make American Great Again PAC and is now linked to the Save America PAC, from which the former president has been sending out statements and political endorsements. They are linked by a joint fundraising committee that will raise funds to bankroll both entities that among other things can donate to GOP candidates and pay for the former president's political travel. \u00a0 \u00a0Mr. Trump is also preparing to launch a super PAC that will be overseen by longtime on-again, off-again political aide Corey Lewandowski and other associates that would lead a board of directors, including possibly former Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon, according to the senior adviser. \u00a0 \"It's very clear that he's the one best positioned to lead the party forward,\" the senior adviser said. \"He's the one with the vision, he's the one with command of the issues and is able to provide the sharpest contrast with Democrats. The speech will make clear he's best prepared to do that.\" \u00a0 Ed O'Keefe is a senior White House and political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Arlington, Virginia \u2014 President Joe Biden framed the Virginia governor's race as a repudiation of his predecessor, tying the Republican candidate to former President Donald Trump as he campaigned for Democrat Terry McAuliffe in what's become a tight and increasingly bitter campaign. No Republican has won statewide office in Virginia since 2009, and Mr. Biden carried it by a comfortable 10 percentage points in 2020. Yet polls have shown McAuliffe tied with Republican former business executive Glenn Youngkin with the election a week away and the president's own popularity on the decline.   In the final days of the race, both candidates are focused on turning out their base supporters, with Republicans pressing culture war issues - prompting a debate over banning books in high school classrooms - and McAuliffe, who previously served as governor from 2014 to 2018, hammering Youngkin for his ties to Mr. Trump.   Mr. Biden drove that theme home during a Tuesday night rally in Arlington, just across the Potomac River from Washington, mentioning the former president by name more frequently than Youngkin and drawing a direct line from last year's presidential race to Tuesday's election.  \"I ran against Donald Trump and Terry is running against an acolyte of Donald Trump,\" Mr. Biden said. He charged that Youngkin \"not only embraces some of the essential lack of character, he endorses Donald Trump's bad ideas and bad record.\"  McAuliffe, meanwhile, told the same gathering that Youngkin \"is ending his campaign the way he started it: With divisive dog whistles.\"   \"We have a choice: A path that promotes conspiracies, hate, division, or a path focused on lifting up every single Virginian,\" McAuliffe said.  A loss by McAuliffe - or perhaps even a narrow victory - would be an ominous sign for Democrats already likely facing stiff political headwinds in next year's midterm elections, when their narrow control of the House and Senate will be on the line. The party that wins the White House historically losses congressional seats in the next election, and Virginia, this cycle's top off-year race, is seen as a key test of whether Democrats can head into 2022 with momentum. How much help Mr. Biden will offer McAuliffe is unclear though. The president has seen the percentage of Americans approving of his job performance fall after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and amid an economy that remains far from fully healed as the nation continues to struggle with the coronavirus pandemic.  Mr. Biden defended his record Tuesday night, rehashing some of his old arguments with Mr. Trump. He said that while Mr. Trump presided over a loss of American jobs, the Biden administration has overseen a surge in job creation. He also touted the strength of the stock market on his watch - a nod to one of Mr. Trump's favored metrics for success.  And Mr. Biden touted aspects of his infrastructure and social services spending proposals, tying his plans to the need to win next week's elections.  \"We're on the right track, but we've got more to do,\" the president said. Youngkin's campaign released an ad featuring a mother who years ago sought to have the book \"Beloved\" banned from classrooms in suburban Washington. The acclaimed 1987 novel by Nobel laureate Toni Morrison is about an escaped slave who kills her infant daughter rather than allowing the girl to be returned to the plantation.  The mother's advocacy led to state legislation McAuliffe vetoed in 2016 and 2017 that would have let parents opt out of having their children study classroom materials with sexually explicit content.  McAuliffe's campaign and fellow Democrats blasted Youngkin's ad and accused him of trying to \"silence\" Black authors.  McAuliffe's campaign highlighted the controversy during his rally by passing out copies of \"Beloved\" to reporters, and McAuliffe hammered Youngkin for it.  \"He wants to bring his personal culture wars into our classrooms,\" he said. \"Folks, we will not allow Glenn Youngkin to bring his hate, his chaos, into our Virginia schools.\"  Youngkin has made defending \"parental rights\" in school classrooms a centerpiece of his gubernatorial run, and his campaign responded by noting that the bills McAuliffe vetoed had passed with Democratic support. It said that by accusing Youngkin of playing racial politics, McAuliffe was effectively leveling the same charge at his own party.   That issue flared up before Mr. Biden addressed more than 1,000 people who cheered and shivered against stiff winds on soccer fields in a park in Arlington, long safely blue territory. Other nearby parts of the fast-growing Washington suburbs have moved Virginia from a onetime swing state to more reliably Democratic - especially as their populations of Black, Hispanic and Asian residents have increased.   A small group of protesters, one hoisting a large \"Mr. Trump Won\" flag, gathered nearby and briefly chanted \"Let's Go Brandon,\" a euphemism for a vulgarity against Mr. Biden that has become popular on conservative social media sites. Also, CBS News' Fin Gomez reports that soon after the president took the podium a group of immigration protesters waved signs and interrupted the president. Mr. Biden told the protesters to speak to him after the event. \"This isn't a Trump rally -- we let them holler,\" Mr. Biden added.  Ebonie Gadson, 23, an independent voter who works for a tech company and lives across the street, headed to rally to learn more about a governor's race she said she only recently began closely following.   \"Having the president's support, I think, will increase voter turnout and just get everyone excited,\" said Gadson, who added that she wanted to learn more about the race \"than just what I'd seen on TV.\"   Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Youngkin is \"ensuring every Virginian has a say in their child's education.\"  \"With an unprecedented amount of Republican enthusiasm, Virginians are ready to reject Terry McAuliffe and Joe Biden,\" McDaniel said in a statement. Mr. Biden was making his second trip to Arlington since McAuliffe launched his gubernatorial bid. He's the latest in a parade of Democratic stars to flood the state, hoping to fire up the party's base.   The president follows former President Barack Obama, Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and first lady Jill Biden.   Vice President Kamala Harris will campaign for McAuliffe on Friday, her second stop in as many weeks. In Dumfries, about 30 miles south of Washington last week, Harris called the race \"tight\" and warned against Democratic complacency.   Youngkin campaigned in Clarksville and Danville, not far from the Virginia-North Carolina border on Tuesday, part of a 50-stop bus tour. In contrast to McAuliffe, Youngkin, a former top executive at the private equity firm the Carlyle Group, has largely shied away from outside help from national party members, though he has been endorsed by Mr. Trump.  \"This is no longer a campaign,\" Youngkin said as he visited suburban Richmond recently. \"This is a movement.\"",

            "article_content": "Former President Trump returned to the public spotlight on Sunday at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, giving his first public speech since leaving office and since he was acquitted in his Senate impeachment trial.\u00a0 Mr. Trump laid out his vision for the Republican Party, called for states to pass new election laws, teased a possible 2024 run and criticized President Biden's first month in office.\u00a0 Mr. Trump indicated he'll remain active in Republican politics and said his \"journey\" that began during his first presidential run is \"far from being over.\" The former president shot down rumors that he was thinking about creating a third party.\u00a0 \"We have the Republican Party. It's going to unite and be stronger than ever before,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Wouldn't that be brilliant? Let's start a new party\u2014let's divide our vote, so that you can never win. No, we're not interested in that.\" Mr. Trump said he believes the GOP is united and the divisions within the party are \"between a handful of Washington D.C. establishment political hacks, and everybody else all over the country.\" He said he will be \"actively working\" to elect Republicans who embody his vision for the party and told his supporters to donate to his PAC if they want to help elect the candidates he supports rather than other GOP groups.\u00a0 \"We want Republican leaders who are loyal to the voters and who will work proudly for the vision I've laid out today,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that includes issues like supporting the military, promoting \"law and order,\" \"great trade deals and great education.\" Mr. Trump attacked some of his critics, including the seven GOP senators who voted to convict him in his impeachment trial. He also called out the 10 House Republicans who voted for his impeachment, including Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who Mr. Trump said is \"a person who loves to see our troops fighting.\" \"Get rid of them all,\" Mr. Trump said about the Republicans who backed impeachment. Results from a conference straw poll found 55% of attendees would vote for Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination if the election was held today. Nearly 7 in 10 respondents said that they want Mr. Trump to run in the next presidential election. Mr. Trump attacked President Biden, saying his successor has had the \"most disastrous first month of any president in modern history\" and sharply criticized his decisions on foreign policy, energy and immigration.\u00a0 \"In just one short month we've gone from America first to America last,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There's no better example than the new and horrible crisis on the southern border.\" The former president also called for schools to reopen and accused the Biden administration of catering to teachers' unions.\u00a0 \"Their callous indifference to working families is equally clear when it comes to the critical matter of getting America's children back to school,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's the teachers' union, it's the votes and it shouldn't happen.\" Mr. Trump's appearance capped off a conference that featured many leaders in the Repubilcan Party, including potential 2024 presidential candidates, saying the former president should continue to play a role in the GOP. Several speakers said that Republicans shouldn't return to the policies from the pre-Trump era.\u00a0 Attendees erupted in applause after Mr. Trump falsely suggested that he won the 2020 election and said, \"I may even decide to beat them for a third time.\" \"With your help we will take back the House, we will win the Senate, and then a Republican president will make a triumphant return to the White House. And I wonder who that will be,\" Mr. Trump later said.\u00a0 During the conference there were seven panels about the 2020 election and some speakers repeated false claims about widespread fraud in the election. Mr. Trump in his speech called for an end to no-excuse absentee voting, strong voter ID laws and for the election to take place on one day. More than 40 state legislatures have introduced bills that would restrict voting access, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.\u00a0 \"We need election integrity and election reform immediately,\" Mr. Trump said. He went on to falsely state that the election was \"rigged\" and complained that the Supreme Court \"didn't have the guts or the courage to make the right decision\" on a case that challenged the election results.\u00a0 Mr. Trump and his allies lost more than 60 court cases after the election, and his own attorney general said there was no evidence of fraud at a level that \"could have effected a different outcome in the election.\" Earlier on Sunday, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a staunch ally of the former president, said he wants to see Mr. Trump run for president again in 2024.\u00a0 \"President Trump is the leader of the conservative movement. He's the leader of the America first movement. He's the leader of the Republican Party,\" Jordan said. \"And I hope on January 20, 2025 he is once again the leader of our great country.\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump returned to the political stage with a speech at the North Carolina Republican Convention on Saturday, solidifying his continued symbolic leadership of the party despite his repeated falsehoods about the 2020 election, and allowing him to exert influence amid an ongoing social media ban.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's second public speech comes after a tumultuous three months for his party. He ripped President Biden's first several months in office, touted his own accomplishments in the White House and repeated false claims that the 2020 election was a \"hoax.\" He teased that 2024 is a year that he is \"very much\" looking forward too, but placed his focus on the midterm elections. \"The survival of America depends upon our ability to elect Republicans at every level, starting with the midterms next year,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Mr. Trump attacked Mr. Biden's record on immigration, the economy and foreign policy for a substantial portion of the speech, saying \"our country is being destroyed before our very own eyes.\" The former president also highlighted his administration's work on the vaccine, asserting that is what set up the recovery that's currently taking place. Mr. Trump also seized on renewed interest in pursuing the origins of COVID-19, with some questioning whether the virus originated at a lab in Wuhan, China. He mocked Dr. Anthony Fauci, Mr. Biden's chief medical adviser, for dismissing that theory in the past. Mr. Trump said he got along with Fauci, but criticized Fauci's track record.\u00a0 \"He's not a great doctor, but he's a hell of a promoter,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He likes television more than any politician in this room, and they like television, but he's been wrong on almost every issue and he was wrong Wuhan and the lab also.\" The crowd erupted when Mr. Trump called on China to pay the rest of the world for damage caused by the virus. \"All nations should work together to present China a bill for a minimum of $10 trillion to compensate for the damage they caused,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We should all declare with one unified voice that China must pay.\" Mr. Trump has released numerous statements in recent weeks about the November election and the ongoing audit in Arizona, indicating that the 2020 election is still very much on his mind. He turned to elections towards the end of his remarks Saturday, and once again falsely stated that the 2020 election was a \"hoax\" and the \"crime of the century.\" Mr. Trump praised Republican lawmakers who have been working in state capitals around the country to overhaul their voting laws in the wake of that election.\u00a0 \"I'm not the one trying to undermine American democracy, I'm the one that's trying to save it,\" Mr. Trump said. The comment received a loud round of applause.\u00a0 Mr. Trump and his allies lost more than 60 court cases seeking to overturn the results after the November election and his own\u00a0attorney general said there was no evidence of fraud at a level that \"could have effected a different outcome in the election.\" It was the \"most secure election in American history,\" said the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.\u00a0 As the former president contemplates his political future, prosecutors in the\u00a0New York attorney general's office\u00a0and the Manhattan district attorney have been investigating Mr. Trump's business. The former president dismissed those probes on Saturday night as part of an ongoing witch hunt. \u00a0 \"They're in search of a crime. It's a fishing expedition,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They failed in Washington. They failed all over the place. Between the impeachment hoax number one, impeachment hoax number two. All of these investigations. 'Ah, s***, we failed. Let's send it to the radical left prosecutors in New York. Maybe they can have more luck.'\"\u00a0 Even though Republicans lost control of the House, Senate and White House under Mr. Trump, he continues to have a remarkable hold on the party. A recent CBS News poll found that 66% of Republicans said it is important for Republicans to be loyal to Mr. Trump. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published May 21 showed just 28% of Republicans think Mr. Trump should not run for president again in 2024.\u00a0 Mr. Trump won North Carolina in 2016 and 2020 and the state will be one of the top Senate battlegrounds in 2022 with an open race to replace retiring Republican Senator Richard Burr. Mr. Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, had been considering jumping into the race, but she announced Saturday night that she will not be running. \"Because of my two kids who are very young, 1 and 3, Carolina and Luke, it is going to be very hard for me to enter this Senate race right now. But I am saying no for now, not no forever,\" Lara Trump said. Following her announcement, Mr. Trump endorsed Congressman Ted Budd in the GOP primary.\u00a0 Mr. Trump's continued grip on the GOP has played out not just on the campaign trail, but also in the halls of Congress.\u00a0 House Republicans ousted Congresswoman Liz Cheney from her leadership position in May because of her frequent criticism of Mr. Trump, her refusal to promote false claims about the election and her insistence that the party should not whitewash the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob of Trump supporters. Cheney was replaced as conference chair by Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a staunch Trump ally. A few weeks after Cheney's unceremonious removal, Senate Republicans blocked a bill that would have created a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack. Most Republicans in Congress, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have argued that the country should move forward from the attack. Rioters threatened the lives of lawmakers and former Vice President Mike Pence during the assault, which resulted in the deaths of five people, and more than 140 law enforcement officials were injured. Pence acknowledged in a speech on Thursday that he would \"never see eye-to-eye\" with Mr. Trump about the attack. The president, meanwhile, remains banned from Facebook and Twitter. Facebook announced Friday that it is barring Mr. Trump from its platform for at least two years, after finding that his posts on January 6 stoked violence and posed a risk to public safety. The two-year ban began on January 7, when Mr. Trump was initially suspended from Facebook, and it will keep him off the platform through the 2022 midterm elections. \"I'm not too interested in that,\" Mr. Trump said of returning to Facebook.\u00a0 Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Washington\u00a0\u2014 \u00a0As U.S. and Haitian authorities continue working to free 17 members of a\u00a0missionary group kidnapped\u00a0almost three weeks ago, there is new immediacy to the question of how to restore order inside a country in the grips of gang violence and a humanitarian crisis. The recently-resigned U.S. special envoy to Haiti who quit in September to protest the Biden administration's Haiti policy has explained to \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan why he believed the dramatic move was his only option even as desperate Haitians flee to American shores. \"I realized the only way I'd get the right attention was by going nuclear and resigning,\" long-time diplomat Daniel Foote told Brennan in his first interview since resigning. Ambassador Foote told CBS News that his frustration with the Biden administration's \"deeply flawed\" Haiti policy had been mounting since late August or early September.  One of the first incidents to worry him specifically was the forced clearance in late September of a makeshift camp around a bridge near the Del Rio Port of Entry in Texas, which saw about 15,000 people, many of them Haitian migrants, deported without the opportunity to claim legal asylum. \"I learned about [the] deportations by the press, like everybody else, which was troubling to me,\" he told Brennan in the interview. He confirmed hearing reports from Homeland Security in the months prior that large numbers of Haitians might be among convoys of migrants moving through Central America toward the U.S. Southern border, but said he was not part of any State Department discussion about how to handle it.\u00a0 That exclusion, and the decision to deport migrants back to dire conditions in Haiti \u2014 a situation he compared to a war zone \u2014 troubled him. \u00a0 Due to the coronavirus pandemic, migrants who illegally enter the U.S. are being expelled without asylum hearings. About 17,000 Haitians crossed the border into the U.S. between September and October alone. More than 7,600 were sent back.  \"The Haitian state cannot take care of the people that it currently has, and to put thousands or tens of thousands of additional desperate people into that situation is only going to fuel a terrible situation,\" said Foote. He added that the U.S. routinely urges other countries not to take such measures, which have been called a violation of international law by groups such as Human Rights Watch.  The Biden administration disputes Foote's version of events, but a second State Department official, Harold Koh, also resigned in protest over the government's immigration policy. The regulation, known as Title 42, is a border policy decided on by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has been in place since the COVID-19 pandemic began during the Trump administration. Migrants are expected to continue fleeing due to the deteriorating security situation in Haiti. After the July assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse, Ariel Henry stepped in and claimed the role of acting prime minister. Asked whether he believes Henry played any role in Mo\u00efse's assassination, as has been alleged by a former chief prosecutor in Haiti, Foote said he couldn't answer directly.  \"There are allegations \u2014 there are phone records that indicate that he had several conversations before and after the assassination with one of the prime suspects,\" said the ambassador, adding: \"Ariel Henry has some questions to answer for his citizenry.\"  Henry denies the allegations. The State Department says it supports the current government but wants Haitians to decide their own fate. In the wake of a devastating earthquake in August, however, the White House dropped its call for new elections to be held this year. The State Department says there should be elections as soon as conditions on the ground allow it. Foote said that while he didn't advocate for a large-scale U.S. military intervention in Haiti, he did propose sending \"a company or so of U.S. special forces\" into the Caribbean nation \"to train an anti-gang task force within the Haitian national police. So, you're talking about 30 [to] 60 people.\"   The Biden administration opposes sending any troops. Foote agrees that any intervention to stabilize the country would only be of short-term benefit, and would be broadly opposed by the Haitian people. But the security situation is rapidly deteriorating as criminal gangs gain ground. A senior State Department official told CBS News that there are probably between 3,000 and 4,000 gang members in Port-au-Prince, and that the gangs are in \"loose coalition with each other and have ties of some type to political figures.\" They have cut off the country's fuel supply, and they're taking hostages. The group of missionaries affiliated with the Ohio-based Christian Aid Ministries, including 16 Americans and one Canadian, are being held by a gang called \"400 Mawozo.\" The group has demanded a ransom of $1 million per hostage \u2014 $17 million in total. The White House says President Biden is briefed on the situation daily. \"The gangs are stronger than the police. The police are outgunned and overmatched right now,\" said Foote. \"They need lethal aid. They need training\u2026 We can give that to them.\" While the impoverished island country is not the type of national security crisis that grabs daily headlines, the real threat of a failed state in America's backyard may result in future migrant flows across the U.S. Southern border. Foote predicts that many of those who are being expelled will try again. He told Brennan that the U.S. could live with a failed Haitian state next door, \"but it's going to have a major negative impact on us.\"",

            "article_content": "Brittany Aldean, who is married to country star Jason Aldean and has a large social media following of her own, received criticism this week after sharing photos on Instagram of her family wearing anti-Biden shirts. Now, her husband, who appeared in the post, is defending his beliefs. Brittany posted several photos of herself wearing a shirt that read \"Anti-Biden Social Club\" \u2013 a play on the popular athlesiure brand Anti-Social Social Club. The Instagram post included photos of her kids, Memphis and Navy, wearing shirts that read \"Hidin' from Biden.\" A post shared by Brittany Aldean (@brittanyaldean) Brittany, who has 2 million followers, received nearly 400,000 comments \u2013 some positive, but some negative.\u00a0 In another post, she shared a shot of her son, holding up two thumbs while wearing the \"Hidin' from Biden\" shirt. \"My boy!\" her husband commented.\u00a0 Alden later took to his own Instagram to share about his beliefs. \"I will never apologize for my beliefs or my love for my family and country. This is the greatest country in the world and I want to keep it that way.\u00a0#unapologetic\u00a0\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u00a0#phoenixwasfire,\" Aldean wrote in a Thursday night post with a photo of himself silhouetted in front of an American flag.\u00a0 The singer was in one of the photos his wife posted, but he was not wearing an anti-Biden shirt. \u00a0 On her Instagram stories Thursday, Brittany Aldean also re-shared a TikTok video that praised her for being openly conservative. \"Conservatives, it's okay to speak up. Some people won't like you, but most will,\" she wrote. \"You're allowed to have an opinion too.\" She also shared that she was invited to the Turning Point USA offices in Phoenix. The organization, founded by Charlie Kirk, is a conservative group with chapters at many U.S. colleges. Southern Poverty Law Center has warned of Turning Point USA's \"blooming romance with the alt-right\" and its connection to racists. Kirk shared a photo of himself and Brittany during her visit on Thursday, writing: \"Anti-Biden Social Club.\" Many country stars sing about patriotism, but keep any strong political opinions to themselves, so as not to disappoint some fans. In a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, Aldean said he didn't vote in the presidential election, because he had just moved and wasn't registered to vote in the right county.\u00a0 When asked if he voted for Mr. Trump \u2013 whom he said was \"busting his butt on the campaign trail\" and \"digging in to the heartland of America\" \u2013 Aldean said: \"I don't know if I'm going to cross that road with you. That's one subject I do stay away from. Politics is a no-win.\" He kept his personal politics close to his vest, like many country artists, but Aldean has since shared more about his views. In August, he applauded fans for not wearing masks at his concert \u2013 an issue that has become politicized, though experts say masks have proved to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0 His wife has long been open about her views, often posting about her disappointment in the 2020 presidential election results.\u00a0 On the opposite end of the spectrum, countless country stars are breaking the typically held silence to share their more liberal political views. Country-pop star Kacey Musgraves addressed then-President Trump on Twitter\u00a0in 2019, criticizing his lack of response to mass shootings. \"Don't you hear us,\u00a0@realDonaldTrump? Don't you hear our pain? You have the power to become a hero. Why don't you take it?\" Taylor Swift has promoted the Equality Act \u2013 the bill that extends civil rights protections to gay and transgender Americans \u2013 during music videos, awards shows and on social media. She spoke about breaking her political silence in a documentary. Willie Nelson performed at a Biden fundraiser in 2020 and spoke out about the immigration controversy at America's southern border, calling it \"outrageous\" and saying \"Christians everywhere should be up in arms.\" Caitlin O'Kane is a digital content producer covering trending stories for CBS News and its good news brand, The Uplift.",

            "article_content": "Former President Trump will headline a big-dollar fundraising event next month in Dallas, according to an invitation obtained by CBS News.\u00a0 The event on July 11, which benefits the political action committee Make America Great Again Action, asks donors to contribute $15,000 per person or $25,000 per couple to participate in a photo opportunity with the former president and invites them to a reception. \u00a0 The invitation also offers recipients more information about a golf foursome with Mr. Trump if they check a box when they RSVP. MAGA Action is run by Mr. Trump's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. The committee is a super PAC, meaning it can raise unlimited sums of money. It can spend during elections, but it can't donate directly to political candidates or coordinate with any of the candidates it benefits.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has said he intends to support candidates in the 2022 midterms and has not ruled out another run for president in 2024. But he has remained mostly out of the public spotlight since leaving office.\u00a0 The former president is already scheduled to be in Dallas that weekend to speak at a Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) event. He spoke at the group's Florida conference earlier this year, when he made his first public appearance after leaving the White House. On Saturday, Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks at the North Carolina Republican Party's Convention.\u00a0 The pricey fundraiser shows Mr. Trump remains a force in Republican donor circles. In April, he headlined the Republican National Committee's spring donor retreat and his Mar-a-Lago Club was a popular destination for GOP fundraisers during the winter and early spring.\u00a0 A recent CBS News poll found 66% of Republicans said it is important for Republicans to be loyal to Mr. Trump. More than three-quarters of Republicans said the Party should follow his examples on economic issues, leadership, immigration and how to treat the media. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published May 21 showed just 28% of Republicans think Mr. Trump should not run for president again in 2024.\u00a0 Mr. Trump is expected to start holding rallies again in the coming weeks and has said he plans to be active in the 2022 midterm elections. Earlier this week he endorsed Texas Governor Greg Abbott for reelection. He has mostly endorsed incumbents so far but has also weighed in on some 2022 primary elections. He's backing his former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is running for governor of Arkansas, Congressman Mo Brooks, who is running for Alabama's open Senate seat, Congressman Jody Hice, who is challenging Georgia's GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and former aide Max Miller. Miller is challenging Ohio Congressman Anthony Gonzalez, who was one of the House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump.\u00a0 Major Garrett is CBS News' chief Washington correspondent. He's also the host of \"The Takeout,\" a weekly multi-platform interview show on politics, policy and pop culture.",

            "article_content": "When House Republicans ousted Congresswoman Liz Cheney from her leadership post, it spoke to the direction of the Republican Party in at least one specific way: what should happen to those who publicly break with former President Donald Trump? So, we surveyed the nation's self-identified Republicans to learn what they thought of the week's events. They still very much want their party to show loyalty to Mr. Trump and adhere to the idea that President Biden didn't legitimately win.\u00a0 Their views on Cheney, in turn, now reflect those wishes. Eighty percent of Republicans who'd heard about the vote agree with Cheney's removal \u2014 they feel she was off-message, unsupportive of Mr. Trump, and that she's wrong about the 2020 presidential election. To a third of them, and most particularly for those who place the highest importance on loyalty, Cheney's removal also shows \"disloyalty will be punished.\" Those Republicans opposed to her removal \u2014 just a fifth of the party right now \u2014 say it's mainly because there's room for different views in the party, not all need support Mr. Trump and this was a distraction. But when we look down the line to any potential electoral impact, theirs might be even more limited: this group is also less likely to report voting in Republican primaries. Republicans say that Mr. Trump himself represents their views just as well as they think the party does; it's a personal connection to him we've seen for years. Today, loyalty also means they specifically want the party to follow more of the former president's examples across a range of items, including economics, issues of race and immigration, how to treat the media, using power and leadership, generally.\u00a0 It's important, but not very important \u2014 and not as much as governing. Yes, the Republican rank and file still deny the legitimacy of the election, as they have since last fall, but it's still far more important to the nation's Republicans now for their leaders to propose legislation on key issues and to match their voters on policy and on values, than it is to see them claim election fraud.\u00a0 Given the way so many Republicans feel about 2020, we wanted to explore the implications of that belief as they strategize for the midterm elections in 2022, as well as the 2024 elections. So, we offered a choice: to succeed next time, do Republicans feel the party needs to focus on message and popular ideas to win over more voters? Or does it already have enough voters, and therefore need to focus on pushing for changes to the voting rules in states and districts instead?\u00a0 On balance, message focus barely came out as top priority. Almost half \u2014 and especially, for those who believe Mr. Biden didn't legitimately win \u2014 think changing the voting process, rather than messaging, is more important. The CBS News survey of 951 Republicans in the U.S. was conducted by YouGov between May 12-14 2021. This sample was selected from self-identified Republicans (including Republicans and Republican-leaners) who had completed a previous CBS News national poll in 2021. The sample was weighted to be representative of Republicans in the previous national polls, according to gender, age, race, education, geographic region, 2020 presidential vote, political ideology, and degree of partisan Identification.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer on Tuesday cautioned against adding seats to the nation's highest court, as some liberal activists are urging to weaken the power of its conservative majority, with Breyer warning that doing so could erode the public's trust in the institution. In remarks delivered remotely to Harvard Law School for its annual Scalia Lecture, Breyer, one of the Supreme Court's three liberal justices, said his speech aimed to \"make those whose initial instincts may favor important structural change or other similar institutional changes, such as forms of court-packing, think long and hard before they embody those changes in law.\" Breyer said the Supreme Court's authority rests on \"a trust that the court is guided by legal principle, not politics\" and warned that \"structural alteration motivated by the perception of political influence can only feed that perception, further eroding that trust.\" \"If the public sees judges as politicians in robes, its confidence in the courts, and in the rule of law itself, can only diminish, diminishing the court's power, including its power to act as a 'check' on other branches,\" he said. Progressive groups and some Democrats have been advocating for expanding the Supreme Court as a way of diluting its 6-3 conservative majority. Calls for more seats to be added to the high court amplified during former President Donald Trump's tenure, as he named three justices to the bench, shifting it ideologically to the right. President Biden said in October he is \"not a fan\" of growing the Supreme Court beyond its nine members and vowed to create a commission to issue recommendations on how to reform the court system. Details of the commission, however, have been scant.\u00a0 While the Supreme Court boasts a conservative majority, Breyer pushed back on the characterization of it as a \"conservative\" court, pointing to the justices' refusal to wade into legal disputes over the results of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Trump has lambasted the Supreme Court for refusing to deliver him a second term in office, claiming the justices were \"gutless, and will go down in history as such.\" \"The court's decision in the 2000 presidential election case, Bush v. Gore, is often referred to as an example of its favoritism of conservative causes,\" he said. \"But the court did not hear or decide cases that affected the political disagreements arising out of the later 2020 election.\" He also cited the 2012 ruling upholding the Affordable Care Act, the health care law championed by Democrats, as well as other recent decisions involving politically fraught issues. \"It did re-affirm precedents that favored a woman's right to an abortion,\" Breyer said. \"It did find unlawful certain immigration, census, and other orders, rules, or regulations, favored by a conservative president.\" But Breyer also acknowledged the Supreme Court issued other rulings \"that can reasonably be understood as favoring conservative policies and disfavoring liberal policies. These considerations convince me that it is wrong to think of the court as just another political institution and it is doubly wrong to think of its members as junior-league politicians.\" Judicial philosophy, he said, \"is not a code word for politics.\" Breyer pushed back on the habit of the press to label justices as \"conservative\" or \"liberal,\" and link the court members to the president who appointed them, as well as the politicization of the Senate's confirmation process for Supreme Court nominees. These practices, Breyer said, \"reinforce the thought that is likely present already in your minds that Supreme Court justices are primarily political officials, or let's call them junior league politicians, rather than jurists.\" At 82 years old, Breyer is the oldest and most senior member of the Supreme Court's shrunken liberal wing. Nominated by former President Bill Clinton in 1994, he is facing growing pressure to resign his seat on the high court to allow Mr. Biden to name a successor. The president has promised to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court should a vacancy arise, and Democrats currently have a razor-thin majority in the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Biden signaled on Thursday that he would be willing to consider supporting the elimination of the filibuster if Senate Republicans use it to block Democratic legislative priorities from receiving a full vote on the Senate floor. He also advocated the return of a \"talking\" filibuster, which would require a senator to talk for an extended period of time in order to block a bill. Most legislation in the Senate requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Democrats hold a narrow 50-seat majority, and most Democratic legislation is unlikely to garner support from 10 Republicans. The filibuster is the biggest roadblock to Democrats achieving most of their legislative priorities. At his first press conference as president, Mr. Biden said the filibuster was \"being abused in a gigantic way.\" He added that a talking filibuster would force senators \"to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapse,\" and then the Senate could proceed with a vote afterwards. \"I strongly support moving in that direction,\" Mr. Biden said. This would not address the problem of a bill needing 60 votes to advance, and he sidestepped a question about whether he believed it should take 60 votes or 51 votes to break a filibuster. He also called himself a \"practical guy,\" and suggested that he would be willing to go further on the filibuster if it seemed clear that Democratic priorities like bills on voting rights were not going to receive votes on the floor. \"If we have to, if there's complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we'll have to go beyond what I'm talking about,\" Mr. Biden said. Democrats were able to pass their recent $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan using a process known as reconciliation, which allows certain bills to pass with a simple majority. But reconciliation cannot be used for most types of legislation, setting up an eventual showdown in the Senate over immigration, voting rights and more. Earlier on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he would bring a massive voting rights and government reform bill to the Senate floor for a vote, even though it is almost certain to fail due to Republican opposition.\u00a0 GOP senators claim that S. 1, known as the\u00a0For the People Act, is a power grab by Democrats, while Democrats insist that they are trying to protect voting rights as several states introduce legislation that could make voting more difficult. \"Across the country, the Republican Party seems to believe that the best strategy for winning elections is not to win more voters but to try and prevent the other side from voting,\" Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday. \"That's not America. That's not democracy. And this Senate will take action to protect the voting rights of tens of millions of Americans. The Senate will vote on the For the People Act.\" The bill would establish automatic, same-day and online voter registration nationwide. It includes some measures that would require states to overhaul their registration systems. It would expand absentee voting, limit states' ability to remove people from voter rolls, increase federal funds for election security and reform the redistricting process.\u00a0 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell slammed S. 1 in a speech on the Senate floor moments after Schumer spoke, calling Democratic arguments that it would protect voting rights \"utter nonsense.\" \"That goal is let Washington Democrats rig the rules of democracy from top-down to hide that partisan project behind the smoke screen of voting rights,\" McConnell said. The For the People Act may not even receive support from all Democrats, as Senator Joe Manchin expressed skepticism about the bill on Wednesday. He is currently the only Democrat in the Senate who is not a co-sponsor of the bill. Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, is also vehemently opposed to eliminating the filibuster. \"I think all of us should be able to be united around voting rights, but it should be limited to voting rights,\" Manchin told reporters on Wednesday, arguing that S. 1 as it is currently written \"might divide us even further on a partisan basis.\" But if the bill were limited to voting rights, it would strip provisions related to campaign finance and ethics reform, which are key priorities for progressives. In a lengthy statement on Tuesday, Manchin expressed concerns about S. 1, and said that he would support bipartisan legislation on voting rights. \"As the Senate prepares to take up the For the People Act, we must work toward a bipartisan solution that protects everyone's right to vote, secures our elections from foreign interference, and increases transparency in our campaign finance laws. Pushing through legislation of this magnitude on a partisan basis may garner short-term benefits, but will inevitably only exacerbate the distrust that millions of Americans harbor against the U.S. government,\" Manchin said. His statement on Thursday further indicates that he is unwilling to create an exception to the filibuster rule specifically for voting rights, as has been suggested by some Democrats. Manchin said last week that creating such a carve-out would be \"like being a little bit pregnant,\" meaning that it is impossible to only partially change the filibuster. Some senators have changed their minds on the filibuster as it becomes clear that Republicans will block many bills supported by Democrats. Senator Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, wrote in an op-ed in the Washington Post on Wednesday that \"supporting the continuation of the rule becomes harder and harder to justify\" if the minority uses the filibuster as a tool for obstruction. \"All-out opposition to reasonable voting rights protections cannot be enabled by the filibuster; if forced to choose between a Senate rule and democracy itself, I know where I will come down,\" King wrote. He quoted Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock, who said in a speech on the Senate floor recently that \"it is a contradiction to say we must protect minority rights in the Senate, while refusing to protect minority rights in the society.\" Warnock argued on Thursday that it is critical to pass S. 1 to counter a bill signed into law by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp on Thursday that includes new restrictions on voting by mail. Critics say that the bill will disproportionately affect people of color, making it more difficult for them to vote. \"Instead of adjusting their message, some Georgia politicians have decided to rewrite the rules with SB 202-a thinly-veiled attempt to suppress the vote. It's Jim Crow in new clothes. We will not go back. And Congress must act to protect the sacred right to vote,\" Warnock, who represents Georgia, wrote on Twitter. Senator Kyrsten Sinema has also said she is against eliminating the rule. Unless she and Manchin change their minds, most of the progressive legislation proposed by Democrats will remain in limbo. In a letter to Democratic colleagues on Thursday, Schumer also said that the Senate Judiciary Committee would soon take up the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which would restore provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court. Like S. 1, it is unlikely to receive the needed support from 60 senators. Schumer added that the Senate will take up the Equality Act, which would enshrine legal protections for LGBTQ Americans, and COVID-19 hate crimes legislation proposed by Senator Mazie Hirono aimed at protecting Asian Americans from violence and discrimination. He also said that the Senate would take up gun control legislation and bills related to climate change, both of which are unlikely to garner Republican support. \"The challenges our country still faces are immense, and there is no reason both sides cannot work together on issues that will affect our country and our children's future,\" Schumer said in his speech on the Senate floor. \"We won't agree on everything, but we must agree that inaction is unacceptable. The Senate must help the country finish the job against COVID while continuing to build a more equal economy and a more just society.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

Pence was at the Capitol overseeing the counting of the Electoral College votes when the mob of angry Trump supporters overran the Capitol, and he had to be evacuated from the Senate chamber. \u00a0 \"January 6 was a dark day in the history of the United States Capitol, but thanks to the swift action of the Capitol Police and federal law enforcement, violence was quelled, the Capitol was secured and that same day we reconvened the Congress and did our duty under the Constitution and the laws of the United States,\" Pence said Thursday. \"President Trump and I have spoken many times since we've left office and I don't know if we'll ever see eye-to-eye on that day, but I will always be proud of what we accomplished for the American people over the last four years.\" Pence spoke Thursday at a Hillsborough County Republican Party fundraiser in New Hampshire, the pivotal early primary state. It's his second trip to an early primary state, following a speech before a conservative Christian group at the end of April. In that speech, he only made one reference to the January 6 attack, calling it a \"tragedy.\" His remarks on Thursday came less than a week after Senate Republicans blocked a bill to create a commission to investigate the January 6 attack that left five people dead. Republicans were mostly unified in their opposition against the bill, but six senators voted to advance it. On Thursday, Pence accused Democrats of using the attack for political purposes. \"I will not allow Democrats or their allies in the media to use one tragic day to discredit the aspirations of millions of Americans,\" Pence said. \"Or allow Democrats or their allies in the media to distract our attention from a new administration intent on dividing our country to advance their radical agenda.\" In his speech, Pence also highlighted the Trump administration's accomplishments on issues such as economy, immigration and foreign policy. He sharply criticized the Biden administration's first 130 days in office, saying Mr. Biden campaigned as a moderate, but governs \"as the most liberal president since FDR.\"\u00a0 \"They've proposed trillions of dollars in a so-called infrastructure bill that's just a thinly disguised climate change bill,\" Pence said.\u00a0 The former vice president also slammed Critical Race Theory, a frequent target of Republicans, and declared that \"America is not a racist nation.\" He blamed Democrats for rising crime rates and said law enforcement needs to be respected. \"Black lives are not endangered by police, Black lives are saved by police every day,\" Pence said. \"We don't need to defund the police, we need to defend the police.\" Pence also touched on GOP efforts around the country to overhaul state voting laws. He blasted the federal bill, HR1, which has passed the Democratic-controlled House, as\u00a0 national government overreach and said it's up to state lawmakers to write their own election laws.\u00a0 \"We will defend state-based election reform, support Voter ID, and we're going to work every day to restore the confidence of every American in every vote,\" Pence said.

The House passed a resolution punishing Gosar by a vote of 223 to 207, with Republicans Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois joining all Democrats in support of the measure and one Republican voting \"present.\" After the resolution was approved, Gosar stood in the well of the House chamber while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi read aloud the formal rebuke against him.\u00a0 The resolution stated that \"depictions of violence can foment actual violence and jeopardize the safety of elected officials, as witnessed in this chamber on January 6\" and noted that \"violence against women in politics is a global phenomenon meant to silence women and discourage them from seeking positions of authority.\" The video that sparked the censure resolution was posted to Gosar's congressional Twitter and Instagram accounts last week and racked up more than 3 million views. In the cartoon, Gosar is portrayed as a sword-wielding character who slashes at a figure with Ocasio-Cortez's face with his weapons from behind, causing the character to collapse to the ground. Then, with a sword in each hands, Gosar is depicted charging toward Mr. Biden and raising his arms in attack. Just 23 other members of Congress in U.S. history have been censured, the most severe punishment a lawmaker can face short of expulsion, with the most recent being Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel of New York in 2010 for ethics violations.\u00a0 Ahead of the vote, Ocasio-Cortez criticized Republicans for failing to denounce Gosar's actions and asked her fellow lawmakers, \"Does anyone in this chamber find this behavior acceptable?\" \"What is so hard about saying that this is wrong?\" she said in a speech from the House floor. \"This is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar. But this is about what we are willing to accept.\" Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calls out House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy for not condemning Rep. Paul Gosar posting an anime video showing him killing her: \"What is so hard about saying that this is wrong?\"She says the censure vote for Gosar is \"about what we are willing to accept.\" pic.twitter.com/9mz5s0AC7n But Gosar defended himself, arguing he does not \"espouse violence toward anyone.\" He did not apologize to Ocasio-Cortez and instead said he \"self-censored\" by removing the portrayal from his social media accounts on his own accord after learning his colleagues felt threatened by it. \"There is no threat in the cartoon other than the threat that immigration poses to our country, and no threat was intended by my staff or me,\" the Arizona lawmaker said in floor remarks, likening himself to Alexander Hamilton at the conclusion of his remarks.\u00a0 The move by the House to discipline the Arizona Republican was the latest undertaken by the Democratic majority in response to violent statements promoted by GOP lawmakers. In February, the House voted to remove Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committees after extremist and racist comments she posted to social media before she was elected to Congress surfaced.\u00a0 Democrats have said such action against those Republicans was warranted as their conduct promotes violence against members of Congress and GOP congressional leaders have failed to discipline their colleagues on their own. But Republicans warn that Democrats are now paving the way for them to respond in kind when the GOP retakes control of the House. \"Today's action once again tramples on the traditional norms of the House: The idea that the majority and the minority have the right to appoint their own members to committees as they see fit,\" Congressman Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the House Rules Committee, said from the House floor. \"It sets a dangerous and disturbing precedent that will likely change the character of the House in the years to come, and not for the better.\" But Pelosi said the censure resolution against Gosar was about \"workplace harassment and violence against women.\" She also condemned House Republican leadership for failing to discipline Gosar on their own, saying it is \"sad that this entire House must take this step\" because of their refusal to respond. \"These actions demand a response,\" Pelosi said. \"We cannot have a member joking about murdering each other or threatening the president of the United States. This is both an endangerment of our elected officials and an insult to the institution of the House of Representatives.\" In response, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy accused Pelosi of \"burning down the House on her way out the door\" and claimed Democrats are abusing their power by removing Gosar from his committees. Gosar has been in Congress since 2011 and serves on the House Oversight and Reform Committee alongside Ocasio-Cortez, as well as the House Natural Resources Committee. Across his six terms in Congress, he has raised eyebrows for social media posts and promotion of conspiracy theories, including that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Gosar objected to the electoral votes from his home state of Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6 and has claimed Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran who was fatally shot when she tried to jump through a broken window outside the House chamber during the January 6 assault, was \"executed.\" The U.S. Capitol Police cleared the officer who killed Babbitt and said he acted lawfully and within department policy. Gosar's video last week was met with swift condemnation from congressional Democrats. He removed the post after receiving a call from McCarthy, who told him the cartoon was inappropriate, and said in a statement he does not \"espouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress or Mr. Biden.\" Gosar also appeared behind closed doors before his fellow House Republicans on Tuesday, Cole said, and insisted to his colleagues that the video was intended to symbolize the policies he opposes and was not meant for it to be an endorsement of violence. The Arizona Republican, however,\u00a0downplayed the controversy in a tweet.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced Thursday she won't seek a second term, an election-year surprise that marks a sharp turnabout for the city's second Black mayor who months ago was among those President Biden considered as a possible running mate. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called the decision \"stunning.\" An emotional Bottoms held a press conference on Friday explaining her decision. She said that she had written two potential letters to the people of Atlanta \u2014 one announcing that she would remain in the mayoral race, and one announcing that she would would not run for reelection. Bottoms released the open letter announcing her decision to withdraw on Thursday evening. \"This has been my highest honor to serve as mayor of this city,\" she said. \"It is abundantly clear to me that it is time to pass the baton on to someone else.\" Bottoms said that her decision was not due to family reasons, but in large part because of the upheaval during her term. \"The last three years have not been at all what I would've scripted for our city,\" Bottoms said. She referenced a massive cyber attack, recent racial justice problems and \"a madman in the White House,\" meaning former President Trump. \"I don't know what's next for me personally and for our family. But what I do know is that this is a decision made from a position of strength, not weakness,\" Bottoms said. She noted that she had raised a significant amount of money, and said that she would win the race if it was held today. Bottoms added that she had made her decision \"after thoughtful prayer and consideration.\" Bottoms said she would offer to refund the donations to her mayoral campaign. She also said that she would try to \"leave the city better than I left it,\" and would work through the end of her term to \"continue to do every single thing in our power to make this city safer.\" Bottoms said that she was making her announcement now to give candidates the opportunity and time to \"fundraise and organize a campaign.\" She added that she is not making an endorsement but \"has a pretty good idea who it should not be.\" Bottoms challenged the idea that she was bowing to political pressure by deciding not to run for reelection. \"I may bend, but I will never break,\" she said. Bottoms, 51, disclosed her decision publicly in the lengthy open letter and accompanying video Thursday night after having told family and a close circle of associates and supporters. The tweeted letter began with the words, \"Dear Atlanta.\" \"It is with deep emotions that I hold my head high and choose not to seek another term as mayor,\" Bottoms wrote, saying she'd prayed about the decision with her husband, Derek, an executive at the Home Depot Inc. https://t.co/4yHFpvnVre pic.twitter.com/b7IJEIyojq She scheduled a news conference for Friday morning.  Bottoms, who narrowly won a runoff election four years ago, pushed backed against any questions about whether she could have secured a second victory later this year. She pointed to a March reelection fundraiser with Mr. Biden and said polls showed her in a strong position.  \"'Is she afraid of the competition?' NEVER,\" Bottoms wrote. The Journal-Constitution noted that the fundraiser was the first headlined by the president since he took office and drew over $500,000, which it called \"a sign of her strong financial standing and national political connections.\" The newspaper said her move \"creates a wide-open mayor's race this year, and is likely to open the door for a slew of new candidates.\"  City Council President Felicia Moore has already announced her mayoral bid. CBS Atlanta affiliate WGCL-TV spoke with political analyst Rashad Richey, who said crime rates in the city could have led to Bottoms' decision. He said to expect the flood gates to open for potential candidates, including City Council members Antonio Brown, Amir R. Farokhi and Andre Dickens.\u00a0  Bottoms' tenure has been a mix of rough-and-tumble City Hall politics and an ever-brightening national spotlight for her.  She was among Mr. Biden's earliest endorsers, taking a risk early in a crowded Democratic primary campaign. She was later rewarded as one of the women he considered to be his running mate, though he eventually chose another Black woman, Kamala Harris, then a California senator who is now the first woman to hold the national office.  Bottoms nonetheless watched her profile rise during the coronavirus pandemic and with the renewed attention on policing in the United States after George Floyd's killing by a white Minneapolis officer last spring.  She drew plaudits for a nationally televised news conference in which she chided protesters to \"go home\" while noting her own experiences as a mother of Black sons to empathize with citizens distraught over police violence. She pledged to review Atlanta's police procedures in the wake of Floyd's killing.  Yet Bottoms met criticism herself just weeks later when an Atlanta police officer shot and killed Rayshard Brooks. The officer, Garrett Rolfe, was fired last June, a day after he shot the Black man in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant. Rolfe was later charged with murder.   The Atlanta Civil Service Board on Wednesday reversed the firing, finding that the city didn't follow its own procedures and failed to grant Rolfe due process. Bottoms said then that Rolfe would remain on administrative leave while criminal charges against him are resolved.  The mayor didn't mention Floyd or Brooks in her announcement letter, focusing instead on having giving the city's police and firefighters raises and alluding to a \"social justice movement (that) took over our streets \u2026.and we persisted.\"  Bottoms came to the mayor's office as an ally of her predecessor, Kasim Reed, whose endorsement proved critical in her campaign. But she sought to establish her own identity, in no small part because of a long-running FBI investigation of City Hall contracts and finances during Reed's tenure.  The \"far-reaching and ever-growing\" investigation, she said Thursday, \"consumed City Hall, often leaving employees paralyzed, and fearful of making the smallest of mistakes, lest they too be investigated, or castrated on the evening news.\"  Bottoms has never been implicated.  Early in her term, Bottoms eliminated cash bail in Atlanta and ended the city jail's relationship with federal immigration enforcement agencies, joining big-city mayors around the country in criticizing then-President Trump's hardline immigration policies. Her administration navigated a cyberattack on the city's computer systems early in her tenure.  She helped renegotiate the long-term redevelopment of \"The Gulch,\" part of the city's old railroad footprint downtown. But the city didn't score the biggest potential prize for the location: the second Amazon headquarters that instead is being built in northern Virginia, outside Washington, D.C.  An Atlanta native and graduate of Florida A&M University, a prominent historically Black college, Bottoms is just the second Black woman to lead the city. She joined Shirley Franklin, who served two terms from 2002-2010. Bottoms noted her family's deep ties to the city and surrounding region whose history traces Black America's arc from slavery and Jim Crow segregation to the ongoing legacy of institutional racism.  \"My ancestors, direct descendants of the once enslaved, traveled by horse and buggy from the cotton fields of east Georgia in search of a better life for themselves and their children in Atlanta,\" she wrote. \"I have carried their belief for a better tomorrow in my heart, their earnest work ethic in my being, and their hopes for generations not yet born on my mind, each day that I have been privileged to serve as the 60th Mayor of Atlanta.\"",

            "article_content": "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen airing Sunday, November 14, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Madam Secretary, thank you so much for having us and for making time.\u00a0 TREASURY SECRETARY JANET YELLEN: Well, thank you for the invitation.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You have said that inflation is likely to be with us until the second half of next year. Are you confident that prices for the average American will be down by the time we head into next November and Election Day?\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, it really depends on the pandemic. The pandemic has been calling the shots for the economy and for inflation. And if we want to get inflation down, I think continuing to make progress against the pandemic is the most important thing we can do. I think it's- it's- it's important to realize that the cause of this inflation is the pandemic. It shut- all but shut down our economy. It boosted unemployment to almost 15% and we've been opening up in fits and starts. And the pandemic is really responsible, in its impact for the inflation that we're seeing. It led to a dramatic increase in demand for- for products. Households were unable to spend on services -- going out to eat and traveling. They shifted as they stayed at home, worked more from home. They shifted their spending on to goods that led to a surge in the demand for products. And although the supply of products has increased in the United States and globally, not as much as demand. You know, we- President Biden's top priority after he was elected was, of course, vaccinations, trying to defeat the pandemic and get people back to work. We passed the American Rescue Plan, and when you think about what would have happened without that, I mean, what a success that unemployment has declined from almost 15% to under 5% now. Americans feel confident about the job market. Quits have increased up to record numbers, which is a sign that people are getting outside offers. They're seeing wage increases. That is something that didn't have to happen, and it really reflects the support that we gave to Americans to keep up their spending and make it through the pandemic. But with supply disruptions and this huge shift in- in- in demand toward products, we are seeing some broad-based price increases. We have shortages of semiconductors; that's really caused new and used car prices to rise, car production to decline--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty-six percent year over year for used cars, gasoline up 50%, eggs 12%, milk 6%, coffee 6%. So when-- \u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: We are seeing some big increases in prices.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: When does it get better? When do those spikes abate? \u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: You know, when the economy recovers enough from COVID, the demand patterns, people go back to eating out, traveling more, spending more on services, and the demand for products, for goods begins to go back to normal. And also, labor supply has been impacted by the pandemic. Labor force participation is down, it hasn't recovered. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhmm.\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Probably many people remain concerned about the health consequences of working. Child care arrangements may be disrupted. But with- when labor supply normalizes and the pattern of demand normalizes, I- and I would expect that if we're successful with the pandemic to be sometime in the second half of next year, I would expect prices to go back to normal.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there could be a political cost to this, which is why I ask about November, of course.\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Yes. Well, there's an economic cost and Americans feel that. And when gas rises - the average is now over $3 a gallon, in some places, quite a bit higher - Americans notice it and it- it makes- it makes a difference. But I just think it's important to put inflation in context of an economy that is improving a lot from what we had right after the pandemic and is making progress.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of near-term relief, China's leaders have repeatedly asked for the Trump era tariffs to be lifted. If the Biden administration did that, would it make things cheaper?\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: It would make some difference. Tariffs do tend to raise domestic prices. We put those tariffs in place; President Trump and his administration did as a retaliation for unfair trade practices--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Should they stay in place?\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: You know, we have said- the U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai has said that we are revisiting the phase one trade deal and recognizing requests to reduce tariffs in some areas. So that's certainly something that's under consideration.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Also on China, before we leave that space, there are fears about toxic debt in China and a potential Lehman Brothers moment. How concerned are you about the risk to the rest of the world by what's going on inside of China right now? Are you confident China can control it?\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Look, it's something that's important that we're monitoring closely. China has a real estate- a real estate sector with firms that are overleveraged, and it's something that China is trying to deal with. Real estate is an important sector of the Chinese economy. It accounts for about 30% of demand. And a slowdown in China, of course, would have global consequences. China's economy is large, and if China's economy were to slow down more than expected, it certainly could have consequences for many countries that are linked to China through trade.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you believe they can manage the risk right now?\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: They're certainly trying to do that, and it's something we're watching closely.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: When we talk about the supply part of the challenge you're dealing with here in the United States, is it the private sector's job to unclog the supply chain? Or is there more that you can be doing within the administration right now?\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, short run, we are looking for everything that we can possibly do to help unclog supply chains. The supply chains are by- are by and large private. But nevertheless, sometimes help in coordinating actions is useful and necessary to unclog supply chains. We have been talking with the operators of ports in Los Angeles, in Long Beach, in Savannah, trying to understand why there is such backlog of ships waiting to offload their goods in Long Beach, in Los Angeles. We've talked with big retailers who often have been leaving containers at the ports rather than moving them quickly. As the president- as president, Biden announced, those ports have agreed to stay open 24/7. And we've talked to the retailers about trying to move their containers out to create more room. We have similar discussions taking place in Savannah. So there are things that we can do to bring private- private parties together to better coordinate and to work through how we can relieve some of these supply bottlenecks. And we're certainly doing that. We're leaving no stone unturned, even though this- this is mainly private. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Of course, it's so important at this time of year. But when you were talking earlier about a much brighter jobs picture, there are record level of job openings right now. \u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: That's right. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet there's a worker shortage at the same time. What is going on with the supply and demand mismatch here?\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, you know, first of all, the programs that were put in place, the American Rescue Plan and the CARES Act and other programs, really were intended to support households and families to get through this so that they didn't take a huge hit to their income. So financially, Americans say they feel good about their finances, and that's not an accident. And they're spending a lot, so demand is strong in spite of the fact that the pandemic has had a big impact on our economy. And that's good, because if you remember after the 2008 financial crisis, unemployment spiked. It took a really long time to go down--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: -A decade.-- \u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: --and household finances were decimated. That hasn't occurred this time, so that's the good piece. But spending is strong and the supply of workers is not back up to normal. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. \u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: People haven't- labor force- unemployment is low and labor force participation is quite depressed relative to pre-pandemic levels. I think part of it reflects concerns about COVID and exposure to COVID, especially in jobs that involve public facing activities. And I- partly, you know, the fact that childcare workers, educators are in short supply creates childcare problems. That also tends to suppress labor supply. So as I say, when we really get control of the pandemic, I think labor supply will go back to normal. But yes, we have a tight labor market, not a loose labor market. The unemployment rate is down to 4.6 percent. As I say, labor supply is abnormally low, I believe, because of the pandemic.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But there is a skilled worker shortage in many places. I mean, are we at a place where we need to increase immigration in order to meet this challenge?\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, you know, there are a lot of issues involved in immigration, but that- I believe that is one reason that we do face supply shortages- shortages of certain kinds of workers. I mean, we've long had a problem of more jobs available for skilled workers and declining opportunities for less skilled workers. So focusing on education and training was important and continues to be. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: What does the economic recovery look like without paid leave?\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, you know, I think we will still have an economic recovery that will be strong and, you know, support ongoing growth. But labor force participation for- particularly for women has been a problem in the United States now for some time. Once upon a time, female labor force participation in the United States was higher than almost any developed country. And now that is absolutely not the case. And when you compare it to the United States with other developed countries, a big difference that stands out is a lack of support for- for people working--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. \u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: --and particularly for women. Now, I'm very hopeful and fully expect the Build Back Better package to become law,--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But it was taken out of the framework-\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: --Yes, so-\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's unlikely to have full support in the Senate.\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Paid- paid leave- it's important, it's an important support for people to be able to work. But there's a great deal of support in that package for child care. It does a lot to make child care more affordable so that for most families, child care expense would be reduced from, I think, about 13% now down to no more than 7% of their income.--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So I-\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: --There would be two additional years of early childhood education that would be universal and a child tax credit that would help families be able to afford to take good care of their children and also participate in the workforce. So I think that package will help boost labor force participation, particularly that of women. Paid leave is another component that would add to that, but there's a lot in that package that will make a difference.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think what's in there is sufficient because back in February, you told me women's participation is down because they don't have access universally to paid family and medical leave and child care. Is it essential to full economic recovery?\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, we- we're supportive, President Biden and I, of paid leave, and it's something that we will try to legislate in the future. It looks like it won't be a component of this package, but as I say, there's quite a lot in the package that will be supportive of labor force participation. There's money in this package also to improve home health care for elderly citizens who have health issues. And for those who are disabled. And again, that's a support that will make it easier for people to- to work and care for family members at the same time.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm told we are out of time, but I want to quickly ask you -- the president's expected to make his selection for the Fed chair. Do you believe Jerome Powell should be renominated? How important is continuity? \u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: I am going to leave it to the president to make a decision. I've said that I think Chair Powell has done a very good job of running the Fed, of addressing the issues, particularly that arose when the pandemic struck. But what's important is that President Biden choose someone who's experienced and credible and there are a range of candidates.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Madam Secretary, for your time. There's much more we could talk about.\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Of course. Absolutely. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We thank you for having us here.\u00a0 SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, thanks very much for the invitation. Happy to have you.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The first 100 days is a somewhat arbitrary, if traditional milestone in a presidency, but it's one President Biden has embraced and even incorporated into his own goal-setting.\u00a0 Mr. Biden took office under difficult circumstances, during a deadly pandemic and as millions of Americans still harbored doubts that he had won the election. He made a number of promises centered on restoring normalcy to American life and rolling back actions taken by his predecessor, including a realignment of U.S. foreign policy priorities. He has kept some promises, such as reentering the Paris climate agreement, broken others, and made some progress but not yet accomplished all of his early goals. Here's a status check\u00a0on the key promises he made. Establish \"police oversight board\" in the first 100 days: Not kept\u00a0 As a candidate, Mr. Biden pledged in the days after George Floyd's death to form a national police oversight board in his first 100 days in office, if elected.\u00a0 But the White House announced earlier this month it would not create the oversight board. After talking with civil rights groups, the White House said it had concluded the most effective way to address the issues at hand would be to pass the proposed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act into law. The police reform bill is currently being discussed by Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill.\u00a0 Increase Trump-era refugee cap: Broken (so far)\u00a0 Mr. Biden pledged to do away with Mr. Trump's record low refugee cap of 15,000 a year. In February, he promised to raise the cap to 62,500, as a kind of down payment on his intent to resettle up to 125,000 refugees in fiscal year 2022.\u00a0 But earlier this month, he broke that promise, keeping the refugee cap at 15,000 for now. Facing a backlash, his administration said it would increase that refugee cap in May. But the president has been widely criticized, by progressives and conservative faith-centered groups alike, for failing to increase the cap as promised. Without this pressure, it's not clear whether the administration would have increased the cap this fiscal year.\u00a0 Send immigration bill to Congress to \"modernize our immigration system and give nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants a roadmap to citizenship\": Kept promise; legislation stalled Mr. Biden sent an immigration proposal to Congress on his first day in office, but the tenets of the legislation have hit legislative hurdles, compounded by his administration's struggle to process the\u00a0 thousands of migrants and unaccompanied children arriving every week.\u00a0 Read more\u00a0about the legislative push from within Mr. Biden's own party.\u00a0 Repeal Trump-era tax cuts: He's working on it\u00a0 As a candidate, Mr. Biden said he'd fight for the repeal of the 2017 Republican tax cuts, a move that requires Congress. He's pushing for a hike in the corporate tax rate and taxes on Americans making more than $400,000. But boosting the corporate tax rate from its current rate of 21% to 28% is facing resistance from key Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who has already said he wouldn't support a corporate tax rate that high.\u00a0 Reenter Paris climate accord: Kept\u00a0 Ahead of the election, Mr. Biden promised to re-enter the Paris climate accord, the 2016 agreement that former President Trump formally withdrew from last year.\u00a0 On his first day in office, Mr. Biden stated his acceptance of the agreement \"and every article and clause thereof on behalf of the United States of America.\" On February 19, the U.S. formally re-entered the agreement.\u00a0 Convene world climate summit: Kept As a candidate, Mr. Biden promised to organize a \"climate summit\" to encourage world leaders to tackle climate change more aggressively, specifically addressing global shipping and aviation emissions. Last week, Mr. Biden and Harris hosted the Leaders Summit on Climate, albeit remotely because of COVID-19, with dozens of world leaders participating. The U.S.pledged to cut emissions levels at least by half by 2030 and other industrialized nations also made commitments: Canada pledged a 40-45% cut by 2030 and Japan doubled its goal. Other major emitters, like China, did not offer new goals.\u00a0 Read more here on the other takeaways from the summit. \u00a0 Give 100 million COVID-19 shots in the first 100 days: Kept President Biden's original goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days was easily exceeded \u2014 200 million were administered by last week. The president upped his goal from 100 million to 200 million when it became clear he would easily meet the first target. The U.S. was already giving roughly 1 million shots a day when Mr. Biden took office. Use executive action to address greenhouse gas emissions: Kept but will require more work President Biden signed multiple executive actions related to climate change in his first 100 days in office.\u00a0 He revoked an earlier executive order issued by then-president Trump weakening the government's commitment to cutting greenhouse gases.\u00a0 He also announced a new target for the U.S. to reach a 50% to 52% reduction from 2005 levels in net greenhouse gas pollution by 2030, only nine years away. He made this announcement during the Leaders Summit on Climate he hosted last week.\u00a0 Reopen majority of K-8 schools nationwide by day 100: Kept School decisions are mostly made at the local level, but the Biden administration publicly pressed for a simple majority of K-8 schools to be back in the classroom in some form by the president's 100th day in office. Even though outside analysis from Burbio indicated a majority of students were already back in the classroom on their first day in office, the White House did not update this goal. In early March, the president pushed for states to prioritize vaccinating teachers and by April around 80% of educators were vaccinated or had an appointment scheduled, according to Education Department data.\u00a0 There are still significant pockets of students \u2014 about 6% nationwide \u2014 who are only learning virtually, according to data from Burbio. About 30% of students nationwide are learning in a hybrid system with the remaining approximately 65% of students back in the classroom full time.\u00a0 Repeal transgender military ban enacted by President Trump: Kept Mr. Biden repealed the Trump-era ban on transgender service in the military, which impacted approximately more than 15,000 people, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin returned to guidance instituted during the Obama administration. The Pentagon in April announced new policies that, in part, will provide medical treatment during gender transition to service members' self-identified gender.\u00a0 On his first day in office, the president also issued an executive order aimed at combating discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. This was another campaign pledge kept \u2014 restoring Obama-era guidance for transgender students in schools.\u00a0 More gun control: In progress, but little done concretely\u00a0 Mr. Biden regularly promised to address \"loopholes\" in gun purchase checks, but much of that work will require legislation. After the mass shooting in Boulder, Colorado, in March, he called on Congress to pass legislation to close these loopholes. In early April, he signed targeted executive actions to address \"ghost guns\" and advocated for the Justice Department to outline \"red flag\" models that would temporarily stop people in mental anguish from possessing weapons.\u00a0 Mr. Biden also asked the Justice Department to issue a rule on stabilizing braces that attach to a pistol and add enough stability to, in essence, transform it into a short-barreled rifle subject to regulation by federal law. The alleged shooter in the March supermarket shooting in Boulder appears to have used a pistol with a brace. \u00a0 But one big promise on guns remains distant: the president wants to change the law providing liability protections to gun manufacturers if one of their guns is used in a crime.

She also said that, as lieutenant governor, she will push for the creation of a Black Virginians Advisory Cabinet for the governor and for a \"once-in-a-generation investment\" in Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\u00a0 Sears campaigned alongside Glenn Youngkin, the Republican who was elected to the governor's seat on Tuesday in a closely-watched battle against Democrat Terry McAuliffe.\u00a0 \"It's a historic night, yes it is,\" Sears said. \"But I didn't run to make history, I just wanted to leave it better than I found it.

            "article_content": "A national organization dedicated to Asian and Pacific Islander Americans is expanding its scope to help craft legislation and policies, and become the first organization of its kind to do federal lobbying. AAPI Progressive Action, an advocacy nonprofit and part of the AAPI Victory Fund super PAC, is rebranding to become \"AAPI Victory Alliance.\" The group is looking to build off of the boosted AAPI turnout in the 2020 elections, and add more nuance from an Asian American perspective on the federal and state legislative process. The organization will initially be focused on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the community and combating acts of hate toward Asian Americans. It will also form the first-ever think tank dedicated to issues related to Asian Americans. The community has seen a spike in hate incidents throughout the pandemic, with nearly 3,800 reported in 2020 according to a report by Stop AAPI Hate. More recently, eight people, including six Asian women, were killed in a series of shootings in Atlanta in mid-March. Executive director Varun Nikore said the group had already been planning this year to do more lobbying, but the recent attacks on Asian Americans sped up the timeline.\u00a0 The organization says it has already reached out to lawmakers and the White House. AAPI Progressive Action was part of a successful push in March to reinstate the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. They say they're currently talking through proposals on the initiative's mission and structure. Nikore added that there's more openness with the Democratic White House and Congress on working on these issues, compared to the previous administration. During his first prime time address of his presidency, President Biden addressed the trend of attacks against Asian Americans.\u00a0 \"At this very moment, so many of them, our fellow Americans, they're on the frontlines of this pandemic, trying to save lives, and still, they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It's wrong, it's un-American, and it must stop,\" Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden has been criticized by Asian American groups and lawmakers for the lack of representation in his cabinet, though the White House has pledged to add a senior level Asian American and Pacific Islander liaison.\u00a0 \"The last four years frankly, we were just playing defense. Trying to beat back on all of Trump's onerous policies and regulations. Now we feel like we can go on the offense, we can work with the White House, state legislatures, state governments,\" he said. \"Now, we are flexing our political muscle.\" One legislative push is to make changes to how the Justice Department and local governments deal with hate crimes. The group is backing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which requires a designated Justice Department employee to facilitate the review of hate crimes related to the pandemic.\u00a0 The group will also push for and work with other groups representing communities of color on broad issues that impact the community, such as immigration, healthcare and voting rights.\u00a0 In total, AAPI Victory Alliance is looking at pushing 11 pieces of legislation to start, with potential for digital and multi-language ads down the road.\u00a0 The Asian American and Pacific Islander electorate set record numbers in 2020 and was crucial for Democrat wins in the Georgia Senate runoffs, according to Tom Bonier, CEO of Democratic voting file firm TargetSmart. He said Asian American and Pacific Islander turnout increased by 50% in 2020 compared to 2016, and close to 40,000 more Asian American voters cast a ballot in the Georgia Senate runoffs compared to the 2016 presidential election. Of the Asian Americans who voted in 2020, 49.4% of them didn't vote in 2016 and 23% of them had never voted before. Bonier said the key question is whether these voters come back, and a potential answer lies in addressing issues relating to Asian Americans \u00a0 \"Clearly, everyone votes in an election with some level of expectations. Perhaps especially so for the AAPI community in terms of the racism and violence that they've been subject to. There will be an expectation to see some results in addressing these issues,\" he said. \"That will impact whether or not we see this turnout hold up.\" One challenge advocates have in analyzing data related to Asian Americans and making policy, is the wide net cast for categorizing the community. There are gaps between different nationalities on education level and income, which Nikore said feed into a \"model minority myth that all AAPIs are doing well.\" For example, 54.6% of Chinese Americans have a bachelor's degree while 29.6% of Vietnamese Americans have one, according to AAPI Data. About 7.2% of Indian Americans are in poverty, compared to 30.1% of Burmese Americans. \"Disaggregating\" this data to be more targeted and based on subsets like nationality and age is also a focus for AAPI Victory Alliance. AAPI voters also showed they're not a monolithic voting block. AAPI voters in Georgia helped drive the wins of Democrat Senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock and Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux, while Vietnamese American voters in Orange County, California elected Republican Korean-American Congresswomen Young Kim and Michelle Steel. The Victory Alliance said it will look to back \"progressive\" AAPI candidates up and down the ballot. Nikore, who is also president of the organization's campaign operation with the AAPI Victory Fund, said there's been an influx in small dollar donations in recent weeks.\u00a0 \"The White House is listening. People are listening. The community is expecting more from us. They're saying, 'You need to raise your game.' And we are up to that challenge,\" he said.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "Congressional Democrats are pursuing an ambitious legislative agenda supported by President Biden, but many of the bills that pass in the House will be stalled in the Senate \u2014 thanks to a rule that requires just about any legislation to attract 60 votes before it can be passed. Frustrated progressives are pushing the Senate to eliminate the legislative filibuster, which would allow bills to pass with a simple majority \u2014 and without any Republican votes. In recent weeks, the House has passed H.R. 1, a wide-ranging elections and government reform bill, and the Equality Act, which enshrines legal protections for LGBTQ Americans. This week, it will vote on reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, eliminating the deadline to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, and on two immigration measures \u2014 one aimed at helping undocumented immigrants who came into the country as children, and another that would give relief to agricultural workers.\u00a0 The House will also soon consider a bill which restores provisions of the Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court, a priority for Democrats. Republican state legislatures across the country have sought to restrict voting rights after the expansion of absentee voting during the pandemic increased voter turnout in 2020. But most, if not all, of these measures, are unlikely to garner support from 10 Republicans. Democrats hold the barest majority in the Senate, a 50-50 split and Vice President Kamala Harris to cast any tie-breaking vote. There are some limited workarounds for avoiding the 60-vote threshold, including the budget reconciliation process, which was recently used to pass the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan with a simple majority. All Republicans present voted against the bill, which doesn't bode well for future legislation that doesn't rely on reconciliation. Democrats could vote to eliminate the filibuster with a simple majority vote. But given the narrowness of their advantage over Republicans, they could not afford to lose any Democratic votes, and at least two say they're opposed to ending the filibuster, Senators Kyrsten Sinema, of Arizona, and Joe Manchin, of West Virginia, to eliminating it. Manchin told reporters on Tuesday that the filibuster ensures \"the minority has input,\" and implied that eliminating it now could harm Democrats in the long-term when they lose power, saying that \"what goes around here comes around here.\" \"Everybody's talking, there's so many different ideas out there. They're all talking. And that's it, there's nothing wrong with it that's healthy when you want to talk about everything. But the bottom line is, you can't get rid of the filibuster,\" Manchin said, referring to potential solutions considered by Democrats to at least make filibustering a bill more painful. \"You cannot get rid of the filibuster unless your intention is to destroy the Senate.\" Mr. Biden indicated that he was in favor of reforming the filibuster in an interview with ABC News on Tuesday. He endorsed a return to the talking filibuster, in which a senator has to stay on the floor and continue talking to hold up legislation. However, implementing the talking filibuster would not lower the 60-vote threshold for advancing a bill, but just make the process more arduous for the Republican Party. Senator Dick Durbin, the Democratic whip, told reporters on Wednesday that Mr. Biden \"knows how to choose his words carefully on this subject.\" \"I think he's acknowledging the obvious \u2014 that the filibuster has really shackled the Senate and made it far less productive. If it weren't for reconciliation, we would have little to show for this session other than nominations,\" Durbin said. He added that Democrats did not currently have the votes to eliminate the filibuster, but \"this is a process.\" \"There are some who are skeptical of any change in the rules. We have to demonstrate to them how the rules can be used and abused before we go any further,\" Durbin said. Other Democrats have called for a carve-out to filibuster rules specifically for voting rights bills. \"If Manchin and Sinema enjoy being in the majority, they had better figure out a way to get around the filibuster when it comes to voting and civil rights,\" House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn told the Guardian in an interview earlier this month. \"I'm not going to say that you must get rid of the filibuster. I would say you would do well to develop a Manchin-Sinema rule on getting around the filibuster as it relates to race and civil rights.\" However, Manchin indicated on Wednesday that he would be unwilling to create an exception for voting rights and government reform legislation. \"No. No. No. That's like being a little bit pregnant, maybe,\" Manchin said, meaning that it is impossible to only partially change the filibuster. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell warned Democrats that eliminating the filibuster would eventually backfire on them. Once they retake the Senate and the White House, he said, Republicans would then pass their own priorities with a simple majority, like defunding Planned Parenthood and sanctuary cities. And he threatened to invoke procedural rules to slow down the legislative process: he could require 51 senators to be present for all business; or hold roll call votes on measures that typically pass by unanimous consent. McConnell noted that a single senator could prevent the Senate from convening before noon, or force every bill to be read aloud before votes. \"This chaos would not open up an express lane to liberal change,\" McConnell said Tuesday. \"It would not open up an express lane for the Biden presidency to speed into the history books. The Senate would be more like a 100-car pileup \u2014 nothing moving.\" But Durbin shrugged off McConnell's threats of gumming up the works of the Senate, arguing to reporters on Tuesday that McConnell had already shown he could do so when he was majority leader. \"He has already done that. He's proven he can do it and they'll do it again, I assume. So that's a threat that, yes, we've seen it, we know you can do it,\" Durbin said. He had previously opposed eliminating the filibuster, but said that he had changed his mind after seeing how McConnell wielded the filibuster. \"Senator McConnell taught me that I was wrong. He managed to use and misuse the filibuster so many times that it now has stopped the Senate mid-track,\" Durbin said, arguing that McConnell had used the filibuster to block several Democratic amendments to legislation. Meanwhile, the progressive advocacy group Stand Up America announced on Tuesday that it would launch a nationwide campaign to demand that senators support the elections reform bill passed in the House and pass it by eliminating the filibuster. \"Our democracy is under assault, and we cannot allow a Jim Crow relic like the filibuster to block this transformational bill,\" said Sean Eldridge, founder and president of Stand Up America.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Judge Merrick Garland, President Biden's nominee for attorney general, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee for the first day of his confirmation hearing on Monday, vowing to restore the Justice Department's independence and pursue prosecutions of those who participated in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. \"It is a fitting time to reaffirm that the role of the attorney general is to serve the rule of law and to ensure equal justice under the law,\" Garland said in his opening statement. \"If I am confirmed as attorney general, it will be the culmination of a career I have dedicated to ensuring that the laws of our country are fairly and faithfully enforced, and that the rights of all Americans are protected.\" A judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Garland made his debut before senators as the Justice Department emerges from a period during which it was thrust into the center of politically charged investigations involving former President Donald Trump's allies and dogged by accusations of politicization.\u00a0 Garland appears poised to be confirmed by a wide bipartisan margin, as senators on both sides of the aisle praised his record of public service and commitment to the rule of law. Emphasizing his commitment to maintaining the independence of the Justice Department and shielding it from political pressures, primarily from the White House, Garland pledged to \"fend off any effort by anyone to make prosecutions or investigations partisan or political in any way.\" \"I am not the president's lawyer,\" he said. \"I am the United States' lawyer.\" In an exchange with Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, Garland grew emotional discussing his motivation for accepting the nomination for attorney general as he reflected on the experiences of his grandparents who fled anti-Semitism and persecution in the early 1900s for the U.S. \"This country took us in, protected us,\" he said, becoming choked up. \"I feel an obligation to the country to pay back. This is the highest, best use of my own set of skills to pay back.\" If confirmed, Garland will take the helm of the Justice Department as it pursues investigations into and prosecutions of rioters who breached the U.S. Capitol in the violent insurrection January 6.\u00a0 The judge told lawmakers that \"battling extremist attacks on our democratic institutions\" remains central to the Justice Department's mission. He condemned the deadly assault on the Capitol, calling it a \"heinous attack that sought to disrupt a cornerstone of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power into a newly elected government.\" \"I don't believe this is necessarily a one-off,\" Garland said about the attack. Garland would also assume the post of attorney general as the department continues to oversee several politically sensitive probes, including one involving Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden's son whose \"tax affairs\" are under scrutiny, as well as the ongoing examination from special counsel John Durham into the origins of the FBI's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Garland told senators he has not discussed Hunter Biden's case with the president and reiterated Mr. Biden's public commitment to leave decisions about investigations and prosecutions to the Justice Department. \"That was the reason that I was willing to take on this job,\" he said. As attorney general, Garland committed the Justice Department to fully participating in congressional investigations into Mr. Trump's \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy, which led to separations of migrant families apprehended at the border. The department's inspector general found former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his aides were the \"driving force\" in the prior administration's policy. \"I think that the policy was shameful,\" Garland said. \"I can't imagine anything worse than tearing parents from their children, and we will provide all the cooperation that we possibly can.\" Garland has received support for his nomination from a bevy of civil rights organizations and law enforcement groups. When pressed on whether he supports calls from progressives to strip police of their funding following the deaths of unarmed Black men and women at the hands of law enforcement, the judge said, \"President Biden has said he does not support defunding the police and nor do I.\" Instead, Garland said he believes more resources should be given to police departments to gain support of communities and ensure resources are available for mental health services. Garland's hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee comes five years after he was nominated to the Supreme Court by former President Barack Obama following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. But Republicans declined to take up Garland's nomination and he never received a confirmation hearing before the Judiciary panel, as GOP senators argued the vacancy arose too close to the 2016 presidential election. If the Senate approves Garland as the nation's top law enforcement officer, it would open up a seat on the powerful D.C. Circuit for Mr. Biden to fill. Garland, appointed to the court by former President Bill Clinton in 1997, served as its chief judge until February 2020. Garland is also no stranger to the Justice Department, having served as a federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., as well as deputy assistant attorney general for\u00a0 the criminal division, and as principal associate deputy attorney general. The Judiciary Committee will hear from outside witnesses Tuesday, the second day of the confirmation hearing. Committee Chairman Dick Durbin told reporters he expects the Senate to vote on Garland's nomination next week. Clare Hymes and Cassidy McDonald contributed reporting.",

            "article_content": "Budapest, Hungary\u00a0\u2014 Activists in Hungary erected a 30-foot-hig rainbow-colored heart opposite the country's neo-Gothic parliament on Thursday, vowing to wage a civil disobedience campaign against a new law that they say discriminates against LGBTQ people and that has raised questions about what values the European Union stands for. The law, which came into effect Thursday, prohibits the display of content depicting homosexuality or sex reassignment to minors \u2014 but critics say its goal is to marginalize and stigmatize the LGBTQ community as the country marches steadily to the right under Prime Minister Viktor Orban. The law has drawn intense opposition in Hungary and from the EU and has become a significant battleground in the fight over what the bloc represents. Orban and some other right-wing leaders of member states have been at the forefront of that fight, challenging the EU's traditional \"liberal consensus\" by refusing to accept migrants, cracking down on media plurality and limiting the independence of their judiciaries. At the Thursday demonstration, rights groups said the Hungarian law denies thousands of LGBTQ young people crucial information and support, and violates national and international human rights standards. \u00a0 \"We think that the only path we can pursue is civil disobedience, and we will not change anything about our activities,\" Luca Dudits, a spokesperson for Hatter Society, Hungary's largest LGBTQ advocacy group, told The Associated Press. \u00a0 One provision in the law bans organizations from holding educational programs on sexual orientation in schools unless they are approved by the government. But Dudits said Hatter Society will continue to provide teachers with training and educational materials, and offer their services to anyone regardless of age. \u00a0 Dudits added that the law \"stigmatizes LGBTQ people and actually puts LGBTQ youth more ... in danger of bullying and harassment in schools and in their families as well.\" Many European leaders have demanded the law's repeal, saying it violates the bloc's values. \u00a0 European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday that the law was \"a disgrace.\" In a resolution adopted Thursday, EU lawmakers condemned \"in the strongest possible terms\" the new legislation in Hungary and said it constitutes a clear breach of fundamental rights. \u00a0 They said the law is not a one-off case, but \"rather constitutes another intentional and premeditated example of the gradual dismantling of fundamental rights in Hungary.\" The parliamentarians urged the European Commission to take swift action against Hungary unless it changes tack. \u00a0 Speaking earlier in the day in Belgrade, Orban dismissed the EU criticisms, characterizing the controversy as a \"debate about who decides how we will raise our children.\" \"The European Parliament and the European Commission want that we let LGBTQ activists and organizations into the kindergartens and schools. Hungary does not want that,\" Orban said in a post on his Facebook page. \"Here Brussels bureaucrats have no business at all, no matter what they do we will not let LGBTQ activists among our children.\"\u00a0 The debate over the law reflects a larger one within the 27-member EU, where a handful of countries are led by populist leaders who have pressed ahead with laws and policies that many in the bloc feel are anti-democratic or violate its founding values. On the one hand, critics of those polices want the EU to take action to protect their vision of the bloc as a progressive institution; on the other, such action raises uncomfortable questions about how much power Brussels should have over member states' own parliaments. \u00a0 Orban's government \u2014 which next year faces elections expected to be the most competitive since his party returned to power in 2010 \u2014 is one of the faces of this rift. A champion of what he calls \"illiberal democracy\" and a conservative religious worldview, Orban has depicted his rejection of immigration as a fight to preserve Christian civilization and has taken increasing control over Hungary's higher education system in an effort to instill conservative values. Along with Poland, Hungary's closest EU ally, Orban has repeatedly challenged the bloc over issues like migration, corruption and the rule of law. Last year, the two countries held up passage of the EU's budget and COVID-19 economic recovery package over provisions that would allow the withholding of payments to countries that fail to uphold democratic standards. David Vig, director of Amnesty International Hungary which co-hosted Thursday's demonstration, called the recent legislation \"fundamentalist,\" and echoed the European Parliament's call for action against Hungary's government, including the possible freezing billions of dollars in funding to the nation. \u00a0 \"We expect EU institutions to act firmly and the European Commission to start an infringement procedure ... because this is in clear contradiction not just with EU values, but also with binding EU law and the commission's LGBTQ strategy,\" Vig said. \u00a0 But he said that must be done in way that \"does not affect the human rights of everyday Hungarians.\"",

            "article_content": "In the final debate before primary day, eight leading Democrats running for New York City mayor frequently devolved into bickering in a rapid-fire format on Wednesday in NBC's Studio 8H, the home of the iconic show \"Saturday Night Live.\" The debate was one of the last chances for candidates to make their closing arguments to voters before primary day on June 22. Tens of thousands of voters have already cast ballots during early voting or via absentee ballots. Former Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan, who has been toward the bottom of nearly every poll, tried to sum up the night when he said: \"New Yorkers didn't tune in tonight to hear us fight with each other.\" But the other candidates didn't seem to follow that advice, with punches and barbs being thrown most of the night. Andrew Yang, who was the front-runner early in the race, but has seen his stock fall, took a shot at Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, who is now leading polls, when asked why Yang secured an endorsement from the NYPD Captain's union, when Adams was a former captain in the department. \"The people you should ask about this are Eric's former colleagues in the police captain's union,\" Yang said. \"The people who worked with him for years, the people who know him best, they just endorsed me to be the next mayor of New York City.\" Adams said he never asked for the union's endorsement and they didn't like his record of fighting against \"abuse of stop and frisk\" and \"heavy-handed policing.\" Crime was once again a central focus at the debate, but candidates also drilled down on mental health, affordable housing, climate change and other critical issues facing America's largest city. Polling has indicated that crime and policing are the top issues for the city's likely Democratic primary voters. New York has seen a surge in gun violence in 2021, which has brought the issue to the forefront. While some major crimes are slightly down compared to last year, murders are up 13.5% and shootings are up 64%, according to NYPD statistics. Civil rights attorney Maya Wiley, who has emerged as the progressive favorite in the field, wants to cut $1 billion from the NYPD budget and shift that money into other city services that provide alternatives to policing. Wiley has also said that she would stop hiring in the next two police cadet classes, but stressed that her vision could help reduce crime in the more immediate future.\u00a0 \"I have been Black all my life and I know what it's like to fear crime and police violence,\" Wiley said. \"When we invest in trauma-informed care, when we stop the guns from getting fired in the first place, we are safe from both crime and police violence.\" While Wiley and other progressives have proposed reallocating some of the NYPD budget to other services, former Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia \u2014 who has emerged as a serious contender since she was endorsed by The New York Times \u2014 took aim at that idea during a question about the worst idea she's heard from her opponents. \"These are complicated times and several of my opponents are using hashtags, hashtag defund the police and I just don't think that's the right approach,\" Garcia said. Adams again defended his plan for a plainclothes police unit to address gun violence and to use a moderated version of stop and frisk. He said he doesn't want to \"return to anything,\" but rather show \"how to use tools correctly.\" \"We can't wait until we have 3-year-olds shot in Times Square. If we don't get gun violence under control it's going to stop our economic recovery,\" Adams said. All the candidates except for New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, former non-profit CEO Dianne Morales and Wiley said they wanted more police officers patrolling the city's subway system. In a section about undocumented immigrants, Wiley, Morales and Garcia spoke about ending the city's relationship with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Yang touted his cash relief program as something that would help undocumented New Yorkers, but Stringer sniped, \"Andrew's fake [universal basic income] program would only be about five dollars a day\" for a small subset of the city. \"That's a lot of money for someone who's right at that line between staying in their home and not being able to put food on their table,\" Yang responded.\u00a0 Mental health also was a key part of the debate as public safety concerns have gripped the city as it adjusts to post-pandemic reality. Yang promised to double the amount of psychiatric beds, saying \"there will be no recovery until we solve this.\" Yang's response drew fire from Stringer, who asked Yang to give a cost and called it \"not serious.\" During a question later in the debate on how to fix the city's \"functioning mental health system,\" Morales called for community health clinics and shared a personal story from her daughter, who Morales called a mental health \"survivor.\" Morales said she was sharing her daughter's story with her permission, and said the \"framing\" around mental health needs to be changed. Some of the candidates laid out specific plans to address homelessness and affordable housing in the city, while others were more vague. Adams pledged to retrofit hotels for single adults, while Donovan, who served as the Housing secretary in the Obama administration, said he wanted more supportive housing. Stringer criticized the \"incrementalism\" in building affordable housing in the de Blasio administration, and called for building 10,000 \"real low-income housing units\" per year. Early voting began June 12. As of Tuesday night, more than 64,000 people have voted early in-person. More than 50,000 absentee ballots have been returned. It's not yet clear how many of those votes are in the Democratic race. This election will be New York City's first citywide primary to use ranked-choice voting. The city is expected to report unofficial results for first-choice votes from early and election day voting on June 22. More results will be released starting the following week. It may take until mid-July to determine which candidate wins the Democratic mayoral primary because absentee ballots can arrive until June 29 and voters will have until July 9 to fix some issues with their mail ballots.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up a blockbuster dispute over a Mississippi ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, setting up a high-stakes showdown over the future of Roe v. Wade. The battle will be the first test of limits on abortion access to go before the Supreme Court's expanded 6-3 conservative majority and could pave the way for more restrictions, as the dispute takes aim at the landmark 1973 ruling in Roe, which established a woman's right to an abortion. Arguments will likely be heard in the fall, during the high court's next term, with a decision expected by summer 2022. The justices will specifically weigh whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional, according to an order issued Monday. The high court's abortion cases have established a woman has a right to an abortion before fetal viability, which generally occurs around 24 weeks into a pregnancy. The Supreme Court's rightward shift during former President Donald Trump's tenure left pro-abortion advocates concerned about the future of abortion access, as a growing number of Republican-led states have passed laws restricting the procedure, at times with the stated goal of overturning Roe.\u00a0 While the nation's highest court last year struck down a Louisiana abortion regulation that required doctors that perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, the Supreme Court's conservative majority has grown since then with the appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in October to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. At issue in the case before the justices is a Mississippi law enacted in 2018 that prohibits most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The state's only abortion clinic, Jackson Women's Health Organization, swiftly filed suit to challenge the law, and the federal district court struck down\u00a0the ban, finding it unconstitutional. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, citing Supreme Court's abortion precedent. Mississippi's attorney general urged the Supreme Court to hear its appeal, arguing in court filings the case presents it with an opportunity to reconcile its \"conflicting statements regarding the test to apply when analyzing the validity of a pre-viability law that protects women's health, the dignity of unborn children, and the integrity of the medical profession and society.\" \"[T]he viability rule was created outside the ordinary crucible of litigation, failed to take account of the state's accepted interest in maternal health and fetal pain, is increasingly out of step with other areas of the law, rejects science and common sense, and is shaky precedent at best,\" the state argued. \"The court should revisit it.\" But the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing Jackson Women's Health Organization, argued the court should reject Mississippi's argument, as it is \"based on a misunderstanding of the core principle of\" the Supreme Court's past decisions. \"Roe and Casey, and the Court's subsequent cases, are clear that, before viability, it is for the pregnant person, and not the state, to make the ultimate decision whether to continue a pregnancy,\" attorneys for the group told the Supreme Court. \"A pre-viability abortion ban unquestionably contravenes this fundamental tenet of the Court's abortion jurisprudence.\" Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said following the Supreme Court's decision to take the case that \"alarm bells are ringing loudly about the threat to reproductive rights\" and warned a ruling reversing Roe would lead numerous states to outlaw abortion outright. \"Already, abortion is nearly impossible to access for people in states like Mississippi, where lawmakers have been chipping away at the right to abortion for decades,\" she said. \"We will keep fighting to make sure that people do not lose this fundamental right to control their own bodies and futures.\" But the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion rights ground, applauded the Supreme Court for agreeing to hear Mississippi's appeal. \"This is a landmark opportunity for the Supreme Court to recognize the right of states to protect unborn children from the horrors of painful late-term abortions,\" Marjorie Dannenfelser, the group's president, said in a statement, adding that it's \"time for the Supreme Court to catch up to scientific reality and the resulting consensus of the American people as expressed in elections and policy.\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that President Biden is committed to codifying Roe regardless of how the Supreme Court rules in the case. \"Over the last four years, critical rights like the right to health care, the right to choose have been under withering and extreme attack, including through draconian state laws,\" she said. \"The president and the vice president are devoted to ensuring that every American has access to health care, including reproductive health care, regardless of their income, zip code, race, health insurance status or immigration status.\" The legal fight over Mississippi's law has been closely watched by those on both sides of the debate over abortion access, particularly as the Supreme Court's ideological shift to the right raised the stakes. Conservatives believe the high court is poised to chip away at or overturn Roe with its new 6-3 conservative majority, while pro-abortion advocates are sounding the alarm the right to an abortion is more at risk than it ever has been. The justices mulled whether to take the case for several months, listing it to be discussed at more than a dozen private conferences.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Former President Donald Trump has left office, but his political presence still looms large over the Republican Party as it seeks to regain majorities in Congress in 2022.\u00a0 Two controversial GOP politicians who have tied themselves closely to the former president announced their Senate campaigns in Missouri and Alabama on Monday evening, presenting a test for whether Trumpian politics can attract voters without Mr. Trump himself on the ballot. GOP Congressman Mo Brooks announced that he would join Alabama's primary to replace Senator Richard Shelby, who said in February that he would not seek another term. Brooks jumped into the race at an event on Monday with Stephen Miller, a former adviser to Mr. Trump. Miller is considered one of the primary architects of Mr. Trump's hardline immigration policies, and his endorsement of Brooks is meant to signal the congressman's ties to the former president. \"I am a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, not the GOP surrender caucus. And as President Trump can vouch, I don't cut and run. I stand strong when the going gets tough,\" Brooks said during his campaign launch event. Brooks recently came under fire for his comments at the January 6 rally that preceded a violent assault on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters, resulting in the deaths of five people. \"Today is the day that American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass,\" Brooks said at the rally not far from the White House, while wearing a hat that said \"Fire Pelosi.\" He also condemned \"weak-kneed Republicans\" and urged attendees to \"fight for America.\" Brooks has refused to apologize for his remarks, saying that he was not inciting violence. Meanwhile, former Missouri Governor Eric Greitens announced in an interview with Fox News on Monday that he would run for the Senate seat that will be vacated by GOP Senator Roy Blunt, who will retire at the end of his term. Greitens resigned in disgrace in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct and blackmail, and faced two criminal charges and an ethics investigation. But the charges have been dropped and the probe concluded, leaving Greitens to emerge from the ashes of his political career to attempt a comeback. In his interview with Fox News, Greitens said he had resigned only for the sake of his family. Greitens was facing a potential impeachment inquiry by the state legislature when he stepped down. \"I was honored to serve the people of Missouri as their governor,\" Greitens said, adding that he is running for Senate because \"the people of Missouri need a fighter in the United States Senate.\" Greitens has remained a staunch supporter of the former president. He said in a tweet on Monday that he was a \"fierce defender of President Trump\" and would \"continue Trump's America First policies\" if elected. Greitens has been a frequent guest on former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's podcast, and obtained an endorsement from former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Like Brooks, Greitens also amplified the false claim that Mr. Trump won the 2020 election. On January 6, he appeared on a conservative podcast expressing support for Mr. Trump's conspiracy theories about the results less than an hour after the police secured the Capitol, according to reporting by Media Matters for America. Mr. Trump has not yet waded into either race. Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of the former president, said he believed Mr. Trump should stay out of the Republican primaries in Missouri and Alabama. \"I think I'd just let it play out, if I were him,\" Graham said. It's also unclear whether Brooks and Greitens would necessarily be Mr. Trump's candidate of choice because of their previous support for him. Lynda Blanchard, Mr. Trump's former ambassador to Slovenia, has also entered the Republican primary in Alabama. Mr. Trump has been advised on the Missouri race by Senator Josh Hawley, who as state attorney general was one of the most high-profile Republicans to call on Greitens to step down in 2018. Hawley, who was elected to the Senate in 2018, is also a close ally of the former president. Hawley told reporters on Tuesday that he had spoken to Mr. Trump about the race. \"I think he probably won't be involved,\" Hawley said about whether he believed Mr. Trump would endorse Greitens in the primary.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia indicated Sunday he is open to reforming the filibuster to allow more opportunities for Democrats to pass legislation through the Senate along party lines and without relying on Republican support. In a series of interviews Sunday, Manchin, who wields significant power in the evenly divided Senate as a moderate willing to work across party lines, said he believes the filibuster should be made more \"painful\" to dissuade the minority from using it frequently.\u00a0 \"If you want to make it a little bit more painful, make him stand there and talk,\" Manchin said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"I'm willing to look at any way we can, but I'm not willing to take away the involvement of the minority.\" While the West Virginia senator said he remains opposed to abolishing the 60-vote threshold for ending debate on a motion, he floated the idea of a \"talking filibuster,\" in which a senator must remain on the floor speaking to hold up legislation. Manchin, too, did not rule out using the budget reconciliation process, a procedure used by the Senate to pass President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package with a simple-majority threshold, for future legislation when bipartisan negotiations fail to yield a deal, including the sweeping elections reform package approved by the House last week. \"I'm not going to go there until my Republican friends have the ability to have their say, also,\" he said. \"And I'm hoping they'll get involved to the point to where we have 10 of them that will work with 50 of us, or 15 of them that will work with 45 of us.\" Manchin said \"there's no need\" for Democrats to use reconciliation \"until the other process has failed.\" With the Senate evenly split 50-50, leaving Vice President Kamala Harris to cast tie-breaking votes, pressure among Democrats to eliminate the filibuster has been building to make it easier to implement Mr. Biden's legislative agenda. The rule requires 10 Republicans to cross the aisle to move forward with a bill, giving the minority party power to effectively kill major pieces of legislation. Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, have said they are against efforts to get rid of the filibuster, though a growing number of Democrats have said they are willing to do so. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Mr. Biden's \"preference is not to get rid of the filibuster\" and \"not to make changes to the filibuster rules,\" and said the president believes there are numerous opportunities to work on a bipartisan basis, including on immigration reform and infrastructure.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, chaos has turned to calm at the White House, but the challenges facing the newly elected President continue to grow. In the ten days since taking office, President Biden has issued a flood of executive actions dealing with COVID-19, immigration, Obamacare, climate change, overturning the travel ban, racial equity, transgender rights, the Keystone Pipeline, and abortion rights. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: The best way to describe them, to undo the damage Trump has done. MARGARET BRENNAN: There are new mandates requiring mask wearing when traveling, new efforts to bring order to vaccine distribution, and a third successful immunization is pending FDA approval. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We now have a national strategy to beat COVID-19. It's based on science not politics. It's based on truth, not denial. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Mister Biden's push to end the pandemic will likely be disrupted by mutating strains of the virus now spreading in the U.S. Another roadblock: He's having a tough time selling his nearly two-trillion-dollar package of economic aid to Congress. Even to some members of his own party. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: COVID relief has to pass. There's no if, ands, or buts. MARGARET BRENNAN: With new accusations and threats on top of increasing fears over the safety and security of members of Congress bipartisanship is in short supply on Capitol Hill. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The enemy is within the House of Representatives. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will anyone be willing to compromise? We'll talk with White House senior adviser and former Congressman Cedric Richmond. Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont's state is a success story when it comes to vaccinations. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez's city has reported dozens of cases of coronavirus variants. Plus, we'll take a closer look at the push to get schools to reopen for in-person learning. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We could see an entire cohort of kids with a lower lifetime earnings because they're deprived of another semester of school. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with Chicago Schools Superintendent Janice Jackson, former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, and look-- at-- going back to Wuhan, one year after the virus was discovered. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It's quiet in the nation's capital today, but that may be because of the snow falling outside. Whatever the case, we know it won't last. Washington is preparing for another impeachment trial. This time former President Trump has been charged with incitement of insurrection, based on his role in the January 6th attack on the Capitol. The former President has remained out of sight in Florida since leaving office, but last night we learned that he has parted ways with his top attorneys hired to represent him in next week's trial in the Senate. We've got a lot to get to today. And we begin with CBS News national correspondent Manny Bojorquez in Miami. (Begin VT) MANUEL BOJORQUEZ (CBS News National Correspondent/@BojorquezCBS): Starting Tuesday, not wearing a mask on most forms of public transportation will be considered a violation of federal law, under a sweeping public health order issued by the CDC. Efforts to stop the spread have taken on new urgency as three mutant strains have now appeared in at least thirty-one states. Even more worrying, the cases are being found in people with no travel history, a clear sign of community spread. ROCHELLE WALENSKY, MD, MPH (CDC Director): We should be treating every case as if it's a variant during this pandemic right now. MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: There are also questions about how the vaccines will stand up to new strains. Johnson & Johnson, which is set to ask for emergency authorization of its one-dose vaccine this week, noted that its efficacy dropped from seventy-two percent in the U.S. to fifty-seven percent in South Africa, where the mutant strain is driving new cases. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, M.D. (Chief Medical Adviser to President Biden): This is a wakeup call to all of us. We will continue to see the evolution of mutants. MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Vaccinating Americans remains a logistical problem. In Alaska, medical workers try to find ways to remote villages. WOMAN: We have been going by plane, and a couple of the places you go by snow machine, the little sled behind it to get you there. MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Across the nation of the nearly fifty million doses distributed to states, just sixty percent have been administered. In an effort to speed up the process, FEMA is now asking the Defense Department to ready as many as ten thousand troops to assist in vaccine clinics. Yet for those who have received the shot, racial disparities persist, with white residents being vaccinated at higher rates than black residents, often double the rate or higher in one survey. At this clinic in South Los Angeles, a surprise shipment of six hundred doses before closing became a lifeline for those who have struggled to secure appointments. MAN #1: Grandmas and grandpas, non-English speakers, how are you supposed to use that complicated website? MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: Another challenge facing states, getting students back in the classroom. A CDC report found schools are low risk for widespread transmission, provided mask and distancing guidelines are followed. But there is a clash between the teachers' union and the City of Chicago over a planned return to in-person learning tomorrow. In Denver, it's already started. MAN #2: It's been tense at times to think about, like, you know, the possibility of getting infected, the possibility of bringing home an infection. (End VT) MANUEL BOJORQUEZ: There are some indications the virus' wildfire pace has slowed just slightly. The number of new cases and hospitalizations nationwide has eased, but the daily death toll surpassed four thousand twice in the past week. Today, Florida ends its deadliest month of the pandemic. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Manny, thanks. The variant of the virus first detected in the U.K. is now in fifty countries. Senior foreign correspondent Liz Palmer reports from London. ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@CBSLizpalmer): Good morning. The U.K. is now more than halfway toward its goal of vaccinating fifteen million people over seventy and medical staff by mid-February. And that's in sharp contrast to the situation in Europe. (Begin VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: Some German vaccination centers are completely empty because they've run out of vaccine. And there is the same problem in parts of Spain and France. Manufacturing delays and sluggish bureaucracy mean Europe has vaccinated just three percent of its population, compared to eight percent in the U.S. and thirteen in the U.K. But those are numbers African countries can only dream of. Most are still waiting to get a single dose-- WOMAN: Okay. ELIZABETH PALMER: --as South Africa battles a dangerous new virus variant that sent deaths rocketing up. The fact is ninety-five percent of the vaccines on Earth have so far gone to the ten richest countries. For life to return to normal, that's going to have to change, warns the WHO. TEDROS GHEBREYESUS (Director-General of the World Health Organization): We will not end the pandemic anywhere until we end it everywhere. ELIZABETH PALMER: And it's far from ended in Europe, in spite of lockdowns and curfews. This is carnival week in Venice, though you would never know it; no one came. Spain is once again struggling with a surge in infections, and Portugal currently has the worst outbreak in the world. (Man speaking foreign language) ELIZABETH PALMER: Meanwhile, a security and media circus surrounds the WHO team of experts in Wuhan wherever they go, looking for the source of the virus. Compare that to the peace movie buff Lisa Enroth is looking forward to. A Swedish COVID nurse, she won a week in a cozy lighthouse to watch all sixty entries in G\u00f6teborg Film Festival. Now, that's self-isolation. (End VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: It's exactly a year ago this week that the very first coronavirus case was confirmed here in Britain. And there is a real hope now that we may be at what you might call the beginning of the beginning of the end. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz, thank you. We want to go now to New Orleans and former Congressman Cedric Richmond, who is now senior adviser to the President. Good morning to you. CEDRIC RICHMOND (Senior Adviser to the President/@Richmond46): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on COVID. This new strain that was first detected in the U.K., B117, led that country to shut down its schools. This week Doctor Fauci said opening U.S. schools may not happen due to mitigating circumstances. Is President Biden still vowing to open American schools by April? CEDRIC RICHMOND: Well, yes. And the key to it is making sure that we pass the American rescue plan so that we provide the school systems and local municipalities the ability to open schools safely. And we think that if we invest in the resources to make it safe, schools should reopen. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that likely wouldn't even happen until March at the earliest. Tell me about the plans right now, what you can do now. Should the federal government make it a priority to vaccinate teachers or instruct governors to push them towards the head of the line as essential workers? CEDRIC RICHMOND: Look, I think you see us doing everything humanly possible to make sure we ramp up vaccinations. We're delivering another million six to the states every week. So we bumped up to order. We just purchased another two hundred million vaccinations so that we can vaccinate the whole three hundred million adults that we need to do. And so we're going to keep pushing. We're going to keep sending vaccines to the states and asking the states to hurry up and make sure that they get them all out. But our plan and why we need to pass the American Rescue Plan is to make sure that we give the school systems the ability to buy the masks, the ventilation systems, all of those things that's needed to open up. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, as you know, I mean that fight is happening right now in cities like Chicago. We'll be talking to their superintendent later on in the program. And Michael Bloomberg, former presidential rival to-- to President Biden, argued in an op-ed this week that the President could be doing more. He could use his bully pul-- pulpit, excuse me, to give political cover to fellow Democrats. He could tell the unions, yes, I understand how we need to prioritize teachers here and actually take measures to do it. Why isn't the President doing more to help out some of these fellow Democrats? CEDRIC RICHMOND: I think the President is doing a lot. He just introduced a 1.9-trillion-dollar plan to make sure that it is a whole community approach to fighting-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But they need the help right now. They're trying to open schools Monday. CEDRIC RICHMOND: --of vaccinations. Well, that's an issue in Chicago that both sides are dealing with. I know they're both at the table. Teachers are concerned about their health and making sure that they could teach in a safe environment. And if you look at the CDC study, the CDC study that just came out said with the proper investments, with the proper spacing and class sizes, schools could reopen safely. But another key aspect of that CDC study is that they didn't test all the students and teachers. They just tested people who were symptomatic. And the class sizes in that population was in between ten and twenty students in a class. So, look, we are very serious about making sure that we pass a plan that gives us a comprehensive approach to COVID, which means small business with help, help to our citizens. And so, look, we want kids back in school. No doubt about it. But we want it to be safe for the students, the teachers and the families of both students and teachers. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think everyone wants that safety. I want to ask you about the aid package you're referencing there. This morning, as you know, a group of about ten Republican senators sent a letter to the President and they say they just want a meeting. They have a proposal that they say mirrors many of the same things the President wants, including money for vaccine and health supplies, targeted stimulus checks, slightly different from what the President's proposing, enhanced unemployment. Is the President open to these ideas? And will he meet with them? CEDRIC RICHMOND: Look, the bi-- the President said in his inauguration speech that he wanted to work with both sides in order to help the American people. And what we know about President Biden is it's never about him. It's always about the people. So, yes, he is very willing to meet with anyone to advance the agenda. But, look, this is about seriousness of purpose. This is about meeting the moment. And this crisis is enormous, and our response to it meets that challenge. And so when you start talking about fourteen hundred dollars to individuals, another hundred and sixty million dollars so we can safely open schools, a couple of hundred million dollars to make sure that we help small businesses that are struggling, that's what the American people want to see. Seventy percent of the American people support President Biden's plan and another seventy-one percent of the American people want to see Republicans work with the President to meet the enormous challenges that we have. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. Is the President willing to compromise then and, perhaps, strip out something like this fifteen-dollar minimum wage demand that many Republicans object to? Could he make that a separate vote? CEDRIC RICHMOND: Look, we're not going to negotiate on TV, but what I will say about the minimum wage is the minimum wage has been expanded or increased during times of crisis before. It's been increased under Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents. And it's a great way to lift people out of poverty. And if you think of all the frontline workers that are out there risking their lives every day, who probably have not been vaccinated, yet. So, you're talking about grocery store clerks and everyone else. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. CEDRIC RICHMOND: They shouldn't have to work two jobs just to make a living wage and live above the poverty line. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you could make that a separate vote. CEDRIC RICHMOND: Look, the other people want to argue process. We want to argue purpose in moving this country forward. And President Biden is very clear and he said it in his inaugural, we face deep challenges and we're going to meet the moment and we're not going to leave anybody behind. That's the whole purpose of building back better. We're not going to leave -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. CEDRIC RICHMOND: --people behind. And especially the people who are on the frontlines risking their lives to keep this economy afloat and make sure people have the goods and services that they need. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your time in Congress. You, yourself were hunkered down on January 6th inside the Capitol when you were a sitting congressman during that siege. Speaker Pelosi said this week that the enemy is within the House of Representatives. Do you believe that some of your former colleagues, sitting lawmakers, pose a security risk? CEDRIC RICHMOND: Look, I-- I can tell you one thing, and this is my time as a congressperson, I believe that we're in a different state than we've ever been before, members who do not want to face reality, members that are encouraging conspiracy theories and things like that. But the real-- the enemy that's within is the dysfunction of the Republican Party, unwilling to face facts, unwilling to put the people of America first. And, look, I have all the faith in the leadership ability of Nancy Pelosi. She's a great speaker. But the challenge is bringing people together right now. And that means Republicans ditching the division that has defined them for the last couple of years under the former President and coming to the table. All we're asking is those people that are out there busting their backs to keep food on their table and a roof over their head and clothes on their kids' back, come join us in helping them. And let's leave the conspiracy theories. Let's stop arguing about election fraud that we know never existed. And so that's the enemy within is the inability of people to acknowledge facts and come together to help the American people. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you very much, Congressman Richmond, for your time. And FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute, to talk with the governor of one of the states that has a strong record when it comes to vaccinating and in-person learning. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Connecticut. Governor Ned Lamont joins us from Stamford good morning to you. GOVERNOR NED LAMONT (D-Connecticut/@GovNedLamont): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, we've talked about your state being a-- an outperformer in terms of actually getting vaccine supply out to constituents, and I wonder what your advice to the Biden administration would be. Should they continue prioritizing states based on population or reward good behavior by giving more vaccine to states that can actually put it in arms? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Well, I can tell you they gave us-- the previous administration gave us fifty thousand additional doses because we are doing a good job of getting people vaccinated on a timely basis. But I think what's most important right now for the Biden administration is give us some transparency, let us know what we can expect next week, what we can expect next month so we know how much to expand our infrastructure. But we're ready to get people vaccinated. You just get us the vaccines. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know the White House said this week that they will boost supply about sixteen percent, give you three weeks' notice of what you're about to get instead of just the one week that you were getting under the prior administration. But then I saw that two health systems in your state have been canceling appointments for shots in arms for the coming week. So I'm wondering is there still a problem with federal supply? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: I don't think so. They've done a relatively good job of getting us the vaccines when we need it. Our hospital systems and federally qualified health centers, they do things by appointment. That clears up a lot of the confusion you see in some other states. But I do know that one or two of these systems maybe overpromised and, you know, had more people than they had vaccines. We're watching that very carefully. Do it by appointment. Clear up the confusion. Get people vaccinated. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have prioritized, as the federal government has suggested, based on age. And-- and there is a correlation, of course, between mortality and age when it comes to COVID. But one of your local papers, The Connecticut Mirror, had analysis pointing out that the sixty-five and older group in Connecticut is about eighty-four-percent white. Given how hard hit people of color are, should race be a factor? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: What they also pointed out, Margaret, is that people of color, black and brown, sixty, sixty-five, seventy-five, are much more likely to get infected, much more likely to suffer complications than a white person ten years their elder. So, we are making a big effort to make sure we don't just get the worried well at our big drive-through vaccination centers, but also get our mobile vans, go to the churches, go to those housing complexes where we can get people vaccinated who have to get vaccinated. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you still will stick with age as the determining factor at this point? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: At this point, it's seventy-five and above, just because, as you point out, you know, eighty percent of the fatalities are related to that narrow group. Then we'll probably go down to sixty-five and above. Most of those folks have comorbidities. And then we'll look at essential workers in a broader group from there. But we can expand quickly if we get more vaccines. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me ask you about those essential workers. You have about fifty percent of your schools already in person, face-to-face instruction. Should teachers be pushed to the front of the line as essential workers? I asked the-- Cedric Richmond from the White House that he didn't want to stipulate that they should be prioritized. Will you prioritize teachers in your state? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Well, first of all, we have about ninety-five percent of our kids have the opportunity to go to school, to go to the classroom either full time or hybrid. Almost all of them are full time. Our teachers have been extraordinary heroes showing up, being at school, giving these kids an opportunity. I can't afford a lost year. So, yes, teachers are going to be in an early group when it comes to people getting vaccinated. And right now, they are a priority group in terms of testing. We're doing testing at the schools or nearby -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: --to make sure every teacher has the confidence that they can continue to teach safely. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, for example, in Chicago, the mayor has said there that putting teachers ahead of other essential workers wouldn't necessarily be fair. Will you put teachers ahead of those other essential workers in 1b? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Well, it's a little complicated. I've got police who are going out there on the front lines. We've got manufacturing folks and defense industries. I've got daycare workers. So, I've got to be careful about how you prioritize. But I got to tell you teachers are right near the top of that list because of what we're doing to keep our schools open and our kids in the game. MARGARET BRENNAN: In Connecticut you have detected some of this new mutant virus, the B117 that originated or was-- excuse me, detected first in the U.K. The prime minister, as you know, of the United Kingdom, shut down schools there. At what point will you reverse course or have to reverse course and shut down your schools if this particular strain becomes more of a problem? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Somebody I talked to a lot about this is one of your next guests, Scott Gottlieb, who's been advising us. And, fortunately, in Connecticut, compared to, say, a couple of the other states, our hit rate in terms of those particularly infectious variants is very, very low. So, I'm quite confident that if we keep the vaccinations going, we're going to be able to stay ahead of that curve. But we are watching it carefully. And if something changes so will we. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have a benchmark infection rate where you'd shut down? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: I don't do it that way. I mean, right now we're less than five percent. We're one of the lowest in the country right now, been that way for some time. And-- and, frankly, being in a classroom with a mask is probably a lot safer than being out with your buddies because you can't go to school. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. So, are you confident, bottom line, that you will have a hundred percent of schools open by the spring? GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: Like I said, ninety-five percent of our kids right now are already have the option to go to school either full time or a hybrid -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GOVERNOR NED LAMONT: --and that we're going to keep that going. The only variant could be is if this U.K. variant takes off like wildfire. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Governor Lamont, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you enjoy FACE THE NATION, we think you'll love our new podcast, a new episode of Facing Forward drops every Friday. And in our latest edition, I spoke with the CEO of Eli Lilly. You can listen and subscribe on Apple podcast or your favorite podcast platform. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with the mayor of Miami, and former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. And later on, we'll talk to Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson about whether they'll be able to reopen tomorrow. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We go now to Miami, still a hotspot for COVID-19. Mayor Francis Suarez is there. Good morning to you, Mister Mayor. MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ (D-Miami/@FrancisSuarez): Good morning, Margaret. It's a pleasure to be with you this morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: According to the CDC, Florida is the state with the most cases of B117. That's that strain first detected in the U.K. It's highly contagious. And I know there's a concentration in South Florida. What mitigation measures are you putting in place in your city to contain it? MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Well, you know, we've been restricted from being able to put in mitigation measures. I had implemented a mask in public order back when we were allowed to do that during the summer, and that drove down cases by ninety percent. Now, we're not allowed to implement a mask in public order. It's something that I had been speaking to the coronavirus task force about. The good news is that as-- as opposed to the summer where we had twenty-three hundred COVID patients countywide, which was a tremendous strain on our hospital system, now we have less than a thousand patients. So, you know, even though, we are, you know, obviously, battling with-- with a new strain, that is not thankfully at this point materializing into more hospitalizations. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say not allowed, I assume you're referring to Governor DeSantis, a fellow Republican who has put in place restrictions to bar local governments from enforcing mask mandates. So you're-- are you telling him, as mayor, I need power over my own city? MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Sure, yeah. I've-- I've tried to reach him on multiple occasion to tell him to give us the opportunity, not just here at the city, but in the county, to be able to institute things that we think are common sense, that we think are backed up by science and we can demonstrate are backed up by science. I have a chart that shows demonstrably that masks in public work. Thankfully, a lot of our residents are doing it regardless. I think they're, obviously, concerned about their own health. And, certainly, we've been hammering home the point in PSAs, you know, throughout, you know, the last few months. And I think that's one of the main reasons why our hospitalizations remain low. So I'm very thankful that our residents are listening, despite the fact that it's something that we can't mandate. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the governor has not responded, I assume, to your requests? MAYOR SUAREZ: That's correct. That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: I looked at the White House report for your state this week and it highlights the metro area around Miami as being in the red zone. But your restaurants are allowed to have a hundred percent capacity, along with social distancing, of course. But your bars, your nightclubs, your gyms are all open. Should you be rethinking that? MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Well, like I said, you know, unfortunately, that's not in our purview. That's something that the governor has decided. And certainly we're-- we're blessed that our residents, I think, are also heeding the warnings and are using masks, despite the fact that there are significantly greater concentrations of people at those establishments. Because of that, our hospitalizations have plummeted from the summer. And like I said, we're in-- in a place where we have significantly less than we had before. Obviously, for our aging population, we're focusing on vaccinating that population right now as we speak. And that's been our priority to make sure that we can protect those that are the most vulnerable, those that are at the most risk of losing their life if they contract the virus. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know if you have any of the cases of P1, the strain out of Brazil, or B1351 out of South Africa? MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: I don't yet. I haven't gotten any indication from the-- the State Health Department that we have any of those strains. It's very possible that we do. What we do know and what we've been told is that the vaccines that we're administering for both Moderna and Pfizer are effective against the U.K. strain, which, of course, we all know is significantly more contagious than-- than, you know, the sort of previous version of-- of COVID-19. So, we're continuing to vaccinate both in the city of Miami at Marlins Park at about seven thousand a week. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: We'd love to have more vaccine. We think if we get significantly more, we can more quickly vaccinate the vulnerable population as well as the general population. MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, vaccine tourism is also drawing people to Miami. I know you've tried to stop some of this and your governor has said to prioritize residents, but there was a Mexican TV star posting on social media last week that he flew into Miami, got a shot, and then flew back to Mexico. Rules are still being broken here. How are you going to discourage that from happening? MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Yeah, it's awful. And I think, you know, we don't control all the vaccine that's being administered. We control about seven thousand of the twenty-two thousand that are being administered countywide. A lot of them are being administered by the hospital system and by other organizations that we don't control. We are very faithful about making sure that we're asking for identification, that people have a Florida ID because we think it's disrespectful. I mean, we have people in this community that are living here that are-- are, you know, dying, frankly, and, you know, they want and they deserve to have priority. If they're vulnerable, we need to get them vaccinated as quickly as possible to make sure that they can live peaceful and enjoyable lives without worry. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you investigating some of this rule breaking? You're saying you're confident that people are being asked for ID, but, obviously, people are exploiting that. MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Well, like I said, we're only doing about a third of all of the vaccinations, so it's very possible that those cases are happening in the other two-thirds. But-- but definitely-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: --our-- our fire department, which is the one that administers it, is on heightened alert for it and-- and certainly will investigate any cases that we believe arise from any of the vaccinations that we've given. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Miami Herald, as you know, local paper there, says that communities with higher average incomes have been getting more doses than impoverished neighborhoods. Why is that happening? MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Again, you know, we-- we only control the ones that we give. We started doing it about a week ago at Marlins Park, and I can assure you that the ones that we're doing are-- are for the general public they're-- it's a state registration system, but it's possible that people are getting preferential treatment at hospitals. And that's something that, frankly, needs to stop immediately. We've been focusing on our minority communities, our underserved communities, to make sure that there's an equitable distribution of the vaccine to those that are vulnerable and that need it most. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mister Mayor, thank you for your time this morning. MAYOR FRANCIS SUAREZ: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He sits on the board of Pfizer as well as Illumina. And you all heard Governor Lamont mention him and the help he gives in his home state of Connecticut. Doctor joins us this morning from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I thought it was remarkable there to hear a Republican mayor criticize a Republican governor in saying we-- we need to actually be able to control what's happening in our own city and that not being allowed to happen. Are cities like Miami, places where they are seeing B117, this strain of the U.K. circulate. Are they really at risk of being overrun? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think Miami is at the highest risk right now, Miami and southern California. If you look at where B117 is right now in the country, about half the cases that we're turning over in Southern California and in Florida and the cities are the hot spots, San Diego, Miami. So I think that the possibility is that we're not going to see a national epidemic with B117, at least in the spring and the summertime. It's a risk to the fall. But what we're likely to see is regionalized epidemics with this new variant. And the two places in the country right now that are the biggest hotspots are southern Cali-- California and southern Florida, Miami. So those cities need to be very mindful of the spread of these variants. Now we know it works. Prior immunity and the vaccines do appear to be as effective against this new variant. So as we immunize more of the population and if people continue to wear masks and be vigilant in these parts of the country, we can keep this at bay. It's not too late, but it's a real risk to those regions of the country right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you clarify, because Doctor Fauci was on this program last Sunday and said that that U.K. strain does have a certain degree of increase in virulence, meaning it can cause more damage, including death. Is it more deadly? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There's some-- there's some evidence right now that does suggest that it is more pathogenic, that it does cause more severe illness. And we do know that it's about fifty percent more transmissible. But what we also know from the data, at least the data we have so far, both experimental evidence as well as the data that's come out of some of these vaccine trials like the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial and the one with Novavax is that immunization and prior infection appears to be protective against the B117 variant, as protective. That's not the case with the Brazilian and the South African variant P1 and B1351, where prior infection, immunity you get from being infected as well as the immunity you get from vaccination, does not appear to be as protective against those variants. So the good news with B117, if there is good news is that as we vaccinate more of the population, it should be a backstop against the continued spread of that variant. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Biden administration projected this week that another ninety thousand people will die in the U.S. over the next four weeks, but the curve seemed to be coming down on hospitalizations and infections. Are we getting ahead of ourselves by saying we're turning a corner here? Are you warning us that these new variants are going to dramatically change this trajectory? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think we have the potential to turn a corner. Things are clearly improving around the country. We can't take our foot off the brake too quickly in terms of the things that people are doing, like wearing masks and being more vigilant. That's really probably what's bringing down infection rates across the country right now. The new variants create a lot of risk. I think that the risk is that what you're going to see over the summertime is whereas the summer should have been very quiet, coronavirus should have really dissipated in part because of the seasonal backstop, in part because we've infected a third of the population and in part because we're immunizing more people. So coronavirus levels should have really come down this summer. You might see higher prevalence than what you would have expected. But what's going to likely happen is that the prevalence is going to be high in certain regional hotspots. So we'll have hotspots of infection and maybe epidemics in parts of Florida, parts of Southern California, because of B117. They'll never really get out of it, but the rest of the country will see prevalence come down. Now, the risk is to the fall when, you know, these new variants are going to want to surge, B117, B1351, P1. Now, with respect to the South African and the Brazilian variants, they don't appear right now to be more fit, meaning that they're more transmissible. So, they may not spread as readily. And we have time to get control of those variants and develop new boosters that could protect against them, vaccine boosters. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to ask you about because we heard from Johnson & Johnson and Novavax that potentially their vaccines may be less effective against that strain out of South Africa. How long will it take us to get the booster shots that you say may be necessary? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think we could definitely have it in time for the fall. We need to come up with a regulatory framework that allows the boosters to be licensed on the ability to demonstrate that they can produce antibody levels. And FDA is working on that. They've talked about developing guidance that would allow companies to develop boosters to the existing vaccines that could be licensed just on the basis of proving that in three hundred or four hundred patients, they can induce antibody levels at a sufficient level that are protective against these new variants. And so I think that framework is going to be mapped out and the companies have said they're already working on those new boosters. We could have them in time for the fall across all these vaccines. There's no reason we can't do that. And the platforms that the companies use to develop these vaccines, these synthetic platforms, lend themselves to those quick adaptations. MARGARET BRENNAN: For those of us who aren't doctors, how should we understand the difference between Pfizer, Moderna and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine that seems to be headed for FDA approval? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah. You know, I don't think you can make apples to apples comparisons across these clinical trials. People focused on the fact that the J&J vaccine was seventy-two percent effective in the United States at protecting against moderate to severe disease and the mRNA platforms, Moderna and Pfizer were ninety-five percent protective. And so, you know, there was a presumption that, well, maybe the J&J vaccine isn't as protective. I think that we need to look at what the vaccine is doing. It does appear that the J&J vaccine is inducing what we call a T cell response, meaning that it's protecting against disease. It might not be protecting as well against infection, but it does seem to be protecting very well against moderate to severe COVID. And, in fact, in the clinical trial, no patients who received the vaccine were hospitalized or died from-- from COVID. And so that's a really good outcome from the clinical trial. We also need to keep in mind that the J&J vaccine is a one dose vaccine. They have a study underway looking at two doses. So, it may well be the case that if you get two doses of that J&J vaccine, which may, eventually, be how we end up using it, it'll be just as protective as the other vaccines. But it's a very good development. I think it will get authorized by the FDA after a careful review, and it's going to provide a lot of additional supply on the market and some differentiation as well from the other vaccines. MARGARET BRENNAN: How much of a difference will it make that the Biden administration is giving three weeks' notice versus one week's notice to states about the doses they're going to receive? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, a lot, and the fact that they're also increasing the amount of supply that they'll flow into the states right now. You know the states need to set up vaccination sites and have a predictable flow coming through those sites. They need to book appointments two, three weeks out. And so giving the states visibility on what the supply is going to be allows them to set up systems where people can go online and book an appointment two or three weeks out. A lot of people are willing to wait to get vaccinated. They just want to know when they're going to get vaccinated. So, I think giving more certainty to more people about when their time is going to come, when they can get an appointment, is going to be very important. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you for your analysis. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Chicago public schools are set to open tomorrow for the first time since March, but school officials and the teachers' union have been at odds over terms of the teachers returning to the classroom. Chicago Public Schools CEO Doctor Janice Jackson joins us. Good morning to you. JANICE JACKSON, EdD (Chicago Public Schools CEO/@janicejackson): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: The mayor has demanded that elementary and middle schools open tomorrow. Will the teachers union go on strike? JANICE JACKSON: Well, right now, we're in the middle of negotiations that have really heated up over the past couple of weeks. Our goal is to reopen schools as planned tomorrow on February 1st for students in our K through eighth grades. It's also important to note we did bring back our early childhood students and some of our students with disability-- disabilities earlier this month and had real good success with reopening. So we are looking forward to restarting again. MARGARET BRENNAN: What happens to teachers if they don't show up tomorrow? JANICE JACKSON: Well, the goal right now is to-- to get a resolution. CTU has made it clear that they want a deal. We share those same sentiments, but we're still far apart on a couple of key issues, such as vaccination and how we account for accommodations for individuals who maybe are just, you know, petrified to come back into schools because of COVID. We believe that we have to reopen schools. We've been closed for almost a year now. And as a school system, we're starting to see some of the effects of schools being closed. Many of our students aren't logging on. We are seeing African American and Latinx students, in particular, being especially hard hit. And our goal is to really give every parent an option. Those families who want to remain remote will have that option through the remainder of the school year. But we have thousands of families who want an in-person option because they're essential workers themselves. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. How many children do you expect to be in the classroom tomorrow? JANICE JACKSON: Right now we're anticipating seventy-seven thousand students, which is roughly a third of the students here in CPS that are eligible for in-person instruction. That's twice the size of the second largest school district here in Illinois. And so reopening Chicago Public Schools is extremely important. We should also note that private and parochial schools in the city have been open since August, and we learned a lot from their implementation plans and look to guidance from public health officials, as well as the CDC to make sure we had a solid plan for reopening. MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that CDC plan, I know this report this week got a lot of attention really urging schools to reopen and-- and saying that transmission can be stopped if masks are worn and there's social distancing. But the same report said there should still be restrictions in the community and it cited indoor dining. Chicago has already opened its bars and restaurants. How do you feel about that? JANICE JACKSON: Yeah, I think we've learned a lot about reopening from the past spring. Definitely prioritizing the reopening of schools has to be at the top of the list and our mayor has done that. We have reopened bars and restaurants at limited capacity here in the city. But one thing that was really important in that report is that it showed that community spread does not necessarily impact spread within a particular school and that implementing mitiga-- mitigation strategies with fidelity actually is more successful, you know, lead to more success with reopening. And so we're focused on that. We have a solid plan in place that goes above and beyond a guidance that we've heard from city as well as CDC officials. And we believe that we can safely reopen. And we've been open for three weeks or we have been open for three weeks with a great degree of success. So, the time is now for students to return to the classroom. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you mentioned that one of the issues you're still in disagreement with-- with the union is over vaccination. Chicago is one of the few cities in this country that gets its supply directly from the federal government. The federal guidelines prioritize based on age. That's why I was asking Cedric Richmond, the adviser to the President, about it. I wonder if it would be helpful to you if the Biden administration explicitly said to prioritize teachers in the front of the line as essential workers? JANICE JACKSON: Yeah, so in Chicago and in Illinois, we are prioritizing teachers. They are included in 1b, which is currently underway. I think the issue is definitely around vaccine supply. The more vaccines we're able to get, we'll be able to vaccinate people sooner. We have started vaccinating individuals in our school system, which is important to note. We started with our health care workers and those individuals who work closely with students where they may be at more risk for exposure. But, again, in order to accelerate vaccination of our teachers, we, quite frankly, need more supply. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you-- why couldn't you move them to the front of 1b ahead of other essential workers with the supply you have now? JANICE JACKSON: Well, our city's health department is in charge of that, but what I've heard them say is that, look, the vaccine is a part of a public health tool kit in order to mitigate the spread of COVID. Rule number one is that you have to disseminate those vaccines in places where we're trying to stop the spread of COVID. Schools are not significant sources of spread. And so this is as much-- this-- not as much-- this is a public health solution. We have to start with that. Some of these other things are incredibly important, but some of them are political decisions. Our health department is trying to combat the effects and the spread of COVID. And we are prioritizing places where we see the spread raging on. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Doctor Jackson, none of this is easy. Thank you for your time this morning. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: A year ago CBS News foreign correspondent Ramy Inocencio traveled to Wuhan, China, at the height of the COVID-19 outbreak. He and his team went back last week to cover the trip of WHO experts who have been trying to get into that country for a year now to investigate the origins of the virus. Today, that team of investigators was allowed into the seafood market in Wuhan where scientists believe the virus first spread. Here's Ramy's report. (Begin VT) RAMY INOCENCIO (CBS News Foreign Correspondent/@RamyInocencio): Wuhan's winter swimmers have returned to the Yangtze River. Dancers to their parks, friends to their favorite snack shops. (Crowd performing) RAMY INOCENCIO: Many are celebrating a new lease on life after the loss of nearly five thousand, and a lockdown for seventy-six days. We were here one year ago, the start of what would be a global tragedy, now World Health Organization investigators are here, too. Scientists believe bats brought COVID to humans. The WHO is looking for the how. This is Wuhan's famous, some would say infamous, Institute of Virology. Some believe COVID leaked from here, but Chinese officials have pushed back hard. The institute says that it's open to any kind of visit. But the international community is skeptical. The investigation has been long delayed. China has been accused of repeatedly blocking access. Beijing has pressed an anywhere but China origin story. The Biden administration says Chinese officials are spreading misinformation. PETER DASZAK: Let history be the judge. RAMY INOCENCIO: Peter Daszak is a U.S.-based investigator and part of the WHO team here. He says the work so far has been productive. Today, the team visited the market where some of the first infections were detected. PETER DASZAK: We are seeing the data and looking at the evidence together with our counterparts in China. RAMY INOCENCIO: We spoke with Wuhan natives who blame the government. Zhang Hai lost his father and calls it murder. (Yang Min Speaking Foreign Language/January 28, 2021) RAMY INOCENCIO: Yang Min's daughter died, she says, because whistleblowers were muzzled. In state propaganda, only the positive is told. From a new patriotic documentary for the nation to a massive COVID exhibition in Wuhan. It praises China's president, Xi Jinping, for victory over the virus. And it is a reality one year later, there has been restoration to society after catastrophe. Resumption of movements after isolation, and recovery from tragedy for the city of eleven million on the banks of the Yangtze, still looking for answers about COVID, now living almost as if it never happened. Ramy Inocencio, CBS News, Wuhan. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Tuesday that President Biden's COVID-19 vaccine distribution goal is to have \"greater availability in the spring.\" Mr. Biden said on Monday that any American who wants a\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0vaccine will be able to get one \"this spring,\" perhaps the most ambitious target mentioned publicly by his administration.\u00a0 \"I think it'll be this spring. I think we'll be able to do that this spring,\" Mr. Biden said Monday when a reporter asked him when any American who wants a vaccine should be able to obtain one. \"But it's going to be a logistical challenge that exceeds anything we've ever tried in this country. But I think we can do that. I feel confident that by summer we're going to be well on our way to heading toward herd immunity and increasing the access for people who aren't on the first, on the list, all the way going down to children and how we deal with that. But I feel good about where we're going and I think we can get it done.\"\u00a0 Psaki would not provide an expected date for when the U.S. would reach herd immunity \u2014 the threshold at which enough people have been vaccinated or infected by the virus to curtail its spread. \"It will take months and months for a broad swath of population to be vaccinated,\" she said.\u00a0 Questions about the nation's vaccine stockpile were directed to White House's COVID-19 response team, led by Jeff Zients, which will begin to hold briefings three times a week, according to Psaki. \"Our concerns and our focus is not just on the supply,\" she said. \"That's part of the issue, it is also about ensuring that states have the number of vaccinators that they need.\" The president has spent the first week of his administration signing a slew of executive actions focused on combating the coronavirus,\u00a0boosting American manufacturing\u00a0and responding to the\u00a0economic crisis\u00a0brought on by the pandemic. Mr. Biden is scheduled to sign a\u00a0package of executive actions\u00a0targeting equity later this afternoon.\u00a0 Domestic policy adviser Susan Rice joined Psaki in the briefing room to preview the actions, including efforts to advance the nation's fair housing laws and a directive to the Department of Justice not to renew contracts with private prisons. The directive, however, does not apply to the Department of Homeland Security, which operates the controversial privately operated immigration detention centers. Mr. Biden is also expected to use his executive authority to disavow racism and xenophobia toward Asian Americans, which have been targeted because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, CBS News reported Monday. The forthcoming action follows weeks of preparation from Mr. Biden's transition team and the new White House Domestic Policy Council. Former President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the \"China Virus\" and the \"Kung Flu\" as he sought to tie the pandemic to the Chinese government, and part of Mr. Biden's efforts are centered around ensuring such references are not in any existing policies, directives or government websites. \"These aren't feel-good policies, the evidence is clear: Investing in equity is good for economic growth,\" Rice said, adding that it's \"critical we don't get anywhere near the March cliff,\" when tens of millions of Americans would lose unemployment insurance. \"Nobody wants to be having a conversations in May about why our schools are not open and why millions of people have been kicked off of unemployment insurance,\" she said.\u00a0 Across Washington on Capitol Hill, the Senate has been steadily confirming members of Mr. Biden's Cabinet, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. The Senate is expected to vote to confirm Tony Blinken, Mr. Biden's pick for secretary of state, Tuesday. Mr. Biden had his first phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. According to Psaki, the two leaders discussed a slew of topics, including \"the Solar Winds hack, reports of Russia placing bounties on United States soldiers in Afghanistan, interference in the 2020 election, the poisoning of Alexey Navalny, and treatment of peaceful protesters by Russian security forces.\" Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny was jailed upon his return to Moscow earlier this month. Navalny spent five months in Germany recovering from a severe nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin, and which Russian authorities deny. Tens of thousands have rallied in support of Navalny.\u00a0 Psaki said Mr. Biden's \"intention was also to make clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of our national interests in response to malign actions by Russia.\"\u00a0 The Senate is also proceeding with the impeachment trial of former President Trump, who was charged by the House with incitement of insurrection for his role in the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. Mr. Trump's trial is not expected to begin until the week of February 8, allowing the Senate more time to approve members of Mr. Biden's Cabinet.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden\u00a0unveiled his $1.9 trillion dollar coronavirus economic relief plan on Thursday evening. The expensive legislation contains three major targets: $400 billion for arresting the spread of COVID-19 and increasing vaccine capabilities; over $1 trillion to assist families needing direct financial support; and $440 billion in emergency funds for cash-poor small businesses and communities. \"I believe we have a moral obligation,\" Mr. Biden said in a speech on Thursday night from Wilmington, Delaware. \"In this pandemic in America, we cannot let people go hungry, we cannot let people get evicted, we cannot watch nurses, educators and others lose their jobs, we so badly need them. We must act now, and we must act decisively.\" \u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Biden in his \"American Rescue\" plan, calls for an additional $1,400 in stimulus checks for Americans, on top of the $600 that's already been approved, bringing the total stimulus to $2,000. Other financial aid includes expanding unemployment insurance by $100, bringing the weekly total to $400, and increasing the child tax credit to $3,000 per child. \"This gets money quickly into the pockets of millions of Americans who will spend it immediately on food and rent and other basic needs, as economists tell us that helps the whole economy grow,\" Mr. Biden said in the speech. \u00a0 \u00a0 The president-elect also wants to implement emergency paid sick, family, and medical leave, stabilize childcare centers with $25 billion in emergency funding, and forestall COVID-related evictions. His proposed legislation also would also initiate his push for a $15 national minimum wage and for ending the tipped minimum wage. Mr. Biden on Thursday also laid the foundation on how his administration will change the vaccine distribution process. \"The vaccine rollout in the United States has been a dismal failure so far,\" Mr. Biden said. \u00a0\u00a0 Mr. Biden is proposing $400 billion dollars to boost vaccine infrastructure, with a specific focus on increasing the number of community vaccine distribution locations. An incoming senior Biden administration official reiterated confidence that the goal of providing 100 million vaccine shots in the first 100 days would be met. The incoming official said the number is not dependent on an additional vaccine becoming available, like the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine that is awaiting the Food and Drug Administration's authorization. Under the plan, the vaccine will be free and available to everyone, regardless of immigration status. Mr. Biden said he will detail specific vaccination procedure changes on Friday. \u00a0\u00a0 COVID-19 testing would also be expanded, with an additional $50 billion. A 100,000-strong public health jobs corps would help spread factual information about the vaccine and to contact-trace COVID cases. Mr. Biden's coronavirus package proposes $170 billion for updates to K-12 schools to ready them for in-class instruction again. Funds could be used to reduce class size, modify space, improve ventilation or provide additional funding for summer school to make up for lost time. Higher-education institutions, including public colleges, HBCUs and other Minority Serving Institutions, could receive $35 billion in assistance. Biden's plan details that \"millions\" of students could receive an additional $1,700 in financial assistance with this money. Mr. Biden's proposal to eliminate $10,000 of student loan debt is not included in this plan, but an incoming senior Biden official said during a press briefing that he still supports this idea and reiterated the Biden administration's plan to continue the \"pause\" on student loan payments. Finally, to assist struggling businesses, Mr. Biden is asking for $15 billion dollars to go directly to 1 million small businesses. He also wants to increase loans to businesses in need. Community transportation, tribal communities, and technology investments are also included in the bill. This is the first of two bills Mr. Biden plans to address COVID-19. Mr. Biden said Thursday evening he will introduce his \"recovery\" bill in February at a joint session of Congress.\u00a0 \u00a0 CBS News reported on Wednesday the Biden White House has already begun trying to line up bipartisan support for the COVID-relief package, which could mean significant changes to the legislation in order to attract more Republican support. This goal was also communicated to the congressional aides on Tuesday. Mr. Biden proactively addressed critics who not share his optimism of striking a bipartisan deal, saying \"unity is not some pie-in-the-sky dream, it's a practical step to getting the things we have to get done as a country, get done together.\" If Mr. Biden cannot reach a deal with Senate Republicans, this package could still pass under reconciliation, a process sometimes used for spending measures. Under this approach, the bill would require only a simple majority to pass and would not be subject to being blocked by a filibuster. Most Senate bills require 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. This option would be used pass the Biden team's framework with only Democratic votes. Once the Georgia Senate election results are certified, there will be a 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would break any ties. With Harris as the 51st vote, Democrats will control the Senate. This legislation is likely to face intense lobbying from congressional members and special interests, which could affect the final price tag.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who will take over as the chamber's majority leader in the coming weeks, laid out Tuesday the agenda the new Democrat-controlled Senate will pursue once President-elect Joe Biden is sworn into office, setting as the first priority the approval of another coronavirus emergency relief package with $2,000 checks to the American people. Schumer detailed the issues the Senate will take up in a letter to his Democratic colleagues, which include legislation to address climate change, improve the health care and child care systems, and fix income inequality. The New York Democrat also said the Senate will also pursue immigration, democracy and criminal justice reforms.\u00a0 But topping the agenda for the Democrat-controlled Senate will be coronavirus relief legislation that includes $2,000 direct payments to Americans. Congress passed another emergency package at the end of 2020 that included $600 checks, but efforts to boost the payments \u2014 pushed by President Trump and Democrats \u2014\u00a0failed. \"As you know from our work at the end of the last Congress, the job of COVID emergency relief is far from complete,\" Schumer told senators. \"Democrats wanted to do much more in the last bill and promised to do more, if given the opportunity, to increase direct payments to a total of $2,000 \u2014 we will get that done.\" Schumer said the Senate will also provide further support for vaccine distribution and assistance for American families, small businesses, school and state and local governments dealing with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Biden, too, has vowed that another coronavirus relief measure will be a foremost priority for him once he is sworn in January 20. \"Working with President-elect Biden and our House Democratic colleagues, the U.S. Senate will finally address the major challenges facing our country that have too long been ignored,\" Schumer said.\u00a0 Democrats secured their razor-thin majority in the Senate after Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock unseated incumbent Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, respectively, in Georgia's\u00a0January 5 runoff elections. With the Senate split 50-50, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be the tie-breaking vote, giving Democrats an edge.\u00a0 Schumer will take over as majority leader as the Congress grapples with the effects of the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, during which a pro-Trump mob violently pushed its way into the Capitol building. The deadly attack led to the evacuation of both the House and Senate and has given way to questions about the preparedness of U.S. Capitol Police. Schumer said the security failures were \"unacceptable\" and pledged that the events would be fully investigated and \"every necessary security measure\" taken for Mr. Biden's inauguration inauguration in just over a week. \"The physical and emotional damage done by these domestic terrorists to the U.S. Capitol and all who lived through it was despicable. The loss of life that occurred as a result of this attack, including one Capitol Police officer, was needless and tragic,\" he said. \"As we continue to take action to address these events \u2013 including action to mitigate and hopefully remove the immediate and ongoing danger President Trump poses to our country \u2013 we must remain vigilant against potential threats and future violence in the lead up to the inauguration.\" The Departments of Homeland Security and Defense, as well as the U.S. Secret Service, are holding an all-senators briefing Tuesday on security for the inauguration, and thousands of National Guard members have been authorized ahead of the inauguration. \"The core tenets of our system of government have been challenged,\" Schumer said. 'Violence descended on Capitol Hill, the sacred temple of our Democracy. A once-in-a-century pandemic continues to devastate our nation. The work of the 117th Congress will begin in the wake of a devastating attack, on the heels of a devastating year. \" The senator said last week's riots underscore the need for Mr. Biden's nominees to key national security posts to be swiftly confirmed, including his picks to lead the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, State and Justice.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate on Tuesday advanced S. 1, the For the People Act, setting up a floor vote for the controversial bill. Senators clashed over voting rights and election procedures for hours in a contentious committee meeting to consider amendments for the massive bill. Democrats claim the legislation is necessary to counter new voting restrictions being considered by multiple states. But Republicans argued that the bill is a naked power grab, and voted down an amendment that would have made several changes to the legislation based on feedback from state and local election officials. The committee deadlocked 9-9 along party lines on whether to approve the bill. The committee can't report it out, but Senate rules allow Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to bring the bill to the floor. All nine Republicans voted against the bill, even though some amendments proposed by GOP senators had been adopted. The House approved the For the People Act by a vote of 220 to 210 in March, with one Democrat joining all Republicans in voting against it. The bill would overhaul government ethics and campaign finance laws, and seek to strengthen voting rights by creating automatic voter registration and expanding access to early and absentee voting. It also includes some measures that would require states to overhaul their registration systems, limit states' ability to remove people from voter rolls, increase federal funds for election security and reform the redistricting process. In a sign of how critical the issue is for both parties, Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell both appeared at the \"markup\" session before the Senate Rules Committee, a rarity for committee meetings to consider bills. In his statement, Schumer argued that there was a reactionary effort by states to limit voting rights, \"led by one party and compelled by the most dishonest president in American history.\" Several Republican-controlled states have recently passed or are considering legislation to restrict voting rights, in the wake of former President Donald Trump's electoral loss and a rise in mail-in voting due to the coronavirus pandemic. Opponents argue such bills disproportionately affect minority and poorer voters, who tend to support the Democratic Party. \"In the wake of the 2020 elections, deemed the most secure in American history of the previous administration, former President Trump told a lie, a big lie, that the election was stolen,\" Schumer said. \"In states across the country, Republican legislatures have seized on the big lie to restrict the franchise.\" He argued that the laws considered and passed in Republican-controlled states \"carry the stench of oppression\" and \"the smell of bigotry.\" Schumer also said that the \"price of admission\" in the current Republican Party is \"silence in the face of provable lies.\" A recent CBS News poll showed 70% of Republicans do not consider President Biden the legitimate winner of the 2020 election. But McConnell countered that Democrats were making \"hysterical attacks,\" citing the increased turnout across the country in the 2020 election. He argued the bill would let \"Washington Democrats dictate the terms of their own reelection races\" and said \"popular safeguards like voter ID would be neutered.\" McConnell said federal election bills, like the 2002 Help America Vote Act, need to be written and passed on a bipartisan basis. \"Our democracy is not in crisis,\" McConnell said, without addressing Schumer's comments on Mr. Trump's lies about the 2020 election. \"This is a partisan effort to take over how you conduct elections in our country.\" Committee Chair Amy Klobuchar, who oversaw the markup session, proposed a manager's amendment that revised several controversial parts of the House-passed bill. But the amendment failed with all Democrats voting in favor and all Republicans voting against with a final tally of 9 to 9.\u00a0 Only a few of dozens of proposed amendments have been approved, including an amendment that would examine the impact of widespread mail-in voting for active-duty service members passed with bipartisan support, and one to maintain e-voting for members of the military. Another amendment to restrict felons convicted of crimes against children to vote narrowly passed, after a contentious back-and-forth between Klobuchar and Senator Ted Cruz. Shortly thereafter, an amendment to restrict felons convicted of murder narrowly failed. Despite hours of contentious debate, most of the amendments offered by both parties failed due to the even split of the committee. Amendments that would have stricken provisions on public campaign financing and ethics reform, which have been criticized by Republicans, also failed. McConnell offered some amendments, including one to undo a provision in S. 1 that would revamp the Federal Elections Commission so that it would have a 3-to-2 split, instead of being evenly divided. Unlike Schumer, McConnell attended the meeting for most of the day. The FEC has not been able to appoint a general counsel in seven years because of the even division of the panel. McConnell argued that the current 3-to-3 partisan deadlock of the panel \"is a decision.\" \"I don't think there's any dysfunction at all,\" McConnell said. However, his amendment failed along party lines. Another amendment introduced by McConnell, which also failed, would have struck many of the campaign finance disclosure requirements. Democrats argued it's about ensuring voters know who is paying for election-related expenses, while McConnell and other Republicans said it would infringe on protected political speech.\u00a0 \"That is precisely what this is about: quiet the voices of citizens, particularly who gather together in 501(c)4s in order to express their views,\" McConnell said, referring to outside groups who don't have to disclose their donors. \"The founding fathers would be appalled, appalled to think that we're trying to prevent political discourse at the heart of the first amendment.\" Some of the provisions already in the bill are broadly popular. A Pew Research poll from April found that 61% of Americans support automatic registration for citizens who are eligible to vote, 78% support making early and in-person voting available to voters for at least two weeks prior to Election Day and 76% support requiring voters to show government-issued photo identification before voting. But county election clerks and state and local election officials from both parties have also warned that some of the bill's provisions relating to election administration would be too difficult and expensive to implement. Klobuchar's proposed manager's amendment would have revised several controversial parts of the House-passed bill. The lengthy proposal contained multiple individual amendments offered by the senator managing debate on the bill. \"We have a good bill with broadly popular positions,\" Klobuchar said in her opening statement on Tuesday. \"I urge my Republican colleagues not to disregard these efforts.\" But congressional Republicans unanimously oppose the bill, arguing that it amounts to a federal takeover of state-run elections. An aide to GOP Senator Roy Blunt, the ranking member of the committee, told CBS News that Republicans planned to \"focus their arguments on the numerous ways in which S.1 will make elections less fair and less secure\" and that Blunt \"expects a lengthy and robust debate on the bill.\" \"This is, in my view, a bad bill with bad policies that creates more problems than it does solutions,\" Blunt said in his opening statement on Tuesday. Republican Senator Ted Cruz repeatedly slammed the bill, calling it \"Jim Crow 2.0.\" Cruz falsely claimed that the bill would allow undocumented immigrants to vote, and that this would dilute the vote of citizens, thus amounting to voter suppression. \"The Democrats want to stop the voters from voting Democrats out of power,\" Cruz argued. Cruz introduced an amendment to explicitly include language to prevent non-citizens from being able to register to vote through automatic voter registration. Democrats on the committee noted that there are safeguards in the bill to prevent this from occurring, making the amendment redundant. Cruz countered that Democrats should then support his amendment, if they really believed undocumented immigrants should be prevented from registering to vote. However, it failed along party lines. Several states, including some red states, have already adopted automatic voter registration. Schumer has promised to bring the bill to the Senate floor for a vote if it advances out of committee as expected. But Republicans are expected to filibuster the bill, setting up a challenge for Democrats on how to respond to Republican obstruction of their priorities. Most legislation requires 60 votes to advance on the Senate floor, but Democrats only hold a 50-seat majority, meaning they would need support from 10 Republicans to pass the For the People Act. Some progressives and outside advocacy groups have pushed for eliminating the filibuster, which would allow for legislation to be approved by a simple majority. A new poll from Fix Our Senate, a coalition of organizations advocating for the filibuster to be eliminated, found that 50% of voters nationwide support reforming the filibuster once informed that \"under the current rules for the Senate, all it takes is a single senator to block the majority from bringing legislation to a vote by creating a filibuster that takes 60 senators to end.\" The poll also found that 46% of voters said they would feel positively if their senator supported filibuster reform, compared to 26% who would feel negatively towards their senator. According to the online poll, which was conducted in April with 1,218 people who voted in 2020, 74% of voters support reintroducing the talking filibuster, which would force senators to stay on the floor continuously to block a bill; this proposal is also supported by 69% of Republicans.\u00a0 Another proposed reform would eliminate the filibuster for certain types of bills, like those related to voting rights, which is supported by 62% of all voters. But while eliminating the filibuster outright has support from 58% of voters as a whole, only 35% of Republicans support taking this step. \"The polling affirms that when people learn what's at stake, they care more about issues like protecting our right to vote than preserving the filibuster \u2014 and a lot is at stake right now with Republicans passing egregious voter suppression laws across the country,\" Fix Our Senate spokesperson Eli Zupnick said in a statement to CBS News. However, at least two Senate Democrats have expressed opposition to ending the filibuster, meaning that the rules are unlikely to change any time soon. One of the most vocal opponents of eliminating the filibuster, Senator Joe Manchin, has also expressed skepticism about the For the People Act. In a March statement, Manchin said he believed senators should come together to work on bipartisan voting legislation. \"We can and we must reform our federal elections together \u2014 not as Democrats and Republicans, but as Americans to restore the faith and trust in our democracy,\" he said. Manchin said on April 30 in an interview with WV MetroNews that he would \"vote no\" on the bill \"as it exists today.\" On Monday, he told reporters at the Capitol that he had not looked over the changes by Klobuchar, but said he was \"open\" to hearing more and was \"looking at everything.\" Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Editor's Note: On January 13, 2022, Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes   was among 11 people who were charged with \"seditious conspiracy\" for their alleged roles in the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. Nearly 500 people have now been charged in one of the most complex investigations the Department of Justice has ever faced \u2013 the January 6 attack on the Capitol. The FBI has called it 'an act of domestic terrorism' and one group has grabbed investigators' attention for their role \u2013 the Oath Keepers. The FBI describes them as an anti-government militia movement, among them current and former military and law enforcement. Their name is a reference to the oath they took to defend the U.S. Constitution. But as we first reported this past April, unlike most other militia groups, the Oath Keepers haven't been hiding. They've been armed and in plain sight, broadcasting plans to mobilize. If you were looking for a roadmap to January 6, all you had to do was listen. Zello transmission from the Capitol on January 6: OK guys, we're on an open channel here now\u2026 These are the voices of far-right extremists communicating with each other in real-time from homes across America and on the ground in Washington\u2026 Zello transmission from the Capitol on January 6: Godspeed and fair winds to us. As some of them made their way to the Capitol. Jess Watkins on Zello, January 6: Trump's been trying to drain the swamp with a straw. We just brought a shop vac. Zello transmission from the Capitol on January 6: Stop the steal! They were talking on a phone and computer app called Zello. It's unencrypted, like a walkie-talkie, and has an international user base of around 150 million. It's popular with truckers, disaster relief groups, activists, and extremists. Zello transmission from the Capitol on January 6: Be safe, be alert, and stay in groups. Anyone can listen to Zello and Micah Loewinger did. \u00a0 \u00a0 Loewinger, a WNYC radio reporter, started working with the online extremist research group militia-watch to understand how militia groups liked to use Zello to recruit and communicate. Micah Loewinger: Leading up to January 6th we uncovered examples of militias saying things like, revolution or bust. That they were using Zello to plan their travel to Washington D.C. That they were going to have separate channels for people gathering intel and separate channels for boots on the ground. And they did. On January 6, Micah Loewinger found an open 'stop the steal' conversation going on among 100 people on Zello and started recording.\u00a0 Micah Loewinger: It wasn't until a couple days later that I started to realize how much planning must have gone into this event. And that's when I heard this mysterious woman narrating her march to the Capitol and eventually inside. Jess Watkins on Zello, January 6: We have a good group. We've got about 30, 40 of us. We're sticking together and sticking to the plan. That mysterious woman is Jessica Watkins, a 38-year-old Army veteran. She's the leader of a self-described Ohio militia group and member of the Oath Keepers. \u00a0\u00a0 Jess Watkins on Zello, January 6: We're moving on the Capitol now, I'll give you a boots on the ground update here in a few. Watkins is seen in video from the Capitol with goggles and nine other Oath Keepers in battle gear. They move in a 'stacked' military formation, methodically working through the crowd up the Capitol steps towards the doors just as the Capitol doors are breached. On Zello, others cheer her on... Zello transmission from the Capitol on January 6: You are executing citizens' arrest! \u2026as she offers a play-by-play. Jess Watkins on Zello, January 6: We are in the main dome right now. We are rocking it. They're throwing grenades. They're freaking shooting people with paint balls, but we're in here.\u00a0 Zello transmission from the Capitol on January 6: Get it Jess. Do your s**t. This is what we f***ing lived up for. Everything we f***ing trained for. Oath Keeper Donovan Crowl cell phone video: Overran the capitol!\u00a0 Jess Watkins: We're in the f***ing Capitol bro!\u00a0 For weeks, extremist watchdogs like the Anti-Defamation League, national news outlets, and journalists like Micah Loewinger had been warning of possible violence on the 6th. Micah Loewinger: If they had been paying attention to the whole network of far-right groups online that were extremely vocal and very public about what they wanted to happen, I don't believe we would have seen so many people break into the Capitol. Jess Watkins on Zello, January 6: Police are doing nothing, they're not even trying to stop us at this point. Members told us at least 40 Oath Keepers were at the January 6 rally with some seen providing security to Trump associate Roger Stone. Eighteen people associated with the Oath Keepers have been charged with federal crimes, including Jess Watkins who has pled not guilty. The Zello recordings are helping prosecutors make their case. Zello has since deleted 2,000 of these extremist channels. Javed Ali: That is just a small demonstration of capability that luckily didn't turn into a more lethal threat. Javed Ali is a former NSC senior director and was a counterterrorism official at the FBI under the Trump administration. Javed Ali: I think what makes the Oath Keepers unique and challenging, beyond the fact that they are a formal group with chapters all over the country, is that a large percentage have tactical training and operational experience in either the military or law enforcement. That at least gives them a capability that a lot of other people in this far right space don't have. The story of \"Oath Keepers\" is very much the story of this man. Stewart Rhodes in 2009: Hooah! Alright. I am Stewart Rhodes, I am the founder of the Oath Keepers.\u00a0 In 2009, in Lexington, Massachusetts, where the first shots were fired in the Revolutionary War, Stewart Rhodes founded the Oath Keepers in response to the election of Barack Obama. Stewart Rhodes in 2009: There is no expiration date on that oath. It is for life. Rhodes enlisted in the Army at 18 and was honorably discharged at 24. He went on to graduate from Yale Law School and became a constitutionalist, later warning America was on the brink of government tyranny. In 2010, he told Bill O'Reilly that it was up to current and former members of the military and police \u2013 who took an oath to defend the constitution \u2013 to stop that tyranny. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Bill O'Reilly: The Commander in Chief is the President by our Constitution. If he issues an order, are you telling people not to obey the order if they don't like it?\u00a0 Stewart Rhodes: If it's unconstitutional, yes. \u00a0 O'Reilly: So each soldier makes up his mind whether the order he's given is constitutional or not?\u00a0 Rhodes: It's a heavy burden to meet. But if you obey an unlawful order, you can also be in trouble.\u00a0 The group recruited thousands, opening up chapters across the country. They formed a board of directors and ten orders to live by, elevating themselves to 'guardians' of the republic and the Constitution, vowing to protect against mass gun confiscation and a Marxist invasion. In 2014, they took their fight to the Nevada desert. Rhodes sent armed Oath Keepers to defend the rancher Cliven Bundy \u2013 who was in a 20-year battle with the federal government about public land use.\u00a0 And in 2015, months after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Oath Keepers arrived with AR-15 style weapons saying they were there to protect businesses. But in 2016, the Oath Keepers believed they finally had an ally in the White House. When President Trump warned of an invasion of undocumented migrants, the Oath Keepers called on members to patrol the border. And this fall when President Trump warned of election fraud, founder Stewart Rhodes appeared on \"Infowars,\" conspiracist Alex Jones' talk show, setting the stage for what was to come on January 6. Stewart Rhodes on \"Infowars\": We have men already stationed outside D.C. as a nuclear option in case they attempt to remove the president illegally. We will step in and stop it. It's either President Trump is encouraged and bolstered and strengthened to do what he must do, or we wind up in a bloody fight \u2013 we all know that. The fight's coming. But for some Oath Keepers, the rhetoric was too much. Former board members told us Rhodes adopted a more violent, militia-style ideology and it was tearing apart the group.\u00a0 Chapters in Virginia and North Carolina broke ties with national well before the 6th, citing a departure from the original mission. Others distanced themselves after the insurrection, including the country's largest chapter in Arizona, where Jim Arroyo is vice president. While Arroyo doesn't think the election was legitimate, he doesn't think anyone should have stormed the Capitol. Jim Arroyo: I wanna congratulate Stewart Rhodes and his ten militia buddies for winning first place in the ultimate dumbass contest, 'cause that's what it was. That goes against everything we've ever taught, everything we believe in. It was pre-planned. It was pre-staged. Ten guys go and do something stupid and suddenly, we're the devil. In September, some Arizona members showed up armed at a Black Lives Matter protest in Prescott. Jim Arroyo told us law enforcement coordinated with him to help keep the peace. The local sheriff's department told us they didn't ask for their help. Sharyn Alfonsi: The critics of your presence there say like these are just a bunch of guys who are wannabees. And they can't wait to get dressed up and play the role. Jim Arroyo: Our guys are very experienced. We have active-duty law enforcement in our organization that are helping to train us. We can blend in with our law enforcement and in fact, in a lot of cases, our training is much more advanced because of our military backgrounds. Jim Arroyo at chapter meeting: There's nothing I love more than my AR-15 and my chainsaw and I don't know which one I like more! (laughter) Jim Arroyo invited us to a meeting to see for ourselves. The crowd, mostly retirees, meet twice a month to talk about how to survive disasters like forest fires, attacks on the power grid, and civil war. Jim Arroyo at chapter meeting: So that's why we talk about civil unrest, civil war. It's not a joke. This can happen and we need to be ready for it. Sharyn Alfonsi: Yesterday Jim said 'Do you think we're in a civil war?' And everybody nodded their heads and said yes. \u00a0 Cathy York, Gary Harworth, and Mike Rice are members. Sharyn Alfonsi: Do you all think that we are in the middle of a civil war? Cathy York: I think that we are. You've got good versus evil right now going on in our country.\u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi: Who do you view as evil? Cathy York: Anybody that doesn't support our Constitution and follow it, they're trying to change it. Gary Harworth: This country is divided right down the middle. And you're on one side or the other.\u00a0 People have to realize that when things go crazy, things get a little chaos-y around you, you have to be able to take care of yourself, defend yourself, protect your family, those you love, that's part of the Constitution. Sharyn Alfonsi: So on January 6th, when you see, these people wearing that same emblem storm into the Capitol, what was your reaction? Cathy York: Some of those people with Oath Keepers could have been BLM. They could have been-- Mike Rice: It could have been a false flag as far as I'm concerned.\u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi: You don't think they were Oath Keepers? Gary Harworth: Well, we don't know.\u00a0 Cathy York: It coulda been. We don't know.\u00a0 Mike Rice: We don't know. Gary Harworth: We weren't there. Cathy York: They're stupid people. It's stupid. We don't do that. That's not Oath Keepers. Mike Rice: How are you gonna take an oath to defend the Constitution and then try to disturb a session of Congress during what's supposed to be one of our most precious political things, you know, the transfer of power? How are you gonna do that? Jim Arroyo: I haven't had contact with Stewart Rhodes. He refuses to talk to us. Sharyn Alfonsi: Why is that? You're the biggest Oath Keepers group, why wouldn't you be talking to him. Jim Arroyo: We have made multiple attempts through national. My honest opinion is if there's any honor left in this organization at the upper levels, they will deal with it. Photos and phone records place Stewart Rhodes on the Capitol steps on January 6, communicating with Oath Keepers before they breached the doors. But no charges have been brought against him.\u00a0 Rhodes declined to speak with 60 Minutes to tell his side of the story. He did appear again in March on InfoWars, this time from his car, saying he didn't order Oath Keepers to enter the Capitol, but defended the members who are now in jail and criticized those who put them there. One Oath Keeper has pled guilty and agreed to cooperate in the ongoing investigation. Evidence suggests members stashed weapons at a nearby hotel as part of a 'quick-reaction force' \u2013 evidence a federal judge says, \"is among the most troubling he has seen.\" Sources tell us prosecutors are looking to build a case against Stewart Rhodes and possible separate charges against the national organization. Federal prosecutors are currently working on informal plea negotiations with some of the Oath Keepers who've been charged. Trials are expected to begin sometime in the fall. Produced by Ashley Velie.

And this week on FACE THE NATION, along with more access to vaccines and more money headed to people who need it most, comes more concern about Americans moving too quickly to get back to normal. With sunny states easing or in some cases dropping health restrictions completely, spring break 2021 is off to a busy start, that is for a country that's far from finished with COVID-19. According to the TSA, 1.3 million people flew on Friday, the highest day of travel since the pandemic began. President Biden's one hundred million shots administered in a hundred days challenge has been met in only fifty. Eleven percent of the adult population has been fully vaccinated, but with images like these, there's cause for concern. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: This is not over. Conditions can change. We're not finished yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because images like these are still coming in. The U.S. death toll is at over five hundred and thirty-four thousand and still rising. The Biden administration had another first fifty-day accomplishment last week--passage of the American Rescue Plan. This week the challenge of implementing it begins. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We have to get this right. We have to continue to build confidence in the American people that their government can function for them and deliver. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll check in with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Arkansas Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson. Plus, there is good news about vaccine hesitancy among minorities. We'll talk with the chair of the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, Doctor Marcella Nunez-Smith. Former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb will join us, and we'll talk with Ireland's Prime Minister Micheal Martin. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. President Biden's American Rescue Plan has been signed into law, and it is one of the largest stimulus bills in American history. Its impact particularly on low-income Americans could be significant. Traditional political party lines could also be altered. Make no mistake: Democrats support and Republicans oppose the overall package. But some provisions in the new law are long-time priorities of conservatives. We begin this morning with senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann. (Begin VT) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: For the first time in a long time, this bill puts working people in this nation first. MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): President Biden will spend this week selling his new deal for COVID America. After a year defined by loss the American Rescue Plan becomes Washington's nearly two-trillion-dollar lifeline, potentially transformative, how it expands the social safety net. Two pandemic unemployment programs will extend into September and add up to an extra three hundred dollars a week in benefits. Multi-billion-dollar hikes in housing aid, food stamps, and Obamacare subsidies. Fifty billion dollars for small business relief, and three hundred fifty billion dollars in aid to state and local governments, radioactive to many conservatives as a bailout for blue America. Despite broad public support, not one Republican in Congress voted for the package. SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: It was a multi-trillion-dollar Trojan horse full of bad, old liberal ideas. MARK STRASSMANN: Financially, the stimulus bill will also be a booster shot to the middle class and the poor. A much more generous child tax credit, and for millions of people, fourteen hundred dollars in direct payments that start going out this weekend. Under the new temporary child tax credit, income-eligible families will get up to thirty-six hundred dollars for each child under six. And up to three thousand dollars for older children under eighteen. Partial benefits could roll out as soon as this July. Roughly two hundred eighty million Americans will qualify for Washington's third round of stimulus checks, including Lyft driver Marquis Rhodes (ph) in Atlanta. Business is better, but last year his family barely dodged eviction. His family qualifies for forty-two hundred dollars in aid. That will buy peace of mind. MARQUIS RHODES: I'm not out of the woods, but it gives me a small cushion to say, okay, if something does happen, I at least have this to kind of fall back on. MARK STRASSMANN: For millions of Americans, it's also help finding hope, another casualty of this pandemic. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann reporting from Atlanta. Our new CBS News poll out this morning shows that Americans do have hope and optimism about the coming months. A record high sixty-four percent of those surveyed think efforts to contain the coronavirus are going well. The majority gives President Biden credit for how things are going, with over two-thirds saying he is doing a good job of handling both the outbreak and vaccine distribution. We go now to elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto for insight. Good morning to you, Anthony. What is driving these numbers? ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Good morning, Margaret. There's two key drivers behind this optimism: economic outlook and vaccine outlook. And they're linked. Let me start by talking about the economy. First, be-- because people think that the outbreak is going to get better over the coming months, that sixty-three percent who think so, that means for them they can go out and start doing more of the things that they want to do, gathering with family and friends, traveling, going to restaurants and bars more, even shopping. So that's pent-up demand. That's spending. That could fuel the economy. And so that, in turn, boosts optimism about businesses reopening safely, about the job market in their area, the stock market, they tell us, as well as overall optimism about the national economy. So it's as people are looking forward to doing more of those things, maybe spending more money, that could fuel that economic optimism. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, President Biden will be out on the trail talking up this two-trillion-dollar relief package he just signed. This was really passed just on a party-line vote. I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of public perception of it? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Right. That bill is extremely popular. It has been all throughout, seventy-four percent approval. Now one interesting thing, Margaret, is you don't get those big approval numbers without across the board, at least some, support from all partisan corners. So, Democrats overwhelming in-- overwhelmingly in favor. Republicans, even half of them, even though as you mentioned, it did pass on that party-line vote in Congress and independence in favor, as well. Now, why is that? First of all, it hits their pocketbook. People tell us that they think this bill is going to help them personally. That's always important, as well as, of course, the national economy. There's another component to this, too. In that they think it is going to help working class and lower-income people who, of course, tell us they've been so hard hit by the pandemic, even more so than the wealthy, always associated with high approval numbers for something like that coming out of Washington. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Popularity explains why the President's going to be on the trail taking credit for it, of course, Anthony. But I wonder how persuasive is he in convincing people to actually be willing to take the vaccine? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Well, this is that second key component, Margaret. We are seeing the trend line in willingness to get the vaccine going up. It's been going up over recent months and weeks. So, you've got a majority now saying if they haven't gotten it already that, yes, they will get it. But there are still some who are hesitant. Some on the fence with maybe, and some outright no. And one of the key things we're seeing here, Margaret, is that that is related to partisanship. You've got Democrats saying that they'll get it, you've got most independents, but there is that more reluctant-- reluctance relatively among Republicans, and in particular younger Republicans under sixty-five. So as they become eligible for-- to get the vaccine, we're really going to have to watch whether they change their minds on it. We asked them why they're still hesitant. They say, well, it's still untested while they're worried about the side effects. Some don't trust the government or don't trust the science on it. So, that's something we really want to watch. Even though I should add, we also asked and a majority of Americans give the Trump administration at least some credit for spurring that vaccine development. And here is where it all ties back to the economy, too. When people say, when are they going to feel comfortable venturing out, going out, spending more? It's when most in their community are vaccinated and when cases get even more rare. So, it's that hesitancy we're going to have to watch to see if then that economic outlook comes together, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: So goes the virus, so goes the economy. Thank you very much, Anthony Salvanto. A year into the COVID-19 pandemic, New York City has the highest per capita death rate in the country, higher than any state in the U.S. Joining us now is Mayor Bill de Blasio. Good morning to you, Mister Mayor. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-New York City/@NYCMayor): Good morning, Margaret. How are you doing? MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm-- I'm doing well, and I want to ask you about what's happening in your city right now, because we had Doctor Fauci on this program last Sunday. And he said he's very concerned about this new variant that's circulating in New York because it has shown some resistance to antibody treatments and to the vaccine. What is your health department telling you about who's getting sick and where are they? MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: Margaret, our health team is really hopeful at this point. We're-- we're vigilant about the variants. We don't take them lightly. But I got to tell you, we've now had 2.8 million vaccinations in New York City to date. That's more than the entire population of Chicago. The vaccination effort is moving very rapidly. We need a hell of a lot more supply, but it's moving. Hesitancy level is going down. So I'm really hopeful that we are going to stay one step ahead of the variant. So far our health team says, in fact, the vaccine is effective against the variants we've seen. But I'll tell you, people should not let their guard down. Until this battle is over, keep wearing the mask, keep practicing the social distancing, and let's not get ahead of ourselves. We've got a pandemic to overcome here. We all have to do it together. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are people who were infected last spring getting reinfected? MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: We've not seen a lot of reinfection, Margaret. It's something our health team has studied carefully. We know that the science regarding COVID is still imperfect. But I'll tell you the answer is just to maximize the pace of vaccination. In New York City today, we could be doing over half a million vaccinations a week if we had more supply. I think the key thing is to get us that supply-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The federal government directly provides you supplies. Is the Biden administration not giving you enough? MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: I think the Biden administration is doing an amazing job. I think it has been one of the greatest weeks in presidential history, honestly, what Joe Biden has pulled off. No, part of our problem is the state of New York. We don't get our fair share of vaccine for this city. We're vaccinating people not just from the city, but also from the suburbs, surrounding states. We need our fair share, but we don't have enough control of our own destiny. In this city and in cities around the country this is something that has to be better going forward if we're really going to reach everyone who needs the vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you what you do have control of within your city. You detected the first COVID-19 case March 1st of last year. You waited until the 15th to shut down bars and restaurants, gyms and schools. And, in fact, you tweeted yourself on March 15th telling people to go out and get that one last drink at the bar. Why do you think you were so late in understanding the threat? MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: Margaret, I'll tell you something. This is the anniversary of our first death, March 14th. We're doing a memorial tonight to remember everyone we lost and to keep their memories close in this city. But I'll tell you something, I was one of the first in America to shut schools, and one of the first in America to shut bars and restaurants. And I called for shelter-in-place, one of the first, and unfortunately, my state government wouldn't agree to it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: In fact, Governor Cuomo said shelter-in-place-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That is-- that is true. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: --would be imprisoning New Yorkers. And that's a lost opportunity. MARGARET BRENNAN: That is true. You had that dispute very publicly with the governor. But, on the other coast, San Francisco's mayor back on February the 25th declared an emergency in her city before there was a single infection. We were looking at Italy, plenty of people sick there. The writing was on the wall, at least for her. Why didn't you see it? MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: Margaret, as I said, we closed schools on the 15th. We closed bars and restaurants, tried to move shelter-in-place. But I'll tell you something, we were trying to make sure that we were working on the best health evidence while also protecting our children who needed to be in school. And this is something I've really focused on as things have gotten better-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: --keeping our schools open and bringing our schools back strong in September. This is the kind of thing we can now do with the stimulus money, thank God-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you feel responsible for that? MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: --and actually take care of our kids and families. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the former CDC director, Tom Frieden, has said that if you had acted a week earlier, you could have saved fifty to eighty percent people. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: That's just not accurate. The fact is, the thing that would have been great, the thing that would have been powerful is shelter-in-place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: When I called for it, Governor Cuomo wouldn't do it. Again, he said it would be, quote, unquote, \"imprisoning New Yorkers.\" I mean that's just outrageous. We had an opportunity. That was the missed opportunity. If I had had local control, we would have done shelter-in-place. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you want more of that local control as the governor is politically embattled right now. You were one of the first Democrats in New York to call for Andrew Cuomo to resign. Do you actually think he will do that? MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: I think he'll try to hold out, Margaret. I think he is used to getting things his way, and-- and it's been almost an imperial governorship. But I got to tell you, the folks in this state and the political leadership don't believe him anymore. He doesn't have any credibility. So I think an impeachment proceeding will begin, and I think he will be impeached and perhaps right before that he'll decide to resign. That's probably the most likely outcome right now. But I've got to tell you something. He should resign right now because he's holding up our effort to fight COVID. He's literally in the way of us saving lives right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that he and his administration deliberately tried to cover up the scale of nursing home deaths? MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: I don't have a doubt in my mind. Everything was about his public image. Everything was about his political future. It was not about what people needed. And by the way, it was about campaign contributions. The nursing home industry, the-- the big hospital systems, they gave him millions and millions of dollars and he went easy on them. And he tried to cover up for everyone. Not just him, but his donors. And I think the investigations are going to prove this, Margaret. This was a thoroughly corrupt situation and he just needs to resign so we can actually turn the page. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: And-- and look, it's an optimistic time as you started out this morning. It's an optimistic time. We got to put the past behind us. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: And Andrew Cuomo can't lead us into the future. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: We've-- we've got the people of the state ready to reopen, but we need to get him out of the way to do it. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to know about your future. Are you going to run for governor in 2022? MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: I'm-- I'm focused right now on fighting COVID and reopening our schools and bringing this city back. That's my focus. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not a no, Sir. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: Look, I'm-- I'm not worried about the future right now. We're in the middle of a war right here and we're winning that war. Let me tell you, New York City is going to come back. It's going to be a recovery for all of us, a recovery that really includes every neighborhood, people everywhere. We had the most folks ride our subway last Thursday-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: --than we had since the pandemic began. The city is coming back strong, but I'm going to make sure that everyone is brought along in this recovery. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go I have to ask you about this really troubling spike in hate crimes in New York City. It's the city with the most significant spike in crimes against Asian Americans. You have a hate crimes unit. How is this happening? Why weren't you better prepared for this? MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: Well, we created a hate crimes unit that is very strong in the NYPD and we've been doing education outreach and actually in most areas thank God, Margaret-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need to do more? MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: --hate crimes did go down, except with Asian-Americans, it's been horrendous and disgusting. So what we're doing, we have a-- a task force made up of Asian-American police officers out in communities, finding the people who did it, making sure there's consequences-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: --and holding the community close. I'd say this to all-- MARGARET BRENNNAN: Yeah. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: --Americans. Stand up for Asian-Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO: Stop Asian hate. We've got to do this together. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor, thank you for your time. And FACE THE NATION will be back in a minute with Arkansas's Governor Asa Hutchinson. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Despite demand for the vaccine outstripping supply nationally, Arkansas is one state that's expanding eligibility in order to use their supply. Governor Asa Hutchinson joins us from Little Rock this morning. Good morning to you, Governor. Before I get to COVID, I want to quickly ask you about politics. Your partner, Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, co-head of the National Governors Association, should he resign from his position? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON (R-Arkansas/@AsaHutchinson): I'm going to-- first of all, it's very important to take any allegations by the women who've come forward seriously. They have credibility. They need to be heard. I understand there's an investigation by the attorney general that should proceed. Beyond that, you know, he's a-- the chairman of the NGA right now, selected by the Democrats. And so that's within their bailiwick to deal with that issue and the people of New York. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Governor, let me ask you what's happening in your state. Our CBS polling, as you heard at the top of the show, is-- is reflecting a real partisan divide in terms of willingness to get the vaccine. Young Republicans, in particular, are resistant to it. Are you seeing that problem and how are you combating it? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: We are seeing that problem and the poll numbers are troubling because in Arkansas, it's a very pro-Trump state in terms of the last election. And-- and so we see that resistance. Whenever we are opening up eligibility for the vaccine, we're moving through it very quickly because we're not having everybody sign up to take it. What we're doing to address it is having influencers who would need to broaden that to help shape the thinking. But as more and more people get the vaccine, they see it's a way to get back to more normal life. They're excited about it. They're optimistic. So, I see those numbers changing. Sometimes someone will not take the vaccine saying, I just want to wait a little bit longer to make sure everything's okay. We're encouraging them not to do that. When it's your turn, take the vaccine. But at the same time, we're going to move through the eligibility and then we're going to have to come back and catch up because we'll probably be at a fifty percent rate. We need to get up to seventy to eighty percent acceptance rate to increase the immuni-- immunization of the vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Given that problem, why would you consider lifting the mask mandate at the end of the month? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, because we need to continue to wear a mask, socially distance until we get the vaccine widely accepted, but you can do that two ways. One is by a mandate or you can do it by public common sense. And so I didn't want to have a jump off the bridge in one moment, so we have a ramp in which we want to see what our testing, our-- our cases look like, our hospitalizations, positivity rate look like toward the end of the month. And we'll make a decision whether we can lift the mask mandate and turn it into guidance and common sense as we said. I think the time in this pandemic for heavy-handed restrictions and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: --and mandates are going by the wayside so people can make good judgments. And we expect that to happen even after March 31st if the mask mandate is lifted. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your state's going to get four billion dollars from this American Rescue Plan. Many of your constituents are going to take home these fourteen-hundred-dollar checks and thousands of dollars in tax credit. Isn't this good for your state? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, there's many good parts of the bill, and that's important to remember. There's rental assistance there for people who need it. There's food assistance in there. There's also money in there for arts, humanities. Really across the board there's increase in spending. Some of the most important elements of it would be trying to recover the lost learning in our schools over this last pandemic year. I think we've done better because we didn't close our schools, but there's still lost learning we got to make up for. So there's great investments in there. I know your previous guests, you talked about why there's Republican opposition. Well, it's just simply too large. And for a state like Arkansas, we're going to be getting more money than we had in the last CARES Act funding. We have a balanced budget. We have a surplus. And the challenging thing is that while there's so many good things in this bill, they've given us a double whammy by saying, first of all, we're going to distribute the money to the states not based upon population, but based upon your unemployment rates. That cost us three hundred and ninety million dollars. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: And then another one is that they've said that you cannot have tax cuts and take this money. Well, we were planning on giving-- reducing the sales tax on used cars, that is low income and middle income. And now we're worried about whether that's going to be prohibited under this bill. The language seems to indicate it is. So, while there's many good things about it, it is too large-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: --and we got to make sure the states have flexibility. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a former Homeland Security official in the Bush administration. At the U.S. border, right now, there are thousands of unaccompanied children in U.S. custody. Does the U.S. need to send them back or keep them here as the Biden administration's doing? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, you've got to have a stricter border policy, or those-- it's going to be a humanitarian crisis that will continue-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: --throughout this year. Unaccompanied minors is a risk to themselves, their families. So you've got to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: --have a tougher policy so we can repatriate them, but care-- MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: --for them as they seek asylum or-- or the help that they need. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We-- we've got to leave it there, Sir, because I have to get to this break. Thank you very much, Governor. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Coming up next, our conversation with COVID-19 Health Equity chair Doctor Marcellas Nun-- Marcella Nunez-Smith. Don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We learned early on in his pandemic that the coronavirus disproportionately affects communities of color. Saturday, we spoke with Doctor Marcella Nunez-Smith, the chair of the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force, about how the Biden administration plans to tackle the problem of racial health disparity. Doctor, our new CBS News poll shows that vaccine hesitancy has actually ebbed among racial minorities and that started about mid-January. We are now seeing that Black Americans are as likely as White Americans to say that they're willing to get vaccinated. Are you also seeing that shift? MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH, M.D. (COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force Chair/@DrNunezSmith/Associate Dean, Yale University): Yes, this is great news. We see vaccine confidence growing in all groups across the country. And so now the work is to make sure that people can connect with-- with vaccine when they're eligible. But it is very promising. I'm-- I'm hearing the same thing, that confidence is high. We are at a great moment. We have three vaccines authorized in the United States for emergency use and people are getting more eager to get connected with those. MARGARET BRENNAN: So is vaccine hesitancy no longer an issue? MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: You know, we absolutely have to meet people where they are, whether we are talking about vaccine confidence or really engagement with health care more broadly. You know, there are institutions, unfortunately, when we think of our history, both in terms of health care, even at times the federal government that have actively earned distrust in many communities, including communities of color. The reality is that the process has been data-driven, grounded in science, thoroughly and rigorously reviewed by independent scientists. We've had diverse scientists at every step of the way and also who was involved in the clinical trials. I'm so grateful to the scientists and the clinical trial participants. You know, over thirty percent of them identify as diverse. So these are some of the key bits of information that trusted messengers across the country are getting out. I think it's making a huge difference. We're starting to see those shifts, as you mentioned, in vaccine confidence. MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the areas where we are still seeing hesitation is, according to our CBS News poll, it is among partisan lines. In fact, unwillingness to get the vaccine is higher among Republicans, specifically younger Republicans. I'm wondering what your plan is to reach them. MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: I think one of the-- the other tragedies of the pandemic has been how it has been so politicized where we see kind of the politicization of just basic public health practice, wearing masks, which we know works and we're asking Americans to do for a bit longer. But we are hopeful and we know that the vaccine is just a clear path to getting to the other side of this pandemic. So we recognize that we have kind of unique messages for different groups. That's so important. MARGARET BRENNAN: But how do you persuade people who aren't supporters of the President? Are you going to launch public service ads here, reaching out to celebrities who may appeal to these constituents? I mean, what is the way in? MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: We are absolutely aware of the need to reach out and reach across. That is a core principle of this administration. We want to make sure we are meeting everybody where-- where they are. And to your point, we're getting ready to launch that national public education campaign and we'll work closely with trusted messengers, influencers and others to get to everyone, whether the hesitancy is-- is based in political view-- MARGARET BRENNAN: When will that be? MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: --or anything else. So we are on the cusp of launching that national public education campaign, timed really appropriately with that increased supply and vaccine that we see coming right down the pike. MARGARET BRENNAN: The administration is now going to be directly supplying vaccine doses into community health centers. What is bypassing the governors and going direct to these centers accomplish? MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: So, you know, I always say equity is a team sport. We're going to continue to work so closely and collaboratively with state and local leaders, as we have been this entire time. And there are several federal programs that directly supply vaccine and-- and all of those have been designed with-- with equity in mind from the beginning. That includes the community vaccination centers, those mass vaccination sites. And we have located those in those areas that are hardest hit using best practice to make sure people can actually overcome many of those structural barriers to get registered and get vaccinated, as well as the Retail Pharmacy Program. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what is the thought behind making doses available to dentists and podiatrists and veterinarians, new providers, here? Is the idea that you-- you know, go in for your teeth to be cleaned and you get a shot in the arm with the COVID vaccine? MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: So we're very excited to have also announced this week expanding who can vaccinate. You know, it's so important. The-- the core of this work is making sure there's more vaccine. And we have pushed on that, you know, making sure that there are more vaccination sites and venues. All the people you mentioned will be able to vaccinate and we encourage them all to go to phe.gov and sign up, see what your state needs and where your state needs you. And so the idea is that these vaccinators will be able to plug into a lot of these existing vaccination venues and give vaccination there. MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you've talked a lot about this and you've said a person's zip code is a stronger driver of health than their genetic code. Tell me what you're doing to actually get better data, because we know the CDC has reported that race and ethnicity is only available to them for about fifty-three percent of all the people who've been vaccinated. So they've only got a partial snapshot of what this country is actually doing. So, why can't the federal government get a handle on it? MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: Yeah, this is a key priority. We need better data to know where to target resources. We are working very closely, again with both providers as well as state and local health officials. We've already seen great partnerships in that space and we're seeing the-- the completeness of our data increase. The equity metric toolkit is growing. MARGARET BRENNAN: So how do you actually measure whether what you're doing is successful or not? MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: So we, again, will keep pushing to get better, more complete data around variables that are important and relevant, like race and ethnicity, and alongside that, we have been using other equity metrics. And so things like social vulnerability and zip code. And we can do those analyses now to keep track. MARGARET BRENNAN: But can't the President mandate that? MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: And we have already communicated-- I-- I think our first step in this process has been to work very collaboratively with-- with states and locals. We're working to overcome any challenges that might exist in terms of just data systems and infrastructure. MARGARET BRENNAN: If you look at the U.S. border right now, there are about eight thousand unaccompanied migrant children in the custody of Health and Human Services. And COVID distancing policies have been lifted inside of those federal facilities just because there are so many kids there. Are you concerned that this is a real health risk? MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: I-- I-- we definitely are concerned so much for the children who are there at the border for so many reasons, including health. And so this is absolutely something that as a response team we're focused on and thinking about. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the governor of Texas has said that some of these undocumented migrants who are crossing into his state are spreading the virus. Have you seen any evidence to support that? MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: You know, I have not seen any evidence to-- to support-- to support that at all. I mean, I-- I think that it's very important for us, you know, again, as we talk about our goal to vaccinate an entire nation, that we not divide ourselves in this process. You know, it's key. Vaccinations are free. We need to make them easy and convenient. And we need to make sure everyone knows that regardless of documentation, status or anything else, quite frankly, that you are eligible for a vaccination here. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Doctor Nunez-Smith, thank you very much for your time today. MARCELLA NUNEZ-SMITH: Oh, thank you so much. MARGARET BRENNAN: You can see more of our interview on facethenation.com. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He sits on the board of Pfizer as well as Illumina, and he joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Doctor Gottlieb, I want to ask you about the mayor of New York who appeared to be disagreeing with Doctor Fauci because Doctor Fauci said these new variants that they're tracking in New York City are showing resistance to therapies and to the vaccines. The mayor of New York said his health department said that's-- that the vaccine works. And, in fact, he said we're not seeing reinfection of people who've had it previously. What's going on in New York? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah. The trends in New York look concerning right now. If you look at other parts of the country where B.1.1.7, that variant from the United Kingdom that we've been watching, is becoming very prevalent. So Florida, where it's about fifty percent of infections, Texas, it's about forty percent of infections. You're not really seeing an upsurge in infections. You're seeing perhaps a plateauing, but you're not seeing this sort of fourth wave that we feared even as B.1.1.7 starts to take over. In New York City as 15.26, that new New York variant, and B.1.1.7 start to become more prevalent, you are seeing a backup in cases; you're seeing a plateauing. Hospitalizations are still declining slowly, but it's kind of plateaued. New cases are about three thousand a day. The positivity rate's about six percent. It's been that way for a couple of weeks now. And so you're seeing sort of a backup in New York that you're not seeing in other parts of the country. So there are some concerning trends. Now with respect to that new variant, that New York variant, 15.26, we are concerned about that. Right now, of the samples being sequenced that have what we call this S gene dropout, so there are samples that we're sequencing because we know they're variants. About forty percent of them are this 15.26. And New York is really the only place in the country right now that we know of where it's 15.26 is that much of the infection and about half of those cases. So half of the cases of 15.26 have the same mutation that's in the South African variant, this 484K mutation that could make the virus more impervious to our vaccines. So it is a concern. We also are seeing with the 1.351, the South African variant, with this same 484K mutation. We're seeing people get re-infected. And so whether or not that's starting to happen in New York and that explains these trends, we don't know yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's still early, but there's a lot of reasons to be concerned about the trends in New York City. MARGARET BRENNAN: From your perspective, is it too soon then for the mayor to be telling people to go back to the office in May, to be telling high schoolers to go back to school in person as soon as next week, to be going back to higher-capacity seating in restaurants? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think we're going to know in the next two weeks where the trends are heading in New York City. It's hard to know for sure which way we're going to head. But right now, the data in New York looks more concerning than other parts of the country. There's other parts of the country that have opened up liberally, have a lot of B.1.1.7 and aren't seeing the same trajectory that New York is. Now, it may just be a-- a backup, and we continue with the declines in New York like we're seeing in other parts of the country in the next two weeks, or it may be the start of an upswing. We don't know. I think the next two weeks are really going to be a critical period. I would be cautious in New York because if 15.26 is partially explaining what's going on in New York City, that could be really concerning. There's-- there's ways to explain what's happening in New York that aren't as concerning. That mean, you know, this is just sort of a temporary blip and will continue-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --on with declines and then there's ways to explain it that would cause a lot of concerns, including that 15.21-- 26 mutation. MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the hedges at the end of President Biden's very hopeful speech about COVID was these new variants. He said, we're watching them. But he did put that July Fourth date on the calendar for gathering. Is that a realistic timeline? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think it is. I think most of the country is going to look much better well before that. I think you're seeing cases decline all around the nation, even in parts of the country where 1.1.7, that U.K. variant, is becoming very prevalent. You're still seeing continued declines, albeit more slowly. I think the combination of a lot of prior infection and the fact that we're vaccinating aggressively now is enough to keep up with that and hopefully get ahead of it. So I think as we get into April, the situation around the country is going to look markedly better. But there will be pockets of outbreaks and there will be pockets where some of these variants become more prevalent that could look bad even though the rest of the nation is going to look very good. And-- and New York is one of those parts of the country right now that if you look at New York, you have some concerning trends there. Even while the other parts of the country are improving, New York does seem to be plateauing. So I think overall, the trajectory for the nation continues to look good. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been saying watch Europe as an indicator of what may be happening here. Europe's moving pretty slow on their vaccinations. Italy is looking at a lockdown over-- over Easter because of what they're seeing. Should we anticipate that's what's going to happen here? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, through this whole pandemic, we've been about maybe three or four weeks behind Europe, so we've used Europe as a barometer of what's going to happen in the United States. I think the tables have turned and I think we're ahead of Europe because we're vaccinating so much more aggressively. Eastern Europe looks very bad right now. Italy looks bad, but I think the U.K. is-- the U.S. is in a much different situation through a combination of the fact that we have a lot of prior infection, so there's immunity in the population from prior infection, and we've now vaccinated twenty-five percent of adults. We're vaccinating probably out-- about 1.5 to two million new people a day. We've vaccinated about sixty-five percent of those above the age of sixty-five, about seventy-five percent-- almost seventy-five percent this week, above those-- of those-- above the age of seventy-five. And we're seeing the-- the-- the benefits of that. And ninety-six percent reduction in nursing homes, we've had very good penetration with the vaccine. So I think we're in a different situation than Europe because of the vaccine-induced immunity that we're getting into the population. MARGARET BRENNAN: Pfizer, where you serve on the board, their CEO said this week that he's seen the vaccine blocks ninety-four percent of asymptomatic infections. Is that the final word showing that if you're vaccinated, you cannot spread the virus? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's an important data point; and this comes out of real-world evidence from Israel and all of the evidence across all the vaccines now is pointing in the direction that these vaccines reduce asymptomatic infection and reduce transmission. We've always believed that they're having that effect. We didn't know the full magnitude of that benefit. But all of the incremental evidence coming out suggests that the impact on a reduction in transmission could be quite strong. And, if that's the case, the vaccine creates what we call dead-end hosts, a lot of dead-end hosts, meaning people will no longer be able to transmit the infection. And just like you get exponential spread on the way up in an epidemic, if you can get a whole bunch of immunity in people where they can no longer spread the infection, that has a compounding effect on reducing the scope of the epidemic. So if, in fact, this vaccine has a substantial impact on reducing transmission, it's going to become a very important public health tool in controlling the epidemic. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you for your analysis. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Last year Ireland's prime minister did travel to Washington just before St. Patrick's Day, but the formal celebration was canceled due to the pandemic. This year, that meeting with President Biden will be virtual. Taoiseach Micheal Martin joins us now from Dublin. Good morning to you. MICHEAL MARTIN (Irish Prime Minister/@MichealMartinTD): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden-- MICHEAL MARTIN: Good to talk to you. MARGARET BRENNNAN: Great to have you here. The Biden administration has renewed that ban on travel from Europe, including Ireland. And I wonder, given progress with the pandemic, do you expect it to be lifted perhaps this summer? MICHEAL MARTIN: Well, that depends on, you know, we're-- we're-- we-- we're similarly have significant restrictions on travel into Ireland and, indeed, across Europe. As the vaccination program rolls out, I believe opportunities will arise, but it's just far too early to say yet. And particularly in the context of the summer, we have a significant journey still to go in terms of vaccinations and in terms of keeping the virus down, because, as you know, in some member states of the European Union now the numbers are going back up because of the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 U.K. variant, which is much more transmissible. MARGARET BRENNAN: You just gestured to the fact that the EU is-- is significantly behind in vaccinating its own citizens, and that includes your constituents. When you meet with President Biden this week, will you ask him for vaccine supply from the U.S. stockpile, since that's a big issue? MICHEAL MARTIN: Well, I think I'm not aware of too many countries that are giving their vaccines away. I think more critically, we will obviously discuss COVID and we'll discuss vaccination. The critical point, I think, for all of us to-- to bear in mind is the fact that this is a joint enterprise in terms of vaccine development and vaccine production. These companies, J&J, Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca, they're all partnerships between U.S. and European companies and-- and involved companies that have global-- integrated global supply chains. So different component parts of vaccines are-- are developed in different parts of the world. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the New York Times reported that the Biden administration had denied a request from the European Union to loan out AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses to the EU. Will you ask President Biden to reconsider that? MICHEAL MARTIN: Well, I think the-- the whole-- that whole issue around AstraZeneca, there's been significant difficulties between AstraZeneca and Europe in terms of AstraZeneca fulfilling its con-- contractual commitments to Europe, and they haven't been in a position to do that and have fallen very far short of what they committed to Europe. But as I say, you know, I'm not preempting any discussions I will have in detail with the President, but obviously the broader COVID vaccination issue will, of course, be discussed. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tensions have been spiking in Northern Ireland, as you know. The British government has not been honoring all the terms of its divorce from the European Union. Now, you also have Northern Irish paramilitary groups saying they're temporarily withdrawing support for the Good Friday peace agreement due to other complications. Are you going to ask President Biden to intervene or appoint an envoy? MICHEAL MARTIN: Well, first of all, we-- I would be thanking President Biden for his steadfast support of the Good Friday Agreement and of peace in-- in Ireland. And-- and I'd also be thanking the friends of Ireland and the vice president and Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the consistency of their support for peace in Ireland. And that has been positive in terms of influencing, you know, the-- the journey of Brexit itself. And we do, you know, we knew Brexit would create challenges, would-- and it-- and it has. It-- it hasn't been easy. And Brexit is only two and a half months old since Britain has formally now exited the European Union. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need U.S. help with that? MICHEAL MARTIN: Yes, we-- we want to see a continuation of the-- the President's interest in Ireland in support of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement and also of upholding the-- the Brexit agreement itself. And I have no doubt that the President will continue that interest and will use his good offices and the administration's good offices to bring the right outcomes here. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that a nice way of saying you need him to lean on Boris Johnson to stick by his commitments? Because as a candidate, Joe Biden said the U.K. wouldn't get a trade deal unless they honored the peace deal. MICHEAL MARTIN: Yeah, and-- and in-- in fairness, as I said, the support of-- of President Biden in recent times and throughout the years has been influential and it's been effective. You know, we also in Ireland here have to work on a post-Brexit relationship with the United Kingdom and we're doing that. And I get on well with Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and we will be working out issues post-Brexit. We have to develop a stronger structure now for British-Irish relationships in the aftermath of Britain leaving the European Union. But part of that whole relationship is the U.S. engagement and connection, because I'm-- having been involved at the time of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, I'm under no illusions about the significance of the American involvement and engagement with all sides and-- and all traditions and all perspectives on the island of Ireland and with the United Kingdom. MARGARET BRENNAN: Any indication if President Biden will visit Ireland in June? MICHEAL MARTIN: Not yet, but when I spoke to him in November, I invited him to-- to Ireland and he just said to me, try and keep me out. So that-- that means it's a live possibility. At any stage, it's a live possibility that President Biden could arrive on our shores. And I can tell you he will be most welcome because we really appreciate the warmth that he has for Ireland. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Taoiseach, thank you very much for your time. Happy St. Patrick's Day. MICHEAL MARTIN: Happy St. Patrick's Day, Margaret. Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Seven states are poised to lose a congressional seat based on shifting population figures, according to\u00a0apportionment counts released by the Census Bureau\u00a0on Monday, which could potentially tilt the balance of power in the House of Representatives in the 2022 midterm elections. Congressional seats are apportioned based on a state's population, and each state's share of votes is determined by the number of representatives in their congressional delegation, meaning that the results of the 2020 Census will have far-reaching political implications. California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia experienced static growth or population losses in recent years, resulting in their loss of congressional seats. Democrats currently hold an extremely narrow majority, and will have a tough fight to hold onto control in 2022. Historically, the president's party loses seats during the midterm election in his first term \u2014 Republicans took control of the House from Democrats in 2010, and Democrats regained their majority in 2018. The challenge to keep their majority will be complicated by the changes in apportionment. Twenty-five states utilize an independent, bipartisan commission to draw their congressional districts, or have split chambers of legislatures in charge. But in the other 25 states, there is single-party control of legislatures which will determine how the maps will be drawn \u2014 18 controlled by Republicans, and seven by Democrats. California and Michigan have their districts determined by an independent commission. New York has an advisory commission that will provide a recommended map for the legislature \u2014 but their advisory map is nonbinding, and the Democratic-controlled legislature may not choose to follow its advice. Pennsylvania has a divided government, with the legislature controlled by Republicans and a Democratic governor. Governor Tom Wolf can veto a map if it's gerrymandered, or drawn by the legislature to be politically advantageous to Republicans. Democratic lawyer Marc Elias and the National Redistricting Action Fund filed three lawsuits on Monday in states with divided governments: Louisiana, Minnesota and Pennsylvania. They argue that courts should be used as a backup to draw lines, in case legislatures can't agree on a map in time. \"While these are the first lawsuits of this redistricting cycle, let me make it plain: these are not going to be the last. We are prepared and ready to use every legal tool available to make sure that new maps do not unfairly treat voters,\" Elias told reporters on Tuesday.\u00a0 Illinois, Ohio and West Virginia have single-party control, meaning that their maps are more likely to be gerrymandered along partisan lines. Redistricting will force incumbents to run in more politically competitive districts. In Pennsylvania and Texas, several incumbent representatives in swing districts already face challenging reelection fights. In New York, some House Democrats that lost their 2020 reelection, such as Max Rose and Anthony Brindisi, have not ruled out a 2022 run in potentially more Democratic-friendly seats. Although Pennsylvania's Wolf has veto power over the congressional map, the Republican legislature will likely try to find a way to apportion districts so that Democrats lose at least one seat. This could occur by incorporating more red counties into blue-leaning districts, making it more difficult for a Democrat to hold onto their seat with an influx of Republican voters. Meanwhile, in Illinois, Republican representatives could see their districts could become bluer, and a loss of a seat could mean one less Republican in Congress. Because of the confusion caused by redistricting, other members of Congress may choose to run for statewide office rather than try their luck in a newly reapportioned district. Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, a Democrat, launched his Senate campaign Monday, the same day the Census Bureau said his state would lose a congressional seat. Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin has already launched a campaign for governor in New York. Meanwhile, several other states are gaining congressional seats, but this could spell even more trouble for Democrats. Population growth in Texas, North Carolina, Florida, Oregon, Montana and Colorado will result in added congressional seats to these delegations. Texas, North Carolina and Florida each have Republican-controlled legislatures and GOP governors who will be able to approve a map that is favorable for them. Oregon is controlled by Democrats, and Montana's districts are drawn by a commission. \"We're going to win redistricting. What does that mean? It means we're going to ensure that the rules and procedures are followed to maximize our opportunities,\" National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Tom Emmer said in February. States under single-party political control that have seen demographic change, such as Texas, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina, are at the \"highest-risk\" for gerrymandering, according to a report by the Brennan Center. \"As we redistrict Texas for democratic representation, we must not allow the leftist ideal of representation by population to rule the day,\" Texas GOP Chair Allen West said in a statement Tuesday. \"Representation in Texas must be based upon citizenship, and strategically we can ascertain why the left wants to flood Texas with thousands of\" undocumented immigrants. Some Republicans were anticipating more districts to be added in Texas and Florida, as well as Arizona, which kept their same number of seats.\u00a0 Seven seats will shift among thirteen states, the smallest shift since 1941. Districts that encompass urban areas tend to be safely Democratic, and there are swing districts in counties surrounding cities. For example, the Republican legislature in Georgia could split up the swing districts around Atlanta, consolidating the bluer parts into one safely Democratic seat and allowing for another seat to be skewed towards Republicans. North Carolina had to redraw its congressional and state legislative districts in 2019, after a panel of three judges ruled it was \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that past districts were \"extreme partisan gerrymanders\" that benefitted Republicans.\u00a0 But two recent Supreme Court cases in the past decade have made gerrymandering easier. In 2013, the justices ruled in Shelby County v. Holder that a section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 regarding federal approval on redistricting plans no longer applies. And a 5-4 decision in 2019 on a case involving claims of partisan map drawing in North Carolina and Maryland kicked the question of the legality of partisan redistricting to state legislatures. The House races will also be affected by the change in timeline for releasing population data. Normally, the apportionment data would have been presented by the end of 2020, but the deadline was delayed due to the pause in data collection during the coronavirus pandemic. The bureau instead set an April 30, 2021, deadline for apportionment data to be delivered to states, and more specific data for redistricting has to be sent to states by the end of September. The delay in data has meant that states with constitutional or statutory deadlines have considered moving candidate filing and primary dates. Twelve states require redistricting to be completed this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Thirteen other states have constitutions which state that redistricting must be completed by the year after the census is conducted \u2014 effectively the end of 2021.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Wednesday pitched his $3.5 trillion tax and spending plan to boost social programs and fight climate change, dubbed the \"Build Back Better\" agenda, after the Senate passage of the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill.\u00a0 But in remarks at the White House, the president started off by noting his administration is monitoring increases in gas prices and inflation, as the federal government announced Wednesday that prices have jumped\u00a05.4% in a year, a 20-year high. Prices in July rose 0.5%, down from June's rate of 0.9%, and the cost of things like used cars and rental cars remains very high.\u00a0 The attention from the president is an indication that the White House, which at times has downplayed inflation and high gas prices as temporary, recognizes the need to publicly address the pinch on American families. The president said the Federal Reserve is keeping an eye on inflation to act if needed. Mr. Biden blamed price spikes on shipping bottlenecks and the consolidation of major agricultural corporations, while Republicans blame the trillions of dollars the U.S. has pumped into the economy in the wake of the pandemic. The president noted the bipartisan infrastructure bill doesn't increase gas prices, but recognized that the increase is touching American families. According to AAA, the average price of a gallon of gas in the U.S. is $3.19, compared to $2.17 a year ago. \"I want to make sure that nothing stands in the way of oil price declines leading to lower prices for consumers,\" Mr. Biden said from the White House East Room on Wednesday. \"So today, my director of the National Economic Council has asked the chair of the Federal Trade Commission to use every available tool to monitor the U.S. gasoline market, and address any illegal conduct that might be contributing to price increases at the pump while the cost of a barrel of oil is going down.\"\u00a0 The president said the U.S. is also urging the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, better known as OPEC, to return oil production to pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0 Republicans have been railing against the Biden administration over inflation and gas prices, issues they could use against him and House Democrats if they remain high ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Republican members of Congress have focused on inflation as a key messaging topic.\u00a0 After addressing inflation and gas prices, the president turned to his social spending plan, insisting it's a \"long-term investment in American families\" that will reap dividends. \"The investments I am proposing will be fully paid for over the long term by having the largest corporations, including the 55 corporations that paid zero federal tax last year, and the super wealthy begin to pay their fair share,\" the president said. \"They will still make a lot of money, but pay their fair share. That means it will actually reduce the national debt. It will improve our fiscal position over the long run.\" The Senate passed a\u00a0$1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill on Tuesday, with 19 Republicans joining all 50 Democrats to approve $550 billion in new spending on things like roads, bridges, waterways and rural broadband. Senators then held a marathon session to debate a budget resolution that paves the way for the larger package, adopting the measure in a party-line vote of 50-49 early Wednesday morning.\u00a0 The House plans to return to Washington this month to consider the budget resolution, among other things, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said the House will not vote on the $1 trillion infrastructure package until the Senate finalizes the $3.5 trillion plan, which could take months. The Senate went into recess after Wednesday's votes and plans to return September 13. The $3.5 trillion measure serves as the blueprint for Mr. Biden's social spending agenda, and will include funds to combat climate change, establish child care programs, expand Medicare and provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Democrats can pass the measure using a process known as budget reconciliation, which would not require the support of any Republicans.

            "article_content": "A democratic socialist candidate running her first political campaign is expected to become the next mayor of Buffalo, New York, after a stunning primary upset over the city's longest-serving mayor. India Walton, 38, would be Buffalo's first female mayor and the first socialist mayor of a major American city in six decades. The Associated Press on Wednesday morning called the Democratic primary for Walton, a nurse and activist who was supported by the Democratic Socialists of America and the Working Families Party. Walton defeated Byron Brown, the incumbent who has led the city since 2006. Brown, who was running for a fifth term, did not concede, citing the absentee ballots that had yet to be counted. But the Associated Press said the number of outstanding ballots wouldn't be enough to close the gap of Walton's 7-point lead. Walton is virtually guaranteed to be elected in the November general election, since there is no Republican challenger.\u00a0 Walton declared victory on Tuesday night and a Buffalo News reporter captured her calling her mother to break the news: \"Mommy, I won!

Madam Mayor!\"\u00a0 Walton's career path is not a typical politician's. She became pregnant with her first child at 14 and dropped out of high school, then worked at McDonald's before getting her GED. She served as a public schools nurse and a representative for the 1199 SEIU health care union, and was a leader in the city's Black Lives Matter and racial justice protests last year. \"My story is remarkable, but not uncommon,\" Walton told\u00a0CBS Buffalo affiliate WIVB Wednesday morning. \"And I just want to be the example for people like me that you can do whatever you set your mind to.\" She ran on a progressive platform that included removing police from most mental health emergency calls, reallocating some police funding to other city services, creating the city's first comprehensive climate action plan and declaring Buffalo a sanctuary city for undocumented immigrants.\u00a0 Walton would be the first self-identified socialist to become a big city mayor since Frank Zeidler, a socialist who was mayor of Milwaukee from 1948 to 1960.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The House is expected to approve President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal later this week in a party-line vote, after the House Budget Committee advanced the bill on Monday. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced Tuesday evening that the House would vote on the legislation on Friday.  Although the narrow Democratic majority in the House will likely pass the bill as is, it's unclear whether a provision raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025 will be included in the final Senate version of the legislation.  The bill, which includes $1,400 in direct payments to Americans making under $75,000, extra money for vaccine distribution and funding to state and local governments, was approved by the Budget Committee on Monday by a vote of 19 to 16. Congressman Lloyd Doggett was the sole Democrat to join Republicans in voting against the bill, although a spokesperson for Doggett later said in a statement that his \"no\" vote was a mistake and he \"supports the COVID-19 relief legislation.\"  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters on Tuesday that he believed the final bill would be passed by March 14, which is the day that enhanced unemployment benefits established by relief legislation passed at the end of last year are set to expire.  \"We're going to meet that deadline,\" Schumer said, adding that the final bill will be \"not exactly the same, but very close to the bill that President Biden proposed.\"  Republicans have balked at the price tag on the bill, and expressed consternation that Democrats are using a process known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, which will allow it to pass in the Senate without any Republican votes. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy slammed the bill on Wednesday, calling it \"too costly, too corrupt and too liberal.\"  \"I haven't seen a Republican yet that found something in there that they would agree with,\" McCarthy said.  It is easier for bills to pass along party lines in the House than it is in the Senate. Most legislation needs 60 votes to advance in the Senate, and Democrats hold a narrow 50-seat majority, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting any tie-breaking vote. Budget reconciliation would allow for Democrats to pass the bill with a simple majority.  However, there are strict rules for utilizing the budget reconciliation process, such as the \"Byrd rule,\" which requires that all provisions in the bill be budget-related, and must not increase the federal deficit after a 10-year budget window. Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough, who advises the Senate on procedural matters, will have to rule on whether the $15 minimum wage can be included under the Byrd rule.  Senate Democratic and Republican staffers are expected to meet with the parliamentarian this week to make their arguments for and against including the minimum wage provision.  \"We're going to await her judgment before we go any further,\" Schumer said Tuesday about MacDonough.  However, even if the parliamentarian rules against including the minimum wage, Senate Democrats could take the controversial step of waiving that decision.  But if MacDonough does rule that the minimum wage hike can be included in the final bill, that provision has faced pushback from Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, complicating the prospects of it passing in the Senate. Manchin has suggested amending the legislation to instead raise the minimum wage to $11.  \"$11 is the right place to be,\" he told reporters on Monday. \"Throwing $15 out there right now just makes it very difficult in rural America.\"  Schumer told reporters that Democrats had \"great unity\" since taking the majority in January, adding that he had spoken to members of his caucus about the importance of passinga. relief bill.  If the minimum wage provision was excised from the relief bill, it's possible that the Senate could reach a compromise on a separate bill raising the minimum wage. Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Tom Cotton introduced a bill Tuesday to raise the minimum wage to $10 an hour by 2025. However, the bill includes stricter penalties for employers who hire undocumented immigrants, which would likely be a poison pill for most Democrats.  Raising the minimum wage is widely popular, with a 2019 poll by the Pew Research Center showing that 67% of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15. It even has support in some red states, as demonstrated by a ballot initiative in Florida to increase the minimum wage increase to $15 by 2026 which passed with support from more than 60% of voters in the last election. Progressive Democrats may opt to take a hard line on the minimum wage increase, and refuse to support the bill unless it includes a $15 minimum wage, creating a showdown with more moderate members of the party.  \"Why don't we ever ask moderates to compromise?\" progressive Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna asked in a tweet on Monday. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the House Progressive Caucus, said in a tweet on Monday that raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour \"IS COVID relief.\"  Senator Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee, has repeatedly expressed confidence that the parliamentarian will rule in favor of allowing the minimum wage hike, and that it will pass in the Senate with support from all Democrats.  \"I think the Democrats are going to support the president of the United States and the overwhelming majority of the American people want to pass this COVID emergency bill,\" Sanders told reporters on Monday. \"I think we're going to pass it as is.\"  Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "London \u2014 Amid scenes of frantic Afghans clinging to airplanes to try to escape the Taliban, some European leaders said this week that they would work to prevent migrants and refugees from journeying to the continent without permission. Europe \"should not wait until people stand at our external border. We need to help them before that,\" European Union Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said Wednesday, adding that some people in immediate danger should be resettled within the EU, but \"it's important that we can help these people in Afghanistan, when possible, to return to their homes. We also need to help neighboring countries and support Afghanis and these neighboring countries in the region.\"  Johannsson also said that Afghans whose asylum claims are rejected in Europe should not be deported back to their country right now. \"We must anticipate and protect ourselves against major irregular migratory flows that would endanger those who use them and feed trafficking of all kinds,\" French president Emmanuel Macron said on Monday. He said Europe would coordinate with transit countries like Turkey. \"We should not send the signal that Germany can take in everyone in need,\" the leader of Germany's Christian democrat party, Armin Laschet, said. \"The focus must be on humanitarian aid on site, unlike in 2015.\" Many European countries have become increasingly hostile to migrants and asylum-seekers in recent years. That trend was partially a response to when, beginning in 2015, more than a million migrants and refugees traveled to Europe on foot or by boat, many of them fleeing the war in Syria. Since then, many countries have tightened border controls. Leaders who welcomed asylum seekers at the time, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have faced political backlash. Germany and France,  the EU's two biggest economies, both have elections coming up soon. \"We've seen this populist wave that has spent day after day, month after month, year after year demonizing refugees and migrants. That has certainly had an effect,\" Daniel Balson, advocacy director for Amnesty International, told CBS News. \"It's had an effect in the United States, it has had an effect in Europe.\"  Last week \u2014 before the Taliban took full control of Afghanistan \u2014 Austria, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Greece and Germany urged EU leadership to continue sending Afghan asylum seekers whose claims were rejected back home.  \"Stopping returns sends the wrong signal and is likely to motivate even more Afghan citizens to leave their home for the EU,\" the countries said in a joint letter to the European Commission. The United Nations has called for a moratorium on deportations and Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands have since changed course, halting deportations to Afghanistan in the wake of the Taliban's dramatic retaking of power. But Austria is urging the establishment of deportation centers in countries close to Afghanistan as an alternative to allowing Afghans whose asylum claims are rejected to remain where they are. \"It's not just about Merkel and Macron saying, 'we're not going to take refugees.' They've been acting on that over the course of the previous multiple years,\" Amnesty's Balson told CBS News. \"We should take them at their word.\" People from Afghanistan were already the second-largest group of asylum-seekers in Europe, with 570,000 having sought refugee status in the European Union since 2015. Those numbers had been increasing in recent months, since it became clear that the United States was committed to a wholesale withdrawal from the country. The United Kingdom is the only European country to have committed to taking a significant number of additional Afghan refugees thus far, but the government says it will do so over a five-year period. The plan is to welcome 5,000 Afghans immediately and resettle a total of 20,000 over time. Critics say the plan doesn't go far enough, with a Scottish parliamentarian urging British lawmakers on Wednesday to double the figure. Canada has also committed to resettling 20,000 refugees. But Balson said it was likely that Afghans who cannot get permission to leave through an official resettlement program will try to leave by land, fleeing to neighboring Pakistan or Iran, the latter of which has already started setting up emergency tents along its border, according to Al Jazeera. For many, those countries would not be intended final destinations, but likely first stops on long, dangerous journeys to try to reach European soil. \"People are going to look to get out any way they can,\" Balson told CBS News. \"Those who have money will look to take a plane out... One of the things that the Biden administration can do is secure the airport and protect it for as long as possible and grant landing rights and landing privileges to planes that already have been organized by either non-governmental organizations or other organizations to get people out.\"  He also called on the international community to put pressure on Afghanistan's neighbor countries to keep their borders open.   \"None of us can predict the future, but it would be ridiculous to say that no one can foresee a huge need for refugee assistance on Afghanistan's borders in the near future,\" Balson told CBS News.

            "article_content": "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Hamdullah Mohib, national security adviser under former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, that aired Sunday, December 19, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: It has been just over four months since the Taliban seized Kabul and American troops pulled out of Afghanistan. The WHO estimates one million Afghan children under the age of five will die of starvation this winter. When Kabul fell, the elected President Ashraf Ghani, fled along with his closest aides, including his National Security Adviser, Hamdullah Mohib. Mohib is with us now for his first interview. It's good to have you here.\u00a0 HAMDULLAH MOHIB: Thank you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you in Washington? MOHIB: Well, I'm here to see people, friends and colleagues, former colleagues to talk about what happened and what to do next and how to help our people. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are looking for a role in Afghanistan? MOHIB: No.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: What are you trying to do to help? MOHIB: Well, like you said, people are still starving, and our responsibility to the Afghan people has not ended. It's- we're not- no longer the Republic, the Islamic Republic that serve the people. But I feel like we still owe it to the Afghan people to make sure that this suffering ends. MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot to get to with you. Let's start on what happened. The war was a strategic failure for the United States. The withdrawal was chaotic. It was deadly. It was a political crisis for this president. President Biden puts the blame, though, squarely on your government. Do you accept any of that blame? MOHIB: Look, there is enough blame to go around. Obviously, the Afghan government and the people responsible for running the Afghan government are- are responsible, but so are our partners in the international community, and we all have a blame to share. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say those running the government, you mean President Ghani, who you served, and yourself? MOHIB: Myself included. Absolutely, yes. We all have blame to share. I think it's important to see why and where it started. You know, there are- there is a lot of focus on one day on what happened in one day, instead of broadening and saying, \"What led to the decisions that were made that day and why we had to be- we had to choose to make those decisions? And why were those decisions so narrow? I mean, why- what happened and what led to it?\" And I would like to talk about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about that day.\u00a0 MOHIB: Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: When you left Kabul and the broader issue. But I want to address something that the president of this country told the American people when he was speaking about Afghanistan. Listen. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Afghanistan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometimes without trying to fight. We gave them every tool they could need. We provided close air support. We gave them every chance to determine their own future. What we could not provide them was the will to fight for that future. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of that assessment, did you lack the will? MOHIB: Absolutely not. The Afghan people made tremendous sacrifices for Afghanistan. I think it's- it would be dishonor to take that away. What happened was the rug was pulled under the Afghans' feet. The decision to talk directly and engage the Taliban and make a deal with the Taliban that didn't include the Afghan government was protested \u2013 myself, in this city, about what was going to happen to our government, what was going to happen to us-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That was the U.S. agreement under the Trump administration with the Taliban that the Biden administration honored. MOHIB: \u2013 Exactly. And those decisions- that decision to talk directly to the Taliban without the presence of the Afghan government and then the full transparency with the Afghan government led to the collapse that happened on- on August 15th. For three years, our hands were tied behind our back. We were not allowed to fight. There was no offensive in 2018 and 2019. The Trump administration's policy that was the South Asia strategy was doing wonders. It was helping us push the Taliban back. In 2019, there was a whole offensive planned to push the Taliban, and it would have given us a part to, not a total military victory, but given us close to getting what we wanted \u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Taliban was gaining control in parts of the country. MOHIB: \u2013 No. MARGARET BRENNAN: They were gaining ground.\u00a0 MOHIB: 2019, we started taking- pushing Daesh out of the east, eastern Nangarhar. There was no fighting in Kunar, in the- in the north, the offensives were planned and then- and then that's when the support stopped. So we stopped receiving the kind of support that was necessary to be able to continue those offensive operations. In 2020, when the deal was signed, there was no offensive on the part of the Afghan government. We were told if you announce an offensive against the Taliban, you would be seen as warmongers, and the Taliban continued to strike the Afghan security forces throughout the country. They had an agreement to say there will be no attacks on city centers and district centers, but all of the outposts around the city and district centers that were protecting it were being targeted, and our hands were tied. We were not- we're not able to- to announce an offensive that year. In 2020- 2021 all they had was district centers left. So from 2019, the collapse of the Afghan government started. In 2020, it gained momentum. In 2021, it was the end. They were at city centers fighting. I think the Afghan security forces fought bravely and defended what they could. But when- when there was no more, when nothing was left, including the supplies of their ammunition, we ran out of all kinds of ammo for our air force. We didn't have any kind of laser guided missiles anymore. And so they were our aircraft were grounded and we didn't have the close air support that we needed from the international community, including the United States-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You are talking about now under the Biden administration? MOHIB: This is this year, this is 2021. Our- our fixed aircraft, a fixed wing aircraft, didn't have the ammunition necessary to be able to- to fight. So I think- and when the contractors withdrew, or the contractors were withdrawing from- they- they were doing everything for the Afghan war from a logistical perspective that there was still a huge amount of dependency. The Afghan security forces could fight, but only when they had everything they needed. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what you are talking about is unpacking years of strategy, bringing up to this point. I want to go to the day. You say there's too much focus on it, but I think we have to talk about it first. You were known as President Ghani's closest aide. Where is he now? MOHIB: He is in the UAE. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it true that the Emirati government has told him and has told you that you can't be involved with politics any longer? MOHIB: No, in\u2013 if we are living and we are hosted by the- in the government of the United Arab Emirates, they don't want any political activity and that's their- that's their rule. Yeah. So while we are there, we would have to respect their policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your last day in Afghanistan was on August the 15th. That was the day that the Taliban seized control. They were already in the city. By the end of the day, they had seized control. Did you have any idea when you woke up that morning that you would be fleeing the country?\u00a0 MOHIB: No. MARGARET BRENNAN: When did\u2013 MOHIB: In fact, the night before, my staff contacted me and asked if we would- if we should start shredding and burning sensitive documents, and we, I didn't believe that it would be so, so soon. We still thought there's two more weeks. And the Taliban had at least two more weeks until the U.S. presence in Kabul, and we had received the day before a briefing from our chief of army staff. Plus, he was accompanied by Admiral Vasely. And, you know, the charge de' and the chief of station in Kabul. And so they, you know, our chief of army staff said that he had fully coordinated with the Americans, and that they will be able to defend Kabul, so much so that there were even plans to push back from Kabul against the territory that we have lost. But by this stage, we had several cities and provinces around Kabul that were still under Afghan government control. We had Nangarhar, we had Laghman, we had Wardak. These are provinces that are around- around Kabul. But by that morning, by four a.m. that morning, we had lost all of those provinces, plus a key district in Kabul, Sarubi, that was gone to the Taliban. In the night before, the Taliban even tried to break into Pul-e-Charkhi prison, which is inside now, all- inside Kabul city. But it was previously in Deh Sabz district, one of the districts. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you woke up that morning knowing that the Taliban is essentially knocking on the door of the capital.\u00a0 MOHIB: Correct.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: When did you decide to flee? MOHIB: Well, about 2:30 pm. The decision\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? MOHIB: By that stage, I was supposed to leave to Doha to- to- to be part of the negotiating team. But the news that came in at that point made me understand that we no longer have- no longer have a consolidated force, and based on the discussions I have had with the president before that, if the fight comes to Kabul and it's a fight that we have to do inside Kabul cities- city, we would no longer do that fight. MARGARET BRENNAN: Just for- for those watching: in Doha, Qatar, there are negotiations happening, led by the United States, with the Taliban trying to have a peaceful transfer of power. That's where you were headed. MOHIB: That's where we were headed. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But then what changed? MOHIB: I- I heard from- first of all, all day long, we were getting news and the situation was getting worse, because the forces, the consolidation of forces had no longer been in- in- in the say, in control. There was no single power to control it. Most of them had abandoned their posts. Kabul was a city that was not ready for that kind of fighting. It was a city and its security forces could do crimes. But they weren't ready to fight against the Taliban in a battle- in that. So we- we saw the police and many other forces abandoning their posts and not turning up to work that day. But what happened at 2:30 was that I got the news that two helicopters, one that was part of the president's fleet, was hijacked by a rogue ANDSF element. And then another was shot.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: A rogue soldier? MOHIB: Yes. And another was shot, another helicopter that was supposed to go and pick up the- the minister of defense was shot. And based on what had happened the week before, another- and when Herat fell, the leadership that was present there, including Ismail Khan and the deputy chief, the deputy minister of interior, were not allowed to fly by ANDSF to evacuate to Bamiyan. I understood that this is the end, that even the airport is no longer secure for- for the Afghan president or anyone else around, and the fight is now going to be inside the city. And that was the time when I have made that decision. Obviously, it is difficult for- for people who don't know the context to be able to understand, you know what, what transpired. But we had taken every step possible to see whether there was the possibility of resistance outside of Kabul, even if it- it came down to it. And all of those possibilities were eliminated. And that was the only thing left that the president could do to save lives and to ensure that there were still American troops left to be able to secure, because they were in the negotiations. It wasn't the Afghans that were negotiating anymore. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you- at 2:30, you walk up to President Ghani and you say what? MOHIB: I tell him, \"It's time to leave, sir.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?\u00a0 MOHIB: Because there was no other decision left for him to do. Right?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think would have happened if you'd stayed? MOHIB: Well, fighting would have ensued. We had- we had two weeks, we could have continued fighting inside Kabul, destroy most of the city, and thousands of people\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: Who would have been fighting, though? You're describing forces melting away. MOHIB: Forces, well, whatever forces were left. We so- we did this in Helmand, for example. For two weeks, a very small area was under Afghan government control and the forces fought bravely. We had a few special forces fighting, and they were- were they were provided with air cover, both by the Americans and our Air Force, and they were all able to hold for two weeks. But what transpired was that Helmand turned into the kind of pictures you would see coming out of Aleppo. Thousands of families were displaced from Lashkar Gah. Some went to Kandahar. Most came to Kabul. We, in the end, had to then make a deal to- to evacuate the forces that were there, so that this would have been a repeat of Helmand in Kand- in Kabul, but on a much larger scale. Because here you know, this is a city of five million people and now even more crowded because of all the refugees, internally displaced people that have come from other parts of the country out of war. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, you are harshly criticized, as is President Ghani, for choosing to flee that day. MOHIB: We had to make a decision that was right for Afghanistan. MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you take with you on that plane? You know, there's been allegations of corruption and that money was taken. MOHIB: Look, those are allegations that our people know no person with the right mind would believe. The decision to leave was a very last minute decision. In other- other president's trips, there would be a lot more resources that- that would support a trip. We didn't even carry anything like that because this wasn't- this wasn't \u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't take cash with you?\u00a0 MOHIB: Absolutely not. No.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you take with you? MOHIB: We didn't- we just took ourselves. Most of the people that came on that flight ended up having to, you know, having- didn't even have another- a change of clothes. So in- in- in Uzbekistan and in the Emirates, even for the president, we had to buy him a change of clothes in Termez-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is where you went next?\u00a0 MOHIB: Which is where- yeah--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You took helicopters from the presidential palace to another country-- MOHIB: Correct.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --to Uzbekistan-- MOHIB: To Uzbek-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --to- to flee.\u00a0 MOHIB: To Termez.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: There are reports that you had to fly at low altitude because you were trying to avoid the Americans knowing that you were fleeing.\u00a0 MOHIB: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?\u00a0 MOHIB: Trust was gone. There was no trust. MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you think the Americans were going to do? MOHIB: Well, look, you know, for those of us that were there and present, I had asked the Americans for something simple the day before. And it was a test, to say, if this deal doesn't work out \u2013 I was working, negotiating a deal that would have a transfer of power to the Taliban \u2013 and if this didn't work, would we be rescued? And the response was noncommittal. MARGARET BRENNAN: You asked the United States-- MOHIB: I did.\u00a0 BRENNAN: --to help you evacuate from Afghanistan?\u00a0 MOHIB: If this deal didn't work, would that be the case? There were intelligence reports, both from Afghan sources, the Americans and a- a- a- an independent, that the plan for- by- not by the Taliban, their sponsors was, they wanted Ashraf Ghani's head. And it's embarrassing enough to have lost our country. We're not going to lose another president; be embarrassed like that in Afghanistan and be killed. There was- there were all precautions made. What we tried to do was to see if there was anywhere that the president could go and resist and continue to be in Afghanistan. But that- that- that was no longer possible. We- we had hosts in mind to be able to go and continue from there. But the forces there had already melted away and there was no possibility of him going anywhere. And then, about on the 12th, I consulted with the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Interior and the chief of NDS, our National Directorate of Security. And- and we evaluated where there was a possibility to do any kind of resistance in another province. We considered Panjshir as well, and the Minister of Defense was clear that it is not going to be possible to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: There was no safe place-- MOHIB: Now-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --in Afghanistan for the president to be?\u00a0 MOHIB: There was no safe place. Absolutely. Unless he wanted the war to continue, unless we wanted to see a civil war return. I grew up at a time when- when Kabul was under Civil War, when there was power factions trying to control, and they didn't. And- and- and millions of Kabulis were displaced. I know the misery they lived under in Peshawar, where I was, the- and how derogatory terms were used to call us all the refugees. We were not going to bring that back on the Afghan people, and what was being discussed in Doha was nothing less than a surrender. And if it is a surrender, why take two more weeks and risk the lives of millions of Afghans and- and then in the end do exactly the same thing anyway? MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but you know that the argument is now that had you had a peaceful transfer of power, instead of the Taliban taking it by force, that we wouldn't have children starving to death in Afghanistan right now, because money would have still poured in to this new government, even though the Taliban was part of it \u2013 that international aid organizations would be able to provide food, oxygen and hospitals--\u00a0 MOHIB: What is stopping that from now- from happening now? MARGARET BRENNAN: United States and the world having sanctions on the Taliban.\u00a0 MOHIB: Well, why? The question is, if we were to give the Taliban exactly what they wanted, then you know, the legitimacy given by the president, but for a surrender? You know, this is not an argument. This doesn't make sense to me.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is--\u00a0 MOHIB: In any way. In any way.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the Biden administration would argue, and many Afghans, that there was a very narrow sort of window of opportunity, where in those final weeks, President Ghani could have negotiated an exit that would have avoided the situation and the chaos that ensued. Was there a deal on the table? MOHIB: There was no deal on the table. This is an excuse. Look--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: This is what Secretary Blinken, on this program, said it was there, that he spoke to President Ghani on- on August the 14th. He thought he had a deal and the next day, Ghani fled. MOHIB: I was-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what he says.\u00a0 MOHIB: I was closely involved in that negotiation. And you know, in fact, you know, I worked out the terms with the Americans on what would be that peaceful transfer of power. It was not going to happen on August 15. It was going to happen when we still had multiple provinces under Afghan control and we still had a consolidated force. The Taliban that day were all over the city and we didn't have, like I said, a consolidated force to keep the order. And the Taliban statement was conditional. It was you, the government, is responsible for order in the city, and the people who were breaking the order were also the Taliban. And them sitting in Doha knew that time is ticking. Two weeks more, two more weeks in the end and- and the Americans are out, they could do whatever they wanted to do. The language used by the Americans now for the government, formation of the government was no longer inclusive. It was none monopoly. The word none monopoly. And you take what you want to from that. But that basically means a surrender to the Taliban.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhmm.\u00a0 MOHIB: And maybe the Taliban could include one or two people and there was no specifications of it. What is stopping that from happening now? What was stopping that from happening two weeks before, or August 15, whenever was- the deal was, when the Afghan government was not there to negotiate that, and our partner for negotiation was the United States? The Taliban hadn't even agreed to- to meet with our team. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's been reported you received a text message from one of the Taliban leaders that day on August 15.\u00a0 MOHIB: Correct.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the Haqqanis. What did he say? What did he propose? MOHIB: Surrender. He said you issue a statement of surrender and then we negotiate. I told him that's not how it works. You negotiate first and then we will see what the outcome of that negotiation is. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did the U.S. tell you to take that meeting?\u00a0 MOHIB. No. I contacted at the time, Tom West, and I told him that I had received a call. We were discussing at the- at the time negotiations, whether we go to Doha and do this negotiations, and I said, \"Well, there could be this opportunity. Should we do this negotiation internally? I could take it.\" And he said he consulted and called me back and said, \"No don't take that meeting.\" You know \u2013 couldn't trust that that was in good faith. MARGARET BRENNAN: How many people made it onto these helicopters when you fled the palace? MOHIB: Well, whoever was left at the palace, the palace grounds had vacated\u2013\u00a0 had by most people that were working there. And on the day, not even physically, some people even left the security coordination group that we had at the NSC. They left the WhatsApp groups as well. So whoever was left in, we thought, was still present on the palace grounds vacated-- with us. There were about 11 people and then the rest were security. Some were left behind because they-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Your secretary was left behind.\u00a0 MOHIB: Yes, including- some were left behind because there was no room on the helicopters. It was a hot day, and it could only take a certain amount of load. And so the number of people were exceeding what the helicopter's capacity was. So one of them, one of the helicopters, had to be disembarked by some people, including my personal security and my secretary. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the Biden and Trump administration's envoy to the Taliban, Zalmay Khalilzad, the former ambassador who was on this program recently, said the US should have pressed President Ghani harder to make concessions so that there was a peaceful transfer of power. He told my colleague Michael Morrell, that Ghani insisted until the very end he would not leave until a successor was decided in an election. It was late, and Ghani was making demands as if he had won the war rather than he was losing the war. What he is describing is delusion.\u00a0 MOHIB: Mm-Hmm. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were his national security adviser. Did you ever say to him, \"Mr. President, the Taliban is coming to power, whether we like it or not, we have to take a negotiated deal.\"? MOHIB: Look, we-- until the last day and the day before, even the day before, when the decision was made that a team from the Republic would go and negotiate with the Taliban. There were two things that Dr. Abdullah, who was leading the peace efforts, and former President Karzai asked President Ghani to- to get the Americans to guarantee. One what- that the Taliban would talk to this negotiating team, this team and agree to a power sharing, or an inclusive government, that a negotiation would actually take place, and that until that negotiating- negotiation is complete, the Taliban are not to enter Kabul. I think the distance between the Republic, not the president alone, the distance between the Republic and the Taliban was great. The Taliban wanted every- they wanted the return of their Islamic Emirate and wanted the Republic gone completely. And then the Republic wanted to include the Taliban as part of its big circle. And that was the stand that President Ghani was representing. Yes, he wanted elections because he felt that that would be the way he hands over power, but he's not wrong to think that he was being, he was being assured in every meeting, on every statement that the international community wants to see a democratic Afghanistan, a sovereign Afghanistan, an Afghanistan that's at peace with itself and its neighbors. So we had these four things to look forward to in the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States says President Ghani just wanted to stay in power.\u00a0 MOHIB: Well\u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's it. He did not want to negotiate his exit.\u00a0 MOHIB: This was never- this was never clear. If the- if the United States or any other power came and said that we would like to see- we are happy to see a Taliban government, and the rest of it could work with it- with that. That conversation never happened. There was never an open, honest conversation with the Afghan government in which these, uh, clarity- that this level of clarity that came in\u2013\u00a0 after post collapse never was- was a place. There wasn't a U.S. secretary of state or a national security adviser, anyone higher, that has come to Afghanistan, spent a day or two. This is a mission in which we have both shed blood together, made tremendous amount of sacrifices and is worthy of protection \u2013 to- to spend a day or two, talk with the president and key leaders in Afghanistan to say, here is what the Americans want to do, right? You're right, we didn't read the writing on the wall. The writing on the wall was that a withdrawal will take place no matter what. We thought that the preservation of the last 20 years, the last two decades mattered, and that is where we, we, we, we, we misunderstood. Had that discussion been- taken place, to say the United States no longer can afford \u2013 and it would have been totally understandable \u2013 can no longer afford to stay in Afghanistan and wishes to cut a deal, and we would like you to come on board. Then, we would have been able to make a sensible decision about what the future was. Not the way it was \u2013 President Ghani wrote to President Trump and told him if this negotiation, what Zalmay Khalilzad was leading, is about a withdrawal, would\u2013 negotiate with us, that would give us a fighting chance. Not with the Taliban. MARGARET BRENNAN: When President Biden announced in April that he was going to pull out U.S. troops by September \u2013 you know he pulled that back a bit, but just a few weeks \u2013 your government said you respected the decision. What was your real reaction? MOHIB: It wasn't a decision we were consulted about.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNNAN: How much advance did you get?\u00a0 MOHIB: What would a government respond to say at that time? We still wanted to see American support, and it was important that we keep that going. MARGARET BRENNAN: How much advance notice did you get from the Biden administration before the president announced on television that he was withdrawing? MOHIB: Maybe a few hours MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 A few hours?\u00a0 MOHIB: Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Who told you? MOHIB: The decision was announced. I don't exactly remember who called. But we were informed just a few hours. I think Secretary Blinken called and talked to the president, and supposedly the decision would have been- announcement would have been a bit later. But as is in Washington, once a decision is made, it leaks to the press very, very quickly. So a few hours after we were informed it was already in the media.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: For the Biden administration, they argue they were clear throughout. They accepted the Trump administration's negotiated deal with the Taliban. The president ran on a platform of pulling back. How did you miss that writing on the wall? This was a campaign promise from President Biden. MOHIB: Well, this was also a campaign promise by- by- by Trump. This was not- you withdrawal- the withdrawing from Afghanistan is not what we had an issue with, and we still- I still think that it could be- it could have had other result. I wish that things were done differently. The timing was of extreme- of extreme importance, and the resources left behind were important. So the decision I think made in April, we respected it and we thought, you know, there would be other enablers that would support, for example, the contractors. Contractors were critical to the survival of the ANDSF\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: These were Americans or other workers who were helping basically to- to service \u2013 MOHIB: Correct. They were- they were providing fuel. They were providing ammunition. They were providing, in some cases, food supplies and uniforms. A whole lot that the the- the- the security forces needed. Even the software that was being managed to pay the Afghan security forces was run by a- by a contracting company.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And this all starts disappearing. MOHIB: So all of this is to be withdrawn. And then the panic that ensued is because of this. The-the panic in the Afghan security forces at the point when they stopped fighting is, they were- there were some that were not getting paid in time. There were others who didn't have all the right ammunition and fuel. And it started to panic that this is- And then the Taliban obviously use this as an opportunity to- to do enough propaganda to their advantage. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, there's a lot of criticism of the Ghani government and how you handled this, either not persuading the administration to change their mind or to change how they carried it out. President Ghani himself has been described as sort of living in a bubble. Reading books on the grounds of the palace while the country is disintegrating. MOHIB: I think, you know, everyone, including myself, have our own problems. That doesn't mean that a government collapses,and it doesn't come down to one person. This was not a mission that was just out of\u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But was he out of touch with reality on the ground? MOHIB: That was- it was not a mission that was President Ghani alone. We had a republic. We had a parliament, we had members, you know, a government that had a lot of stake in- in other leaders in Afghanistan. We had media, civil society. Everyone played a role in keeping and preserving the the Afghan government. And it, when it came down to it, is- is the dependency that we had on the international security presence, one, but the enablers and the financial support for them more, more so. And so, you know, I-I've never read, and I would never believe that just because President Ghani read books led to the collapse of the state\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but their criticism that he was\u2013 MOHIB: I think that's a lame excuse. Whoever presented it- presents it. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the criticism is that he was out of touch with reality, that he was living in a bubble, that there was corruption and ineptness within the government. You're the national security adviser. You're the one who gives him the hard news, \"We have to go.\" Did you ever give him the hard news, \"Mr. President, we have to agree to negotiate our exit here because the Americans are gone. They're leaving us.\" MOHIB: Okay. Let me tell you that, you know, President Ghani received hard news every second of the day. Afghanistan was at war. Every minute we lost an Afghan across the country. There was no good news. I have never gone to President Ghani and told him, \"Here is some good news.\" Or for that matter, anyone else to-to issue him good news. It was just bad news all along. We were a country at war.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: When you came here to the United States in June, this is just months before the pullout, you went to the White House, you went to the CIA. It was front page news in American newspapers that the U.S. intelligence assessment was that the government could collapse within six months. Did the United States government ever tell you that to your face? MOHIB: Well, we received some of this information. And I remember a security briefing about three or four weeks before the collapse, or perhaps even less than that, in which there was a timeline. And I-I asked what it meant, and it said that that is where we-we-we believe that the end Taliban would enter Kabul. It was an- it was vague. It was not a very clear response, whether they believed that-that would be the fall of Kabul, or that would be the time when the Taliban surround Kabul. But there was also a lot of belief that the Afghan security forces would- would be able to defend Kabul for some time. It- it wasn't anticipated how quickly the morale fell, and once the morale of the security forces was gone, they were not ready to fight a battle that they were- they knew were going- they were going to lose. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you ever ask what happens if this diplomatic effort fails? MOHIB: Well, uh, this was a big part of the whole discussion when the president came to Washington. It was about whether the Afghan government will continue to have support. Whether the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces will continue to have their support. And we were assured was, the Afghan government will continue to receive the security assistance. That is, the ANDSF will continue to receive some additional equipment, that it- that was previously promised, and that they are working on- on over the horizon support for ANDSF, for maintenance and other needs of- uh, uh-\u00a0 that were previously being done through Kabul- MARGARET BRENNAN: This was what the CIA director and the president of the United States are telling you?\u00a0 MOHIB: Well, this is a discussion overall. I think this is, you know, the specifics of each discussions varied. With, of course, the intelligence, the discussion was about threats and what this- what level of threats would be emanating if there was a total Taliban victory, and what- what it is that they would- wanted to see. I think, you know, overall, the discussion was about the Afghan government will continue to have the support of the United States going forward, and we hoped that a peace settlement would happen before the US withdraws. But it was not certain that that is what will happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now there is, as we talked about, no money flowing in to Afghanistan because the Taliban are now running the government. Do you think if you had stayed, That it would have made a difference?\u00a0 MOHIB: No. If the condition was that a Taliban government be in place, there would have been a Taliban government in place just two weeks later. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So you don't feel a sense of responsibility when you hear about what the UN is saying \u2013 that this is going to be a bleak winter of starvation?\u00a0 MOHIB: Absolutely! Of course I feel responsible. I feel responsible now and I feel responsible then. I think what- what the outcome is is unfair to the Afghan people. A decision was made to include and be able to have- to see the Taliban in government, right? And- and- MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States, the Biden administration agreed to what the Trump administration agreed to, which was the Taliban's coming back into power. MOHIB: When that decision was made. I think it was important to make assumptions about how there will be collaboration with- with that government in place, and how we're going to deliver aid to people that are in need without, if there is a time where there is no direct cooperation with them. I think there was- there was a chance to do that when, and- I have never seen any insurgency with whom ministers, foreign ministers have met. And the Taliban themselves told me when we were negotiating or were trying to negotiate directly to say that they have foreign ministers lined up waiting to meet with them. There is no need for them to talk to the Afghan government. They considered themselves in 2019 a government in waiting. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Because the United States\u2013 \u00a0 MOHIB: And if that was the case- MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013had signed a deal with them?\u00a0 MOHIB: And if that was the case, if they were a government in waiting in 2019, and the international community met with them - every day, there was a meeting with the Taliban, advertised no secret meetings, advertised meetings, public meetings with the Taliban \u2013\u00a0 you know, it would have been important to discuss how this aid be delivered back then.\u00a0 And now I think it's also important that, you know, whatever has happened, it's still important that we reach to those people in need and find ways, be creative about how do we- how we support the Afghan public. They are the ones that are suffering now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you saying you believe the United States is responsible for the Taliban's return to power? MOHIB:\u00a0 I think, you know, things could have been done differently. I wish things were done differently. There could have been a different outcome to this process had Ambassador Khalilzad decided to bring the Afghan government into confidence and be transparent about the negotiating- negotiations process, I think we would have seen a different Afghanistan today than we- what we are witnessing right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the Taliban's ties with Al Qaeda? Do you believe that Afghanistan will once again become a harbor and haven for terrorists? MOHIB: I have been on the record that there is no distinction between the Taliban. I think the international community and many distinguish between terrorist groups in silos, as if al Qaeda is separate to Daesh or Taliban. I- I believe they are all part of the integral network, and they all uh, uh attract from the same pool, and they believe in the same- in the same ideologies and outcome. It may have different political structures, but it is all the same. We have seen time and again proof that an attack conducted by ISIS was actually facilitated by the Haqqani network. So the distinction between al Qaeda, Taliban and ISIS is very difficult in an environment like that. And Al Qaeda, particularly with the Taliban, has been so close they have intermarried and they're- it would be impossible to separate al Qaeda from Taliban. MARGARET BRENNAN: So should all the billions of dollars in money that is being frozen right now be released into use in Afghanistan? How do you do that without putting money in the hands of the Taliban and al Qaeda? MOHIB: Well, I think that's where we have to be very creative, but creative about how how money is flown into the hands of the Afghan people, not the Taliban. It would be impossible that the Taliban benefit- not benefit from some of that. I think I have already seen the Taliban using aid given by NGOs to people as propaganda, as if it was coming from them. So whether it's WFP or any other agency that provides that aid to the Afghan people, that the Taliban would not try to use it to further strengthen their hand in Afghanistan. But- but there must be ways where we don't do that physically. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you want to work on that issue now? MOHIB: Well, I'm trying to assist in any way, any way I can for my people, at least to raise awareness about what needs to be done and whatever we can to help our people. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think your biggest mistake was? MOHIB: I think, you know, not seeing that writing on the wall about the withdrawal probably is one of the biggest. We should have understood that the United States and- has made its decision and- and would withdraw under any circumstances. And I think that probably is one of the- one of the reasons we weren't able to secure another outcome. MARGARET BRENNAN: You felt that you were going to have the United States change its mind based on conditions on the ground? MOHIB:\u00a0 No, I felt- I felt that our partners, the United States- the United States included believed in a democratic Afghanistan, a place where we were going to preserve the gains of the last 20 years. I thought those gains meant something. MARGARET BRENNAN: Hamdullah Mohib, thank you for your time today. MOHIB: Thank you for having me.",

This morning on Face the Nation, we begin a week President Biden said will determine the course of his presidency and whether Democrats maintain control of Congress. At the G20 summit in Rome, President Biden found it easier to broker agreements with other countries than his own party in Congress. He ended a costly tit-for-tat with Europe over steel tariffs and brokered a plan to block corporations from shopping around the world for low tax rates. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going to continue together and prove to the world that democracies, democracies are taking on hard problems, delivering sound solutions. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But significant national security challenges from adversaries like Iran still loom. (Begin VT) QUESTION: When would you like talks with Iran to resume? JOE BIDEN: They're scheduled to resume. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Dire projections for a warming planet make the work at his next stop, a U.N. climate summit, even more challenging, as experts warn, the very survival of our planet is at stake. We will hear from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo. Back at home, Democrats in Congress are still tangled in tough negotiations over President Biden's massive spending proposals, which the president gave a final push to before leaving for Europe. (Begin VT) QUESTION: Do you have the support of all the Democrats? JOE BIDEN: I think we're going to be in good shape. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will hear from California Congressman Ro Khanna, a leading progressive pushing colleagues on the left to stand together. We will also talk with Congressman John Curtis about bipartisan support for rebuilding America's roads and bridges and his effort to get fellow Republicans to help limit the damage from climate change. Then: On the COVID front, vaccinations for younger children could be available in a matter of days. We will talk with pediatrician Claire Boogaard, who oversees the COVID vaccine program at Washington, D.C., Children's National Hospital. Plus, current and former presidents weigh in on the gubernatorial race in Virginia. What's at stake for Democrats and Republicans? We will have a preview. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We begin a consequential week in Washington, with lawmakers eying votes on two key bills that make up President Biden's domestic agenda, while he also pushes to revive American leadership abroad. Overseas, this morning, the challenge of how to survive on a hotter planet faces world leaders at the G20 summit. The president also discussed other national security threats with often troublesome ally Turkey's President Erdogan. With much of the rest of the globe still fighting COVID and seeking access to a vaccine, recovering from this pandemic is a challenge for the economy and a slow global supply chain. The increasingly tense relationship with China is at the heart of all of it. And Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who's traveling with the president, met today with Chinese officials for the first time since his tense confrontation with them in March. We spoke with the secretary earlier and began by asking him when the U.S. will resume negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. (Begin VT) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Well, the Iranians have now said that they're coming back to talks toward the end of November. We'll see if they actually do. That's going to be important. We still believe diplomacy is the best path forward for putting the nuclear program back in the box that had been in under the agreement, the so-called JCPOA. But we were also looking at, as necessary, other options if Iran is not prepared to engage quickly in good faith, to pick up where we left off in June, when these talks were interrupted by the change in government in Iran. MARGARET BRENNAN: Other options, does that include military? ANTONY BLINKEN: Well, as we always say, every option is on the table. But here's what's important. Iran, unfortunately, is moving forward aggressively with its program. The time it would take for it to produce enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon is getting shorter and shorter. The other thing that's getting shorter is the runway we have, where, if we do get back into compliance with the agreement, and Iran gets back into compliance, we actually recapture all of the benefits of the agreement. Iran is learning enough, doing enough, so that that's starting to be a problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran carried out a drone attack on U.S. forces in Syria just last week. Friday, the U.S. announced sanctions related to this program. Do you think sanctions are going to stop Iran from trying to kill Americans? ANTONY BLINKEN: The president is very much prepared to take whatever action is appropriate at a time and place of our choosing, by whatever means are appropriate, to prevent and stop Iran from engaging in these activities, or its proxies engaging in these activities. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk about climate and the international efforts underway. The U.N. says that not a single major economy in the world, U.S. among them, is living up to the targets set back in 2015 in that Paris accord. America is one of the biggest polluters. The president's own domestic agenda faces some uncertain prospects here. How do you lead when America doesn't have its own house in order? ANTONY BLINKEN: Well, we are leading on this. The president significantly increased our own ambitions and announced a new so-called nationally determined commitment in terms of what we will do to make sure that we get to net zero. And John Kerry has been leading our efforts around the world to bring other countries along to raise their ambition, so when we get to Glasgow in just about a day's time, the world comes out together with much stronger commitments that actually get us on the path to keeping to warming that does not exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. We are not there yet. We have a lot of work to do, a lot of work to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: But these international -- right. And these international commitments don't have teeth. ANTONY BLINKEN: Well, these are voluntary -- these are voluntary commitments, but there is, increasingly, I think an understanding that we're seeing every single day storms, droughts, all sorts of natural occurrences that have been exacerbated by climate change, conflict driven by climate change, refugees driven by climate change, fights over resources driven by climate change. This is not tomorrow's problem. This is today's problem, and I think there's a much greater consciousness of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you look around the world, the use of fossil fuels is only going up. Europe is facing a potential winter fuel crisis. China has an electricity shortage right now. Here in the United States, the president has called for OPEC to produce more oil. The projection is global energy consumption will jump 50 percent by 2050. These facts seem very much at odds with the things you're describing as ambition. The rhetoric sounds out of step. ANTONY BLINKEN: We're pushing very importantly in the other direction. For example, here at the G20, again, with American leadership, we are pressing to get an agreement to make sure that countries don't finance coal projects internationally. This is one of the biggest drivers of emissions around the world. But you're right. We have to actually do -- do what we say and make sure that others that have not made the necessary commitments, including China, now the world's largest emitter, actually step up and do the right thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: What incentive does China have to act right now? They seem to be increasingly an adversary of the United States. ANTONY BLINKEN: Well, I think the number one interest is in not being a world outlier. Their own people would benefit dramatically from China taking the necessary steps on climate change. So would the international community. To the extent that China cares about it's -- how it's seen in the world, it also needs to think about stepping up. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Afghanistan. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, who resigned this month as your envoy, was on this program last Sunday and told us that more could have been done to prevent the collapse of the government in Kabul, including pressing President Ghani harder. Should you personally have done that? Should you have been tougher? ANTONY BLINKEN: I was on the phone with President Ghani on a Saturday night, pressing him to make sure he was ready to agree with the plan we were trying to put into effect to do a transfer of power to a new government that would have been led by the Taliban, but been inclusive and included all aspects of Afghan society. And he told me on the phone he was prepared to do that, but, if the Taliban wouldn't go along, he was ready to fight to the death. And the very next day, he fled Afghanistan. So, I was engaged with President Ghani over many weeks and many months. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think you did everything you could? Is that what I hear you saying? ANTONY BLINKEN: Listen, one of the things we're doing at the State Department is reviewing everything that we did over -- going back to 2020, when the agreement was initially reached with the Taliban under the under the previous administration, including the actions we took during our administration, because we have to learn every possible lesson from the last couple of years, but also, by the way, from the last 20 years. This was America's longest war. President Biden ended the longest war. He made sure that another generation of Americans would not have to go to fight and die in Afghanistan. And I think, when all of this settles, that's profoundly what the American people want, and is in our interests. Meanwhile, we are doing everything we can to make good on our ongoing commitments, including to Afghans at risk that we want to help. And we'll also learn every lesson we can from the decisions we made. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, thank you for your time today. ANTONY BLINKEN: Great to be with you, Margaret. Thank you. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the secretary of commerce, Gina Raimondo. She's the president's liaison to the business community. Madam Secretary, welcome to Face the Nation. GINA RAIMONDO, U.S. SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. Supply chains around the world have been massively disrupted over the past few months. We have all of these bottlenecks. Why haven't the ports, why haven't the truckers, why hasn't this become unstuck? GINA RAIMONDO: Yes, good morning. So, this is, as you say, a top issue for Americans. It's a complicated -- complicated issue. I mean, last year during COVID, we shut our economy down. You know, I was the governor at the time. We shut down Rhode Island's economy. We have never seen that before. So that meant factories closed. People went home. You can't just turn the economy back on overnight. So, it takes a little bit of time. I will say we are making progress. You know, due to the president's leadership, we now have the ports open 24/7 and the two largest and busiest ports. MARGARET BRENNAN: But there are reports that those -- while the president announced the 24/7 opening, that that's not actually happening out in California, that there are still backups. The business community has been complaining about that. GINA RAIMONDO: There are backups. And, as I said, this isn't something that can be fixed overnight. But the important thing is, fundamentally, supply chains and logistics are run by the private sector. People say to me, will Christmas gifts be delivered, to which I say, call FedEx? That isn't what the government does. What we are doing, and the president is committed to this, we're using every tool in our toolbox to be supportive, to help, to unstick the ports. An area that I am very focused on is the semiconductor shortage. We are leaning forward into that, increasing transparency in the semiconductor supply chain to make sure that we do everything possible. But this is a direct result of COVID. It is temporary. And we are working every day to unstick these supply chains. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what you just brought up regarding a shortage you say the government does need to do something about here, that tech companies are really worried about these long-term supply chain issues. Apple said $6 billion in lost sales because they can't get goods in time here. So, in what the president just put forward in Build Back Better, this framework, it has money set aside, a manufacturing credit for chip production. What does this actually do? How quickly does this fix things? And do we need a mandate for domestic production? GINA RAIMONDO: Absolutely. So, America invented the semiconductor industry. We started that industry right here. At one point in time, we made in America all the chips that we needed to consume. But over time, over the past several decades, that has left our shores in search of cheap labor in Asia. Now we find ourselves extremely vulnerable. And so what the president is saying is, we ought to get back into the business of making chips in America, which will, of course, create jobs and... MARGARET BRENNAN: How quickly? GINA RAIMONDO: Well, Congress needs to act. This is a fund that will come to the Department of Commerce. It's a $52 billion set of incentives to rebuild the domestic supply here. The day after Congress passes this, it can come to us, and we can get to work. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you -- just to button that up, are you mandating domestic production? Are you close to that? GINA RAIMONDO: We're not -- no, we're not mandating. No, we're not mandating domestic production. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because a prominent Republican senator I'm sure you read, an op-ed, had something to that point this week, Josh Hawley. GINA RAIMONDO: What we're doing is, we are working in partnership with industry to incentivize domestic production, right? We want to make chips in America, so we are incentivizing companies to do that, creating jobs every step of the way. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things that you do hear complaints from -- from retailers, from other people in the business sector is that the vaccine mandate, not a problem with the mandate, per se, but claims that putting it in place at this time around the Christmas season will back everything up, that they might have labor shortages as it comes to rolling this out. The White House, Jeff Zients, the vaccine czar, so to speak, said there's some flexibility around these deadlines, that they're not a cliff, and the rules are being finalized soon. How soon? Do you need to push this off until after Christmas? GINA RAIMONDO: No, I think that would be a big mistake. People want to work in a workplace where they feel safe. You see United Airlines that was among the first to do the mandate, there, number of folks applying for jobs is through the roof. The best thing we can do to get people back to work is to make sure everybody is vaccinated. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. GINA RAIMONDO: So... MARGARET BRENNAN: But can you push that until after Christmas? You announced the rules... GINA RAIMONDO: It would be a mistake. It would be a mistake. You see, in the third quarter -- you know, this year we're on path to have the strongest GDP growth in decades. We had a blip in the third quarter. Why? Delta, Delta variant. The quicker everyone gets vaccinated, the better our economy will be back on track, the quicker everybody gets back to work. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the president's framework agenda here. The U.S. has -- as you know, because you're passionate about this, paid family leave, we don't have it in this country. The president promised it was coming. It's not in this framework. That was a concession he made. You have said this is so essential to getting the economy going. How disappointed are you that that was just given up? GINA RAIMONDO: I am unbelievably excited that we are on the precipice of passing the most significant piece of domestic legislation in 50 years, public pre-K, broadband for every American, massive investments in childcare. As a woman, as a working mother, I know how essential this is. You know... MARGARET BRENNAN: But you said paid leave was essential to get women back into the workplace, and that's not in this. GINA RAIMONDO: Paid leave is essential too. And we will continue to fight for that. No -- I don't think anyone ever expected the president would pass his entire domestic agenda in the first 10 months. MARGARET BRENNAN: It looks like he's trying to pass most of his domestic agenda in the first 10 months, and this is not in it. (CROSSTALK) GINA RAIMONDO: This is not in it. And... MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the argument, though, throughout this from Democrats, has been, if not now, when? This is a unique, historic opportunity. It has to go on now in this big bill. And this is something you were so passionate about. GINA RAIMONDO: And I am still passionate about it, but... MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is not going to happen if Democrats lose the majority, is it? GINA RAIMONDO: I don't believe that's going to happen. Again, the president's package, which we believe will be passed very soon, probably hopefully this week, provides tangible improvements to people's lives, better roads, better bridges, better airports, broadband for everybody, child care, public pre-K. It is historic. Then we get to work continuing to fight for paid leave. You know, we're not backing away from it. It is necessary, but nor should we take away from the monumental nature of what is in this package. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will talk about the prospects for a vote with a key progressive up next. Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Congressman Ro Khanna. He's a Democrat from California and a leading member of the House Progressive Caucus. Congressman, good morning to you. REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard Secretary Raimondo said that this legislation, the Build Back Better program, is going to pass this week. That's really in the hands of progressives like you. Are you a yes-vote on both this and the infrastructure bill? RO KHANNA: I am. The president has shown patient and extraordinary leadership. It's time for this party to get together and deliver. Let me just say. I mean, politicians throw out historic transformation. If I could just say two facts of what this will do, every American kid is going to get to go to preschool. Nobel laureate James Heckman says that is one of the biggest things we can do to create equal opportunity in America. Second, this is the largest investment ever in solar, in wind, in electric vehicles. It's huge on climate. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to get into the details in a moment, but this vote, you do expect to happen by Tuesday, as some have projected? Because on another network this morning, Senator Bernie Sanders was saying he wanted to try to add in some things to the bill still. Pharmaceutical and prescription drug pricing is what he talked about. I mean, that's pricey. How many changes should we expect? RO KHANNA: Well, we are working to add things in. I mean, the negotiation is taking place. I'm going to be a yes. I think we can have the vote by Tuesday. Senator Sanders is doing a great job to actually have Medicare negotiation. I mean, that would save money and help people with prescription costs. But the question is... MARGARET BRENNAN: That's $350 billion over 10 years, according to Senator Sanders. Is that something that you think you can still keep the Senate on board with? RO KHANNA: Well, there are two different issues. One is the actual reduction of costs, the prescription drug negotiation. That actually saves money. It saves money, brings the cost down. The other is the Medicare expansion, so people get dental, vision, hearing, by the way, a hugely popular polling place. So, my point is this. I'm a yes. Progressives will be a yes. We're working to get all of this in. But here's what people are saying. It's been months. Let's get this done. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're yes, even if those things aren't added in? RO KHANNA: I'm a yes on the framework. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Anything else that you know of that might be added into this before it goes to a vote? RO KHANNA: We're still working on getting the climate provisions secured. One of the main things we've done is have a methane fee. There was the American Petroleum Institute and others having massive ads against that. We fought. That will be in part of the framework. The Climate Civilian Corps is part of the framework. So the climate parts are still being negotiated. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because one of -- climate, you're passionate about, I know. REP. RO KHANNA: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But one of the biggest portions of the original proposal, the Clean Energy Performance Program, it's a $150 billion program that didn't make the framework. So how much of a defeat was it to lose that? RO KHANNA: It was a setback. But then the parts that were added, I think, are very strong, because there was another $150 billion added to have electric vehicles, solar wind, in collaboration with the private sector, funding new energy sources. So is it a better that we had the clean electricity program? Of course. But I still believe we can hit the 50 percent goals by 2030 with this plan in -- coupled with regulatory action. It is the strongest climate investment that the country has ever made. And, Margaret, we're doing this with a majority that is less than President Clinton had, less than President Obama had. I mean, they had 57, 60 senators. Here, you've got 50-50. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're doing it all on a party-line vote. RO KHANNA: And that's the question. Why isn't there a single Republican who's for paid family leave? I mean, I heard you say paid family leave is out. Why is there no one asking the Republicans? They claim to be the working-class party. They're not with us on paid family leave. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do you actually think things like paid family leave are not possible to pass after 2022, if you don't hold onto the majority? I mean, some people are saying, oh we'll get to it later. When you were meeting with the president behind closed doors, did he say to you, I can get paid family leave passed... RO KHANNA: He did. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... in the next year? RO KHANNA: He said he will do everything he can on paid family and on community college. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before 2022? RO KHANNA: He will do what he can. But here's the question. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know what he can. You are putting so much in this one bill and passing along party lines because this is your shot, this is what Democrats say, to get what you want done. RO KHANNA: Well, I guess I'm the ever... MARGARET BRENNAN: That suggests you don't have a shot at the other. RO KHANNA: I'm an optimist to think maybe one Republican who gives speech after speech saying they're for the working class, they're for the forgotten American -- let's do a single bill on paid family leave. They don't want to vote for the bigger thing, vote with us on paid family leave. Vote with us on child care. Vote with us to help the working class. We are doing this because we don't have a single Republican vote to help the working class in this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Back on climate. Democratic leaders seem to be saying that you need the business community in order to hit any of these targets. The climate envoy, John Kerry, has said that. President Obama has said that. You held a hearing this week with oil executives, and you went hard at them. Don't you need them to be partners and not adversaries here? What's your endgame? RO KHANNA: Yes, we do. And the European companies actually are being partners, European BP and Shell, not perfect, but they're at least announcing a reduction in some of the oil production, consistent with the U.N. goals. American companies are -- are increasing... MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are subpoenaing some of the -- some of the top oil executives in this country. What is the end goal for that? RO KHANNA: The end goal is to have transparency. They're saying they're for the Paris accord. Great. They're saying they're for climate action. Great. Well, what are they doing to actually hit those targets? Why don't they be honest in saying, OK, here's where we're going to invest in clean energy, here's where we're going to transition, here's where we're going to cut some of the production on oil, like our European counterparts? They shouldn't say one thing and do another saying. I want them actually to be partners. I want them to own up to some of the past outrageous statements. I mean, the Exxon CEO in 2002 is saying that fossil fuel burning does not cause climate change. And the current Exxon CEO, Darren Woods, wasn't willing to say that's an outrageous statement. It'd be like if the president of the United States today was defending Andrew Johnson. Just condemn the outrageous statements in the past. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much, Congressman, for coming on. RO KHANNA: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with Republican Congressman from Utah John Curtis, a pediatrician and head of the vaccine program at Washington's Children's National Hospital. And we will give you a preview of the U.N. summit under way right now to tackle a planet that's getting hotter. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. The global summit is underway right now in Glasgow, Scotland. It is the world's latest effort to tackle the fact that the planet is getting hotter. But expectations for substantive agreements to do something about it are pretty low. The U.N. secretary general says there's serious risks that world leaders will not deliver, urging more ambition and further action. CBS News' senior foreign correspondent Mark Phillips is there. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MARK PHILLIPS (voice over): There is a cloud of gloom hanging over this conference in Glasgow, and it's not just the weather. To understand the pessimism, it helps to go back to those heavy optimistic days in France six years ago when the Paris Climate Accords were signed. The warming of the planet would be kept below 2 degrees Celsius, it was agreed. Preferably, it wouldn't exceed 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. The problem with Paris, though, was that it was a conference about aspirations, not practicalities. How each country would reduce its own greenhouse gases was left to later. Well, later is now and not nearly enough has been done. CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: Infrastructure causes -- MARK PHILLIPS (on camera): It's all happening faster than you ever feared? CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: it's all happening faster than we ever thought. In fact, it's happening faster than scientists thought. MARK PHILLIPS (voice over): Christiana Figueres was the U.N. official who knocked heads together and made the Paris Accords happen. MARK PHILLIPS (on camera): Well, anything above 1.5 is bigger trouble than we thought. CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: It's -- well, absolutely. It's much bigger trouble. It causes two to three times as much biodiversity (ph) loss, two to three times as much infrastructure loss, and two or three times as much human misery. MARK PHILLIPS (voice over): The misery has been all around us lately. Floods in Europe, sweltering heat domes in North America. The world has changed since Paris, particularly in the relationship between its two biggest polluters, the United States and China. CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: Contrasting to where we were in the relationship between the United States and China in 2015, the two of them walked in literally hand-in-hand because over the previous years they had realized that they were better off collaborating on climate change than confronting each other. That has not been the case this year for all the reasons that we know. MARK PHILLIPS: Not only will Chinese President Xi Jinping not be coming, neither will Russia's Vladimir Putin. If there's any cause for hope in Glasgow, is that companies, if not governments, have begun to see the value in going green. Mark Carney, who headed the central banks of two G-7 countries, has been twisting arms. MARK CARNEY: You know, at present, there are leaders and laggers in the financial sectors. Leaders and laggers amongst companies. People will be able to tell who's leading and who's -- who's behind, who's on the right and the wrong side of climate history. (END VIDEOTAPE) MARK PHILLIPS: They've set up this conference to show how the future of the planet is at stake, but what are its chances of success? British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has likened it to a game where humanity is losing to climate change 5-1 at half time. And. Margaret, there seems little chance of a second half comeback. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Phillips, thank you. We go now to Congressman John Curtis of Utah, a Republican, who is scheduled to travel this week to Glasgow to attend that climate summit. Congressman, thank you for joining us ahead of your trip. REP. JOHN CURTIS (R-UT): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to tackle some business here at home first. The House is expected to vote, as you heard, this coming week on that $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure plan. This is roads and bridges. It's popular. Why are you opposing it? JOHN CURTIS: Well, this thing has been botched from the beginning. You know, this was negotiated in good faith in the Senate. And I have no doubt had it come straight to the House it would have passed with strong Republican support. But the reality of it is, we were told from the very beginning that this was coupled with the reconciliation spending, which is a no-go for Republicans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But -- so what I hear you saying, though, it that it's about like optics, that it's about politics. You would have $3.6 billion for your state come in here as a result of this bill. Aren't you just making a political point? I mean isn't that what people hate about Washington? JOHN CURTIS: So, listen, my state is more worried about debt than handouts from the federal government. Sure, there's some good things in that bipartisan structure bill, but the reality of it is, is that's not the vote. They've been very clear. If the bipartisan infrastructure package passes, so does the $3.5 trillion reconciliation package. Now, it may not be $3.5 trillion anymore, but I'll tell you, on foremost in Utah's mind is debt. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you expect Republicans to try to stand in the way of this it sounds like? JOHN CURTIS: It's not a stand in the way. Listen, Republicans have no control. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JOHN CURTIS: You can't imagine how frustrating it is to be a Republican in the House right now. This is all in the Democrats' hand. And I don't even know if we're going to have a vote on it. Like, we were told last week we would vote. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. JOHN CURTIS: We were told two weeks before we would vote. So who knows where this is going to land. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's ask you now about climate, which as we introduced to you, you are going to that Glasgow summit. You're also the -- one of the founders of this Conservative Climate Caucus. That is something that will surprise people. They often hear climate change and hear very partisan points of view here. You, as a Republican, are trying to make a statement. Specifically, what is your message on what needs to be a viable energy source for the United States? JOHN CURTIS: Yes, the message is very clear. First of all the message is, is that Republicans do care. We've been subject to a branding problem and we need to overcome that. But loud and clear, Republicans care and we care deeply. MARGARET BRENNAN: You think it's just a branding problem? JOHN CURTIS: Oh, absolutely. Listen, I'm -- I'm here from the state of Utah and I guarantee you there are more Republicans here than most places. And I know deep down everybody cares about this planet. We want to do what's best for it. We want to leave it off better for our children. Now we're turn -- it's fair to say we're turned off by the -- by the extremist rhetoric and we don't always agree on the way to get there, but I can promise you, Republicans do care deeply. And let me just show you, this caucus is a great example. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something specifically you spent a lot of time on, which you, in interviews I've read, talk about nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels. JOHN CURTIS: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do your constituents really want nuclear plants in their backyard? JOHN CURTIS: Listen, a lot of times when we think about nuclear, we think about our -- our grandparents' nuclear. And -- and we need to change our paradigm on that. Listen, U.S. innovation and technology can lead us past the concerns that we have with nuclear, whether it be safety or whatever those concerns are. We don't have to except old generation nuclear. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well -- JOHN CURTIS: And, by the way -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JOHN CURTIS: Utah does want it in our backyard. We're one of the few u-amps (ph) here, a municipality - - a conglomerate of municipalities, is one of the few that have actually made it part way through the permitting process for a small nuclear reactor. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JOHN CURTIS: And Pacific Core (ph), our major utility here, is working with Warren Buffett to bring nuclear. MARGARET BRENNAN: And there's the $6 billion in this bipartisan infrastructure bill that would go to some of those small, nuclear reactors. There's $9.5 billion to research clean hydrogen and create offices to manage it. You've got to like those provisions, even though you're voting down the bill. JOHN CURTIS: Well, the fact that you could -- a blind squirrel could find a nut in a forest, right, that's -- that's what it's like looking through this bill trying to find something that you like in it. $6 billion out of trillions and trillions of dollars isn't really a serious effort to -- to explore things that really are fundamental if we're going to get to a green future. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what is the Republican path to a green future? Specifically, what are the proposals you want to hear? JOHN CURTIS: Well, let me say, first of all, if -- if we follow the Republican path, we don't need to kill U.S. jobs. We don't need to export our jobs overseas and subject ourselves to our enemies. We have ideas that -- that improve the U.S. economy, that rely on U.S. technology and U.S. innovations, such as new nuclear, as we mentioned, hydrogen. And -- and, listen, fossil fuels have got to be part of the conversation. We've reduced more greenhouse gas emissions here in the United States with fossil fuels than the entire green deal could have -- Green New Deal could have ever dreamed of doing. And it's a mistake to demonize fossil fuels. They're actually part of our answer. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, part of what I hear frequently is, OK, make these adaptations, don't eliminate. But the challenge is, how do you meet the moment in terms of urgency when you are trying to put in investments that take a decade or more to get there? So, how do you do both things at once? JOHN CURTIS: Well, you have to do both things at once. And let's be honest, when we set unrealistic goals -- MARGARET BRENNAN: But how do you make the market more efficient if -- if not for creating tax credits and doing things that have government subsidies? How do you move it faster? JOHN CURTIS: Listen, our -- our free marketplace is remarkable. If -- it's -- it's U.S. innovation and technology that's led to the vast reductions in carbon that we already have. And I have full confidence in this marketplace. Now that's not to say that as a government we don't have a role, that we -- that we should be looking for those areas to incentivize and help and poke and prod along the way. But -- but we need all hands on deck, and we need to talk about this in a bipartisan way, and not just the extreme ideas, which, by the way, have led us in a terrible direction. We're looking at an energy crisis this winter. Rates are skyrocketing. I mean impacting those who can least afford to pay for it. If we're not careful, we're on the path of Germany. That -- that doesn't look good. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Congressman, have a safe trip. We'll leave it there. And FACE THE NATION will be back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Kamala Harris got a third dose of the COVID-19 shot over the weekend and urged Americans to get their booster shot when they become eligible. Harris reminded Americans the shots are free, safe and will save lives. In just a few days, a children's version of the Pfizer COVID vaccine is expected to be made available to 28 million children between the ages of five to 11 years old. CBS news senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann is in Cocoa Beach, Florida, with a look at how parents across the country are reacting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WOMAN: There you go. You're welcome. MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): Halloween 2021's real scare, the next dog fight in COVID America's divide. As soon as Tuesday, the CDC could join the FDA approving the Pfizer vaccine for young children ages five to 11. WOMAN: We have been waiting for this. Parents have been waiting for this. Schools have been waiting for this. And this is really a breakthrough. MARK STRASSMANN: Smaller arms, smaller doses. Pfizer's pediatric vaccine has two shots, each one- third its regular dose. Clinical trials showed efficacy rates above 90 percent. There are enough doses to vaccinate 28 million eligible children. In the latest weekly COVID update, one in four new cases were children. Vaccinating young kids could help keep them in classes, protecting them, their families, and their friends. JEFF ZIENTS, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSES COORDINATOR: We will be ready immediately following FDA and CDC decisions so that parents can get their kids vaccinated quickly, easily, and conveniently. CROWD: No more masks. No more masks. MARK STRASSMANN: But, amicably? Fat chance. Millions of parents already burn with a resentment fever. In one survey, less than one in three parents say they'll get the COVID vaccine for young kids right away. Another third said they'll wait and see. GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM (D-CA): Lives are quite literally at risk. MARK STRASSMANN: So far, California's the only state to mandate the vaccine for eligible students grade seven through 12, but not until next year. GAVIN NEWSOM: Ten vaccines have been required to send your kids to public schools for decades and decades. This is nothing new. MARK STRASSMANN (on camera): But it is new in a couple ways. There are no angry crowds protesting mandatory kid vaccines for measles, mumps, or whopping cough. And there are people willing to risk their jobs rather than get the COVID vaccine. MARK STRASSMANN (voice over): Starting tomorrow in New York City, thousands of city employees will be forced into unpaid leave. But the city says another 10,000 workers got vaccinated, pressured by Friday's mandate deadline, get the shot or lose the paycheck. MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D), NEW YORK CITY: We have a right as an employer to do it. Every court has shown that. MARK STRASSMANN: But missing cops, firefighters, and EMTs could create dangerous public safety blind spots. MAN: My body, my choice. MARK STRASSMANN: Twenty percent of the city's fire stations could go dark. That is how dug in they are. But compared to telling many parents they have to vaccinate their kids, child's play. (END VIDEOTAPE) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's Mark Strassmann in Florida. We're joined now by Dr. Claire Boogaard, a pediatrician who also oversees the COVID vaccine program at Children's National Hospital here in Washington, D.C. Good morning to you, Doctor. CLAIRE BOOGAARD, M.D., MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF COVID-19 VACCINE PROGRAM, CHILDREN'S NATIONAL HOSPITAL: Good morning. Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: So your hospital participated in this trial of the Pfizer vaccine for children. You saw what happened. Did you have any concerns? CLAIRE BOOGAARD: No, I think this is all really good news. What the independent advisory panel and the FDA looked at last week was really good science. They didn't skip any steps in this process. And the best news, both professionally, as someone who wants to take care of my patients, but also as a mom of a six-year-old, this that this is awesome. There are no serious side effects given this lower dose of the vaccine to this lower group of kids and it still protects kids from getting the infection. MARGARET BRENNAN: So this type of technology, the mRNA vaccine, you don't have any misgivings about giving it to someone who's young and developing? CLAIRE BOOGAARD: No, not at all. Vaccines, all they do is they give your body a chance to build a response to something that's non-harmful so it can protect you against something that is harmful. And everything is risk-benefit. If there was no coronavirus in the county, well, we wouldn't be talking about a vaccine, right? But, instead, there's this life-threatening disease floating around our communities. And in order to protect us, this is the safest and most effective way to do so. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the panel that you mentioned that voted on this said the benefits outweigh the risks of myocarditis. That's a heart condition. Did you hospital see any of that? How concerned should parents by about impacts on the heart of their child? CLAIRE BOOGAARD: Yes, the hospital's research is still part of the research that Pfizer reviewed last week. And, again, there was no serious medical conditions, or serious adverse reactions from this vaccine in that group, including myocarditis. The FDA knew this was a concern. And at the end of the summer, they asked Pfizer to increase the amount of patients in this study. And they've done so. And, honestly, it's really good news. It's very safe. MARGARET BRENNAN: So one of the questions raised was whether every child needs it, versus if they had COVID in the past or if there are conditions? If you're a parent at home, how should you weigh these things? CLAIRE BOOGAARD: It's a good question. I talk about this all the time with my husband, with my family and with our patients, right? Everything is risk/benefit. So you need to think about your own individual family situation. You also need to think about the community around you. For us, as parents, we don't want anything bad to happen to our kids, right? COVID has bad complications with children. Doesn't have it with all children, but it has many, and it also has the complications in this young group of having long-term issues, whether it's having symptoms that last longer than two months, which is the long COVID that people talk about, or developing a very serious life-threatening condition called multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children -- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the rash. CLAIRE BOOGAARD: Yes. It's -- actually, it's where your -- your body is enflamed in a very serious way and it can be life-threatening. It requires critical care in some kids. That, to me, as a parent, is enough for me to say, you know what, I don't want my kid to get a booger (ph). I don't want my kid to get that (ph). And if I have a choice, I'd rather use this super safe vaccine to get them back into school and back to their normal life. MARGARET BRENNAN: So kids who are younger than five years old, my children, toddlers, infants, they're still going to have to wait. Pfizer said well into 2022 before they get vaccinated. So what's your best advice to the parents of the very young? CLAIRE BOOGAARD: Just stay vigilant. I'm with you too. I have a four-year- old. So, I hear you loud and clear. But be optimistic. They are also lower the dose for that group, too. Keep in mind, this Pfizer vaccine has now been given to millions of people. We're just now offering it at a lower dose to a younger population who has a strong immune system. So I'm optimistic that the research will still look really positive in young kids. And I also know that scientists take this very seriously. They do not want to offer something that's going to harm people. Myself, as a doctor, I don't want to -- I don't want to go out advocating for something that I don't think is safe. So I promise, hope is coming. We're almost at the end of this. But for those who are unvaccinated, you are still at risk for getting the virus itself. So, keep with the social distancing, masking and follow the public health guidelines in your area. MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC director continues to say she's so concerned that only a third of pregnant women are vaccinated. If you were vaccinated while pregnant, what do you tell your patients about their children that they bring into you? Are those children protected? CLAIRE BOOGAARD: Good question. We -- we anticipate that if someone was infected during pregnancy or given the vaccine, that there is a chance that they have some protection with the antibodies that mom made that are shared to the child. There's also a protection if you're breastfeeding. What we don't know is how protected that child is. So what we don't want you to do is assume since you had it, as a pregnant lady or a breastfeeding woman that your child is protected because we can't guarantee that. But it's all something we recommend. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor, thank you for your advice. CLAIRE BOOGAARD: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks for joining us in studio. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: This Tuesday is election day in Virginia and New Jersey, where voters will select their governors. Usually the party out of the White House has an advantage in these off-year raises. But the one in Virginia is drawing some national attention right now as a test of just how Democrats are governing. CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe is here to help us break it down. So, Ed, we don't normally cover governor's races, but this one has taken on outside importance in the political world. Why is this mid-sized southern state so important? ED O'KEEFE: In essence it sets the table for next year. This is a state that's been hewing Democratic for the last 10 years or so. But for whatever reason they're having a competitive statewide contest this year. They shouldn't be doing that if electoral history from recent years holds. But it seems to be for a few different reasons. One, you have a popular, apparently well-liked Republican contender who has managed to make this about something other than Donald Trump, a local issue of concern, education and specifically parental control of education, all stemming from a debate answer that his Democratic opponent, the former, trying to be future governor, Terry McAuliffe made in a debate recently where he said, I don't think parents should have control over what goes on in the classroom. In essence trying to explain away a bill he had vetoed years ago. But the Youngkin campaign seized on this and said, what do you mean you don't want parents to be in charge after years of mask mandates and virtual schooling and all these debates about social policy and about what's being taught in school. So it could signal that that local issue, of finding one, plus the growing unpopularity of the president, could be enough for certain Republicans in states where maybe they haven't done as well recently, to pull it off. And it will signal to the rest of the party, this is how you can win in the post-Trump era. MARGARET BRENNAN: Those emotional issue always good to galvanize people. ED O'KEEFE: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the things, though, that I think is interesting, is to see current and former presidents out there campaigning in Virginia. And President Biden went out and helped Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic candidate, even though McAuliffe said basically that Biden's creating problems for him, headwinds, and that he's unpopular. ED O'KEEFE: Right. I mean -- and Biden won the state 10 -- by 10 points last year, but his numbers sit now in the 40s. But to bring him over to Virginia to say that his opponent is a Trump acolyte and could return the state to Trump-style politics, or what's going on down in Texas regarding its abortion policy. In essence what Democrats are trying to do is continue what worked for them over the last four years, nationalize the race and warn them about what Trump-style Republicanism could mean for their state. Meanwhile, Youngkin is trying to go local, focusing on that issue of education. Trying -- insisting that he will not, has not campaigned with the former president, even though he's doing a telephone town hall for him Monday night, Youngkin says he won't be there. Trying to divert attention and say, I'm focused on these things here in the state. We'll do this on my own. MARGARET BRENNAN: What's interesting there, for Democrat though is that they're not making an affirmative argument -- ED O'KEEFE: They aren't. MARGARET BRENNAN: Of here is what you get when we governor. They're saying, that's what you might get if we're not governing. ED O'KEEFE: Well, that's what frustrates McAuliffe so much. I mean he told me as much. He said the lack of action in Washington doesn't help me make the case that government can do things for people. So if they would only just pass this legislation they've been spending months on, it would help me make the point. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you buy that argument? ED O'KEEFE: In Virginia, I do, because of the unique nature of Virginia and the fact that it relies so much on the federal government for employment and for its economic growth. It works there. It wouldn't necessarily work in other states. And the other thing that I've -- I've noticed is recent weeks especially is McAuliffe has made the abortion argument, that it they did what they did in Texas and if the Supreme Court rules a certain way, it could happen here. They insist that abortion rights is a big issue of concern for voters in Virginia, and we'll see whether it works on Tuesday. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed O'Keefe, thank you for the preview. And all of you can watch Ed and our political team on Tuesday evening on our digital network, CBSN. They will be broadcasting the elections results. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Have a happy and safe Halloween. For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "The debate over the debt limit \u2014 often called the debt ceiling \u2014 is heating up again on Capitol Hill. But government officials, business leaders and economists are raising the alarms, saying not addressing it in a timely manner would be disastrous.\u00a0 The limit is the maximum amount the United States is allowed to borrow to pay its debts. If the amount of government debt hits that limit, and doesn't lift the ceiling, the U.S. would be unable to pay what it owes and could default. When Congress raises or suspends the debt limit, it's not greenlighting new spending \u2014 instead, it allows the Treasury to pay for spending it already approved. The U.S. has had a debt ceiling for more than 100 years. It was first established in 1917 with the Second Liberty Bond Act and set at $11.5 billion. Prior to that, lawmakers had to approve every issuance of debt separately. Different kinds of debts were later consolidated under one aggregated debt limit in 1939, which was first set at $45 billion.\u00a0The national debt ceiling has been raised or suspended more than 100 times since then, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The debt limit was most recently addressed under President Donald Trump, when Congress passed bipartisan legislation that suspended it for two years. When that suspension expired in 2021, the amount borrowed during that time \u2014 roughly $6.5 trillion \u2014 was added to the previous debt limit of more than $22 trillion, bringing the limit to $28.5 trillion as of August 1. When the suspension expired, the Treasury Department began using so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to keep paying its bills. Such measures include suspending the sales of some Treasury securities and redeeming or suspending investments or reinvestments in some funds.\u00a0 When extraordinary measures are exhausted, the Treasury spends its cash on hand. When that runs out \u2014 which experts estimate could happen in October \u2014 the U.S. government would not be able to meet its debt obligations and would go into default. This has never happened in U.S. history. If the U.S. government cannot pay its bills, millions of Americans would be affected. Social Security payments would not go out; U.S. troops and federal civilian employees would not be paid. Veterans could see compensation or pension payments lapse. And millions of Americans on food assistance would see benefits stop. The U.S. defaulting would \"likely precipitate a historic financial crisis that would compound the damage of the continuing public health emergency,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend. \"Default could trigger a spike in interest rates, a steep drop in stock prices and other financial turmoil. Our current economic recovery would reverse into recession, with billions of dollars of growth and millions of jobs lost.\" On Tuesday, financial services firm Moody's Analytics stated a default would be a \"catastrophic blow\" to the economic recovery, and said even if it was resolved quickly, Americans would pay for a default for generations. Its analysis showed if lawmakers remained at odds after the debt ceiling was breached, nearly 6 million jobs would be lost, the unemployment rate would climb back up to nearly 9% and stock prices would be cut by almost a third, wiping out $15 trillion in household wealth. Even the threat of default can have financial consequences. In August 2011, the U.S. credit rating was downgraded from AA+ to AAA for the first time in history by Standard & Poor's, just days after the Obama administration reached a deal with Congressional Republicans. The credit agency said the downgrade reflected its view that the \"effectiveness, stability, and predictability\" of American policymaking and political institutions had weakened at a time of ongoing challenges. For months, Democrats have been calling for a bipartisan approach to raising or suspending the debt ceiling. But Republicans have said Democrats would not have their support.\u00a0 On Monday, Democratic leaders announced they are including\u00a0the debt ceiling in the stopgap spending bill to keep the government running into December. The move would suspend the debt limit through December 2022, meaning lawmakers would not need to address it until after the midterm election.\u00a0 But attempting to tie the debt limit to the government funding legislation, known as a continuing resolution, poses risks for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\u00a0 For Democrats, should the effort fail, it would not only mean challenges for the debt limit but could also result in a government shutdown at the end of the month. Republicans who vote against legislation that combines raising or suspending the debt limit with money risk going on the record as being in favor of a government shutdown. Combined legislation would also force members who are against changing the debt limit to also vote against provisions they do support \u2014 like disaster relief and money for Afghan refugees.\u00a0 After the plan was revealed, Senator Mitch McConnell reiterated raising the debt limit would not receive GOP support, in a release stating Republicans would vote for a clean continuing resolution with money for Afghan refugees and disaster relief but not to raise the debt limit.\u00a0 With a 50-50 split in the Senate, Democrats need 10 Republicans to vote in support of the legislation. McConnell had suggested Democrats include the debt ceiling provision in their budget reconciliation package, which would have allowed Democrats to suspend the debt limit without any GOP support. But Democrats are still calling for a bipartisan approach. What remains unclear with 10 days to go: Plan B. CBS News reporter covering economic policy.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, as America remembers the September 11th attacks, Presidents, past and present, urged a divided America to unite, and President Biden tries to force the hesitant to get their vaccine. America closed one chapter in its fight against terrorism yesterday, marking two decades since the attacks that claimed nearly three thousand lives. (Crowd singing) MARGARET BRENNAN: And for the first time in twenty years, there are no U.S. troops in Afghanistan, but the Taliban is back in control, just as they were when they harbored Osama bin Laden there twenty years ago. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Can al Qaeda come back? Yeah. But guess what? It's already back other places. What's the strategy? MARGARET BRENNAN: Now U.S. intelligence officials are warning that America's chaotic withdrawal from that war is inspiring terrorist groups abroad. And as the President who first launched the war on terror warned, the hate espoused by extremists at home is now eerily similar. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll hear from a key Republican voice on foreign policy, Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We'll discuss the security threats facing America now with former acting CIA Director Michael Morell. Then, as COVID's ferocious Delta variant continues to spread, President Biden issues a sweeping vaccine mandate that may rest on shaky legal ground. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We've been patient, but our patience is wearing thin. And your refusal has cost all of us. MARGARET BRENNAN: One group that clearly needs protection--children, too young to be vaccinated, who are being hospitalized with COVID in record numbers, as the school year gets into full swing. We'll talk with the top pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital, Doctor James Versalovic. And we'll check in with Alberto Carvalho, the superintendent of schools in Florida's Miami-Dade County, where at least thirteen school employees have passed away from coronavirus in just the last month. And we'll get the latest on a timeline for children's COVID vaccines from former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Yesterday, Americans marked a somber milestone: Twenty years since the September 11th attack, an event that upended American life and launched the war on terror. We'll have more on national security later in the broadcast. But this morning, Americans are waking up to another threat--the Delta variant continues its unrelenting spread. President Biden now faces a slowing economy and his frustration with the eighty million Americans who remain unvaccinated is clear. He's now requiring federal workers to take the vaccine and mandating some private businesses to do so, too, or submit to weekly testing. But that order could soon face legal challenges. CBS senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann is in Atlanta with the latest on COVID's impact. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): COVID's back to school lesson: How vulnerable kids are, making up more than one in four new COVID cases. CLINT SAAVEDRA: How are the parents-- how are they okay with that? How are they just okay with that over a mask? MARK STRASSMANN: For the sickest COVID kids, hospitalization rates spiked almost ten-fold since late June. Alarm in Los Angeles, America's second largest school district just mandated vaccinations for eligible students. JACKIE GOLDBERG (L.A. Unified School District Board Member): That's why there isn't measles and mumps and rubella in our schools, because we vaccinate. And we require it. MARK STRASSMANN: These nine states have banned or restricted school masking mandates, including Florida. On Friday, a judge upheld the governor's ban. RON DESANTIS: Let the parents make the decision that's best for their kids. If you want the masks, do it, if you don't, don't, that's fine. MARK STRASSMANN: But Florida's pandemic politics has consequences. In Miami, Abe Coleman, an elementary math teacher for three decades, died of COVID. TANYA JACKSON: He was just a great co-worker to many people, and stayed at the school like a monument. MARK STRASSMANN: Coleman became one of thirteen Miami-Dade teachers and staff to die of the virus already this school year. All of them unvaccinated. COVID also killed more than twenty-four hundred Floridians last week, another state record. Four were children under sixteen. With the unvaccinated, many college campuses have gone from pleading to punishing. Ohio State will deny them housing and in-person classes next spring. At Quinnipiac University, fines of up to two hundred dollars a week. More than seven hundred colleges and universities have mandated vaccines. MAN: I think it's a massive overstep of their authority. MARK STRASSMANN: But this ICU in Boise, Idaho, largely reflects COVID America today. Every COVID patient is unvaccinated. WOMAN: And they all ask, well, what could I have done? Will the vaccine save them now? No. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Pfizer's vaccine for kids between the ages of five and eleven reportedly could get FDA approval by the end of next month. Communities like Metro Atlanta could use the help. Roughly twenty-five thousand kids have tested positive in the first six weeks of school. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann, thank you very much. Well, we want to go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who sits on the board of Pfizer. He's got a new book coming out to you next week, \"Uncontrolled Spread: Why COVID 19 Crushed Us and How We Can Defeat the Next Pandemic.\" Scott, it is great to see you again. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good to see you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Look, states can mandate vaccines. Federal government has never done something like this before, outside of the U.S. military. The Republican governor of Arkansas is on TV today, saying this is going to backfire. He's trying to convince his constituents to take the vaccine and because the federal government is telling them to, he says it's going to be even harder. Practically speaking, does this mandate make sense? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: I think the downside of this mandate in terms of hardening positions and taking something that was subtly political and making it overtly political could outweigh any of the benefits that we hope to achieve. If you look at where we are right now, right now, seventy-five percent of adults over the age of eighteen have had at least one dose of the vaccine. Most of them will complete the series. That's a very high number of people vaccinated owing to the good work of the Biden administration. We're not going to get above ninety percent. We don't even really reach ninety percent with childhood immunizations, which are mandated. So, we're going to get somewhere between eighty and ninety percent. I-- I would state that we would have gotten to eighty percent just on our current trajectory in short order. Perhaps with a mandate on small businesses, eventually you get to something akin to eighty-five percent, but it's going to be slow because this is going to get litigated. It takes OSHA time to implement regulations. You'll have to put in place guidance, give businesses a grace period and then figure out what the enforcement mechanism is going to be in. In the near term, a lot of businesses that might have mandated vaccines are now going to sit on their hands and say, I'm going to wait for OSHA to tell me just how to do it-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: --and give me more political cover. So, in the near term, you could actually discourage some vaccination. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. OSHA, that's going to come from the Labor Department, and they haven't filed that yet. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what you are referring to. But the President, what he said was mandating a vaccine for businesses and if employees at those businesses don't take it, the alternative is to get weekly testing. Do we have the testing capacity in the country to do that right now? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: We would have the testing capacity to do it, but it puts a big burden on businesses to have to operationalize that and determine what they're going to do with the result. So, I think a lot of businesses are going to opt to try to force workers to get vaccinated if in fact this ever goes into effect. But again-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Many were. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: --we are looking at a very long timeline here. Excuse me. MARGARET BRENNAN: Many already were. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Many-- many were, exactly. Many-- many businesses are, and I think that the federal government's action to require federal employees to get vaccinated, which is probably well within their purview to do that in a function of federal readiness that gives plenty of political cover for more businesses, more private sector businesses to start to implement their own mandate. So, I don't think we had to reach down to the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: --level of small businesses with a hundred or more employees and put a federal requirement on them. I don't think the federal government should be dictating this. I also don't think governors should be preventing small businesses from making these determinations on their own. We should leave these decisions to communities, local communities and businesses to make assessments on what their risk is, what their settings are, how much precautions they can put in-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: --and whether vaccine requirements are an absolute necessary-- necessary to-- to protect people in those settings. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, kids still can't get a vaccine if they're between the ages of five and eleven. When will it be available to them? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Well, I'm more familiar with the process for Pfizer, the company I'm on the board of. Pfizer has said that they're going to have data before the end of September. They could be ready to file within days of having that data, so they'll file very quickly with the FDA. FDA has said it's going to be a matter of weeks, not months, in terms of their evaluation of that clinical data to make a determination whether they're going to authorize vaccines for kids aged five to eleven. I interpret that to mean perhaps four weeks, maybe six weeks. But I think in a best-case scenario, given that timeline they've just laid out, you could potentially have a vaccine available to children aged five to eleven by Halloween. If everything goes well, the Pfizer data package is in order, and FDA ultimately makes a positive determination, I have confidence in Pfizer in terms of the data that they've collected. But this is really up to the-- the Food and Drug Administration to make an objective determination. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, then it's up to parents, whether they want to use a vaccine under emergency use for their children. If you're a parent, what do you ask your pediatrician and are there options out there? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Yeah, I think parents should look at this as a decision where there is some latitude in terms of what you do with your child, and you really should consult your pediatrician and have a conversation. Parents have understandable concerns about putting any new product, new medical product in a child. It's not just this vaccine. It's any vaccine or any therapeutic, and I understand those concerns. This isn't a binary decision. It's not a choice of do I vaccinate my child or not? There's different ways to approach vaccination. You could go with one dose for now. You could potentially wait for the lower dose vaccine to be available, and some pediatricians may make that judgment. If your child's already had COVID, one dose may be sufficient. You could space the doses out more. So, there's a lot of discretion that pediatricians can exercise, making largely off label judgments, but exercising discretion within the context of what an individual child's needs are, their risk is, and what the parents' concerns are. So, I would urge every parent to have a conversation with pe-- their pediatrician. Pediatricians are very good at counseling through these decisions, and I think that they could provide good objective advice to parents. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what about the parents themselves? We've seen this Israeli data that shows the vaccine may have some waning impact after six months. When is the FDA going to fully approve boosters and if Pfizer's first out of the gate, as has been reported, when will we see Johnson and Johnson and Moderna follow? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: Well, there's a meeting this Friday of the FDA's advisory committee to discuss this very issue. The agency could be in a position to act very quickly, depending on what the outcome of that meeting is. If there is a recommendation from the FDA's external advisors to authorize boosters or licensed boosters, the agency could act very quickly, and then ACIP, the advisory committee to the CDC would meet and make a recommendation about what population should receive boosters. The conventional wisdom is-- is that if boosters are approved, it's probably going to be for people who are more at risk from COVID right now. They've already recommended it for those who are immunocompromised, moderately or severely immunocompromised. I think the next tranche would probably be older individuals, particularly individuals who live in congregate settings like nursing homes. And that's may-- that may be what we see next. Pfizer has filed their application with the FDA. I think J&J is going to be in a position also to file a package with the FDA soon as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: They have very good data also looking at boosters. They've showed a good response. And I think that vaccine also could be in a position to get authorized by FDA in short order. MARGARET BRENNAN: Also, very quickly, governors issue mandates for kids to get vaccines. Anyone sending their kid in the classroom has to do that. Do you expect COVID to be any different? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D.: In time, no, I think you're going to see more local school districts and governors make those recommendations. Eventually ACIP is going to make a recommendation about whether this should be included in the childhood immunization schedule. My guess is they're waiting for more of the vaccines to be fully licensed to make that kind of a recommendation. But I would expect this eventually to be required as part of the childhood immunization schedule. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Doctor Gottlieb, always good to talk to you. And FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Tomorrow, lawmakers will get their chance for the first time to question the Biden administration on that chaotic military withdrawal from Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the Taliban is solidifying control in Kabul, raising their flag over the Afghan presidential palace. Our Charlie D'Agata is in neighboring Pakistan. Charlie, U.S. intelligence is already acknowledging that the victory is inspiring jihadist propaganda. What are you hearing about how the chaos of this withdrawal will impact the U.S.? CHARLIE D'AGATA (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@charliecbs): Well, Margaret, we have to make clear right way the Taliban are claiming victory, and, of course, that's going to embolden jihadists in this region, it already has. The priority is an al Qaeda in Afghanistan and here in Pakistan. We have to remember that almost everybody that we have spoken to here and in Afghanistan, including the outgoing Afghan government, if you want to call them that, said al Qaeda is intrinsically linked with the Taliban, in terms of how Afghanistan is now. They are in trouble. I mean, there is a deep humanitarian crisis going on now. So they need an outreach. They need legitimacy from the United States, the international community, but if they don't get it, there are others that are willing to fill that void. I'm talking about players like Russia and China, who if the Taliban don't play by the rules in international standards, they are there to move in. MARGARET BRENNAN: The CIA chief was in Pakistan this week, and he has acknowledged the U.S. has lost capabilities without a footprint in Afghanistan. Does that mean we are more reliant on Pakistan now? CHARLIE D'AGATA: Well, right now after William Burns came on Wednesday, a couple days later, just on Saturday, the intelligence chiefs of Russia, China, Iran, and other local countries here met with the intelligence leaders here as well. So there is a sense that the United States is being sidelined. Prime Minister Imran Khan said you have to think twice if the United States thinks they're going to be able to aptly a base here, reestablish a base here. So the U.S. may need-- they do need to have some sort of footprint here, but for the time being, they're being pushed out by other players. MARGARET BRENNAN: Charlie D'Agata in Islamabad. Thank you. We go now to Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. Good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER (R-Illinois/@RepKinzinger): Hey, good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Intelligence officials are predicting that al Qaeda could reconstitute in as little as twelve months. Have you heard a strategy from the administration yet? Tomorrow, you'll be able to put questions like that to the secretary of state. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Yeah, no, I haven't. And, you know, all you keep hearing is this nebulous over the horizon capability. And I think what's important is to understand what over the horizon capability is. It basically says if we see a target of opportunity, we have the ability to come forward and strike it, you know, great, we can do some of that. And in areas that you know, we hear about a one-off drone strike. But keep in mind, when we defeated ISIS, for instance, in Syria and Iraq, and obviously that's ongoing, we had to embed people with the local forces to be able to get the intel necessary for those strikes. So, I've heard nothing but that nebulous over the, you know, over the horizon strike capability. And secondarily, the fact that you know, your prior guest was talking about having to rely on, in essence, the Russians or China is in there now in Pakistan is playing such a big role. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: That is what happens when you leave a position that we have there in Afghanistan. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm not going to litigate the leave or stay. It's done, right? And the American public overwhelmingly seems to support the concept. But on the practicalities on the national security front, the President said yesterday to reporters when he was asked about the chaotic withdrawal. It's hard to explain to anybody how else you could do it. He said if you pulled up a plane in another country, for example, you would also, quote, \"have people hanging in the wheel well. Come on.\" Was this as unavoidable as he is suggesting? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: You know, I don't think it is, I mean, look, it's-- I get armchair quarterbacking and it's easy for some people to come up and say that, you know, the prior president would have done it perfectly or not, whatever. But I think there are so many people that know military strategy and policy that say, look, even if we made the decision that we're leaving and that's an unnegotiable decision, there were a couple of key points. We always talk about the air base in Bagram. We could have defended that until every American was out and every Afghan civil was out. Secondarily, let's say that we still, you know, shut down that air base and we were down to that last week prior to the complete collapse of the Afghan government. That's when those six thousand marines and other-- and soldiers that rushed into the Kabul airport-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: --actually could have pushed out and defended Kabul proper, the city, because the Taliban at that point had no interest in coming into the city yet. And we could have had the evacuation on our timetable as quickly as we could have. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on that evacuation, it was the ambassador in Kabul who issued the evacuation order on August the 12th. Kabul fell three days later. Is the secretary of state going to take the blame for that? Do you hold him responsible for that? And was the timeline here a real factor? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: You know, look, I think there's a lot of people that bear blame and the secretary of state is one of these, and I think it would be nice. And keep in mind, even under the prior President, I would say this exact thing for some people to just take responsibility. That's what the American people want, is somebody to stand up and say, look, this is on me. We know, obviously, that there is a detailed plan and that's not always on. But in the case of-- of the secretary of state, when we began to see the collapse of the Afghan military, which actually started with the threats of the Taliban, we're doing on these night letters against Afghan leaders and Afghan military leaders saying the U.S. is leaving. We're going to kill your family unless you give up your arms. When we began to see that fall apart, that's when the order should have been given to basically in a defensive posture to get everybody out. We can and not have to wait two or three days prior because a lot of us were watching this happen. We were talking about it and-- and it's like it wasn't a surprise to many of us. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about domestic extremism because you're one of the two Republicans investigating the attack on the Capitol from January 6th. There are at least two extremist groups who are expected this coming Saturday to attend a rally in defense of those who were arrested. Have you been briefed on the security measures to protect the Capitol? Are you confident? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: We haven't been briefed yet. We know that the fence is coming back up. We expect to be briefed this week. Yes, I'm confident. And I feel confident in our-- our, you know, our law enforcement. But I think it's an important point here, everybody has a right, obviously, to protest and nobody would argue that. But George W. Bush said an amazing thing in his speech yesterday when he said-- he talked about al Qaeda and domestic terrorists. And he said they may be culturally very different, but they're children of the same foul spirit. And-- and they seek to basically divide people that are different than them. This is why it's important that we as Republicans, frankly, and as Americans, stand up and say we shouldn't be at this point where we are truly worried for the seat of government every few months when there is a protest. So I hope it goes off well. I-- I have a lot of faith in our law enforcement and hopefully we'll find out more this week. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So tomorrow? When-- when will we hear more about the security measures? You're not sure yet? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: I would love to hear more tomorrow. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Yeah, I would love to hear more tomorrow. I would love to have heard it last week. I hope it's soon though. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be watching that. I want to go to vaccines. This is also a national security threat, the health of the American public. The President issued this sweeping vaccine mandate because he's frustrated eighty million Americans haven't gotten that shot in the arm yet, and-- and COVID is spiking again. He said he's doing this because Republican governors have been cavalier with their constituents, particularly kids. Doesn't he have a point? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Oh, I do, I think he has a point. Look, I-- I don't know if all of his mandates will hold up in court. There's constitutional questions on some of it. I'll leave that to lawyers because I really don't know, but I think it's going to save lives and-- and the failure here comes in leaders that have basically used vaccine status as some tattoo of what political tribe you belong to. I mean, we all hear stories of people that are in, you know, very red areas that are embarrassed to say they're vaccinated. That is insane and silly, and that is a problem with leaders, particularly Republican leaders, that don't stand up and give cover to people and say, look, this is not what republicanism or conservativism should be. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: And you see these governors that do, you know? Mike DeWine in Ohio. And they just get pushed aside by some of those that are out to simply manipulate our base, raise money off of them and not care about their life, only care about what it means for their votes and their bottom line as politicians. It's actually pretty sad. MARGARET BRENNAN: The RNC itself, the Republican National Committee, has said that they want to file, but that's, you know, rhetoric because nothing's actually been instituted yet by the administration. Is that what you're referring to when you say raising money off this? REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, it's-- it's everything. I mean, it's them. It's-- it's when you look at really any Republican, you know, not any Rep-- there's a lot that are not doing this, but there are some, you know, Republican members of Congress and stuff putting out fundraising after fundraising e-mail about-- first, it's going to be a vaccine mandate-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: --next thing, the Gestapo is going to show up at your door and take your Bible away. Like, that's not going to happen and that's playing on people's fear. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today. And we will be back in a moment with a lot more FACE THE NATION, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're not able to watch the full FACE THE NATION, you can set your DVR or we're available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount Plus app. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Late last night, the FBI released a newly declassified document related to the investigation of the 9/11 terror attacks, outlining contacts that hijackers had with Saudi associates here in the U.S. It did not include any evidence that the Saudi government was complicit. Holly Williams is in Riyadh with the look at how that country is fighting against extremism. (Begin VT) HOLLY WILLIAMS (CBS News Foreign Correspondent/@HollyMAWilliams): At Al-Ha'ir prison, Saudi Arabia claims it's reforming convicted terrorists with music, sports-- This is your coffee shop? YASER ESAM HAMDI: Yeah, exactly. HOLLY WILLIAMS: --and even a coffee shop that the prisoners run themselves. Our guide was an inmate. Yaser Esam Hamdi, born a U.S. citizen to Saudi parents in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. YASER ESAM HAMDI: I was there for five years, and it was very nice, it's very-- it's a very nice experience. HOLLY WILLIAMS: Bizarrely many inmates wore business suit during our visit and others filmed us, they said, for the prison's TV station. Saudi officials accompanied us at all times and denied allegations of torture at the facility. After growing up mainly in Saudi Arabia, Hamdi told us he traveled to Afghanistan to train with the Taliban just before the 9/11 attacks. YASER ESAM HAMDI: I watched action movies a lot. And I wanted, like, to have-- I want to try-- I want to try doing stuff like that. HOLLY WILLIAMS: He was captured, held in Guantanamo Bay, and then U.S. military prisons before agreeing to give up his American citizenship and returning to Saudi Arabia a free man. He was later arrested by Saudi authorities, though he was vague about why. YASER ESAM HAMDI: I didn't want to speak about it a lot. Yeah. HOLLY WILLIAMS: Okay. YASER ESAM HAMDI: Yeah. But talking and stuff like that, I am the-- because of that, I came back to prison. HOLLY WILLIAMS: But Hamdi and several other prisoners were happy to describe their upbringing in an ultra-conservative, closed-off kingdom exposed to religious fundamentalism. If you went looking for extremism. YASER ESAM HAMDI: Yeah. HOLLY WILLIAMS: If you went looking for fundamentalism. YASER ESAM HAMDI: Exactly. You can find them. You can find them. You can learn from them, and they will misguide you. HOLLY WILLIAMS: The same factors helped radicalize the fifteen September 11th hijackers who were Saudi citizens, according to some. And Saudi Arabia has been criticized for being slow to fix the problem. Now Saudi Arabia says it's reforming--extremist preaching has been banned, women have greater freedom than ever before, including finally the right to drive, and school textbooks that once justified violence against non-Muslims have been rewritten. As Saudi Arabia tries to rehabilitate its image and stamp out extremism, Yaser Esam Hamdi told us, he's also been successfully reformed. YASER ESAM HAMDI: All people do mistakes. I did the mistake. I was an extremist-- extremist once, but now I am not. (End VT) HOLLY WILLIAMS: The Saudi government has always denied any involvement in the 9/11 attacks. This country has won praise for its effort to combat terrorism, but it's still widely criticized over its human rights record. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Holly, thank you. For more analysis on the threats facing the country, we turn to Michael Morell. He's a former acting director of the CIA and a CBS News contributor. Great to have you here. MICHAEL MORELL (Former Acting and Deputy CIA Director/CBS News Senior National Security Contributor/@MichaelJMorell): Great to be here, Margaret. Good to have you back. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. Ayman al-Zawahiri, the head of al Qaeda, issued a video on the twentieth anniversary of the attacks. The U.N. said in July he's living in Afghanistan, is he? MICHAEL MORELL: We think so, which means that the Taliban is harboring Zawahiri today. The Taliban is harboring al Qaeda today. And I think that's a very important point. MARGARET BRENNAN: So is that just a complete false premise then to say that pulling out of Afghanistan, we can still keep the threat from al Qaeda at bay? MICHAEL MORELL: We have a lot of work to do in order to do that, right? We have to figure out how we're going to collect intelligence-- two types of intelligence. How are we going to make sure that al Qaeda is not rebuilding its capabilities and is planning on attacking us again? And then we have to-- if we do that, then we have to collect the kind of intelligence that gives you the precision you need to conduct strikes, right? Drones need to be told exactly where on the earth to go. What tells you that is precision intelligence. So a lot of work for the intelligence community to do here going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we've seen some of that. If you follow headlines, the CIA director in Pakistan this week, he's already said under oath, Bill Burns, that you will have fewer intelligence tools if you pull out U.S. troops. So what exactly do we need and isn't building up in the region the opposite of what the President intended to do, which was look at Asia and threats elsewhere? MICHAEL MORELL: So we have China, right? China is a big problem. It's the big strategic threat facing the United States. We got to-- we have to-- we have to pivot to that, but we also have to keep our eye on terrorism. And there's terrorists in a lot of different places in the world. The President is right about that. But I think the place where we are most at risk from over the long term and the intelligence community is saying twelve months, so the long term is kind of short here, is Afghanistan, right? So al Qaeda could bounce back in as quickly as twelve months in Afghanistan if we don't do what we need to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when I talk to sources about this, what they say to-- to the argument you just laid out is, well, why Afghanistan? Why regroup there? Why shouldn't we be as worried about Central Africa and al Qaeda's presence there? What's your response to that? MICHAEL MORELL: So right now, the-- the-- the places I'm most worried about are ISIS in Africa and al-Shabab in Somalia. But longer term, I worry most about al Qaeda in Afghanistan and-- and ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Why? Because at the end of the day, the most important thing that-- that a terrorist group can have, the most important determinant of their success is safe haven. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MICHAEL MORELL: Right? And-- and you have safe haven in Afghanistan that you really can't have anywhere else because you're being harbored now by the Taliban. And Afghanistan is a big place. It's tough to get to. It's tough to find partners. We just heard about that earlier in the show. So that's why I worry more about Afghanistan. MARGARET BRENNAN: So are we more at risk then without the military presence there? MICHAEL MORELL: We are more at risk, without a doubt, because we haven't yet, as we heard from-- from Representative Kinzinger, we haven't yet put together a strategy for how we're going to do the two things. So one, right, is to collect that intelligence that I talked about. The intelligence community's got to figure that out. Then the Department of Defense has to figure out this over the horizon capability, right? So when the intelligence community says, Mister President, they're rebuilding again, they're getting to the point where they can attack the homeland again. And the President says, take action. The military has to be able to reach in and degrade al Qaeda, right? We haven't figured those two things out yet. MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and on that point, over the horizon, it's just a euphemistic word for flying in drones and planes from far away. So you had this drone strike that now The New York Times and The Washington Post is raising questions about. This was to target some of the members of ISIS who killed U.S. troops and over a hundred Afghans just a few weeks ago. MICHAEL MORELL: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, did we actually kill the person intended and if we didn't, doesn't that show that over the horizon has some problems? MICHAEL MORELL: So-- so-- so this wasn't over the horizon, right? This-- this was done with assets in Afghanistan. So you got to remember that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Assets still in Afghan? MICHAEL MORELL: Yes. You know what happened here, it needs to be investigated. And I would hope that the administration, once it does the investigation that it tells all of us publicly exactly what happened and if we made a mistake, why. You know, President Obama was very strong on being open about making mistakes with drone strikes. And I think this administration needs to do the same. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's a question for the Pentagon, or that's a question for the CIA? MICHAEL MORELL: It's a question for the White House. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Secretary of State will sit for questions tomorrow. For the very first time the administration is going to have to explain this chaotic withdrawal. You hear about the Taliban effect, that jihadists looked at this, looked at American troops exiting and said, it's possible that they are inspired by this. How much should we be concerned about that now? MICHAEL MORELL: I think that the Taliban winning the war in Afghanistan and then the way our exit happened has absolutely inspired jihadists all over the world. The Taliban is saying we just didn't defeat the United States. We defeated NATO. We defeated the world's greatest military power ever. So there's a celebration going on. We defeated the Soviet Union. Then it fell. Now we've defeated NATO. Right? Maybe they can fall, too. I think not only will jihadists be inspired, but a lot of them are going to come to Afghanistan to be part of the celebration, to be heart-- to be part of jihadist central. So after 9/11, they all scattered from Afghanistan. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MICHAEL MORELL: I think we're going to see a flow back in, and that's one of the things that makes Afghanistan more dangerous than other spots on the planet. MARGARET BRENNAN: We will keep an eye on it. MICHAEL MORELL: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Morell, thank you for your analysis. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn back to our coverage of the COVID pandemic, several school districts in Florida are in an ongoing battle with the governor over that state's ban on mask mandates. The federal government is now involved with the Department of Education investigating whether it violates the civil rights of children with disabilities. We want to go now to the superintendent of the Miami-Dade County School District, Alberto Carvalho. Good morning to you. ALBERTO CARVALHO (Miami-Dade County Public Schools Superintendent/@MiamiSup): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, a Tallahassee judge says the governor is well within his legal rights. But do you believe that this ban on mask mandates actually does violate the-- the rights of children with disabilities as the federal government is investigating? ALBERTO CARVALHO: I certainly do, and I believe that the recent actions taken in Tallahassee are contrary to the expert advice of public health and medical entities that declare that mask mandates are protective measures that serve a compelling public interest. Look, I'm the superintendent of a district that has lost thirteen employees since August 16th. Yes, all of them were unvaccinated. We're still in a community where the positivity rate is at eight percent, where the number of cases per one hundred thousand residents is elevated at around three hundred and thirty. When back in June, it was only about seventy-six individuals per one hundred thousand. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. ALBERTO CARVALHO: So the conditions are not what they should be for us to relax the protocols. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what actually controls the spread in the classroom? Are classrooms vectors for spread of this virus? ALBERTO CARVALHO: I think the experts are very compelling in telling us what controls the spread. Number one, vaccination for those who are eligible, twelve and older, and I am proud of my community since ninety-eight percent of residents in Miami-Dade have already obtained at least one dose of the vaccine. As a school board, we've taken courageous steps in-- incentivizing the vaccination of employees with-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ALBERTO CARVALHO: --financial incentives for our employees, social distancing, mandatory masking, ionization, cleaning techniques in the classrooms. If you put all those together, a multi-layered approach, then we can in fact contain the spread of this awful disease. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you can't employ-- require your employees to be vaccinated. The-- ALBERTO CARVALHO: In the state of Florida, there are legal restrictions in terms of mandating vaccination of employees. MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. And then the teacher's union, they're encouraging vaccination, but they aren't mandating it. Does anything change now that the President made this announcement? ALBERTO CARVALHO: Well, I think one thing that has changed is the fact that there is a greater incentive and a greater focus on the need to vaccinate individuals in our communities. You know, the best way-- the best way to reduce the positivity rates to contain the spread of COVID-19 is by surrounding kids with-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ALBERTO CARVALHO: --vaccinated individuals. And our incentives, the deployment of mobile vaccination units and testing units to our schools, which we do around the clock-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ALBERTO CARVALHO: --are having an effect. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I-- I want to ask you about the tragedy, as you just mentioned, of those thirteen people who worked for you, right? And in a district-- ALBERTO CARVALHO: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --which has high positivity rate, high poverty rate, they were unvaccinated. Why did they refuse to get vaccinated? And-- ALBERTO CARVALHO: I think that's an important question, and I think it underlies, you know, it's-- it's-- it underscores a real tragedy in our community and across the country. There are individuals in our communities, particularly ethnic minorities, who as a result of sad examples that are historic in nature, coupled now with misinformation and disinformation from a very small but very vocal minority that seeks to misinform and confuse. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's why I'm asking you if-- ALBERTO CARVALHO: And the sad reality-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's why I want to ask you if the President's mandate and talking it up makes a difference because the former surgeon general was tweeting, Jerome Adams, this week that he-- he gets the intent, but many minorities, he says, \"still have historically founded reservations. Many people have\"-- ALBERTO CARVALHO: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --\"honest questions.\" So, he's saying essentially this may backfire in those minority communities by-- if they don't trust the federal government, the federal government telling them to take a vaccine isn't going to help. ALBERTO CARVALHO: I understand, and that's why local governments that are usually trusted--school districts, teachers, educators, superintendents, school board members, community-based organizations need to step up to provide an echo and a course of reason in our communities. Look, this should not be a political issue. This is a health concern issue. We've never debated the value of vaccination for measles-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ALBERTO CARVALHO: --mumps, polio or hepatitis. What's different now? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ALBERTO CARVALHO: The conditions-- the health conditions are not what are causing this issue. Politics are, and-- and sadly-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ALBERTO CARVALHO: --here we are debating this from a political perspective, rather than a health benefit perspective. I tell you, as a superintendent-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. ALBERTO CARVALHO: --as a father, as a teacher, I am concerned for our kids. They are being used as political pawns in this political chess game, and that is reprehensible. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for joining us and good luck with the kids in your schools. ALBERTO CARVALHO: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to go-- we are going to go now to Doctor James Versalovic, the pediatrician-in-chief at Texas Children's Hospital. Good morning to you. JAMES VERSALOVIC, MD (Interim Pediatrician-in-chief, Texas Children's Hospital): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: So twenty-five percent of new infections in this country are among children for the people that you are taking care of. How are they getting infected? What are you seeing in your hospital with these kids? JAMES VERSALOVIC, M.D.: Well, we're seeing record numbers here at Texas Children's throughout Texas, and of course, as the story unfolds across the country, it's not just a regional problem, but a national problem. We've seen a record seven hundred fifty thousand plus, more than three quarter of a million children infected since early August through early September. We're seeing that play out here locally in one of the largest cities in the United States and the largest children's hospital in the USA. The reality is that we have seen record numbers of children hospitalized during this Delta surge. We have seen record numbers of cases reported by the day by the week. We continue to be on a high plateau and the reality is that we may be headed to another peak or to another valley if we all pull together. MARGARET BRENNAN: Earlier in the program we spoke with a former FDA commissioner, Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who was predicting that you could potentially see a vaccine by Halloween that's available for kids five to eleven. Do you agree with that timeline? Do you recommend to parents that when it's available, they give it to their child? JAMES VERSALOVIC, M.D.: Yes, we certainly are aiming for that timeline in October of this year to have the data here put together at Texas Children's as we continue to work with children. We are well into phase two-three, working with leading children's hospitals across the country and partners such as Pfizer and Moderna. That is our goal, October. We are doing everything we can now to move these trials ahead and they're moving ahead well. Children are getting a different dosage, but it's safe and effective. Thus far we are on track, and I certainly would agree with Doctor Gottlieb that we are doing all we can to get vaccines to children in the fall. In the meantime, use masking and other measures to keep our children safe and reassure parents that help is on the way in the form of vaccines for children under twelve. MARGARET BRENNAN: For parents, what do they need to look for in their children? Are you seeing these infections develop in the form of some of these syndromes, like MIS-C? Is this a respiratory infection of COVID? Who is ending up sick in your hospitals right now? And how sick are they? JAMES VERSALOVIC, M.D.: Well, in addition to prevention, Margaret, we need to continue to emphasize to all parents and families the importance of timely diagnosis through testing. Once the child is displaying symptoms, respiratory symptoms that could be consistent with COVID, COVID pneumonia, fever, could be shortness of breath, other symptoms. We need to make sure that child gets tested-- that-- if that child has a known exposure, getting timely testing is so pivotal. It's the only way we can make an accurate diagnosis and then triage the care appropriately. Decide whether that child needs hospital-based care. We know how to treat children at this point in the pandemic. We know that the vast majority of these cases, more than ninety-eight percent now are due to the Delta variant, highly contagious. But we are able to take care of these children in a hospital-based setting. We know that there are children with underlying medical conditions that are putting them at greater risk for severe COVID pneumonia, such as obesity, Down's syndrome, diabetes, pulmonary conditions. But we do have medications to treat children. We want to keep children out of the hospital and the reality is timely diagnosis is key. If a child needs hospital-based care, we do all we can to keep them out of the pediatric ICU. The reality is that children may need ICU-based care, and we're seeing that today. We're seeing infections throughout every age group. Infants and very young children, school-aged children and unvaccinated teenagers are getting hit hard now. We're seeing that impact during this surge more than ever. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. JAMES VERSALOVIC, M.D.: So, we need to continue to remind parents, too, that beyond the acute infection, we could have MIS-C three to six weeks-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. JAMES VERSALOVIC, M.D.: --after infection. We are seeing a spike of MIS-C today. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor, good luck to you and thank you very much for your analysis. We'll be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty years ago, the terror attacks on 9/11 illustrated some of the worst that humanity has to offer. But in reaction to those attacks, we also saw some of the best: Courage in the face of danger, unity at an intensely divisive moment. We could use some of that now. (Begin VT) (Crowd singing) MARGARET BRENNAN: It feels at times that was the last moment our country was united. Nearly three thousand people died in the attacks that September day. Today, we lose three thousand every two days to COVID. Yet appeals made to Americans' sense of civic duty to take the shot or wear a mask to protect the vulnerable are distorted as political battle cries. Twenty years ago, it was the passengers aboard United Flight 93 who tried to seize control of the plane from its hijackers. They stopped it from hitting the U.S. Capitol. Seven months ago on January 6th, it was our fellow Americans who violently attacked it in a deluded attempt to change the election. Yet lawmakers can't even agree on how to investigate. The trauma of that single September day is so embedded in America's consciousness, that the term 9/11 has become shorthand for horrific devastation, the benchmark against which we measure all loss. Yet there was persistent trauma in the years that followed--the two wars, the botched intelligence, the torture, the destructive institutions, government and journalists, surveillance violating civil liberties. Constant Islamophobia even morphed into a presidential campaign platform. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: Today, more Americans are worried about domestic extremism than foreign terrorism. This week, Homeland Security warned domestic extremists may target refugees, particularly Afghan Muslims. Those who still see America as that beacon of freedom we have vowed to be. Twenty years ago, Washington promised to move heaven and Earth to prevent another attack. Today, we need that commitment again to fully heal ourselves--to decide what our values are and who we are in the world. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching.

Ross and Morell discuss recent political changes in Israel, including the outlook for the governing coalition and the background of newly elected Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. Ross, a former senior adviser on the Middle East to multiple U.S. presidents and secretaries of state, offers observations on Benjamin Netanyahu's future and background on recent tensions in Gaza. Morell and Ross also discuss the prospects for engagement with Iran.\u00a0 Editor's note: An earlier version of this transcript misidentified Dennis Ross as the former ambassador to Israel.

MICHAEL MORELL: Dennis, thanks for joining us for a second time on Intelligence Matters. It is good to have you with us again. DENNIS ROSS: Always a pleasure to be with you. Thanks for having me. MICHAEL MORELL: So there's a lot to talk about, but I did want to take a minute and mention, since the last time you were on the show, you published another book. This one is, \"Be Strong and of Good Courage: How Israel's Most Important Leaders Shaped Its Destiny.\" Can you tell us a little bit about what the book is about and what are some of its most important themes? DENNIS ROSS: Well, the essence of the book and really the premise of the book is that Israel is facing what are some pretty basic decisions about its identity and its character if it stays on the path that it's been on, meaning if it keeps building outside of what I call the settlement blocs, it will become increasingly difficult to separate Israelis and Palestinians. In that case, you really end up with one state, a binational state, not two states for two peoples.  But it's a hard decision because the settler constituency is an important one politically, and therefore it requires the leadership of a prime minister to say, 'OK, I'm going to make a historic decision to preserve who we are.' And the book, in a sense, using that as the take up point, says, 'Well, let's look historically at four Israeli prime ministers who are different ideologically, but they define leadership very much the same way,' which assumed, among other things, that you you don't defer decisions, you don't avoid decisions. You take them on, you educate your public as as necessary. And as I said before, they were quite diverse. David Ben-Gurion, Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin and Ariel Sharon, diverse ideologically, but very similar in terms of defining what their role as prime ministers would be. And in a sense, this book is saying, 'Let's look at what they did, who they were, how they themselves evolved, and can we see them as a model for Israel's prime minister today?' MICHAEL MORELL: Sounds very interesting, sounds like a book worth reading; which is a great transition actually, to the first topic that I wanted to chat with you about, which is Israeli politics. So Benjamin Netanyahu just finished 12 years as Israel's prime minister, a period of time that spanned nearly all of President Obama's two terms and the entirety of President Trump's term. And as you know, this was Netanyahu's second tenure as prime minister, having served three years from 1996 to 1999. He's now been replaced by Naftali Bennett, not a household name in the U.S. What can you tell us about Prime Minister Bennett, about Bennett, the man and and his politics? DENNIS ROSS: Bennett, the man, is someone who really represents, first of all, the next generation. He's forty-nine years old. He's twenty-two years younger than Benjamin Netanyahu. His parents came from the United States and made it to Israel. He was raised during - at least part of when he was growing up in San Francisco, which is where they're from. So he is a fluent English speaker who has very much a kind of an American inflection.  He is someone who served in Israel's most elite commando unit. He is someone who started two high tech companies, sold them both and made an enormous amount of money. He very definitely was on the right side of the political spectrum. He used to in many ways, press Bibi Netanyahu from the right. He was chief of staff to Netanyahu at one point. And he is from those, I can say, who served with him in Sayeret Matkal, which, as I said, the most elite unit, some of whom I know, they they all say that he's actually very pragmatic. My own experience with him is also one where I have the sense that his ideology is real. But he also believes in solving problems. And in some ways, we see that even in terms of his readiness to go ahead and form a government that is a historic government from any standard - because for the first time in Israel's history, one, you have an Arab party that is a member and a formal member of the coalition, part of the coalition signed agreement; never happened before. You had Arab parties that supported the Israeli government from the outside and helped to keep them in power, which was true for Yitzhak Rabin's government, but they were never formally part of the government. So a historic threshold has been crossed. And in a very interesting time, because in the most recent conflict, there was terrible intercommunal violence that really shocked most Israelis.  And here you see in the aftermath of that, you suddenly see an effort, I think, to to build bridges, really profound bridges. And it's a government as well that has two right wing parties, I would say three center parties. One is a center left leaning Yesh Atid, which is Yair Lapid party is probably a center left party. What is probably a centrist party, Yisrael Beiteinu, which is Lieberman's party, is probably a center right party. And then you have two left parties. The Labor Party has become much more left and and then you have Meretz. So it's an unusual government in terms of covering the whole spectrum politically. But then also having an Arab party, many doubt that it will be able to sustain itself because there isn't a whole lot of ideological convergence and there is an acceptance on one thing, which is opposition to Bibi Netanyahu. I'll just conclude this side by saying the following, because Netanyahu is now the head of the opposition and has so clearly stated he wants to bring down this government as soon as possible; just as he created a kind of a glue for this group while he was in power. So long as he's the focal point of the opposition and trying to bring him down, he creates a glue for them while they're in power. MICHAEL MORELL: So going back to your book is there a possibility here that Bennett could be one of these leaders that you're looking for? DENNIS ROSS: You know, we always look at leaders who grow in office, and I do think Bennett has that potential. He's very smart. And and now he's put in a position where certainly part of his traditional base has been alienated from him. He is presenting himself as someone, I have to say, using language that is very Bidenesque, in terms of saying, 'We're going to represent everybody, those who are against us, those who are for us. It's time for Israel to change the character of our politics, get back to who we've always been. Just because someone disagrees with you, they're not an enemy. They're not a traitor.' And the first thing he said when he convened his cabinet for the first time was he said, 'Look, we're all going to have to soften our ideology and adjust to be able to work together. We're here to work for the country.' And it suggests, at least in the early going, he's adopting a posture that that promises potentially to show that he can be one of those who can measure up to what would be the standard of leadership. We'll see. MICHAEL MORELL: And we haven't seen enough policy decisions yet to give us any indication, would that be fair? DENNIS ROSS: That's very fair. This is so early. No big decisions have been made. The challenge that this government has made for itself, there hasn't been a budget approved in the last couple of years. And so they they've established as part of their coalition agreement this is what they will produce. And it's not an accident that the budget has been introduced. It's not a simple thing to reconcile what are all the competing interests.  And so I think being able to achieve a budget, a two year budget, that will be significant. Some of the personnel appointments will be significant, but they're going to be - inevitably every Israeli government will face unexpected challenges, surprises. And how this government copes with them will go a long way to determining whether Naftali Bennett is prime minister measures up to those figures that we wrote about in the book. MICHAEL MORELL: You talked about the stability of his government and the importance of having Netanyahu there, right, in terms of the stability. What are the risks that his government faces going forward here in terms of whether it can hang on or not? What will be the challenges? DENNIS ROSS: They'll be two kinds of challenges. One will be internal. There will be those, you know, connected probably to prime minister - former prime minister Netanyahu, who will look for all sorts of opportunities to throw in landmines, to try to play on the fissures, the inherent fissures, because, as I said, you have the left, the right and you have an Arab party. There will be those who will, you know, will try to push, I think, the illegal settlement building or they'll try to push for a demolition of illegal construction by Palestinians. They'll push what they think are those basic fissures within this government, basic ideological divides, and they'll try to play on them. So they'll certainly look to create crises that will make it difficult for one side or the other to go along already. As an example, there is an issue related to development in the Negev as it relates to the Bedouin. And there's a push on the part of the right to try to force some Bedouin out. And and obviously that would create a fundamental problem for Mansour Abbas and the Ra'am party, which is their party. So there are examples like that. There's a whole question of what we've seen, will there be evictions? And that's really a Supreme Court decision. But how is that issue going to be handled? It is interesting that this government went along with the decision of the previous government to allow the the March of the Flag. This is something that is done normally on Jerusalem Day, which commemorates the 1967 War and the reunification of Jerusalem. The one thing they did is the police allowed this to go forward with a slightly different route, even though Hamas had made all sorts of threats.  The new public security minister is Omar Bar-Lev, who is from the Labor Party, and he made the decision for this to go ahead. But you could see four people on the left side of this coalition. This was probably not a simple issue because they were worried about what the implications of it were. And yet we already see here's an example of where they figured a way to work together and they will face more of these kinds of hard choices. MICHAEL MORELL: Dennis, is Netanyahu done or is there a chance we could see him back in the top job? DENNIS ROSS: I think that it's premature to write his political obituary, but I do think that the image, his image of being a magician, that he could always pull a rabbit out of the hat and somehow survive - that's taken a hit. The more as I said earlier, the more he tries to explode this current government, the more I think it makes him look more political and less like a leader. It makes the current government and Bennett look like they're trying to manage for the country.\u00a0 If he succeeds, I'm not sure that it ends up translating into anything except a new election where, with four elections, he couldn't put together a government. And so it's not so easy to see if there is an election that he's able to put together such a government. So while I'm not prepared to write his political obituary, I think it's a real uphill climb for him. And I haven't even mentioned anything about the trial that he's been indicted in. There's a trial looking at three different indictments against him. And so we don't know what the future of that's going to be. That trial likely will drag on for a while. So I you know, I wouldn't say that he's necessarily done, but it's not so easy to see his pathway back. MICHAEL MORELL: So if he is done, can can you reflect a little bit on what his legacy as prime minister will be? How will historians look back at his 15 years as prime minister? DENNIS ROSS: He is the longest serving Israeli prime minister; David Ben-Gurion was 13 years. Ben-Gurion resigned in 1963 when he was still a relatively - it wasn't that old at that time, but he made the decision to to leave in the case of Prime Minister Netanyahu. Fifteen years is obviously an extraordinary tenure. On the one hand, I would say on the positive side of the ledger, anybody who's been to Israel and see that it is truly the startup nation, you have to give Netanyahu a lot of credit. He carried out a series of economic reforms, did a lot of privatization, created all sorts of incentives, deregulation to get out of the way of innovation. And he certainly contributed a lot to this. I wouldn't say he's solely responsible for it because a lot of the sources of development that express themselves in terms of making Israel a startup nation were actually done during Prime Minister Rubinstein. But there's no escaping the fact that Netanyahu gave this a big boost. Anybody who comes to Israel sees this is a very advanced country in every sense, cutting edge in every sense. And he certainly deserves some credit for that. It's - and deservedly so, I would say also he was very effective. But when I do, I think when I talk about him, when it comes to dealing with the Arabs, he was always strategic when it comes to dealing with the Palestinians. He was always political. What I mean by that with the Arabs, he engaged in all sorts of very practical quiet under the table, below the radar screen cooperation that build actually that built on what were his recognition that there were converging threat perceptions as it related to radical Islamists, whether they were the Iranians or whether they were the al-Qaida or Muslim Brotherhood. He understood this and he found ways quietly to cultivate relations with the Arabs. And ultimately that contributed to what we saw with the Abraham Accords. So you have to give him credit for that. Where I think he does less well is, I think, he did something that I worry about. Israel has always been, at least historically, an American interest, not a Republican or Democratic interest. And he undermined in many respects Israel's bipartisan relationship with the United States even before Trump, who he embraced in a way that was probably excessive. Any Israeli prime minister would have wanted to get along with an American president and especially someone like Trump. But the zip between getting along and so enthusiastically embracing and the the impulse to sort of line up with the Republicans in a way that was left little to the imagination, that has a longer term consequence. And I think we're seeing some of it now. Certainly the progressive wing of the Democratic Party has become deeply critical of Israel in a way that almost seems reflexive, as opposed to thinking through exactly what the Israelis are doing, what the Palestinians are doing and the like. So I am here. I think that he bears a lot of the responsibility for that. And I think he also bears a lot of the responsibility for putting Israel on a track where it runs the risk of becoming a binational state. What motivated me to write be 'strong enough?' The courage was precisely the concern that Israel is on a track by default of becoming a binational state, unless, in fact, it makes some conscious decisions to change course. And that's really, again, I think one of one of his legacies, his successor that I'm hopeful can undo it. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Dennis, good transition to the second topic I wanted to chat about, which are the recent clashes between Hamas and Israel, which you referenced earlier. Can you explain what happened perhaps from the perspective of both sides? DENNIS ROSS: Yes, and it's really important to put this in perspective. There's a backdrop to what recently happened. It starts with Mahmoud Abbas canceling the elections. Ninety three percent of the Palestinians who are eligible to vote registered for these elections. These would have been the first elections since 2007. The fact that 93 percent registered to vote tells you a lot about how much the Palestinian public wanted the election: not because they had high expectations that everything was going to be transformed, but they clearly wanted to be able to express themselves and express their voices. Now, the cancellation of that created a sense of opportunity for Hamas. And there's a second element that created a sense of possibility for Hamas. And that was, there is a long standing legal issue affecting the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. This is Jerusalem, just outside the Old City, being outside the wall part of Jerusalem. There's a neighborhood called Sheikh Jarrah; there are several families that moved into Sheikh Jarrah, which was after the 1948 war. The Jordanians took over East Jerusalem and they moved a number of families who were refugees into houses that have been owned by the Jews, prior to the war in 1948. So what Israel defines as its war of independence, so they don't necessarily have legal title. These homes were owned by Jewish families prior to '48. There is a right wing settler group that seeks to settle in all the areas, including these Arab areas. And they were able to buy these properties actually from a trust that owned them. And they've been pushing for evictions. This has worked its way through the courts. And the lower level courts have found that these families should be evicted. The Supreme Court has not acted on it yet.  This is a classic case where technically this issue is viewed in narrow terms legally. Those who are pushing for it might be right. But when you deal with issues of Jerusalem, you want to be wise, not just right. And here's a case where there are two issues that will always create an electric response that takes on a life of its own when it comes to Jerusalem. One is evictions, displacement of Palestinians. The other is the religious sites. And that leads to the third issue that has helped propel this. And that was that there were disturbances on Jerusalem Day and rocks were being thrown - the way the Temple Mount of the Haram esh-Sharif, this is a platform on the surface where there are two mosques, Al-Aqsa mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, and the Dome of the Rock. Below it is known as the Ha-Kotel, and this is where the Wailing Wall, the Western Wall.  There are thousands of Jews down there praying and stones are being thrown over the side, you get hit by a stone 300 feet above you, hit you in the head, it will kill you, or certainly it can. So Israeli police want to stop the stone throwing, but for some reason that mystifies me, they went into the mosque. Now, they claim, because rocks and metal bars were accumulated there. Where the mosque is, is far removed. I mean, I joke that George Washington couldn't throw a stone from there to the Kotel. So what you want to do is you want to stop those who are throwing the stones. But for some reason, there ended up being an assault into the mosque. And this went viral, as you might imagine, because everybody who was there has a phone and they become a reporter. And that just set everything aflame. Then Hamas sought to take advantage of all this, to make themselves a defender of Jerusalem, to gain control over the Palestinian movement more generally. And so they launch rockets against Jerusalem. If you think about it, there are 360,000 Palestinians who live in Jerusalem and those rockets actually hit there. They might well have killed the Palestinians, but that wasn't their concern. What Hamas wanted to do was make a statement, seize it themselves and present themselves as the protector of Jerusalem. They knew crossing that threshold, Israel would respond in a very tough way and they didn't care. They knew that the Gazans would be the ones who pay the price for it. And they didn't care. They wanted to score political points. So Israel responded with rockets. First of all, Israel responded to these rockets by carrying out attacks, going after the military infrastructure within Gaza. Now, Hamas builds a vast military infrastructure. And I want to put this in some perspective. In 2014, there was a conflict that went on for 51 days between Israel and Hamas at the time. At the end of that, Hamas had 3,300 about 3,300 rockets left. When during this conflict, when it began, they probably had about 30,000, so they use from 2014 until 2021 massive rearmament. And these rockets, by the way, have more payload, more range and and were more effective. In addition, they built a very extensive network, underground network of tunnels. Now, the tunnels weren't there to protect their people. They were there to protect their fighters, their leadership, their command control and they're built into what are areas that are not only completely civilian, but they built them under hospitals, under schools. They built them in places and they fire rockets from places that, in a sense, challenged the Israelis to hit and bear the stigma. When they do so, Hamas is basically positioning themselves to target Israeli civilians with their rockets on the one hand and in a sense, try to use their population as human shields on the other and hope that Israel pays the price for it, which in many ways they did in this conflict. I just want to make one last point on this. When Hamas built this vast network of tunnels, they used an enormous amount of cement, steel, iron, electrical wiring, and wood. Now Gaza is an impoverished place. All of this material that was used for building this vast underground tunnel network could have been used for construction and development and economic progress above ground. But that's not Hamas's priority. And they have kept Gaza in a state of deep impoverishment even prior to this conflict. MICHAEL MORELL: Dennis, is there a way to fit what happened here into the broader narrative of the peace process for the last 20 years? DENNIS ROSS: I think there is. There was an effort when Hamas took over Gaza in a coup in 2007, and the logic of the effort was, 'Let's show the contrast between the West Bank with the Palestinian Authority; let's show how they develop and that they offer a future, and let's show the failure of Hamas in terms of, they offer nothing but pain.' That was a good theory, but it never fully materialized, in part because the party is far too corrupt, in part because to be fair, the Israelis have not created the kind of space that could have made it more effective.  I would say that we have too often spent too much time riveted on 'Let's solve the whole conflict' when the circumstances weren't there to solve them, but what we should have done is create the conditions where Palestinians genuinely could have advanced, where they could have had increasing political space to make decisions, where we were investing in that, in a sense, working with the Israelis to give them greater political and economic space to create some successful models for the Palestinians so they could see what could be achieved.\u00a0 Enough wasn't done in that regard. Too often we went for, 'Let's Go solve Jerusalem, refugees, borders and security.' And it's not that those shouldn't be solved, but you always have to recognize as a diplomat, as a negotiator, you have to recognize what you can achieve at this particular juncture and what you can't achieve. I would much prefer us to create a new baseline which makes what is impossible today possible tomorrow in the sense we have too often focused on the end game when we didn't have the circumstances or conditions that allowed us to move towards that end game. MICHAEL MORELL: Dennis, maybe we can switch in the last segment here to talk a little bit about Iran. We just had a presidential election and we don't know the outcome because we're actually taping this a day before the election. But I'm wondering how you would describe Iranian politics going into the election. DENNIS ROSS: There is no doubt that the balance of forces within the elite, within Iran, and there is such a thing as elite politics and rule; we have seen with people like the current President Rouhani and his foreign minister Zarif. These are people who believe in the Islamic Republic, but they're more pragmatic. They believe that the Islamic Republic can advance by being more integrated into the into the international community and the international financial system. The Supreme Leader, who is unfortunately from this standpoint, the decision maker, he doesn't use that. He sees the need to preserve an Islamic Republic and its ideology by having enemies and the enemies justify the kind of strict internal controls. And we've seen the balance of forces shift in favor of those who embody the ideology, the resistance ideology that the Supreme Leader has always promoted. So we've seen a shift. The Revolutionary Guard has much greater power. It's clear that Ebrahim Raisi is the favorite candidate. So we'll see whether he actually wins. But he's clearly the favorite candidate. The media gives him dramatically more attention. He's obviously the choice of the Supreme Leader. He's the head of the judiciary. This is someone who, when he was a much younger man, presided over revolutionary courts that put tens of thousands of people to death in the late 1980s because they were seen as real or imagined enemies of the of the Islamic Republic.  And so he comes from what's known as the principle side of the arguments there. And whether he wins or someone else wins, it's still the Supreme Leader who makes the decisions. And it's going to be a more hard line government than we've seen. Now, the question is, does that make a big difference? Practically, my own view is they still want sanctions to be released, but they're trying to signal that they're in no hurry to have them released and they're trying to build pressure on us by pressing ahead with their nuclear program. I believe we'll probably still get back into the Iran nuclear deal sometime this year. And the challenge for the Biden administration will be how do they retain leverage to try to do what they seek, which is a longer, stronger deal? And what do they need to be able to do to counter what the Iranians are doing in the region?  The Trump administration applied what they called maximum pressure on the Iranians, which was really maximum economic pressure. They did squeeze them economically, but it didn't change any of Iran's behavior. They didn't stop any of their active support for Hezbollah, for Hamas, Islamic Jihad or any of the Shia militias within Iraq. Maybe they couldn't provide as wide array of material resources, but they still provided - Hamas was still getting money from them. They were effusive in their praise of the Iranians. After the conflict, Hezbollah was probably still getting 400 billion dollars a year. The Shia militias within Iraq were still being supported, so they didn't change their behavior. What we've seen is if you're going to be effective with the Iranians, you need a strategy that applies economic, political and even at least the threat of military pressure. And you need to create an isolation of the Iranians. And I hope that the Biden administration, I suspect that this is the way they're thinking about it, understands that you believe the Iranians are way out. But you also have to keep the pressure on them and it's more effective when it's not the U.S. acting alone. MICHAEL MORELL: Dennis, why have the hard liners gained strength over the past few years? What's behind that? DENNIS ROSS: I think there's probably a couple of factors that have contributed to it. I do think that the Trump policies did contribute to it because here was the argument of those who said we can advance if we do deals with the with the Americans in the West. So they did the JCPOA. Everyone can debate whether this was the best possible deal or not. But from an Iranian standpoint, they lived up to it. Trump pulled out of it. They paid a price for it. And it undercut the arguments of those who said we can gain by doing these deals. So that certainly contributed, I think, to their strength. I think, though, that what also contributed is that the basic desire to dominate the region is still, you know, the most important driving factor in Iran's behavior. And inevitably, that tends to push them in directions that's going to produce a backlash against them. And one of the interesting things about the the interview, the set of interviews that Foreign Minister Zarif gave them was supposed to be for the kind of oral history of the Rouhani presidency, where he was very candid in terms of saying that the Revolutionary Guard consistently undercut his diplomacy. He didn't know what was going on in Syria. Here's what they were doing that made it much harder to achieve the kind of things he wanted. I think the point to bear in mind here is that people like Rouhani and Zarif were permitted to do certain things like negotiate an Iran nuclear deal, but they weren't the ones who shaped the policy when it came to the rest of the region. And what I'm suggesting is that context plays into the hands of the hardliners because sooner or later it produces responses. Now, the really interesting question is, can you devise a policy where you can create a set of choices for the for the Iranians, where it becomes clear that what the hard liners are doing are costing unmistakably, costing Iran versus what's available if you change the course and the direction. MICHAEL MORELL: So from a policy perspective, assuming we get a new nuclear agreement, which seems likely to me sounds like it seems likely to you as well, I guess the question is, how do you have a nuclear agreement and then keep the pressure on them from a regional perspective? How do you balance that from a policy perspective? DENNIS ROSS: I think what you do is you decide to take a page from their book. Their book is a nuclear file is one thing. We're free to do whatever we want in the region. And the answer to that should be, 'OK, the nuclear file is one thing and therefore we're free to do whatever we want in the region.' And so, you know, if you think about it everywhere where the Iranians are in the region, you know, in Iraq and Syria and Lebanon and Yemen, you either have a failed state, a failing state, or a state that is largely paralyzed because of what the Iranians are doing. So I think one of the things to do is we should be competing in the region. We should be highlighting their failures. So, again, I said there's a political dimension, there's an economic dimension, there's a military dimension. We have the Israelis now in CENTCOM, Central Command, which means we could do all sorts of planning where, we with the Israelis and the key Arab states, we could do contingency planning to focus on what are the options that the Iranian Shia militias are likely to engage in. Let's develop plans to counter them. Let's raise the cost to the Iranians and what they're doing. You can do this in a variety of ways. Let's do more to create the ability to counter their ballistic missiles, creating more of an integrated missile defense network, do more to promote the kind of drone technologies and cooperation. Build on the Abraham Accords and build that coalition. Widen it. When you take these kinds of steps, when you create in a sense a counter coalition, you're also enhancing your potential for deterrence. Because the more you show the Iranians we're going to raise the cost of what you're doing in the region, the more you give them incentive to look for different ways to operate. MICHAEL MORELL: Dennis, thank you so much for joining us. It's always great to hear your views. They're so thoughtful. And let me remind our listeners again of your most recent book, 'Be Strong and of Good Courage: How Israel's Most Important Leaders Shaped Its Destiny.' Given the political changes in Israel, it sounds like the perfect time to read it. So thanks again for joining us, Dennis. DENNIS ROSS: It's always a pleasure to be with you. Thanks for having me.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that aired Sunday, May 16, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: Good morning, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you for being with us. PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL BIBI NETANYAHU: Good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to start with yesterday was the worst clash in this seven-day conflict. The last one of a similar sort in 2014 lasted six weeks. How much longer are these hostilities going to continue? PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Well, we hope that it doesn't continue very long, but we were attacked by Hamas on our National Day, Jerusalem Day, attacked- unprovoked attacks on Jerusalem and then thousands of rockets and missiles on our cities. And I think any country has to defend itself. It has a natural right of self-defense. We'll do whatever it takes to restore order and quiet and the security of our people and deterrence. We're trying to degrade Hamas's terrorist abilities and to degrade their will to do this again. So it'll take some time. I hope it won't take long, but it's not immediate. JOHN DICKERSON: Twenty-nine hundred rockets fired on Hamas, according to one- fired from Hamas, according to one report. But there's also a report that Egypt offered a truce. Hamas said yes. You said no. Why? PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Well, that's not what I know, and frankly, if Hamas thought that they could just fire rockets and then sit back and enjoy immunity, that's false. We are targeting a terrorist organization that is targeting our civilians and hiding behind their civilians, using them as human shields. We're doing everything we can to hit the terrorists themselves, their rockets, their rocket caches and their arms. But we're not going to just let them get away with it. Neither would you. I mean, just imagine what would have happened if you had 2,900 rockets fired on Washington and New York and others. I think you would understand our position. I think you do actually. JOHN DICKERSON: The precision of that targeting has been up for question. There's been a lot of focus on the bombing on Saturday in Gaza of a building that housed the Associated Press and Al Jazeera. The Committee to Protect Journalists, demanded \"detailed and documented justification.\" This morning, there's a Jerusalem Post story that says the Americans were shown a smoking gun, that- proof that Hamas was in that building. What is that proof? And did you show it to the Americans? PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Well, we share with our American friends all that intelligence and here's the intelligence we had, it's about Palestinian terrorist- an intelligence office for the Palestinian terrorist organization housed in that building that plots and organizes the terror attacks against Israeli civilians. So it's a perfectly legitimate target. And I can tell you that we took every precaution to make sure that there were no civilian injuries. In fact, no deaths, no injuries whatsoever. Well, I can't say injuries, I don't know if somebody received a fragment of- of a stone. I don't know that. But no people were killed. Now, imagine ask yourself, how is that possible? You see these high rise towers that are used by Hamas over and over again. They collapse and no one is killed. Why does that happen? Because we, unlike Hamas, take special precautions to tell people, leave the building, leave the premises. We make sure that everyone is gone before we bring down those terrorist facilities. And that's the difference between Israel and Hamas. They deliberately target our cities, deliberately target our civilians. They glorify the death of children and civilians and old people. They are happy with it. I think they're happy with any deaths that are caused to them. We grieve for every non-combatant loss in Gaza and we grieve for all our civilians who died. JOHN DICKERSON: We want to get to-- PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: But we don't- we're not happy with it and we try to minimize it. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get to minimizing those casualties. But you spoke with President Biden yesterday. It's inconceivable you would have talked to him and not shared proof of Hamas in those buildings that housed the journalists. Did you share that with him? PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Well, we pass it through the intelligence services to our people, to those people. Why do you think we brought down that building? The interesting thing is I would say that, you know, all the journalists, one of the, I think, AP journalists said we were lucky to get out. No you weren't lucky to get out. It wasn't luck. It's because we took special pains to call people in those buildings to make sure that the premises were vacated. And that's why we brought down that building. And look, you have your own experiences, I think, in Mosul and Fallujah and Afghanistan. I think you can appreciate the efforts we go through in dense urban fighting when terrorists are targeting civilians who are hiding behind civilians, how difficult that is. We do our best to avoid civilian casualties. And we did that yesterday with that building as well. JOHN DICKERSON: And Mr. Prime Minister, the arguments about how careful Israel have been are familiar ones to your critics. And in this case, with 181 Palestinians dead, 52 of them children, there's significant criticism. Amnesty International has asked the Criminal- International Criminal Court to look into a refugee camp attack. The UN is meeting today. Foreign ministers of the EU are meeting and- and the response has been like this one from the foreign minister of Ireland: \"Israel has international legal obligation to protect children in conflict and are not doing so.\" PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: That's just false. I mean, the reason we have these casualties is because Hamas is criminally attacking us from civilian neighborhoods, from schools, from homes, from office buildings. That's what they're doing. JOHN DICKERSON: But-- PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: And we're taking action, trying to target them with as great precision as we can. Unfortunately, there are occasionally civilian casualties, which we regret. But here's what happens. When the international community attacks Israel, they're actually encouraging Hamas to continue these attacks because Hamas says it's great, we're both killing Israeli civilians. And unfortunately, some of our- and they're happy with their own civilian casualties because it gets that- the international community to focus their attacks on Israel instead of Hamas. JOHN DICKERSON: But it's-- PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: That's wrong. It's both wrong and unproductive. Because actually what it does is prolong the conflict and escalate and increase the number of casualties that- that happen as a result of the continuation of the conflict. JOHN DICKERSON: But the question- the question, Mr. Prime Minister, is- US Secretary of State Tony Blinken said that Israel has an extra burden, that Israel, because of its strength and power and dominance, has an extra burden on these questions of casualties. The question is whether Israel is meeting its extra burden in- in responding to these rocket attacks from Hamas. PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Certainly are, and I can tell you that there have been many studies by serious military analysts who have compared Israel's actions with that of other Western armies in similar situations, fighting radical Islamists, whether it's in Iraq or in Afghanistan or elsewhere. And you know how prolonged those conflicts are, how many casualties are caused. So I- I think there is a- there has to be a measure of fairness. There has to be a measure of reasonableness in projecting this kind of criticism against the Israeli army that is second to none in seeking to minimize civilian casualties while protecting our own civilians. You know, if Hamas would simply move these rockets out of the civilian areas, if they moved their command posts out of these homes and offices, then there wouldn't be any problem.-- JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you, Mr. Prime-- PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: You know it. And I know it. But the fact is they're sending thousands of rockets on our cities with the specific purpose of murdering our civilians from these places.-- JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you-- PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: What would you do? JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you-- PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: If it happened to Washington or to New York? You know damn well what you would do. JOHN DICKERSON: Mr. Prime Minister, let me ask-- PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: You'd do at the very least what we're doing. JOHN DICKERSON: --a broader question. Let me ask you a broader question that was articulated by Senator Bernie Sanders, which is distinct from the clashes over the last week. His argument is that the treatment of the Palestinians is- is so rough that they are marginalized, demonized in such a fashion that there can never be peace, never be a two-state solution, and that- that your treatment of the Palestinians outside of this week is- creates conditions that are always going to lead to this kind of unrest, not just the missile attacks, but the riots you see in cities. What's your response to that? PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: \u00a0Well, let's divide it into two. First of all, the- the Hamas is not is not attacking us because they're trying to increase the welfare of Palestinians. In fact, they're taking huge sums to build the terror tunnels, which we've been able to neutralize, to have rockets, missiles and other armaments. They're not building up Gaza. They're- they're doing everything in their power to turn it into a fortified terror camp in order to destroy Israel. And they openly say their goal is to destroy Israel. They're not interested in any kind of- any kind of coexistence, any kind of- the kind of peace, the four peace treaties that I've made with Arab countries that are changing the Middle East. They're trying everything in their power to avoid the path of peace and reconciliation. So I think any- any objective observer understands that Hamas is out to destroy the state of Israel and they're not- they're not a partner. And as far as the citizens of Israel or Arabs, I've done more than any other prime minister and spent billions and billions of dollars in Israeli shekels and five times more than all the previous governments combined to ensure the the that are Israeli Arab citizens, all of them,-- JOHN DICKERSON: Mr. Prime-- PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: --can be part of the Israeli miracle, the great economic success story. I've invested that because I believe in it. I didn't do it now and I didn't do it for CBS FACE THE NATION. I really believe in this. There has been a minority- a violent minority that has tried to challenge that as well and to kill innocent people. JOHN DICKERSON: Mr. Prime Minister, let me-- PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: I won't tolerate that. Neither Arabs killing Israelis-- JOHN DICKERSON: Before we lose you-- PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: --or Jews killing Arabs or Arabs killing Jews. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask- I want you to respond to one other thing before we go, which is your domestic challenges. You are under investigation for bribery, fraud, breach of trust. You've also had some difficulty, four failed attempts to put together a government in the last 23 months. This leads to the criticism that your current actions are basically an effort to stay in power. And what's your response to that? PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: That's preposterous. You know, I- when I was a young soldier, 18 years old, I held a fellow soldier who died in my arms. A few years later, my brother, my older brother, died while leading a rescue mission in Entebbe, Uganda, to release Israeli hostages. I've seen combatants fall. I've seen my brother fall. And I think anybody who knows me knows that I've never, ever subordinated security concerns, the life of our soldiers, the life of our citizens for political interests. That's just hogwash. I'll do what I have to do to protect the lives of Israeli citizens and to restore peace. I've made peace with four Arab countries. I'm glad that we have a restoration of some considerable calm within Israel. That's my goal, to restore peace and quiet and to assure tranquility and reconciliation for all. JOHN DICKERSON: But this is a persistent criticism, Mr. Prime Minister. Why do you think it persists? PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: It persists because I've been re-elected five times. It persists because I beat every other candidate in public polls and in direct election simulations, apparently the people of Israel, the majority, don't agree with this false criticism and the cynicism. They know that I'm standing there for Israel and I'm doing everything I can for the safety and prosperity of the Israeli people. By the way, all of Israel's citizens, Jews and Arabs alike. JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Mr. Prime Minister, we're out of time. Thanks so much for being with us. And we'll be right back in a minute. Stay with us.",

            "article_content": "Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire mogul and power broker who built a casino empire spanning from Las Vegas to China and became a singular force in domestic and international politics, has died after a long illness, his wife said Tuesday. Adelson died at 87 from complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Las Vegas Sands announced. At one point the third-richest man in the world, Adelson brought singing gondoliers to the Las Vegas Strip and went all-in betting Asia would be a bigger jackpot than Sin City. He was the son of Jewish immigrants, raised with two siblings in a Boston tenement, who over the second half of his life became one of the world's richest men. The chairman and CEO of the Las Vegas Sands Corp. foresaw correctly that Asia would be an even bigger market. In 2018, Forbes ranked him No. 15 in the U.S., worth an estimated $35.5 billion. \"If you do things differently, success will follow you like a shadow,\" he said during a 2014 talk to the gambling industry in Las Vegas. Blunt yet secretive, Adelson resembled an old-fashioned political boss and stood apart from most American Jews, who for decades have supported Democrats by wide margins. Adelson was considered the nation's most influential GOP donor over the final years of his life, at times setting records for individual contributions during a given election cycle. In 2012, Politico called him \"the dominant pioneer of the super PAC era.\" Adelson regularly hosted the party's top strategists and most ambitious candidates at his modest office, wedged among the casinos on the Strip. Throughout, he helped ensure that uncritical support of Israel became a pillar of the GOP platform, never more visibly demonstrated than when the Trump administration relocated the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018. The inflammatory move had been adamantly opposed by Palestinians and was long a priority for Adelson, who had even offered to help pay for it, and for the Republican Jewish Coalition, of which he was the primary benefactor. Adelson and his wife, Miriam, were front and center at the ceremony in Jerusalem.  \"Sheldon's life was one of great consequence,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement posted to Twitter. \"The world, Israel and the United States are safer because of his work.\" When asked at a gambling conference what he hoped his legacy would be, Adelson said it wasn't his glitzy casinos or hotels, it was his impact in Israel. He donated $25 million, a record sum for a private citizen, to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. He established a think tank in Jerusalem. He was closely aligned with the conservative Likud party and funded a widely read free daily newspaper called \"Israel Hayom,\" or \"Israel Today,\" so supportive of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that some Israelis nicknamed it \"Bibi-ton.\" In the U.S., Adelson helped underwrite congressional trips to Israel, helped build a new headquarters for the lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and later was a top supporter of the Israeli-American Council, whose conferences have attracted top Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence, and Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He sponsored \"Birthright\" trips to Israel for young Jewish adults that were criticized by some participants as intolerant of opposing views. His attachment to Israel was life-long and so deep that he once said he wished his military service had been in an Israeli uniform instead of an American one. Adelson was a late bloomer in business and in politics. He didn't become a casino owner, or a Republican, until well into middle age. Through the 1990s and after his wealth soared and his engagement in politics intensified. He was a supporter of President George W. Bush and backed Republican Rudolph Giuliani for the 2008 presidential race before turning to the eventual candidate, Senator John McCain, who lost to Barack Obama. \"Sheldon battled his way out of a tough Boston neighborhood to build a successful enterprise that loyally employed tens of thousands \u2014 and entertained millions,\" said Mr. Bush in a statement Tuesday. \"He was an American patriot and a strong supporter of Israel. Sheldon was a generous benefactor of charitable causes, especially medical research and Jewish heritage education. He will be missed by many \u2014 none more than his beloved family.\" Adelson's leverage grew considerably in 2010 after the Supreme Court's \"Citizens United\" decision lifted many restrictions on individual campaign contributions. He and his wife spent more than $90 million on the 2012 election, funding presidential candidate Newt Gingrich and later Mitt Romney, who also lost to Mr. Obama. \"I'm against very wealthy people attempting to or influencing elections,\" he told Forbes magazine in 2012. \"But as long as it's doable I'm going to do it.\" Adelson came around slowly to Donald Trump, who during the 2016 campaign had said he would be \"neutral\" in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr. Trump even ridiculed his initial liking for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, tweeting in 2015, \"Sheldon Adelson is looking to give big dollars to Rubio because he feels he can mold him into his perfect little puppet. I agree!\" Adelson eventually endorsed Mr. Trump but remained hesitant through much of 2016. He gave more than $20 million in the final weeks of the campaign after reports that he would contribute $100 million and was more generous with congressional races. But after Mr. Trump's surprise victory, the new president spoke often with Adelson and embraced his hardline views on the Middle East. He cut funding for Palestinian refugees and withdrew from the Obama administration's nuclear nonproliferation deal with Iran. He moved the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem even though earlier administrations \u2014 Democratic and Republican \u2014 avoided doing do because it directly challenged the Palestinian view that the ancient city should be part of any peace agreement. Adelson, in turn, aided Mr. Trump financially, including $5 million for his inauguration, and supported him through his media holdings. Late in 2015, Adelson secretly purchased the Las Vegas Review-Journal \u2014 the paper's own reporters revealed he was the new owner \u2014 and soon raised concerns he was imposing his own views. Some longtime staffers left in protest. In what was widely seen as a mark of the Adelsons' influence with Mr. Trump, Miriam Adelson was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2018. Adelson, who contributed more than $100 million to the 2018 off-year elections, held extraordinary power among Republicans even though he didn't always agree with them. In a 2012 interview with the Wall Street Journal, he called himself \"basically a social liberal,\" supporting abortion and immigrant rights. He cited taxes and differences over Israel as major reasons for leaving the Democratic Party. \"His life made him a fearless advocate for freedom and entrepreneurship and a source of counsel and support to a generation of conservatives, including me,\" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California. In Nevada, his influence was such that even the state's most prominent Democrat, Senator Harry Reid, hesitated to take him on. In a 2014 interview with MSNBC, the then-Senate majority leader differentiated between Adelson and fellow GOP billionaire donors Charles and David Koch. Reid had sharply criticized the Koch brothers as callous and greedy, while saying that he respected Adelson because he was \"not in it to make money,\" a widely challenged opinion.  He had previously told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow that he remained friends with Adelson despite their political differences. \"Sheldon Adelson and I still meet and have conversations. He has a problem, I try to help him,\" Reid said. Adelson was married twice. He and his first wife, Sandra, were divorced in 1988. Three years later, he married Miriam Farbstein-Ochshorn, an Israeli-born doctor he met on a blind date and whom many believe helped deepen his involvement with Israel. Their honeymoon trip to Venice inspired Adelson to raze the historic Sands hotel-casino, once a favorite hangout for Frank Sinatra among others, and replace them with a pair of massive complexes: The Venetian and The Palazzo, one of the city's tallest buildings. Sheldon Adelson adopted his first wife's three children and had two children with his second wife. Among numerous philanthropic projects, he and Miriam Adelson were especially committed to the research and treatment of substance abuse, a personal cause for Sheldon Adelson. His son Mitchell, from his first marriage, died of an overdose in 2005. (Sheldon Adelson would spend millions opposing state efforts to legalize marijuana). Sheldon Garry Adelson was born in 1933, in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston. His father was a taxi driver, his mother the manager of a knitting store. A natural entrepreneur, he was selling newspapers by age 12 and running a vending machine business at 16. After dropping out of City College of New York and serving in the Army, he attempted to start dozens of businesses, from toiletries to de-icing windshields. Adelson, who said he disdained email, began to amass his fortune with a technology trade show, starting computer convention COMDEX in 1979 with partners before selling his stake in 1995 for more than $800 million.  When he bought the Sands Hotel in 1989, he was thinking convention space, not just gambling, would make money. It did. He built a convention hall to keep his hotel rooms full on weekdays and others soon followed the business model. Meanwhile, his effort to replicate the Strip in Macao, the only place in China where casino gambling is legal, made his wealth grow exponentially. When faced with water and marshland, Adelson directed his company to build land where there wasn't any, piling sand up to create the Cotai Peninsula. Soon his Macao revenue outstripped that of his Las Vegas holdings. He later expanded his business to Singapore, where his Marina Bay Sands hotel and its infinity pool were featured in the hit film \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" and had been pressing to open a casino in Japan. His Macao business also spawned a long-running wrongful termination lawsuit brought by a former chief of Sands China Ltd. who accused Adelson and the company of firing him for exposing a host of misdeeds. Adelson often clashed with attorneys while appearing on a Clark County courtroom's witness stand. The Sands China lawsuit was among dozens involving Adelson, whose cases included his suing a Wall Street Journal reporter for calling him \"foul-mouthed\" (the parties settled, the words remained) to being sued by his sons from his first marriage for cheating them out of money (he won). A long-running feud with fellow casino tycoon Steve Wynn turned to friendship when Wynn joined Adelson's effort to end online gambling. Critics said Adelson was trying to stifle competition. Adelson countered that there was no way to ensure children and teenagers wouldn't gamble and said he was \"not in favor of it exploiting the world's most vulnerable people.\" Mr. Trump's election would again prove useful to Adelson. During the Obama administration, the Justice Department said online gambling that does not involve sporting events would not violate the Wire Act, a 1961 federal statute. In a legal opinion that became public early in 2019, the department reversed itself and decided the statute applies to any form of gambling.",

            "article_content": "Poland, near the Belarus border \u2014\u00a0Poland's defense chief said Wednesday that migrants gathered in Belarus had been \"attacking\" his country's barbed wire-lined border again over night. Defense Minister Mariusz Blaszczak warned that the standoff between Poland and Belarus, in which thousands of migrants and refugees are caught in the middle, could last months. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports that Polish forces \u2014 about 15,000 of whom have been deployed to secure the border \u2014 unleashed tear gas and water cannons on migrants who tried to breach the fence on Tuesday. It was some of the worst violence along the border in recent weeks. Poland, the European Union and the U.S. accuse Belarus of orchestrating the migrant crisis, by luring thousands of desperate people from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other nations marred by violence into his country, with the promise being a relatively easy crossing over its frontier onto the EU soil of Poland. But Poland has made it clear that migrants and refugees are not welcome. Belarusian strongman President Alexander Lukashenko's motivation for the purported \"hybrid warfare\" tactic, according to the EU, has been to retaliate for sanctions levied against his regime by Europe over a crackdown on dissent following Belarusian elections that many believe were far from democratic. Russia has denied involvement in the tense standoff, but Lukashenko said on Tuesday that he could ask his ally Vladimir Putin, \"to get involved and, if necessary, provide appropriate assistance.\" The escalating crisis along the Polish border may be of Belarus's making, but the apparent plan to use migrants as a human battering ram has turned both sides into a battlefield.  Polish police firing water cannons, volleys of tear gas and a hail of rubber bullets sent refugees running in retreat on Tuesday. Poland's harsh response has compounded the suffering of the most vulnerable among the thousands of people who've been camped out in woodland, living in medieval conditions in sub-freezing temperatures. The Polish border guard service said on Wednesday morning that it had detected 161 illegal crossing attempts, including two new \"forceful\" attempts overnight. For migrants who do manage to get across, a different nightmare awaits: Hiding out in the forests and dodging Polish police, who will haul them back to the border. Anna Alboth, a Polish aid worker who has helped refugees all over the world, is now trying to help people caught up in the crisis unfolding on her own doorstep. \"There are probably around 1,500 people right now in the Polish forests,\" she told CBS News. \"Those are people who need everything \u2014 who need food, who need water, who need medicine, who need clothes \u2014 they have nothing right now.\" But the Polish government has forbidden aid agencies, and journalists, from entering an exclusion zone about two miles around the actual border. The area is teeming with as many as 20,000 security forces, all ready to turn back anybody who tries to get in, from either side.  Under international law, refugees who come from conflict zones should be allowed to apply for asylum. But aid workers, including Alboth, say the Polish authorities aren't allowing that process to happen. Both Polish and Belarusian authorities have been accused of illegal \"push-backs,\" when migrants or refugees are forced back across a border without consideration for their safety. The lack of access has left Alboth feeling powerless to help.  \"We have to stop it. We have to force [the] Polish government to let international organizations, humanitarian organizations, to get into the zone to give people absolutely, at least, water and food,\" she told D'Agata. \"We can't look away.",

            "article_content": "Berlin\u00a0\u2014 the world was still weeks, possibly even months away from confirmation of who the new German Chancellor will be on Monday, as the focus shifted toward forming a coalition government a day after national elections. Whoever eventually takes over the top job in Europe's biggest economy, the candidates spent weeks falling over themselves to prove who would most closely resemble outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel.\u00a0 As CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay reported, there was a new, Angela Merkel-shaped hole in global politics on Monday morning. After 16 years in office, the former research scientist and daughter of a Lutheran preacher was finally saying \"aufedersein\" as the leader of her country.\u00a0 Merkel has been lauded as a bulwark of Europe who helped save the European Union from imploding during the Euro financial crisis.\u00a0 Her secret? A stoic calm that not only influenced German society, it came to define it, according to political scientist Frank Stauss.\u00a0 \"There's a lot of common sense in [the] German public, and maybe even due to her,\" he told CBS News. Merkel's legacy spanned four American presidencies. She befriended some, including Barack Obama, but clashed with others, including his successor, Donald Trump. As Trump retreated from international affairs, David Deissner, the executive director of the German political consultancy Atlantik-Br\u00fccke, said many people in Europe and around the globe looked to Merkel as the new leader of the free world.\u00a0 \"The Trump years make clear that Western values [are] not only represented by the United States,\" Deissner told Livesay. \"This is why many people said she was carrying the torch of Western values and freedom.\"\u00a0 While Trump worked to keep migrants and refugees out of his country, building a wall along the southern U.S. border, Merkel opened Germany's doors to more than 1 million refugees. It was her shining moment, according to most Germans. \u00a0 \"I'm proud with all these refugees that came to Germany,\" one woman on the streets of the German capital said. \"It was a fantastic sign, and people look in another way now on Germany.\" \"It was a good thing,\" agreed a younger resident. \"But then, the question is how you deal with it.\" There was indeed a backlash to her welcoming policy: On Merkel's watch, a far-right party entered parliament for the first time since WWII, and anti-migrant movements took hold across Europe. In Hungary, they erected a fence along the border.\u00a0 Once heralded as the leader of the free world, Merkel now leaves the reins of the most powerful country in Europe \u2014 as well as many of the tensions she sought to resolve \u2014 for her successor to pick up.\u00a0 Germany's center-left Social Democrats party narrowly came out ahead of Merkel's center-right bloc in Sunday's voting. But it was hardly a rebuke of Merkel's leadership \u2014 the leader of the winning party, Olaf Scholz, has been Merkel's own finance minister for several years. Scholz made it clear on Monday that he would look to form a coalition government with some of the smaller parties, including the environmentally-focused Greens, quickly. He said he hoped to have a government formed by the new year.\u00a0 Once Time Magazine's Person of the Year, she now leaves the reins of the most powerful country in Europe, as well as many of the tensions she sought to resolve, in the hands of her successor.\u00a0 Scholz, who may well be that person, is known to project the same sense of calm that Merkel brought to the job, and he even uses some of the same hand gestures.",

            "article_content": "Damascus\u00a0\u2014 The civil\u00a0war in Syria may no longer be headline news as the world struggles through the coronavirus pandemic, but a decade after the crisis began, Syria's people continue to suffer as much as ever, and finding a solution couldn't be more urgent.\u00a0 Appalling statistics highlight the comprehensive grimness of this 10-year anniversary.  Some 12 million Syrians \u2014 half the pre-war population \u2014 have fled their homes in search of safety, many of them multiple times. More than 5.5 million have become refugees in neighboring nations, and hundreds of thousands more are scattered across 130 countries. Another 6.7 million Syrians are internally displaced \u2014 refugees in their own land.  The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) says most of the country is now living with food insecurity. More than 90% of Syria's population is surviving on less than $1 per day. Barely a town or village in Syria has been spared from the violence which, according to U.N. estimates, has claimed 400,000 lives.  The war has left Syria's economy in tatters. Last week, Syria's currency plummeted to a record-low value of 4,040 pounds to the dollar on the black market, compared to 700 at the beginning of the year. Housing, basic food items \u2014 scarce in many areas even for those with the piles of money needed to buy them \u2014 and health care are all unattainable for millions of people.\u00a0  The war started in 2011, when Syrians enraged by corruption and emboldened by a wave of \"Arab Spring\" protests across the region took to the streets to demand democratic accountability for their leaders. The protests started in March that year and quickly morphed into an armed insurgency, and eventually a full-blown war, with the U.S. and Europe supporting rebels aiming to topple President Bashar Assad. With significant foreign support for the rebels, many thought Assad would only manage to cling to power for months. But the fighting dragged on for years. The rebels made significant gains, but so, too, did extremist groups. The chaos of the war allowed ISIS, al Qaeda and other terror groups to seize more than 70% of Syria's territory.  Then in September 2015, Russia jumped into the war with both feet. President Vladimir Putin sent forces to back up Assad's on the ground and warplanes to attack not only the extremist groups, but in some cases the rebels backed by the West.  For Moscow, Assad's overthrow would have been a serious blow: The old Soviet Union had at one time enjoyed real political influence across the region, with strong alliances in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Algeria and Yemen, but Putin's Russia had only one remaining foothold in the Middle East, in Syria. Putin saved Assad, and the Syrian president is now planning to run for a new seven-year term in June elections. While Assad's regime is now back in control of most of the country, there's no end in sight to the war. Nearly a third of the country, mostly in the north, is still controlled by rebel forces, and the conflict has only become more complicated given the significant investments by foreign powers like Russia and the U.S.  What began as a simple confrontation between the government and its domestic opponents has evolved into a geopolitical quagmire. Still caught in the middle, with little cause for optimism, are the Syrian people. \"Beyond the need for stout, instant humanitarian backing, the Syrian people whose lives have been upended for years deserve genuine endeavors in the search for a fitting solution for all,\" Sami Ammar, a school teacher in downtown Damascus, told CBS News. \"I don't think there is a more perplexing active conflict than the Syrian war. I know a solution is not easy, but world powers should do whatever they can to end the nightmare.\" \u00a0 The United Nations Security Council has been unable to take any meaningful action to end the crisis, paralyzed by both Assad's ally Russia and China wielding veto power as permanent members. Russia has vetoed 16 Security Council Resolutions related to Syria, and it was backed by China on many of those occasions. President Joe Biden's administration said last week that Assad had done nothing to restore his legitimacy, and it rejected any restoration of official ties with his government \"anytime soon.\" In a statement marking a decade of civil war, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that while Syria had fallen off front pages around the world, \"the situation remains a living nightmare.\"  \"The war should end right away,\" said Ibtisam Lama\u00e1, a mother of five who lost her husband in a mortar attack in Damascus four years ago. \"I need to provide my kids with better prospects - better education and a brighter future.\" \"It is a hard life, I know, but I am dreaming of that day when I will see my sons and daughters [become] doctors or architects,\" she told CBS News, her voice trembling with emotion. Even when the war does finally end, it will take decades to repair the damage.",

Hanif, now 30, can still recall the shock of the moment, her confusion over how anyone could look at her, a child, and see a threat. \"It's not a nice, kind word,\" she said. \"It means violence, it means dangerous. It is meant to shock whoever is on the receiving end of it.\"\u00a0 But the incident also spurred a determination to speak out for herself and others. Hanif is today a community organizer who is favored by many to win a seat on the New York City Council in an upcoming municipal election. Saturday marks the 20-year anniversary of 9/11. Weeks after the attacks, Arab and Muslim Americans like Hanif became targets of hate crimes and violence.\u00a0 \"There was a significant and very vocal minority at the beginning that harbored negative views of Muslims,\" said Dalia Mogahed, research director for the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, a Michigan think tank that studies social trends impacting Muslim Americans. Two decade on, hostility persists. The Iraq War, launched in 2003, helped fuel some Americans' antipathy toward Muslims, as did political rhetoric from Republicans during the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, Mogahed said.\u00a0 A recent poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research conducted ahead of the 9/11 anniversary found that 53% of Americans hold unfavorable views toward Islam, compared with 42% who have favorable ones. This stands in contrast to Americans' much more favorable opinions about Christianity and Judaism.\u00a0 A Pew Research Center\u00a0study\u00a0this month also found that although the U.S. Muslim population is growing, to almost 4 million people of all races, Muslims in this country still face negative views in daily life. And a 2020\u00a0poll\u00a0from Mogahed's organization found that Muslim Americans are more likely than any other group that experiences religious discrimination to experience bias on an \"institutional level,\" such as when going through an airport, applying for a job, receiving medical care or interacting with law enforcement.\u00a0 Hoping to fight the discrimination that followed 9/11, many Muslim Americans in the ensuing years ran for local political office or launched nonprofits aimed at teaching people about the Islamic faith, according to Mogahed. \"There was an urgent desire to educate the public that didn't exist before that,\" she said. Small businesses and corporate workplaces are also venues for educating. There are about 100,000 Muslim-owned businesses in the U.S., according to a 2012 study from Missouri think tank Strategic Research Circle. About half of them operated in Chicago, Houston and New York City at the time.\u00a0 In the Bronx, New York, 31-year-old Mohamed Nageeb told CBS MoneyWatch that customers at his grocery store are much more welcoming than years past, but that wasn't always the case. Nageeb said his father told him stories years ago about how anti-Muslim customers would try to inflict damage on the family business \u2014 some people threw grocery items about the store, others simply stopped coming to the 30-year-old establishment altogether, he said.\u00a0 \"People used to steal and loot right in front of you and say you can't do anything about it basically because you are a terrorist,\" Nageeb aid.\u00a0 These days, Nageeb said the way New Yorkers often accept him, his faith and his family has greatly improved. The community has been equally accepting of other Muslim Americans as well, he said. \"People treat us as family,\" Nageeb said. \"After all these years have gone by, I guess us going through school and jobs, people got to know us much better.\"\u00a0 Shukri Olow, 34, fled civil war with her family and lived in refugee camps in Kenya for years before coming to the U.S. in 1997 when she was 10. Growing up in Kent, Washington, a midsized city south of Seattle, she felt embraced by her community, Olow said. Then 9/11 happened. She recalls feeling confused when a teacher asked her, \"What are your people doing?\" But Olow also remembers others who defended Muslim Americans and worried about her safety. \"For those of us who live at the intersection of anti-Blackness and Islamophobia ... it was really hard,\" said Olow, who is now seeking a seat on the King County Council. \"There are many young people who have multiple identities who have felt that they don't belong here, that they are not welcomed here,\" she said. \"I was one of those young people. And so I try to do what I can to make sure that more of us know that this is our nation, too. Ishaq Pathan, 26, recalls the time a boy told him he seemed angry and wondered if he was going to blow up their Connecticut school. In another incident that lingers, he was taken aside at an airport for additional questioning upon returning to the U.S. after a college semester in Morocco. The agent looked through his belongings, including the laptop where he kept a private journal, and started reading it, Pathan said. \"I remember being like, 'Hey, do you have to read that?'\" he said. \"The agent just looks at me like, 'You know, I can read anything on your computer. I'm entitled to anything here.' And at that point, I remember having tears in my eyes. I was completely and utterly powerless.\" Widespread negative attitudes toward Muslim Americans are likely to persist until more non-Muslims probe and confront their own feelings, Mogahed said. That starts with doing your own research on the Islamic faith and becoming friends with a Muslim American, she suggested.\u00a0 \"There's no easy solution,\" Mogahed said. \"It's going to take education and relationship-building.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Khristopher J.

            "article_content": "Moscow - Evan Neumann, whose participation in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol landed him on the FBI's Most Wanted List, has accused American authorities of going \"back to the Middle Ages\" and abandoning the rule of law in their handling of ex-President Donald Trump's supporters. Neumann fled prosecution in the U.S. by traveling to Europe, eventually making it into Russian-allied Belarus, where he's now appeared on state-run TV to complain about his home country's leadership and make his case for \"asylum\" in the nation often dubbed Europe's last dictatorship. In a special broadcast late Thursday night on Belarusian state TV, Neumann spoke of a grueling journey through the forests near the Chernobyl exclusion zone to get into Belarus. He wants Belarus to grant him political asylum to avoid criminal prosecution back at home on six charges related to the January 6 attack on the U.S. Congress. In court files, the FBI said Neumann spent around four hours at the Capitol during the riot and verbally and physically abused police officers, including \"forcefully shoving [a] metal barricade\" into a line of officers before breaking into the building. Neumann initially sought refuge in the Ukrainian city of Zhytomyr, but claims he was followed by local law enforcement \u2014 likely, he said, on U.S. orders. \"The FBI found out which country I went to and what city I was in, and then, just two weeks later, I was told that the Ukrainian police were looking for me in Zhytomyr,\" Neumann told Belarusian TV. He said he then fled the country \"wearing one set of clothes with a thousand dollars\" on him. \"I know that Belarus resists the West. Besides that, your country was closer to me than Russia,\" Neumann said, explaining his decision to a Belarusian reporter. Neumann has asked the country's longtime ruler Alexander Lukashenko to offer him formal government protection, to keep him from the reach of American law enforcement. The 48-year-old owner of a small company bemoaned \"political repressions\" in the U.S. and claimed that he would face torture if he was sent back to the U.S. \"What they do to people like me? They keep you in solitary confinement for eight months, beat you. Torture is common,\" Neumann said, later adding with a smile. \"I'm not strong enough to withstand torture.\" There have been no allegations of torture leveled by any of the January 6 rioters detained in the U.S., but the lawyer for one man who was sentenced this week for assaulting a police officer has claimed \"repugnant\" conditions in the Washington, D.C., jail where he's been held, including purported threats of violence. Neumann's interview, which aired on Belarus' most-watched, state-run channel, was likely welcomed by the Lukashenko regime as useful propaganda as Belarus remains locked in a diplomatic standoff, with increasingly dire security implications, with the West. Lukashenko, as well as his closest ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin, have repeatedly used the attack on the Capitol and American officials' response to it to criticize U.S. democracy. Both have accused Washington of having \"undemocratic\" double standards, as the U.S. routinely criticizes Russia and Belarus for their authoritarian tendencies while prosecuting the Capitol rioters, who are routinely characterized by media in Moscow and Minsk as protesters. Last year, Belarus was engulfed in mass protests after a presidential election that the outside world saw as deeply flawed, but in which Lukashenko claimed a resounding victory. Many Belarusians and outside observers said the outcome was falsified, believing Lukashenko's main opponent, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, really had an advantage and likely won. That outcome would have ended Lukashenko's 26-year rule. To quash the monthlong unrest and silence his opponents, Lukashenko launched a brutal crackdown on protesters, activists and independent journalists, permitting law enforcement to use the harshest methods. Thousands ended up in detention centers, many later recalled callous beatings, torture, and even rape while in state custody. To solidify his grip on power, the Belarusian ruler left most of his political rivals imprisoned, while police have continued to prosecute Belarusians for such minor things as hanging the opposition's white-and-red flag from their balconies. The U.S. and the European Union have imposed harsh sanctions in response, hitting industries that provided cash for the regime. A few months ago, an enraged Lukashenko threatened to flood Europe with drugs and migrants. Europe and the U.S. believe he's tried to make good on that threat by easing travel for refugees and migrants via Minsk to the EU's border, which has resulted in an ongoing crisis at the Polish frontier. In his interview with the Belarusian reporter, Neumann said he'd lived in Moscow in 1994 and complained that both Russia and Belarus were being \"demonized\" by Western media. He called U.S. sanctions against the countries \"a form of terrorism.\" Neumann added that he would like to return to the United States, but only if he was guaranteed safety. Otherwise he said he would hope to remain in Belarus and get an IT job. \"Belarus showed me a lot of support, I want to do this country a favor and I respond with being a productive and good citizen,\" he said.",

Only a fraction of the festival's 113 feature premieres have been previewed at press time. Of those, here are some highlights:  \"Alien on Stage\" (NYC Premiere) \u2014 When New Jersey high school students went viral with their stage production of the Ridley Scott sci-fi thriller \"Alien\" a few years back, it was a bracing reminder of the power of creative young minds \u2014 and the powerful hold that pop culture and nostalgia can have on us. A similar bracing feeling is fostered in Danielle Kummer and Lucy Harvey's fun tale of bus drivers from Dorset, England, who put on an amateur theatrical production of \"Alien.\" When opening night arrives, it's not exactly a hit, but it earns a fan following that propels the amateur troupe to London, when they're invited to bring their show to the West End. How's that for a Hollywood ending? But the road to West End success is plenty bumpy, with problems (like a xenomorph) rearing their ugly heads right up until the curtain rises. \"Alien on Stage\" is a hilarious testament to theatrical dreams, and the durability of the original film's ability to tease and terrify audiences, even those looking for camp laughs. Screens Nov. 14, 15 at IFC Center; Nov. 15-28 online.  \"Citizen Ashe\" (NYC Premiere) \u2014 Arthur Ashe's rise \u2014 becoming, in the words of one, \"the Jackie Robinson of tennis\" \u2014 might have been less spectacular had he not been the African American son of a maintenance worker, who was gifted with lessons by a coach driven to teach Black boys and girls to succeed on the court in segregated Virginia, in a sport dominated by White players. But the timing of his ascendency, concurrent with the 1960s civil rights movement, also thrust Ashe into a very public conundrum: should he speak out from within the conservative, almost all-White tennis establishment, and align himself with more militant Black athletes on the world stage? The conflict was as much about personal attitudes as about politics, but \"Citizen Ashe\" examines how the tennis star \u2014 the only Black man to win the Wimbledon singles championship \u2014 learned to gauge and modify his impact on the world as a celebrity and activist, and how his advocacy \u2014 as an opponent of apartheid, and a supporter of AIDS patients (of which he was one) \u2014 shaped his legacy beyond the court. And it's not all politics; the film's analysis of Ashe's victory over Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon in 1975 is a rich and eye-opening distillation of strategy, tactics, and the role of personality on the court. Directed by Sam Pollard (\"MLK/FBI\") and Rex Milller (\"Althea\"). Screens Nov. 13 at SVA Theatre; Nov. 14-28 online. \"Comala\" (U.S. Premiere) \u2014 Mexican filmmaker Gian Cassini's powerful personal essay explores the hole created by the influence and absence of his late estranged father, known as El Jimmy. Even as he tries to unravel the details of Jimmy's life and how he became a hitman in Tijuana, Cassini's more immediate concern is to explore the impact Jimmy had on his mother, his half-siblings, other extended family members, and Jimmy's various girlfriends, whose lives all appear distorted, compromised or scarred by Jimmy's infidelities, lies and violence. Through old videos, photographs, and interviews with family on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, Cassini crafts an intriguing true-crime investigation that teases out the psyche of his father, who appears to have been shouldering the psychological damage wrought by the shady past of his own father (Cassini's granddad). Screens Nov. 13, 14 at Cinepolis; Nov. 14-28 online.  \"End of the Line\" (World Premiere) \u2014 New York City's century-old subway system is a marvel of engineering, but it is also a hundred years old, and as its millions of daily riders will tell you, it is a source of frustration due to aging components, lack of upkeep, delays and overcrowding. [Never mind the Pizza Rats.] So, when damage from Superstorm Sandy necessitated some drastic action to upgrade infrastructure, requiring an entire line be shut down for a year and a half, another storm \u2014 of protests \u2014 ensued. Into this political fray came a new president of the NYC Transit Authority, whose enthusiasm for upgrading the system was met with the maelstrom of a mayor, governor and MTA Board that seemed in perpetual conflict. Director Emmett Adler explores how public transportation is at the mercy of events and personalities outside of its control, and yet is expected to function fully, even during a pandemic, as the lifeblood of a metropolis. Screens Nov. 12, 17 at Cinepolis; Nov. 13-28 online.  \"Exposing Muybridge\" (World Premiere) \u2014 Photographer Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904) is best remembered for his photographic motion studies of horses galloping and men wrestling \u2014 image tests that presaged motion pictures in both form and narrative. But during his lifetime his photographic legacy \u2014 which would inspire countless artists since \u2014 was somewhat overshadowed by the scandalous murder trial for having killed his wife's lover (the jury acquitted him). With the commentary of scholars and collectors (such as actor Gary Oldman), director Marc Shaffer traces the high and low points of Muybridge's life, with the pinnacle being his 1870s series of sequential photographs taken at a horse track, which made his name, until it was effectively erased from a published version of the images. Muybridge rebounded by entering into a prolific period under commission from the University of Pennsylvania to continue his locomotion studies. The university officials no doubt looked quizzically at Muybridge's pictures of nubile women dumping water on each other, but it was all in the interest of science. Screens Nov. 13 at IFC Center, Nov. 15 at Cinepolis; Nov. 14-28 online. \"Exposure\" (NYC Premiere) \u2014 In 2018 a group of women from several Eastern and Western countries participated in a 100-kilometer skiing expedition to the North Pole. The trek was noteworthy not only for being an all-female team (joined by director Holly Morris and cinematographers Kathryn Barrows and Ingeborg Jakobsen), but also for being possibly the last over-ice trip to the North Pole due to the ever-increasing melting of polar ice. The movie is an intimate look at the women who signed on for the trip, most of whom were novices in polar exploration, and their unique bonding exercise in a hostile environment, as they maneuver cracking sea ice, grueling physical challenges, and the onset of frostbite. An evocative portrait of human endurance, and how climate change is affecting one of the world's most alluring, and deadly, places. Screens Nov. 13, 16 at Cinepolis; Nov. 14-28 online.  \"F@ck This Job\" and \"We Are Russia\" (U.S. Premieres) \u2014 The opposition to Vladimir Putin during his reign as leader of Russia is explored in films that juggle the hopes of a young generation for a freer nation, and the pessimism of Russians who feel themselves under the boot heel of an authoritarian state. \"F@ck This Job\" tells the story of the TV station Dozhd, an independent media outlet that was founded as a source of optimistic television news but grew to butt heads with the government over its unflattering coverage of national news, elections, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The station's owners and staff face arrest, violence, eviction, and financial disaster when cable outlets are mysteriously directed to drop their channel. Director Vera Krichevskaya's film, spanning a decade of history during which Putin worked to enshrine his hold on the nation into the constitution itself, shows how journalists and media mavens question their mission when they find themselves targeted for holding the powerful to account, and become increasingly despondent that change will come to Russia for as long as Putin lives.  \"We Are Russia\" follows young activists and campaign staffers for opposition candidate Alexei Navalny as they bravely participate in street protests leading up to the country's 2018 presidential election, before Navalny's near-fatal poisoning (apparently by an FSB agent) and later imprisonment by Russian authorities. Director Alexandra Dalsbaek puts viewers in the thick of danger, as activists lay their lives on the line to spread word on social media about Navalny and the political situation in Russia, and (not inconsequentially) even turn reluctant parents to their cause.  \"F@ck This job\" screens Nov. 12 at Cinepolis, Nov. 18 at IFC Center; Nov. 13-28 online. \"We Are Russia\" screens Nov. 11, 12 at Cinepolis; Nov. 12-28 online.  \"Kurt Vonnegut: Unstuck in Time\" (World Premiere) \u2014 It shouldn't take 40 years to make a movie. But then, Robert Weide and Don Argott's reverential exploration of the life of the satirical novelist and essayist would be nothing without the decades-long odyssey of Weide (a documentary filmmaker and director of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\") to profile Vonnegut, who graciously agreed to be filmed back in the early '80s, and in numerous encounters over the ensuing years. The author's puckish humor is clear even when discussing the most painful events of his life, from surviving the World War II firebombing of Dresden while being held in a POW camp (enshrined in his breakthrough novel, \"Slaughterhouse-Five\"), to the death of his beloved sister from cancer and the suicide of his mother. He is also forthright about navigating the rocky life of a working writer until finding his sea legs as a counter-culture figure with such novels as \"Cat's Cradle\" and \"Breakfast of Champions.\" Vonnegut steers clear of some topics, like his divorce and remarriage (though the kids have much to say about that), but his bonhomie with Weide is effusive. Weide's appreciation over Vonnegut's generosity of spirit actually threatens his project; he finds himself wrapped up in the weighty responsibility of tying down his film 14 years after his friend's death. It's a fulsome tribute to a writer who could never be accused of being warm and fuzzy, but who believed being funny was key to living a purposeful life. So it goes. Screens Nov. 11 at IFC Center; Nov. 12-13 online. \"The Real Charlie Chaplin\" (NYC Premiere) \u2014 Blending recordings of the legendary film comedian and director with re-enactments lends an immediacy to the story of the immigrant artist who found unprecedented fame, and then ignominy, as one of Hollywood's leading lights. Directors Peter Middleton and James Spinney (\"Notes on Blindness\") follow the story of Chaplin's life and career, including his entrance into the fledgling movie industry, his perfectionism, his romantic entanglements, his parodistic attack on another mustachioed world figure, and the stresses on his family due to his workaholism. A richly entertaining glimpse into the heart and ambition of an unabashed genius. Screens Nov. 12 at Cinepolis; Nov. 13-28 online. Debuts on Showtime December 11.  \"The Rossellinis\" (U.S. Premiere) \u2014 Italian director Roberto Rossellini was celebrated for his neo-realist works, such as \"Rome: Open City.\" And he was vilified for the scandal of his adulterous love affair with actress Ingrid Bergman, which would lead to their marriage (his second of three, to women from three different countries). Rossellini had a total of six children, some of whom (such as actress Isabella Rossellini) followed in his footsteps in cinema, while others ran in the other direction. One of his grandsons, Allessandro Rossellini (a biracial boy born of Roberto's oldest son and an African American dancer), turns the camera onto himself and his Rossellini diaspora in this intriguing family reunion, which examines layers of familial discord, sparked by a celebrated but difficult patriarch, stirred by the paparazzi, and stretched by sibling jealousies. Allessandro also reunites with his mother, living in a New York City nursing home, a shadow of a woman wracked by alcoholism and drug abuse. It's an affecting piece of self-analysis about fame, blood ties and responsibility, conducted on a couple of generations who share a surname and, in varying forms, a psychic wound. Screens Nov. 14 at SVA Theatre, Nov. 16 at IFC Center; Nov. 15-28 online. \"Storm Lake\" (NYC Premiere) \u2014 Small-town newspapers are an endangered species nowadays, but their civic purpose is undeniable, as detailed in Jerry Risius and Beth Levison's engrossing portrait of the daily lives of reporters and staff at the family-run Storm Lake Times, in Storm Lake, Iowa. Their twice-a-week paper, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 2017, nonetheless faces real financial challenges, as they present a journal of life in their increasingly diversified Midwest community, from politics (as Democratic hopefuls stream through their neck of the woods for the presidential caucuses) to the COVID-19 pandemic (which shuts down businesses on whom the paper depends for advertising). The film's intimacy mirrors the neighborly, personable content of the newspaper, whose pages may not exactly fly out of the vending machines, but which nonetheless projects the values of small-town America, with recipes. Screens Nov. 11, 12 at IFC Center; Nov. 12-14 online. Premieres on PBS' \"Independent Lens\" Nov. 15. \"The United States vs. Reality Winner\" (U.S. Premiere) \u2014 When a young analyst and Air Force veteran improbably named Reality Winner printed out and mailed a copy of a classified U.S. intelligence report on Russia's cyberattacks aimed at influencing the 2016 presidential election to the website The Intercept, she shouldn't have been surprised that her actions would attract the attention of government prosecutors, who charged her under the Espionage Act. Winner explained that she took the action to raise alarm bells as a whistleblower, but her imprisonment would divide critics and supporters of the Trump administration, which seemed to be punishing her for raising the specter of the Kremlin's impact on Trump's electoral victory. Director Sonia Kennebeck adds recreations to audio obtained of Winner's interrogation by the FBI and her jailhouse phone calls, as well as interviews with Winner's parents and sister, and with journalists at the Intercept (whose misjudgments possibly set up Winner for arrest). The result is an intense debate about the pursuit of truth, the responsibilities of citizens, and what counts towards preserving \"national security\" when our national security itself is under attack. Screens Nov. 13 at IFC Center, Nov. 15 at Cinepolis; Nov. 14-28 online.  There are dozens of shorts (curated into programs), and only one has been previewed at press time, but it is not to be missed: \"Phenomena,\" by artist and filmmaker Josef Gatti, features psychedelic and gobsmackingly beautiful imagery through scientific experiments that capture patterns in matter that demonstrate different forces of nature, from magnetism, gravity and energy to soundwaves, electricity and light. The dances by particles of metallic fluid directed by magnetic waves are mesmerizing. And it's all done with microphotography \u2013 no CGI, thank you.

            "article_content": "Johannesburg\u00a0\u2014 It's been nearly one year since Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops in to crush rebellious forces in the country's northern Tigray region. In that time Abiy's standing as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate for ending the war with neighboring Eritrea has been undermined, as those same troops have been accused of committing unspeakable atrocities. \u00a0 Now there are fears that the Tigrayan army he claimed he would defeat could head towards the capital, Addis Ababa. Over the weekend, fighters from the Tigrayan Defence Force seized control of parts of Dessie, a city just less than 250 miles from Addis Ababa, and captured Kombolcha, with its major airport. With control over those two cities, the Tigrayans effectively control access to a major highway leading to the capital. \u00a0 In an act of hubris, Abiy claimed that an offensive he launched in October would recapture the Tigrayan capital of Mekele in just 10 days, but that initiative has been left in tatters as the Tigrayan forces make their most decisive advances since they took back Mekele in June.\u00a0 Abiy has now issued a terrifying call for citizens to take up arms to defend his government \u2014 demanding that loyalists double efforts to defend the seat of power using \"any type of weapon\" available to them.\u00a0  \"Dying for Ethiopia is a duty for all of us,\" declared the prime minister. \u00a0 Ethiopia is a multi-ethnic country with a long history of inter-ethnic violence and resentment. The country has dozens of different ethnic groups, but five, the Oromo, Amhara, Tigrayan, Afar and Somali, represent 85% of the population. These groups were, at one point, all represented in the political system governing the country, but that system has broken down. \u00a0 The immediate trigger for the current military conflict was Tigray's decision to hold an unauthorized election in 2020, after Abiy postponed national elections citing the coronavirus pandemic. On November 4, 2020, Abiy sent the Ethiopian military into Tigray, claiming he was responding to an attack by Tigrayans on a government military camp. The conflict has escalated since then, taking a devastating toll on both civilians and military forces. As many as several hundred thousand people are believed to have been killed, but the exact numbers are unknown, as very few journalists have been allowed in to report on the crisis. The war has led to accusations of ethnic cleansing and frequent claims of rape, massacre and widespread human rights abuses. It has also created a desperate humanitarian crisis. Abiy has blocked food aid convoys from reaching up to a million people trapped, mostly women and children, who are near starvation in the region where the conflict is taking place. When the United Nations strongly condemned this, accusing Abiy's government of using hunger as a weapon of war, U.N. personnel were booted out of the country. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 In addition to the U.N., Doctors Without Borders and the Norwegian Refugee Council have also been banned, making it extremely difficult to get aid into affected areas. \u00a0\u00a0 It's estimated that about 4.5 million people are in need of aid, and about 1 million are in areas that are currently inaccessible. In June, the U.N. estimated that 400,000 people were already at risk of famine-like conditions, and the situation has only deteriorated since then. The international reaction hasn't been particularly strong, and with attention focused elsewhere the explosive nature of the crisis might go unnoticed. \u00a0\u00a0 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Twitter that Washington was alarmed by the reports of the takeover of the two towns, saying \"continued fighting would prolong the dire humanitarian crisis.\" \u00a0 The United States is alarmed by reports of the TPLF takeover of Dessie and Kombolcha. Continued fighting prolongs the dire humanitarian crisis in northern Ethiopia. All parties must stop military operations and begin ceasefire negotiations without preconditions. The U.S. envoy for the Horn of Africa, Jeffrey Feltman, said on Tuesday that Washington opposed any attempt by the Tigrayan forces to move toward Addis Ababa.\u00a0 Feltman called the spread of the conflict \"unacceptable\" and said the situation was \"even more alarming than it was a few months ago.\" He warned of \"disastrous consequences\" for the Ethiopia's stability \u2014 and its ties with the U.S. \u2014 if the fighting isn't reined in. \u00a0 The U.S. government is considering suspending Ethiopia's duty-free market status, citing human rights abuses and the growing famine. Suspension of these benefits would threaten Ethiopia's aspirations to become a manufacturing hub, and they would be a huge blow after some hard-won economic gains for Abiy's government. \u00a0\u00a0 A lot of blame has been laid at the feet of the prime minister, for inciting decades-old ethnic divisions. If his government falls, he'll leave behind an economy in ruin, and a shattered country.\u00a0 \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Yangon, Myanmar \u2014 Social media giant Facebook announced Thursday it was banning all accounts linked to Myanmar's military as well as ads from military-controlled companies, in the wake of the army's seizure of power on February 1. It said in a statement that it was treating the post-coup situation in Myanmar as an \"emergency,\" explaining that the ban was precipitated by events since the coup, including \"deadly violence.\"  Facebook's action comes as diplomatic efforts to resolve Myanmar's political crisis have intensified and protests continued in Yangon and other cities calling for the country's coup makers to step down and return Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government to power.  Facebook already has banned several military-linked accounts since the coup, including army-controlled Myawaddy TV and state television broadcaster MRTV.  The bans are also being applied on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. The junta has tried to block Facebook and other social media platforms, but its efforts have proven ineffective. For more than a week, it has also turned off access to the internet nightly from 1 a.m. Opposition to the coup continues inside Myanmar, with large demonstrations in many cities and towns.  There was a new look to anti-coup demonstrations Thursday, with protesters smearing a traditional yellow paste on their faces, as a proclamation of their national identity. Outside the Hledan Centre in Yangon, where around 1,000 people gathered to keep up pressure on the new military regime, protestors wore the mixture, called thanaka, in broad swathes on their foreheads, cheeks and down their noses. Some had slogans written into the designs. The Reuters news service reports that clashes broke out in the capital Thursday between backers and opponents of the military. And it could have been worse \u2013 as roughly 1,000 military supporters held a rally, police blocked the gates of the capital's main university campus, keeping hundreds of students from joining the protest against military rule. There was a tense standoff on Wednesday in the country's second-biggest city, Mandalay, where police holding riot shields and cradling rifles blocked the path of about 3,000 teachers and students. After about two hours, during which demonstrators played protest songs and listened to speeches condemning the coup, the crowd moved away.  On Saturday, police and soldiers fatally shot two people in Mandalay while breaking up a strike by dock workers.\\ Facebook and other social media platforms came under enormous criticism in 2017 when rights groups said they failed to take enough action to stop hate speech against Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority. The army launched a brutal counterinsurgency operation that year that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya to seek safety in neighboring Bangladesh, where they remain in refugee camps. Myanmar security forces burned down villages, killed civilians and engaged in mass rape in their campaign, which the World Court is investigating as a crime of genocide.  Facebook in 2018 banned the accounts of several top Myanmar military leaders, including Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who led this month's coup that ousted the elected government of Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party. The general heads the junta that now acts as the government.  Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi on Wednesday visited the Thai capital, Bangkok, and held three-way talks with her Thai counterpart and Myanmar's new foreign minister. The meeting was part of Marsudi's efforts to coordinate a regional response to the crisis triggered by the military takeover in Myanmar.  Indonesia and fellow members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are seeking to promote some concessions by Myanmar's military that could ease tensions to prevent more violence. The regional group, to which Thailand and Myanmar also belong, believes dialogue with the generals is a more effective method of achieving concessions than more confrontational methods such as the sanctions often advocated by Western nations.  The military says it took power because last November's election was marked by widespread voting irregularities, an assertion that was refuted by the state election commission, whose members have since been replaced by the ruling junta.  Despite the landslide victory by Suu Kyi's party at the polls, the army blocked Parliament from convening and detained her and President Win Myint and other top members of her government.  The junta has said it will rule for a year under a state of emergency and then hold fresh elections.",

            "article_content": "The following is an extended transcript of an interview with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan that aired on Sunday, September 26, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. President, thank you for making time.\u00a0 PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: Thank you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden has described the world as split between autocrats and Democrats. And he's called you an autocrat. How do you describe your relationship with President Biden? PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDO\u011eAN: Well, as of now, Mr. President's definition of an autocrat remains unknown to me, I don't know what he meant, but my past is of a political past, and in my political past, which dates back to four decades -- and I've always internalized democracy and I have dedicated these four decades to servicing my people. That's the kind of a leader I am and this is how I came to be what I am today. And because of the fact that my people never complained of me, I've always accomplished and triumphed at the end of every election that I partook in the last 20 years. In 1994, I became the mayor of Metropolitan City of Istanbul. And then I became the prime minister, and then I became the president, and I still am the president of my country servicing my people. This is the process, and I really don't know what Mr. President meant by saying autocrat. MARGARET BRENNAN: He said you're going to have to pay a price for some of your actions. He said this when he was a candidate and he talked about human rights abuses. Has he ever talked directly to you about what he meant? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Well, on the contrary, he never mentioned any of these issues to me. And, I know whenever we got together, he's very respectful towards me. And ever since the days when he was the vice president, he was always very respectful-- that's how he approached me, and it is very difficult for me to understand why he's using such a definition when he's talking about me. And the last time we got together was in Brussels in June. We just discussed the situation vis-a-vis the Karzai airport in Afghanistan when they were preparing to withdraw from the airport. He proposed us to possibly run the airport, and this is a great demonstration of his confidence in us. So I would like to ask you, he trusts us enough to propose us to run the Karzai airport. This is his thoughts and impressions on us, and it is still very difficult for me to understand why he would deviate from that now. And he would call me an autocrat. I wished to have seen- Mr. President would talk to me about these issues directly and t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're not meeting him during this visit. PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Well, right now, under these circumstances-- Well due to the pandemic level is only good as far as I'm concerned, he's not having bilateral meetings with the leaders and we have invited him for a prospective bilateral, but he didn't respond positively. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Afghanistan. The CIA already says that it is seeing members of al Qaeda potentially move back into Afghanistan. Do you think the US departure from Afghanistan makes the region less safe? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Of course. With the American footprints dating back to two decades, the region was not any safer. On the contrary, every day the region lost more blood and we used to have 1000 troops in Afghanistan and we executed our duties in order to protect the airport in Afghanistan. And finally, when we were asked to possibly run the airport, we got together in Brussels with President Biden where we discussed these issues, and we told him that we could possibly assume such a responsibility. But on the condition of three requests: one of them is logistical support. And of course, what would logistical support stand for? It's including financial and equipment support, the ammunitions, the vehicles and the weapons there would have been transferred to us. But such things have unfolded that the exact opposite happened. The artillery, the ammunition, the weapons and the vehicles at the Karzai airport were all transferred over to Taliban, and Taliban is currently using all those weapons and all those vehicles, and we have to see all these facts for what they are. But we are actually accustomed to certain things because similarly, the terrorist organizations in and around Turkey are receiving logistical support from the United States at a very severe extent-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --What are you talking about? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: --and it was the case with the previous government, with the previous administration? And it's exactly the same right now. (00:09:07) The terrorist organizations. Receiving this kind of support should be stopped once and for all: PKK, YPD, PYG, these are the terrorist organizations which have received significant artillery and weapons support. MARGARET BRENNAN: They were US allies in the fight against ISIS, have you seen any evidence that weapons provided to them went back into Turkey? Is there any threat to you from any of these groups because of U.S. support? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: I've raised this issue personally with President Trump when he was in the office and currently, trucks full of artillery, ammunition and weapons are coming to the region, and we have provided this information to the administration through our intelligence agency. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you present it to President Biden? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: All of this was submitted to our interlocutors, and the current Turkish intelligence chief is talking to his counterpart on a continuous basis, and we will never shy away from sharing this information with our interlocutors because there are certain facts MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: that we have to admit to the United States is a NATO member. Similarly, Turkey is NATO member and we are in a position to be obliged to forge a solidarity under the roof of NATO. But so long as the terrorist organizations receive such logistical support that upset us and we would be vocal about this MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to come back to Afghanistan. But let me finish here because you took us to Syria. There are still nine hundred troops in Syria, and you had that moment with President Trump, where he moved U.S. troops out of the way and Turkey went into northern Syria. This was hugely controversial in the United States because it looked to many people like President Trump sold out America's Kurdish allies. Did he promise you that he would pull all U.S. troops out of Syria? And have you asked President Biden to do that? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: The situation in Syria is of a different nature. Region by region, certain places had been entirely evacuated or abandoned. There is the western side and the eastern side of the Euphrates River. We have Russia there. We have the regime forces, Iran and us. The outstanding issue is to find a sustainable way to continue with this solidarity. We are always defending the idea to continue with this solidarity in a positive way\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: But did you tell President Trump that Turkish troops would fire on American troops? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: --and we are currently leading this process.\u00a0 PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Would you possibly repeat your question? Did you tell President Trump that if U.S. troops didn't get out of the way, that Turkish troops would fire on them? And have you asked President Biden to pull out American troops? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Such a thing never happened. We are not using such definitions because they would be insincere and these would be just allegations and lies. Turkey has never used such remarks talking to President Trump, and we never talked about these issues with President Biden back in Brussels. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to go back to Afghanistan. Turkey is helping the Taliban to run the airport right now, providing technical support. It's one of their few lifelines to the rest of the world. What do you think of this new Taliban government? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Currently, there's not an issue upon which we have reached an agreement, a consensus with Taliban. Taliban is currently moving jointly with Qatar and we have withdrawn our troops and our civilians were evicted--evacuated--excuse me. So, It's meaningless to talk about these things where we are not present because we're not currently at the airport and we don't have a cooperation outstanding with Taliban right now. But I need to be very frank and very clear in my following remarks. We have historic relations with the Afghan people, and we've always been very supportive of Afghan in an unprecedented fashion, unlike any other. And in terms of infrastructure, in terms of superstructure, we were involved in major investments, which we will continue for the future. But because of the mistakes made in the field, we had to withdraw our troops and evacuate our civilians. And right now, we are not present in Afghanistan. MARGARET BRENNAN: You won't help to run the airports? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: it will entirely depend on possible agreements and caution, because here, if we can reach a reciprocal understanding, if we can expect for some certain concrete steps and positive steps to be taken forward, we can do something right now. The government in Afghanistan is not inclusive, is not embracing all different factions. So long as that will be the question we won't be present in Afghanistan, but if the government shall be more inclusive, we can be there, present, as Turkey. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said, it back in August, for sure, the Taliban's views won't be the same as they were 20 years ago. But the Taliban is only letting boys go back to school, not girls. They've told women not to show up for work in government positions. It doesn't look like the Taliban has evolved. Can you do business with a government like this? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Madam, Turkey's approach to women's issues is quite well known. Women are present in every aspect of life, in education, in health, in justice, in judiciary. Women are present in every aspect of life, so long as this is the situation in our country, why would we have a different stance in Afghanistan? (00:16:40) Our views would apply to Afghanistan as well as we would expect all women to be involved in every aspect of life in Afghanistan in a very active way. And whenever women become more active in every aspect of life, we can support them. If they would need us in health care and security and in other walks of life and if they need, we could support them in terms of education in our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you don't want to do business with the Taliban at this point? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: About the issues that I've just listed, if they shall be agreed on, if they will be accepted and recognized, we can do business, but if not, we won't do business with them. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have Afghan refugees now fleeing the country. Some of them headed towards your country of Turkey. You said last month Turkey has no duty, responsibility or obligation to be a refugee warehouse. Whose obligation is it? Is it America's obligation to take in these refugees? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Right now... the United States failed to meet its obligations. Both registered and non-registered, we have more than 300,000 Afghan refugees- and-\u00a0 we will no longer be able to afford to welcome any more Afghan refugees in Turkey. However, the United States is-\u00a0 if the United States is willing to accept the Afghan refugees here, that's something they would know. I think they will understand my refugee politics and nobody would actually get intertwined. MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? Are you closing your borders to all refugees? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Currently, we are the ones housing 300,000 Afghan refugees, but I'm very clear in my remarks that our doors are not going to be the kind of doors that everybody can freely walk in and out of. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the U.S. need to do more? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Of course, the United States should do a lot and should invest a lot because the United States has been there for the last 20 years. But why? Why? First, these questions should be answered by the United States. The United States is not Turkey, it's a very powerful country, and this powerful country is feeding on this power and should have been capable of assessing the issue sociologically in Afghanistan, but why fail to do that? The armament in Afghanistan, for example, why was it made in the way it was made? Why so many bodyguards mobilized in Afghanistan? Why were they getting paid the amounts they were getting paid? Because we are not talking about peanuts here and all of these issues should be questioned by all of the Americans. And why did you enter the United States, why did you withd- why did you enter Afghanistan? Why did you withdraw from Afghanistan? And these are questions that should be posed by the Americans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you pose these questions to President Biden back in June when you met face-to-face? Did you warn him (SOUND OFF CAM AND MB LOOKS AWAY BRIEFLY) that you saw potential problems? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: The issues we discussed were mainly revolving around the airport, the possible operation of the airport. We posed the relevant questions about the airport to President Biden-- MARGARET BRENNAN: and that's it? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: --I said, if you want us to be present at the airport, we need logistical support from you, and administrative, financial support would be most welcome. And as a NATO partner, as an ally, we would jointly work with you in the field. That's what we said. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that relationship. You're part of NATO, as is the United States. The Russian government says that Turkey plans to continue buying their missile defense systems, the S400s. The U.S. says it's a threat to this country, to the entire Western alliance. Why do you continue to go through with this? Did President Biden ask you to stop? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: I explained everything to President Biden and through you, I would like to once again state the following: We were acquiring F-35 aircraftS and we've paid $1.4 billion. But the $1.4 billion of payments which were delivered in return for the F-35s, led us to such a situation that we never got the F-35s and we requested to acquire Patriots, but we were never given Patriots. And when we were talking to President Trump about these issues way back when he said the following: \"Well, Turkey has paid $1.4 billion for 35s and why are we not giving them F-35s?\" And he said this right in front of the entire world press.And why the five aircrafts are not still being delivered? I paid my-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --they're not being delivered because you purchased the S-400s, and the United States has said that this would be a risk. PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Well, nobody can- nobody can interfere with that. You're not going to give me Patriots.\u00a0 (00:23:41) And in terms of the defense-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --but, can you-- PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: I'm- I'm going to possibly acquire defense systems from another country and nobody can get involved in this. Stoltenberg, of the NATO, secretary general, came up with the best statement. And he said, quote, \"We can't do anything about what our partners or where our partners are going to buy their defense systems and they could never interfere with,\" that was what he said. This is NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. MARGARET BRENNAN: But after the United States government says to you that this is a security risk for the United States and for the entire Western alliance, can't you understand that America has a hard time trusting you after that? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Well, sorry, then. This is what I'm going to say in return: who is going to share our security risks? It can be said to me, how are we going to take the necessary measures for security risks? Are we going to keep on expecting delivery of weapons from other countries that didn't give us those weapons? MARGARET BRENNAN: But don't you trust your own air force? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: It's not about the air force, it's not just Air Force. Defense systems are one thing, Air Force is another thing. Because right now in terms of Air Force, maybe the United States, won't- won't maintain the F-16 program. I don't have such a guarantee that the Americans will continue with the F-16 provision. If that will be interrupted, then we will be forced to take other measures. MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you still intend to buy another round of these S-400s, of these Russian missile systems. PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: In the future, nobody will be able to interfere in terms of what kind of defense systems we acquire, from which country at what level. Nobody can interfere with that. We are the only ones to make such decisions. We are a country-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So the sanctions will stay on? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: --with 84 million inhabitants and we are very resolute in terms of our defence systems and the necessary measures to be taken, and nobody can interfere with that. MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like a yes. PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Of course, of course, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: When we started this conversation, you talked about your political career and support for you. President Biden is a constant critic of human rights abuses. You said in your private conversations with him that he didn't bring them up in June. Has he ever asked you to improve your treatment of journalists, or anything specific? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: No he didn't. And because we don't have any problems of that nature in terms of freedoms, Turkey is incomparably free. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that Committee to Protect Journalists says that you rank second only to China when it comes to jailing journalists. Worse than Iran. Worse than Saudi Arabia. PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Well, sorry, then I won't accept this. And these associations, these unions--uh, statements, and disclosures are not shared by me, because Turkey doesn't have such a situation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, human rights lawyers say you have a hundred thousand Turkish citizens who have been investigating just for insulting you. PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Do you believe these? MARGARET BRENNAN: International organizations, credible ones are coming out with these statements. PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Well, I know those credible international organizations that have no credit for me\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: The United States government has said these things, or at least they say them to us. You said President Biden never said this to you. PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Well, you're being deceived actually, and you're led to believe. Are you looking at the source of these allegations? Are you researching these claims? Please do, if you're not. MARGARET BRENNAN: You think the U.S. State Department is not credible when it criticizes human rights abuses in Turkey? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Well, I don't, because in order for me to believe that it's a credible claim or a statement, my country's organizations, actual findings are important, because everything is political, everything has become political and this political approach can never be shared or accepted by us. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm told we are running out of time, but I do want to ask you: Turkey needs to improve its relations with the West and with the United States. When you came to Washington in 2017, you were on camera when you were watching those protesters get beaten. Those American protesters. There were Secret Service officers who were injured as a result. Do you understand that in the eyes of the American public, that's completely unacceptable? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Well, sorry, but, they're- not the Secret Service. On the contrary, the Turkish citizens living in Turkey were attacked by the federalized terrorist organization members and they were supported by the American police. And I talked about this to the American authorities, and I just wanted them to see things for what they are. And as press members, please consider the attacks against the Turkish citizens. MARGARET BRENNAN: But I'm talking about the video that was shown in households around this country when they turned on the evening news, they saw you stand there while those protesters were being beaten. Do you understand why that hurt Turkey? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: I wasn't standing there. I wasn't standing there. (00:30:44) I was just following the incidents, but I wasn't standing there. We need to be honest, we need to speak the truth.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you approve of it? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: --And I was not inside that crowd. MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that appropriate? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: On the contrary, our citizens were attacked and the American security forces, aggressively attacked the Turkish citizens and I told this to the American authorities. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think what happened that day is appropriate? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: It's impossible for me to say it was because my citizens were being attacked. And some of them were detained or were arrested here. How are we going to explain this? MARGARET BRENNAN: More than a dozen and the U.S. government won't sell weapons to some of your personal security because of what happened that day. PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Let me remind you of something. We need to be honest about many things, but there's no honesty here. The approach against my security forces are misleading steps of the administration here in the United States. And these security forces are not being brought to the United States anymore because this is not a fair approach. The holders of the power if they demonstrate an unjust and unfair approach, of course, our approach will be different in nature. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lastly, the American public has decided it doesn't have the political will to be involved militarily in the Middle East anymore. What does that mean for you and your country? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Well, this is the approach of the Americans- of the American people. And there's nothing we can do about it. We're not going to just determine what will be done and we can decide what we are going to do in the Middle East and the United States will, in her lonesome, decide what they're going to do in the Middle East. But I'm just stating one fact. The United States is a NATO member, and Turkey is as well. And the United States will it be moving forward with the terrorist organizations or will it be moving forward with the friend and ally under the NATO roof. (00:34:05) I would prefer the second one, actually. MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Let me repeat. We are allies under the roof of NATO with the United States, and it has to decide whether it's going to move forward with Turkey or move (00:34:23) forward with PKK, PYD, and YPG and other terrorist organizations as such. This is the main decision to be made. MARGARET BRENNAN: Has the Biden administration told you that it has any intention of changing its policy towards its Kurdish allies in Syria and in Iraq? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: We didn't have the opportunity to talk about these issues because we mainly focused on the Afghan- Afghani question. But, when I was speaking to my leader friend in the United States, I told them about the terrorist organizations such as PKK, PYD, YPG, including the Trump administration, and the thousands of weapons and our artillery and the ammunition. What are you going to do about this? And I never got a positive response about that issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: So to be clear, do you want U.S. troops, the nine hundred that are left in Syria to stay or to go? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Of course, if I have the choice I would, I would want them to get out of Syria and Iraq. Just like the way they have withdrawn from Afghanistan. Because if we are going to service peace around the world, it's not-- it's no longer meaningful to remain in those parts of the world. We can just leave those people, leave those administrations to make up their own minds. MARGARET BRENNAN: And leave it to Turkey to intercede into Syria? Can you guarantee that would happen without human rights abuses? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: Let me be very clear, and frank: we will never remain where we are not wanted. We will never be present where we are not welcome. In Syria, we are currently building 100,000 units of brick homes. People and families were displaced and they were kicked out of their motherland and we are building these units for them there. And I wonder what the other countries are doing, and it's very important to see it. MARGARET BRENNAN: And is that what you're going to talk to Vladimir Putin about? PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN: We are talking about these facts with Putin. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm being told we have to wrap the interview, but thank you for your time, Mr. President. PRESIDENT ERDO\u011eAN:\u00a0 And I would like to thank you. I hope that the United States, Russia, Iran, Turkey, both in Syria and Iraq, we can work together collectively for the peace of the people in those parts of the world. MARGARET BRENNAN: Insha'Allah.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 President Biden sought to reassert the United States as a world leader and boost morale among the ranks of the State Department in his inaugural foreign policy speech as president Thursday, vowing \"America is back.\" He also announced his administration would be reversing some plans from the Trump administration. \"I will have your back,\" Mr. Biden said during his address at the State Department. \"This administration is going to empower you to do your jobs, not target or politicize you. We want a rigorous debate that brings all perspectives, that makes room for dissent. That's how we'll get the best possible policy outcomes. So with your help, the United States will again lead not just by the example of our power, but by the power of our example.\" Mr. Biden announced Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is launching a global force posture review, during which there will be a freeze on the planned withdrawal of troops from Germany\u00a0announced by the Trump administration. He also said there will be an end to American support for offensive operations in Yemen, including arms sales. Both initiatives were previewed by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan earlier Thursday.\u00a0 The president also said he will be issuing a presidential memorandum on protecting the rights of LGBTQ individuals worldwide, as well as an executive order allowing him to raise U.S. refugee admissions to 125,000 people for the first fiscal year of his administration. The president and Vice President Kamala Harris made the short trip to the State Department's headquarters in Foggy Bottom to speak with department staff and meet with\u00a0Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who took the reins of the State Department last week, before delivering his remarks. Mr. Biden told State Department employees he supports them and their work, comments that stand in contrast to former President Donald Trump's criticisms. \"We must meet the new moment of accelerating global challenges, from the pandemic to the climate crisis, to nuclear proliferation, challenging the will only to be solved by nations working together and in common,\" Mr. Biden said. \"We can't do it alone. We must start with diplomacy.\" The president reflected on his conversations with America's closest allies \u2014 Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, NATO, Japan, South Korea and Australia \u2014 which were about \"re-forming the habits of cooperation and rebuilding the muscle of democratic alliances that have atrophied over the past few years of neglect and I would argue abuse. American alliances are our greatest asset.\" Addressing Russia, Mr. Biden said it's crucial for the U.S. to work with allies and said his administration's approach to dealing with Russian President Vladimir Putin will differ from that of his predecessor. \"We will not hesitate to raise the cost on Russia and defend our vital interests and our people,\" he said. The president spoke with Putin last month and said that during the conversation, \"I made it clear to President Putin in a manner very different from my predecessor: the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyber attacks, poisoning its citizens, are over.\" Mr. Biden also raised the importance of a free press, which he said is crucial to a democracy. \"We believe a free press isn't an adversary, rather it's essential,\" he said. \"The free press is essential to the health of a democracy.\" In earlier comments to the State Department workforce, some of whom were in attendance while others watched virtually, Mr. Biden conceded \"it's been a difficult few years\" and heralded staff for exhibiting \"great personal courage.\" \"The main message that I want to communicate to you all is whether you're part of the newest class of foreign service officers or you've worked for decades in the civil service or foreign service, or you're locally employed staff, you're vital, and success to the strength of our nation depends in no small part on you,\" he said. Mr. Biden previewed his later remarks, vowing to \"send a clear message to the world: America is back. America is back. Diplomacy is back. You are the center of all that I intend to do. You are the heart of it.\" The president asked State Department staff to abide by several core tenets: \"Integrity in all you do; transparency and accountability to rebuild trust in America around the world; working in the service of the American people, not self-interest; and promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility across the board because our diplomats at all levels should reflect the full diversity of this great country.\" Mr. Biden was set to visit the State Department earlier this week, but the trip was moved due to a winter storm that blanketed the Washington, D.C., area with snow. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that Mr. Biden's visit is \"largely focused on his desire to thank the men and women who are us \u2014 who are Foreign Service officers, civil servants, who are the heart and soul of that institution and, frankly, our government.\" Psaki said the president would \"talk broadly\" about foreign policy, but cautioned his remarks \"will not be a laydown of his vision for every issue and every foreign policy issue.\" Mr. Biden has vowed to repair alliances that frayed under the Trump administration and has repeatedly declared \"America is back\" as a leader on the world stage. In calls with foreign leaders after the election, the president said he reassured U.S. allies that \"we're going to be back in the game.\" The State Department is emerging from a period in which the institution and at least one of its top diplomats, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, were attacked by Mr. Trump. A January 2020 report from the State Department's inspector general found the agency's \"staffing gaps, frequent turnover, poor leadership, and inexperienced and undertrained staff frequently contribute to the Department's other management challenges.\"\u00a0 \"Workforce management issues are pervasive, affecting programs and operations domestically and overseas and across functional areas and geographic regions,\" the internal watchdog found.",

            "article_content": "For 15 years, Robert F. Kennedy's assassin was denied parole by a California parole board that maintained Sirhan Sirhan did not show adequate remorse or understand the enormity of his crime that rocked the nation and the world in 1968. But on Friday, the two-person panel said he appeared to be a different man, even from his last hearing in 2016, and granted the 77-year-old prisoner parole. Two of RFK's sons, going against several of their siblings' wishes, said they also supported releasing him and prosecutors declined to argue he should be kept behind bars. But the governor ultimately will decide if he leaves prison. The board found Sirhan no longer poses a threat to society, noting that he had enrolled in more than 20 programs including anger management classes, Tai Chi and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, even during the coronavirus pandemic. \"We think that you have grown,\" Parole Board Commissioner Robert Barton said. Douglas Kennedy was a toddler when his father was gunned down in 1968. He told a two-person board panel that he was moved to tears by Sirhan's remorse and that Sirhan should be released if he's not a threat to others. \"I'm overwhelmed just by being able to view Mr. Sirhan face to face,\" he said. \"I've lived my life both in fear of him and his name in one way or another. And I am grateful today to see him as a human being worthy of compassion and love.\" Six of Kennedy's nine surviving children, however, said they were shocked by the vote. They urged Governor Gavin Newsom, who is facing a recall election in California, to reverse the parole board's decision and keep Sirhan behind bars. \"He took our father from our family and he took him from America,\" the six siblings wrote in a statement late Friday. \"We are in disbelief that this man would be recommended for release. The statement was signed by Joseph P. Kennedy II, Courtney Kennedy, Kerry Kennedy, Christopher G. Kennedy, Maxwell T. Kennedy and Rory Kennedy. But another sibling, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has spoken in favor of his release in the past and wrote in favor of paroling Sirhan. He said in the letter that he met him in prison and was moved by Sirhan, \"who wept, clinching my hands, and asked for forgiveness. \"While nobody can speak definitively on behalf of my father, I firmly believe that based on his own consuming commitment to fairness and justice, that he would strongly encourage this board to release Mr. Sirhan because of Sirhan's impressive record of rehabilitation,\" he said in a letter submitted during the hearing to the board. Sirhan, whose hair is white, smiled, thanked the board and gave a thumbs-up after the decision to grant parole was announced. It was a major victory in his 16th attempt at parole after he's served 53 years. But it does not assure his release. The ruling will be reviewed over the next 120 days by the board's staff. Then it will be sent to the governor, who will have 30 days to decide whether to grant it, reverse it or modify it. If Sirhan is freed, he must live in a transitional home for six months, enroll in an alcohol abuse program and get therapy. Robert F. Kennedy was a U.S. senator from New York and the brother of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963. RFK was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination when he was gunned down at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles moments after delivering a victory speech in the pivotal California primary. Five others were wounded. Sirhan, who insists he doesn't remember the shooting and had been drinking alcohol just beforehand, was convicted of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to death after his conviction, but that sentence was commuted to life when the California Supreme Court briefly outlawed capital punishment in 1972. Some of Kennedy's children and others have called for a reinvestigation of the killing, believing there was a second shooter who got away. While on Friday, Sirhan again said he didn't recall the killing, he made multiple attempts to show nonetheless he takes responsibility for the harm he caused. \"Senator Kennedy was the hope of the world ... and I harmed all of them and it pains me to experience that, the knowledge for such a horrible deed, if I did in fact do that,\" said Sirhan, appearing on camera from a San Diego County prison at the virtual proceeding, wearing his blue prison uniform, a paper towel folded as a handkerchief peeking from his shirt pocket. Barton said that was progress. \"We saw the improvement that you've made, and all of the other mitigating factors, and we did not find that your lack of taking complete responsibility\" for the crime as proof of currently being dangerous to society, Barton said. Because of laws passed in 2018, the board was required to take into account this time the fact that he had suffered childhood trauma from the conflict in the Middle East, committed the offense at a young age and is now an elderly prisoner. The board found that despite the magnitude of the crime, he wasn't likely to reoffend and didn't pose an unreasonable threat to public safety. \"Not withstanding its atrocity, its impact, not just on the families and the victims and the nation as a whole and perhaps the world as a whole \u2014 if you were sentenced to life without parole that would be a different matter, but you were sent to life with parole,\" Barton said. Barton said the board's decision was not influenced by the fact that prosecutors did not participate or oppose Sirhan's release under a policy by Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n, a former police officer who took office last year after running on a reform platform. Gasc\u00f3n, who said he idolized the Kennedys and mourned RFK's assassination, believes the prosecutors' role ends at sentencing and they should not influence decisions to release prisoners. \"Obviously they opposed in the past and even if they had opposed it today, our decision would be the same,\" Barton said. The Los Angeles Police Department, relatives of some of the victims and members of the public submitted letters opposing Sirhan's release. The California District Attorneys Association denounced the prosecution's absence. \"This is one of the most notorious political assassinations in American history and the killer is being considered for release without benefit of a representative on behalf of the people of California. That is disgraceful,\" El Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson, the association's president, said. Sirhan's lawyer, Angela Berry, had urged the board to base its decision on who Sirhan is today and not what he did more than 50 years ago. Sirhan said he had learned to control his anger and was committed to living peacefully. \"You have my pledge. I will always look to safety and peace and non-violence,\" he told the panel. Sirhan, a Christian Palestinian from Jordan, has acknowledged he was angry at Kennedy for his support of Israel. When asked about how he feels about the Middle East conflict today, Sirhan broke down crying and temporarily couldn't speak. \"Take a few deep breaths,\" said Barton, who noted the conflict had not gone away and still touched a nerve. Sirhan said he doesn't follow what's going on in the region but thinks about the suffering of refugees. \"The misery that those people are experiencing. It's painful,\" Sirhan said. If released, Sirhan could be deported to Jordan, and Barton said he was concerned he might become a \"symbol or lightning rod to foment more violence.\" Sirhan said he was too old to be involved in the Middle East conflict and would detach himself from it. \"The same argument can be said or made that I can be a peacemaker and a contributor to a friendly nonviolent way of resolving the issue,\" said Sirhan, who told the panel that he hoped to live with his blind brother in Pasadena, California. Paul Schrade, a union leader and aide to RFK who was among five people wounded in the 1968 shooting, also spoke Friday in favor of Sirhan's release.",

            "article_content": "United Nations\u00a0\u2014 U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock warned Thursday that \"a campaign of destruction\" is taking place in Ethiopia's embattled Tigray province, saying at least 4.5 million people need assistance and demanding that forces from neighboring Eritrea accused of committing atrocities in Tigray leave Ethiopia. \u00a0 As the Tigray crisis enters its fourth month, Lowcock said, the humanitarian crisis is deteriorating and \"multiple credible and widely corroborated reports from Tigray... speak of widespread atrocities, involving mass killings, rapes and abductions of civilians, ongoing fighting across the region\" as well as the destruction of harvests and key agricultural machinery. Lowcock's remarks to a closed meeting of the U.N. Security Council, obtained by CBS News, for the first time singled out Eritrean forces as fighting on the side of the Ethiopian government, and warned of possible famine \"if food does not get through and there is no agricultural revival.\" Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said the U.S. had sent a \"Disaster Assistance Response Team to Ethiopia,\" reports CBS News' Pamela Falk. The American ambassador called on the Ethiopian government to support an immediate end to the fighting in Tigray and backed Lowcock's call for \"the prompt withdrawal of Eritrean forces and Amhara regional forces.\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also supported Lowcock's demand. \u00a0 A Security Council press statement on Tigray, drafted by Ireland, is still being discussed, council diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the meeting was closed. As fierce fighting reportedly continues between Ethiopian and allied forces and those supporting the now-fugitive Tigray leaders who once dominated Ethiopia's government, alarm is growing over the fate of Tigray's 6 million people. No one knows how many thousands of civilians have been killed. \u00a0 Accounts of atrocities against residents of Tigray were detailed in reports by The Associated Press and by Amnesty International. Federal government and regional officials in Tigray both believe that each other's governments are illegitimate after elections disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. \u00a0 In demanding that the Eritreans leave, Lowcock said, \"It is now abundantly clear to all, and openly acknowledged by officials of the government administration in Tigray, that Eritrean Defense Forces are operating throughout Tigray.\" \u00a0 \"Countless well-corroborated reports suggest their culpability for atrocities,\" he said. \"Eritrean Defense Forces must leave Ethiopia, and they must not be enabled or permitted to continue their campaign of destruction before they do so.\" Lowcock also stressed that all forces \u2014 \"and here I include the Ethiopian Defense Forces, the Eritrean Defense Forces, Tigrayan forces and ethnic militia from parts of Ethiopia beyond Tigray\" \u2014 must under international humanitarian law grant access to people who need assistance, \"wherever they may be.\" He said many people in rural areas, which accounted for about 80% of Tigray's population before the conflict began, remain inaccessible and their situation \"is almost certainly worse\" than those that aid agencies have been able to reach. \"We have identified at least 600,000 people who we know need help but who have not yet received any humanitarian aid whatsoever,\" Lowcock said. \"But we suspect the real number of people in need who have received no help so far is significantly higher.\" \u00a0 With harvests and markets disrupted by the conflict, he said \"food insecurity is rising,\" citing \"anecdotal reports of starvation\" but saying \"the worst is still avoidable.\" \u00a0 Lowcock said aid agencies are scaling up their response and urged donors to contribute to a $400 million appeal for Tigray due to be released next week. The U.N. humanitarian chief said Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed told Secretary-General Guterres several days ago \u2014 and reiterated to World Food Program Executive Director David Beasley on Thursday \u2014 that he is committed to ensuring aid reaches those who need it. \u00a0 \"This commitment must now translate into more action on the ground,\" Lowcock said, stressing that one urgent need is getting communications equipment into Tigray so aid agencies can communicate with each other. \u00a0 Lowcock said Tigray may not be the only hot spot in Ethiopia. \u00a0 \"We see warning signs in other regions in Ethiopia, including a military buildup on the Ethiopian-Sudan border and worsening ethnic conflict in the Benishangul-Gumuz region, from where refugees are fleeing to Sudan,\" he said.",

            "article_content": "Yangon, Myanmar\u00a0\u2014 Members of a group supporting Myanmar's military junta attacked and injured people protesting Thursday against the army's February 1 seizure of power that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. At least several people were injured in the attacks in Myanmar's largest city. \u00a0 The chaos complicates an already intractable standoff between the military and a protest movement that has been staging large-scale demonstrations daily to have Suu Kyi's government restored to power. It comes as social media giant Facebook said it was banning all accounts linked to Myanmar's military, reacting specifically, it said, to \"deadly violence\" in the country. Photos and videos on social media showed the attacks and injured people in downtown Yangon as police stood by without intervening. The attackers fired slingshots and carried iron rods, knives and other sharp implements. A widely-circulated video showed one man stabbed in front of an office building near a major downtown intersection on the road to Sule Pagoda, a major venue for anti-coup protests. The number of injured people and their condition could not immediately be learned. \u00a0 According to accounts and photos posted on social media, the situation began with a march of hundreds of people in support of the coup. They carried banners in English with the slogans \"We Stand With Our Defense Services\" and \"We Stand With State Administration Council,\" which is the official name of the new junta. English has been widely used for signs and posters and online memes by the anti-coup demonstrators in an evident effort to win international support. Reports said the pro-military marchers were jeered by bystanders near the city's Central Railway station and responded by firing slingshots, throwing stones at them and then chasing them down. Video shows pro- and anti-coup crowds at that location. \u00a0 Supporters of the military have gathered in the streets before, especially in the days immediately before and after the coup, but had not used violence so openly. \u00a0 Critics of the military charge its pays people to engage in violence, allegations that are hard to verify. Such confrontations jeopardize outside diplomatic efforts to help resolve Myanmar's crisis through dialogue. Social media giant Facebook announced Thursday it was banning all accounts linked to Myanmar's military as well as ads from military-controlled companies in the wake of the army's seizure of power on February 1. \u00a0 It said in a statement that it was treating the post-coup situation in Myanmar as an \"emergency,\" explaining that the ban was precipitated by events since the coup, including \"deadly violence.\" \u00a0 Facebook already has banned several military-linked accounts since the coup, including army-controlled Myawaddy TV and state television broadcaster MRTV. The bans also apply to Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. Facebook and other social media platforms came under enormous criticism in 2017 when right groups said they failed to act enough to stop hate speech against Myanmar's Muslim Rohingya minority. The army launched a brutal counterinsurgency operation that year that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya to to seek safety in neighboring Bangladesh, where they remain in refugee camps. Myanmar security forces burned down villages, killed civilians and engaged in mass rape, actions the World Court is investigating as constituting genocide. The junta has tried to block Facebook and other social media platforms, but its efforts have proven ineffective. For more than a week it has also turned off access to the internet nightly from 1 a.m. \u00a0 The military says it took power because last November's election was marked by widespread voting irregularities, an assertion that was refuted by the state election commission, whose members have since been replaced by the ruling junta. \u00a0 The junta has said it will rule for a year under a state of emergency and then hold fresh elections.",

            "article_content": "There have been only four presidential impeachments in U.S. history. In the past year, Americans have lived through half of them. The second impeachment trial\u00a0of former President Donald Trump finished on February 13 \u2014 just one year and eight days after his first trial ended. Mr. Trump was acquitted again, but he also pushed the boundaries for the nation's slim history of presidential punishments. Mr. Trump is the first federal official to be impeached twice and the first president to face a trial after leaving office, and his impeachments broke two records for senators voting against the president of their own party. Before Mr. Trump, only two presidents had been impeached \u2014 Andrew Johnson in 1868, and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was convicted. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 after articles of impeachment were drafted, but before the House could vote on them. The Constitution says presidents and other federal officials can be impeached for \"Treason, Bribery and other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.\" No president has faced impeachment articles for treason or bribery; all impeachment cases so far came down to what Congress considered to be \"High Crimes and Misdemeanors.\"\u00a0 The phrase \"High Crimes and Misdemeanors\" is not defined in the Constitution, leaving it up to Congress to decide what qualifies in any particular case. Historians and legal scholars say it's generally understood to mean a serious abuse of the public trust.\u00a0 Here's a look at what led to past presidents facing impeachment. The House has the power to impeach the president, and the Senate, in a subsequent process, then decides whether to remove an impeached president from office. The Senate can also hold a separate vote on whether to ban the president from holding office again. The House drafts articles of impeachment outlining the president's alleged offenses, and can vote to impeach him with a simple majority vote on any of the articles. However, impeachment in the House is not enough to remove or disqualify a president from office. The Senate then holds an impeachment trial, and ultimately votes on whether to convict or acquit the president on the articles approved by the House. A two-thirds majority of senators (at least 67) would need to vote for convicting the president, leading to his removal and potential ban from public office. What happened? The 17th president was the first to be impeached. Johnson, a Democrat from Tennessee, was President Abraham Lincoln's running mate for Lincoln's second term. Just 42 days after becoming vice president, Johnson ascended to the presidency following Lincoln's assassination in April 1865. This put him in charge of a country still reeling from the Civil War, and he was soon clashing with Congress over how to handle Reconstruction.\u00a0 Johnson favored a lenient approach to the former Confederate states and shocked lawmakers with some of his vetoes, including his veto of a bill that would have provided food, shelter and aid to newly freed African Americans and Southern refugees. The final straw came in 1868, when Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a Lincoln appointee who opposed Johnson's approach to Reconstruction. House Republicans said this violated the Tenure of Office Act, a law passed one year earlier that said the Senate must approve the president's dismissal of a Cabinet member he appointed. (Johnson vetoed that bill, but Congress overrode him. The Supreme Court ruled in 1926 that the Tenure of Office Act was invalid, and it is no longer enforced.) What did the impeachment articles say?\u00a0 In February 1868, the House voted in favor of an impeachment resolution against Johnson. A week later, the House adopted 11 articles of impeachment. Most of the articles centered on Johnson's dismissal of Stanton, alleging that the move defied the Senate and violated the Constitution. One article accused Johnson of unlawfully ordering that all military orders had to come from the General of the Army.\u00a0 Another article said Johnson gave speeches that attempted \"to bring into disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach, the Congress of the United States.\" That article said Johnson had declared \"with a loud voice, certain intemperate, inflammatory and scandalous harangues,\" and that he had uttered \"loud threats and bitter menace\" toward Congress. The text of the impeachment articles repeatedly said that Johnson was \"unmindful of the high duties of his oath of office.\" What was the outcome?\u00a0 Only three of the impeachment articles were voted on by the Senate \u2014 two about the appointment of Stanton's replacement, and one about insulting and disrupting Congress.\u00a0 On each of these three articles, the Senate acquitted Johnson by a single vote. He remained in office until 1869, leaving after one term when he failed to win his own party's nomination. What happened? Nixon, a Republican, resigned before facing a formal impeachment vote. But he was the first president since Johnson to have impeachment articles drafted against him.\u00a0 The impeachment process for Nixon started in October 1973, after the Watergate scandal had dragged on for more than a year.\u00a0 Nixon resisted House subpoenas as the Watergate investigation intensified. The impeachment process began just days after the \"Saturday Night Massacre,\" when Nixon fired the special prosecutor investigating Watergate, Archibald Cox, and accepted the resignations of Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus. In the impeachment proceedings, Nixon was not directly implicated in the break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington. Rather, the focus was on his efforts to obstruct the Watergate investigation. What did the impeachment articles say? The House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon in July 1974. The first said Nixon had worked with subordinates to \"delay, impede, and obstruct the investigation\" into the Watergate break-in to \"cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities.\" The second article said the president had \"repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens\" by \"impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries.\" The third article focused on Nixon's resistance of subpoenas from the House committee. It said the president had \"interposed the powers of the Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of the House of Representatives, thereby assuming to himself functions and judgments necessary to the exercise of the sole power of impeachment vested by the Constitution in the House of Representatives.\" What was the outcome? The House Judiciary Committee approved all three articles, but the articles never reached a full House vote. An impeachment seemed inevitable after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the White House to release the tape of a phone call that showed Nixon had ordered a cover-up of Watergate. Even the Republican House leader said he would vote to impeach Nixon.\u00a0 Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974. He became the first, and so far only, U.S. president to resign. And even though he was not technically impeached, he was also the first and only president to leave office due to an impeachment process. One month later, Nixon's successor, President Gerald Ford, granted Nixon a full pardon for any crimes he may have committed as president, ensuring that he wouldn't face punishment out of office. Ford argued that an end to the Watergate saga was in the country's best interest. What happened? More than 130 years after Johnson's impeachment, Clinton, a Democrat, became the second president to be impeached.\u00a0 Clinton's impeachment process sprouted from the Starr Report \u2014 the result of a four-year independent counsel investigation into his administration \u2014 and from a lawsuit filed by Paula Jones, a woman accusing Clinton of sexual misconduct.\u00a0 In a deposition for the Jones lawsuit, Clinton falsely claimed that he did not have a sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The Starr Report said Clinton tried to cover up his affair with Lewinsky, and had pressured his secretary Betty Currie to repeat his denials. What did the impeachment articles say? The Republican-held House drafted four\u00a0articles of impeachment against Clinton, but only two were approved. The first article that passed said Clinton had provided \"perjurious, false and misleading testimony\" to a grand jury in the Jones case. It was approved in a 228\u2013206 vote. The second approved article, which passed with a 221\u2013212 vote, said Clinton had \"obstructed justice in an effort to delay, impede, cover up and conceal the existence of evidence related to the Jones case.\" An article for a second perjury count, and another article accusing Clinton of abuse of power, failed to get a majority vote. Clinton was impeached in December 1998. At least one Democrat voted for each of the four impeachment articles, and five Democrats voted for the two that were ultimately passed. What was the outcome? A Republican-controlled Senate acquitted Clinton on both charges in February 1999. The Senate trial resulted in 45 \"guilty\" votes for perjury and 50 \"guilty\" votes on obstruction \u2014 both short of the two-thirds vote needed to convict and remove the president.\u00a0 All 45 Democrats in the Senate voted \"not guilty\" on both charges, and several Republicans joined them, with some arguing that Clinton did not deserve to be removed from the White House for these offenses. Clinton remained in office and completed his second term.\u00a0 What happened? Some congressional Democrats, as well as protesters nationwide, began calling for President Trump's impeachment right after he took office. But it took an anonymous whistleblower complaint, in the third year of his presidency, to eventually make it happen. The complaint filed in August 2019 sounded the alarm about a phone call Mr. Trump had with another world leader. A month before, Mr. Trump had asked the new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call to \"do us a favor\" and pursue politically-loaded investigations, while withholding U.S. military assistance that had been approved by Congress. One issue the president raised involved a disproven conspiracy theory that Ukraine somehow interfered in the 2016 election. He also pressed for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden \u2014 then a frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary \u2014 and his son, Hunter, who held a paid position on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma while his father was vice president.\u00a0 Earlier in July, Mr. Trump had ordered a freeze on $391 million in security aid to Ukraine that Congress had approved. The U.S. ultimately released the aid in September, after the whistleblower complaint, and Ukraine never launched either investigation. Days after news of the whistleblower complaint emerged, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched a formal impeachment inquiry in the Democrat-controlled House. During the hearings that followed, former and current Trump administration officials testified about an irregular diplomatic channel in Ukraine involving the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and stressed that the freeze on aid undermined American and Ukrainian national security.\u00a0 Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified that there was a \"quid pro quo\"\u00a0conditioning the security aid and a White House meeting on Mr. Trump's requests to Zelensky. During the inquiry, the White House refused to comply with House subpoenas for documents and witness testimonies. The president insisted that his call with Ukraine's president was \"perfect.\"\u00a0 What did the impeachment articles say? House Democrats settled on personal attorney: Abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The abuse of power article said Mr. Trump had \"openly and corruptly\" solicited political investigations from Ukraine and conditioned official acts on his requests. \"President Trump engaged in this scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit,\" it said. The obstruction of Congress article cited Mr. Trump for withholding documents and ordering officials to not testify. \"In violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed \u2014 Donald J. Trump has directed the unprecedented, categorical, and indiscriminate defiance of subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives pursuant to its 'sole Power of Impeachment,\" it said. Mr. Trump's Republican defenders criticized the articles as partisan and political, noting that abuse of power and obstruction of Congress are not criminal offenses. They also criticized House Democrats for rushing the process instead of waiting for courts to rule on the subpoenas. What was the outcome? On December 18, 2019, the House impeached Mr. Trump on both articles. The votes\u00a0were 230-197 for abuse of power, and 229-198 for obstruction of Congress. At the time, those were the two highest vote tallies ever in support of impeachment articles.\u00a0 No Republicans voted in favor of either article. Two Democrats voted against the abuse of power article, three voted against the obstruction article, and one (Tusli Gabbard, who was also running for president) simply voted \"present\" for both.\u00a0 The Senate trial's opening arguments began January 22, and the trial concluded just two weeks later. Republicans controlled the Senate with 53 votes, and used that power to keep the trial as short as possible.\u00a0 A majority of 51 Republicans voted against allowing subpoenas for additional documents or calling witnesses, one of whom would have been John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security advisor. Bolton published a memoir later in 2020, in which he confirmed the accusation that Mr. Trump withheld Ukraine's military aid to pressure the government into investigating the Bidens. On February 5, the Senate acquitted Mr. Trump on both charges. The votes were 52-48 on abuse of power, and 53-47 on obstruction of Congress. Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah\u00a0voted to convict Mr. Trump on the abuse of power charge \u2014 becoming the first senator to ever vote against a president of his own party in an impeachment trial. Mr. Trump held a ceremony at the White House the next day celebrating his acquittal in a profanity-laced speech. What happened? Nine months after his acquittal, Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. But the president refused to concede. In the two months after the election, Mr. Trump insisted he won the race and spread false conspiracy theories about election fraud. His legal team filed dozens of challenges to the election results, all of which were shot down in court. His falsehoods set off a \"Stop The Steal\" movement of supporters who wrongly insisted the election was rigged and sought to overturn the results. Mr. Trump held a \"Save America\" rally on the National Mall on January 6, 2021, the day Congress met for its ceremonial counting of Electoral College votes confirming Mr. Biden's victory. The president told his supporters about 20 times to \"fight\" the election results, and said they should \"demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated.\" He urged supporters to walk down to the U.S. Capitol and said he would go with them, but he didn't go. Thousands of supporters from the rally then marched to the U.S. Capitol, and hundreds broke through police lines and stormed the building to disrupt the vote count. Capitol Police evacuated Congress members as the rioters assaulted officers, ransacked offices and chanted for the deaths of lawmakers, including Vice President Mike Pence, whom Mr. Trump falsely claimed could overturn the election results. The insurrection led to five deaths, including a Capitol police officer, Brian Sicknick,\u00a0who died from injuries sustained in the attack. During the Capitol assault, Mr. Trump posted a video on Twitter telling supporters, \"We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. You're very special.\" He still claimed the election was \"fraudulent\" and did not explicitly denounce any of the violence. After several hours, the rioters were cleared from the Capitol, and Congress reconvened to the complete the vote count \u2014 the final step in confirming Mr. Trump's defeat. What did the impeachment articles say? Lawmakers in both parties blamed Mr. Trump for fueling the violence. Just five days after the attack, the Democrat-controlled House introduced an article of impeachment for incitement of insurrection. The article condemned Mr. Trump for his remarks before the riot as well as his earlier efforts to subvert his election loss, including a call to Georgia's secretary of state asking him to \"find\" votes to flip the state for Mr. Trump. \"In all this, President Trump gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government,\" the article states. \"He threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power, and imperiled a coequal branch of Government.\" It said Mr. Trump would be \"a threat to national security, democracy, and the Constitution if allowed to remain in office,\" even though he only had a few days left. The House voted 232-197 to approve the article on January 13, one week before the end of Mr. Trump's term. Ten Republicans joined all Democrats in the vote, making it the most bipartisan impeachment vote in U.S. history. It was also the highest vote tally ever in support of an impeachment article \u2014 breaking the previous record from Mr. Trump's first impeachment.\u00a0 This second impeachment raised the unprecedented questions of whether a former president could even face a Senate trial, and what kind of punishment he would get if convicted. The Constitution does not directly address these issues, but\u00a0most constitutional scholars agreed\u00a0that officials can face impeachment trials even after they have left office.\u00a0 The primary historical example is\u00a0William Belknap, the secretary of war under President Ulysses S. Grant, who in 1876 handed in his resignation and burst into tears just minutes before the House was set to vote on impeaching him for a kickbacks scandal. The House still unanimously approved five impeachment articles, and the Senate held a trial, where Belknap was ultimately acquitted on all charges. With Mr. Trump already removed from office through an election, Democrats said they could ban him from running for office again, which would have required a separate vote after his conviction. What was the outcome? The Senate trial began February 9, and wrapped after just five days \u2014 a swift end for the fastest impeachment process on record. On the trial's first day, the Senate decided in a 56-44 bipartisan vote that the trial was indeed constitutional.\u00a0 Democratic impeachment managers relied heavily on video evidence for their arguments. They played never-before-seen footage from the Capitol attack, showing how close lawmakers had come to facing a violent mob, along with videos of Mr. Trump encouraging violence during his presidency and campaign rallies. Mr. Trump's defense focused largely on challenging the process of trying a former president, and argued against directly connecting him to the Capitol violence. On the trial's final day, the Senate voted to allow witnesses and more evidence \u2014 a move that could have prolonged the trial for weeks or months. But just two hours later, impeachment managers and Mr. Trump's lawyers reached an agreement to proceed to the trial's conclusion. One impeachment manager, Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, later told CBS News' \"Face The Nation\" that he believed more witnesses \"would not have made a difference\" for most Republican senators.\u00a0 In the end, the Senate acquitted Mr. Trump with a vote of 57 \"Guilty\" to 43 \"Not Guilty\" \u2014 10 votes short of the two-thirds majority needed for conviction. Seven Republicans voted against Mr. Trump \u2014 Richard Burr of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. It is the highest number of senators to vote for convicting their own party's president, breaking another record from Mr. Trump's first impeachment.\u00a0 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell voted to acquit Mr. Trump but still blamed him for the Capitol riot in a scathing speech\u00a0immediately afterwards, saying there was \"no question\" the former president is \"practically and morally responsible\" for the riot. The Kentucky Republican said his acquittal vote came from his decision that the Senate did not have constitutional grounds to convict an ex-president. McConnell, however, said Mr. Trump was not immune from being punished by the country's criminal and civil laws. \"He didn't get away with anything yet,\" he said. \"Yet.\"",

            "article_content": "Watch the CBS Reports\u00a0documentary \"The Right's Fight to Make America a Christian Nation\" in the video player above.\u00a0 Outside the Capitol insurrection in January, a group of protesters carried a large wooden cross and a flag flew reading \"Jesus is My Savior, Trump is My President.\" Some in the crowd embraced Christian nationalism, an ideology that combines Christian and American identities and promotes Christianity as the reigning religion. Research has found that adherence to Christian nationalism was a significant predictor of support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election. Like other White evangelical Christians \u2014 a reliable Republican voting bloc for decades \u2014 they saw their support for President Trump rewarded with conservative judicial nominees and policies promoting \"religious liberty.\" But hundreds of evangelical leaders have condemned the \"radicalization\" emerging among those who identify as Christian nationalists. The debate over what role religion should play in public life has never been more contentious, with some promoting a vision of Christian primacy that critics say tramples on the rights of everyone else. Several pastors with very different points of view shared their thoughts in the CBS Reports documentary, \"The Right's Fight to Make America a Christian Nation.\" A Bible sits on Pastor Ken Peters' desk, its cover graced with an American flag and inscribed with the words \"FOR GOD AND COUNTRY.\" His church has an American flag painted across its roof.\u00a0 \"I believe we are the greatest country next to Israel. I got to give God Israel as His chosen people in the Old Testament,\" he told CBS News. \"But we've proven it, America's the greatest country that's ever existed in the history of the world, and it's because of Judeo-Christian values.\" In September 2020, Peters founded the Patriot Church in Knoxville, Tennessee, one of a network of three \"Pro-America\" non-denominational congregations that \"desire to see a land infiltrated by the Holy Spirit.\" He said his goal for the Patriot Church is to avoid tiptoeing around political issues like he believes other churches do. \"At the pulpit, we preach strong against things like abortion, things like gay marriage,\" said Peters. \"We talk about religious freedom and we endorse candidates. We endorse President Trump. We endorse people that we feel are running on a platform of righteousness.\" At a Patriot Church service a month after Mr. Trump's defeat, Peters called out to his congregation, \"Who won the election?\" The crowd shouted back in unison, \"Trump!\"\u00a0 For Peters, the stakes are high: he believes religious liberty is under attack in America and a Biden victory means the further loss of religious freedom. \"We're about to lose this country as we've always known it. It's about to become something completely different. \u2026 I don't want it. My parents don't want it. My grandparents don't want it,\" he said.\u00a0 \"It's not according to our heritage,\" he continued. \"That's why I'm fighting so hard to keep it a Christian nation.\" Peters said he wants the country to have \"Christian principles and Christian laws and Christian ways,\" a stance that Christian nationalists, who believe Christianity should have dominant influence on American life and politics, would agree with. However, Peters rejects the label \u2014 though he added that he does consider himself a nationalist as opposed to a globalist. \"I think [Christian nationalist] has a connotation of some sort of racist, or I think America is better than every other country. I hate that term,\" he said. \"I do believe America is special. I believe she's beautiful. I believe her roots are great. \u2026 So I will never say that I'm a Christian nationalist, but I will say I'm a Christian that loves America.\" \"I have seen the look of surprise on legislators when I will announce at the beginning of a testimony in a hearing that I'm a Baptist minister, and I am opposing this bill to promote Christianity in public schools precisely because of my faith,\" Brian Kaylor told CBSN Originals.\u00a0 Kaylor grew up attending a Southern Baptist church and went to school at Southwest Baptist University. He pastored a Baptist church for a couple of years and in that time realized that he was better suited for a different part of the ministry, which grew to include advocacy for the separation of church and state.\u00a0 Kaylor, who lives in Jefferson City, Missouri, has testified against several bills in the Missouri State Legislature, including one in 2019 that pushed Bible literacy classes in public schools and another in 2020 that would require public universities to provide official recognition and benefits to religious student associations.\u00a0 \"Separation of church and state is really important because it's really the only way that we can protect the purity of not just the church, but also of individual faith,\" said Kaylor. \"I also think it helps the state to remain focused on the welfare of all people, not just those of a privileged class, be that religion or be that some other special class.\" Kaylor sees a timely lesson in the history of the 1950s, when the U.S. adopted \"In God We Trust\" as the national motto and added \"under God\" to the Pledge of Allegiance. \"It's not happening in a vacuum. It's happening because we're in the middle of a Cold War against that atheistic Soviet Union. And so we need to conjure up that God is on our side,\" he said. \"We saw this in the '50s and we are definitely seeing another wave \u2026 I think this time it's this concern that we, the White evangelicals, White Christians, are losing control of our country.\" He opposes policies promoting Christianity in public life and the so-called \"religious freedom\" laws that would allow business owners to cite their religious beliefs to turn away members of the LGBTQ community. \"There is just the psychological, personal, spiritual level of being constantly treated as if you're not really accepted in your own community, and I think that can be very damaging,\" he said.\u00a0 Kaylor said he doesn't believe that the separation of church and state is an attack on religious liberties.\u00a0 \"Some people almost seem to act, 'If I can't establish my religion, then you're violating my free exercise of it,'\" he said. \"Establishing your faith is not religious liberty for someone else. Because if someone else's liberty is endangered, then all of us, all of our liberty is in danger.\" Michael Walrond Jr., the senior pastor at First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem, wants to see America live up to its ideals. \"America may be a Christian nation in language, but it's far from it in practice: how we treat people, how we manipulate, how we take advantage of, how we live in a country of so much wealth, and there's so much poverty,\" he said. \" I could go on and on. If we were a quote-unquote 'Christian nation,' there are certain harsh realities that in many ways define this country, that would not exist.\" For Walrond, the rising Christian nationalist movement and the intermixing of Christian and American exceptionalism \"is really a shroud for bigotry and prejudice\" \u2014 a way to justify the denigration of people of color, immigrants, and people of other faiths.\u00a0 \"All of that has theological undertones that are deeply rooted in a dysfunctional and distorted view of Christianity that really serves as a covering for ideas and notions of supremacy, superiority, and racial supremacy and superiority,\" he said.\u00a0 Walrond believes young people are turned off by the intolerance, and nationwide their church attendance is down. According to Gallup, only 19% of 24-year-olds attended church weekly or almost weekly in 2019, down from 33% in 2002. At his own church, Walrond has seen the opposite trend: when he started preaching at First Corinthian there were maybe 100 attendees, and now they're reaching thousands. He attributes it to the kind of teachings provided there.\u00a0 \"There are a lot of young people here, in spite of what the statistics say, because they don't find a space that is intolerant and rigid. They find a space that is open, that affirms the dignity of human beings and affirms them,\" he said. Walrond speaks openly of political issues that he said other pastors may prefer to avoid. \"There are issues that are political that impact the everyday lives of our people,\" he said. \"It would be theological and homiletical malpractice for me to stand in this pulpit, right, and preach a salvation that doesn't take seriously the lived lives of individuals, right?\" In 2014, he even ran for Congress but lost the Democratic primary. In the end, Walrond said his focus is on living the teachings of God. \u00a0 \"I hope that in the future, we actually take love seriously and make it be the lens by which we view the world. I hope that in a way, human beings can begin to live the lives we were created to live, that we will love beyond the limits of our prejudices, and understand our responsibility to serve and take care of one another.\"",

            "article_content": "Watch the CBS Reports documentary \"An (Un)Civil War: The Evangelical Divide\" in the video player above. At Koinonia Church in Nashville, Tennessee, Alan and Penny Godwin watch as Pastor Mika Edmondson preaches about racism that existed in some Christian communities for centuries. The Godwins, who belonged to a predominantly White evangelical church for 30 years, joined Koinonia Church in November 2020, the first week that Edmondson launched it with the aim of building a more diverse congregation. Koinonia reflects the growing diversity of American Christianity, which has seen the share of Protestants of color nearly double between 1991 and 2016. \"We both said, 'You may not want a couple of old White people to join your church, and that's fine if you don't. But we're interested in your success with whatever you're going to do there,'\" said Penny Godwin, 67. The Godwins said that on the issue of race, their former congregation was divided. \"I think some of the leaders were very comfortable addressing these issues, but not everybody in the congregation was comfortable with it,\" said Alan Godwin, 68. \"And so, if they were to broach some of these subjects they got a lot of pushback. I think they had the suspicion that people would bolt and leave if they brought it up and made it too much of an issue.\" The couple said their decision to switch churches was heavily influenced by the police killings of Black men and women, which Penny admits she used to dismiss and even assumed were justified. \"That kind of terrible thinking that rattles around in your head when you're in a little white bubble. Anyway, that opened that for me. So it was like, 'If I've been wrong about that, what else have I been wrong about?' It opened my mind in a way that had not happened, and I didn't consider myself to be a close-minded person.\" Not everyone agreed with the Godwins' decision to leave their old church. \"We've got a lot of Facebook friends, social media friends that we've known, in some cases for almost 50 years,\" Alan said. \"There are even people that I went to college with who are still very much in that segment of evangelicalism that believes this is all just stoked-up, contrived racism for some sinister purpose. I think the general assumption is that either we've lost our minds, or we've got duped by some Marxist philosophy.\" Conservative political commentator David French, now the editor of The Dispatch, has spent much of his career studying the politics of White evangelicals, who made up 14% of the U.S. population in 2020. He notes that in politics, \"evangelical\" is often assumed to be \"White evangelical.\" He points out that the evangelical community is not so monolithic: \"If you look at the evangelical community more broadly, people of every race and ethnicity who believe broadly the same theological propositions, then it's much more closely divided.\" Some evidence of this move toward greater inclusiveness could be seen at this year's election for president of the Southern Baptist Convention, when Ed Litton, who ran on a message of unity and diversity, beat ultraconservative candidate Mike Stone, albeit by just 4 points. Fundamentalist pastors were dismayed by Litton's victory. Pastor Greg Locke, who has sparked controversy for sermons questioning the legitimacy of the 2020 election and spreading misinformation about COVID-19, said the vote represents a power struggle across evangelical denominations. \"They just voted in, without a doubt, the most liberal leftist president they've ever had,\" Locke said. \"There was this conservative resurgence for years. And so now people are struggling. Is the Bible of the word of God? Is it just a book written by men? The critical race theory. Everything now is up for grabs. And so there's this massive division.\" Locke said churches that preach about race are making the problem worse. \"The problem is, everybody wants to keep picking the scab. That's what these social justice churches are picking a scab, picking a scab. Leave it alone, let it heal. And they won't let us heal because they keep bringing it up,\" Locke said. \"They're trying to, they're trying to take away the structure of who we are as Americans to make us look inherently racist.\" Edmondson said that Christians who don't acknowledge America's structural racism are propping up bigotry with their silence. \"I think people want to affirm the sort of inherent goodness of America and the American project. They want to say America is a good country,\" Edmondson said. \"But in their attempt to try to affirm the goodness of America in every respect they often are overlooking, downplaying, and perhaps even reinforcing the sufferings of a lot of people.\" Koinonia's scholar-in-residence and Pastor Mika Edmondson's wife, Dr. Christina Edmondson, said that these demographic shifts have created fear for many White evangelicals. \"That creates all kinds of psychological unease, frustration, fear, conflict with family of origin, what they've been given, the mythologies about America that they've been handed over to them,\" Edmondson said. \"It will continue to be used as a really effective political strategy particularly as people are having this existential crisis.\" Political scientists have named this ideology Christian nationalism, which fuses patriotism with Christianity. Experts use the term to describe a group of people who believe America was founded as a Christian nation that needs to be restored to its roots. Before joining Koinonia, Penny and Alan Godwin felt the momentum growing behind Christian nationalist ideologies. \"I don't know that I'd ever heard the term Christian nationalism before a couple of years ago. And the more that I read about it, the more I understand about it, there have been great tendencies for people to conflate America and Christianity,\" said Alan. \"And the more they rally to that cause, the more extreme they become. And so people that have had the mentality that we have felt ourselves increasingly on the outs, in that kind of space. That's one of the reasons we felt like we had to leave.\"",

            "article_content": "U.S. intelligence agencies believe domestic terrorism poses an \"elevated threat\" to the homeland in 2021, predicting in a new joint report that social and political factors including the coronavirus pandemic and \"emboldening impact of the violent breach of the U.S. Capitol\" will \"almost certainly\" spur domestic violent extremists to engage in further violence.\u00a0 The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued an unclassified summary of a joint assessment of the national security threat posed by domestic violent extremism, Wednesday. The comprehensive threat assessment provided by ODNI, the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security to the White House and Congress was produced at the direction of President Biden, who solicited the report in the wake of the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The full classified report \u2013 described by an ODNI official as a \"fact-based analysis\" that may inform strategy and policy development \u2013 was sent to White House and Congress Tuesday, according to an ODNI official. The report arrived on the same day DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called domestic violent extremism the \"greatest\" and \"most persistent\" threat to the homeland. \"Newer sociopolitical developments \u2014 such as narratives of fraud in the recent general election, the emboldening impact of the violent breach of the US Capitol, conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and conspiracy theories promoting violence \u2014 will almost certainly spur some (domestic violent extremists) to try to engage in violence this year,\" reads the unclassified summary. The report separates domestic violent extremists into different groups, including racially or ethnically motivated extremists, anti-government extremists, animal rights and environmental extremists and abortion-related extremists. Intelligence agencies found that racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists and militia violent extremists presented the \"most lethal threats.\" Racially motivated extremists were determined to be the most likely to instigate mass-casualty attacks against civilians, according to the unclassified summary. In contrast, the threat assessment found militia violent extremists typically target law enforcement and government personnel and facilities. White supremacists built networks of support outside the U.S. in some cases, the unclassified summary revealed, adding a \"small number\" have travelled abroad to \"network with like-minded individuals.\" Social media platforms, including smaller websites and encrypted chat applications, were pinpointed as emerging tools for recruitment, planning and dissemination of materials that ultimately contribute to violent acts. The assessment also noted that \"lone offenders\" or \"small cells\" of domestic violent extremists adhering to diverse ideologies are more likely to carry out violent attacks than organizations espousing a specific ideology. Appearing before Congress Tuesday, Mayorkas warned that lone-wolf extremists expressing \"loose affiliation\" with ideologies of hate and extremism are \"willing to execute on them in unlawful, violent and illegal ways.\" The full classified assessment was coordinated across the intelligence community and law enforcement, according to an ODNI official, drawing from government and non-governmental organizations, as deemed appropriate. \u00a0 House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, underscored in a statement the \"transnational element to the threat of domestic violent extremism.\" \"The threat of white nationalism in particular has become a global phenomenon,\" he said. Schiff called Wednesday's assessment \"a good first step\" but urged intelligence agencies to publicly release additional details as mandated by Congress, including, \"specific information on incidents, investigations, prosecutions, analysis, prioritization, personnel and resources.\" The full classified assessment was coordinated across the intelligence community and law enforcement, according to an ODNI official, drawing from government and non-governmental organizations, as deemed appropriate. \u00a0 Olivia Gazis contributed to this report.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.",

            "article_content": "Toronto\u00a0\u2014 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday Canada could start allowing Americans fully vaccinated against the coronavirus into Canada as of mid-August for non-essential travel. He said the country should be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travelers from all countries by early September.  Trudeau spoke with leaders of Canada's provinces and his office released a readout of the call. He noted that if Canada's current positive path of vaccination rate and public health conditions continue the border can open. \u00a0 \"Canada would be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travelers from all countries by early September,\" the readout said. \"He noted the ongoing discussions with the United States on reopening plans and indicated that we could expect to start allowing fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents into Canada as of mid-August for non-essential travel.\" Trudeau noted Canada continues to lead G20 countries in vaccination rates with approximately 80% of eligible Canadians vaccinated with their first dose and over 50% of eligible Canadians fully vaccinated. He said case numbers and severe illness continue to decline across the country as vaccination rates continue to increase. \u00a0 In the early days of the pandemic, the U.S. and Canadian governments closed the more than 5,500-mile border to nonessential traffic. With increasing vaccination rates and dropping infection rates, some were annoyed the two governments hadn't laid out detailed plans to fully reopen the border. Canada began easing its restrictions earlier this month, allowing fully vaccinated Canadians or permanent legal residents to return to Canada without quarantining. People still must prove a negative COVID-19 test before returning, and another once they get back. Pressure has been mounting on Canada to continue to ease the restrictions at the border, which have been in effect since March of last year. \u00a0 Providing exemptions for travel into Canada amid the pandemic is politically sensitive and Trudeau is expected to call a federal election next month. \u00a0 Trudeau said his ministers would share more details on the border early next week. Commercial traffic has gone back and forth normally between the two countries since the start of the pandemic. Canadians are able to fly into the United States with a negative COVID-19 test. \u00a0 The U.S. Travel Association estimates that each month the border is closed costs $1.5 billion. Canadian officials say Canada had about 22 million foreign visitors in 2019 \u2014 about 15 million of them from the United States. Tom Webb, a 63-year-old retired U.S. navy pilot from Orchard Park, New York, said he's seriously thinking of selling his cottage in Georgian Bay, Ontario after not being able to access it for almost two years. He is vaccinated. \"I am beyond frustrated,\" he said. \u00a0 Canadian officials have said they would like 75% of eligible Canadian residents to be fully vaccinated before loosening border restrictions for tourists and business travelers. The Canadian government expects to have enough vaccine delivered for 80% of eligible Canadians to be fully vaccinated by the end of July. The U.S. only allowed for exports of vaccines into Canada in early May.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Kamala Harris said she and President Joe Biden will at \"some point\" visit the southern border as the U.S. remains on track to open at least six emergency facilities to house migrant children streaming into the country. Harris spoke to \"CBS This Morning\" on Wednesday as the Biden administration faces scrutiny on both sides of the aisle for how they are addressing the growing crisis. Harris said Wednesday that the administration needs to work to solve the root problem of the migrant crisis and deal with what causes people from those countries to come to the United States. \"At some point, absolutely we will go down to the border and I've been down to the border and our secretary of the Homeland Security Alex Mayorkas has been down there twice. Senior administration officials have been down there and yes, we will go,\" she said. \"But the reality also is that in addition to the border, we also need to deal with the root causes. We need to deal with what's happening in the Northern Triangle and address it in a way that is about not only diplomacy but bringing our allies together. Dealing with what we need to do around aid in a way that is about developing those countries so that we also deal with the cause of why people are coming into our country.\" The Border Patrol reports that they are encountering about 530 unaccompanied minors every day. More than 16,000 migrant children are currently in U.S. custody, with 5,000 of those in the hands of Border Patrol. Harris said that she agrees the influx of unaccompanied minors is a \"huge problem\" but that things wouldn't be fixed overnight. Along with the crisis at the border, Harris spoke to \"CBS This Morning\" about gun violence and the rise in crimes against Asian Americans Read her full interview below: \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King: Vice President Kamala Harris joins us now for an exclusive interview from Washington, D.C. Madam Vice President, good morning to you. We're very glad to see you this morning. There is so much to discuss, so we'll get started. Listen, it's clear that the president's intention and his frustration are very clear. But the reality is you guys just don't have the votes. So what's your move? Vice President Kamala Harris: Well, on the issue of gun violence, let's just be very clear, we are seeing tragedy after tragedy after tragedy. We are now learning the names of the ten people in Colorado, including that police officer who was, who ran into fire in terms of gunfire. A father of seven children. We are looking in Atlanta and all of those folks who all of them at the grocery store, in these establishments, going about their lives. King: I know the personal stories are heartbreaking. The personal stories... Harris: But Gayle, here's why I mention it, here's why I mention it,  because I'm going to tell you something, I've been working on this for a long time. I actually thought that Sandy Hook would have been the thing that moved Congress. How, when 20 six- and seven-year-old babies were slaughtered, and they did not act, and they did not not act. It is time for Congress to act and stop with the false choices. This is not about getting rid of the Second Amendment. It's simply about saying we need reasonable gun safety laws. There is no reason why we have assault weapons on the streets of a civil society. They are weapons of war. They are designed to kill a lot of people quickly.  King: Yeah. We all agree. Harris: Let us all agree that we need background checks. But the point here is Congress needs to act and on the House side, they did. There are two bills which the president is prepared to sign, and so we need the Senate to act. And this is going to be about your viewers and all of us pleading to the reason, pleading to the hearts and minds of the people in the United States Senate to say enough with the partisanship, enough with the ideological perspective on this. Let's just be practical and agree. People who have been found to be a danger to themselves and others should not be able to purchase a gun.  King: So, what will the Biden administration do? We keep hearing about executive action. What does that mean, Madam Vice President? Harris: What it means is that we need to take action. But Gayle, let's be clear about this, there is the piece about executive action, but if we pass legislation, it's permanent. If we, if the Congress acts, then it becomes law. And that is what we have lacked. That is what has been missing. We need universal background checks. You know, various states have done it. But there's no universal approach to this and so what ends up happening, people can move from one state to another depending on what the law is. We need to have a federal standard and that is going to be accomplished by the way we have structured our democracy when the United States Congress acts. The House has acted. Now it's in the hands of the Senate. \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Anthony Mason: But madam... Harris: The president is prepared to sign it. Mason: Madam Vice President, as it stands right now, you do not have the votes. Failing that, is the president prepared to take executive action? Harris: We should first expect the United States Congress to act. I'm not willing to give up on what we must do to appeal to the hearts and minds and the reason of the members of the United States Senate. I served in that body, and I believe that it is possible, it has to be possible that people agree that these slaughters have to stop. And this is, again reject the false choices, stop pushing it for sure. Stop pushing the false choice that this means everybody's trying to come after your guns. That is not what we're talking about. King: Yeah, most reasonable people get that. Ted Cruz said something interesting yesterday. He called this conversation \"ridiculous theater,\" that the gun laws that are being proposed, the changes, would have done nothing to stop those shootings. Does he have a point? Is this a uniquely American failure? Does he have a point?  Harris: Well, this is what every time there is a slaughter, a mass shooting, someone who does not want to be accountable for what we need to do says, 'Well, that wouldn't have prevented this thing.' You know, arguably if you took this approach to any law, you would argue that we shouldn't pass any laws that are designed to protect the health and well-being of the American people. So listen, yet again we have a situation where there are seven children who have lost their father. Where there are families in two big states of our country who are mourning the loss, forever will be without their family members, their friends, who were innocent, who were going about their lives, and were gunned down. And but guys, I want to be again, I'm going to start with where -- where I started. Which is what I thought Sandy Hook would be... Mason: Right. But it didn't. Harris: The thing that compelled everyone. But it didn't. Mason: I agree with you. But it didn't. My question is how do you change minds in the Senate? You were in the Senate. You know... Harris: Elections matter. Elections matter and you know there are a bunch of folks, Moms Demand Action, folks from Gabby Giffords to the Brady folks too. Let's join them and let's say we're going to hold our elected people accountable. If they're not going to be with us in terms of what we need in terms of reasonable gun safety laws. Mason: But Madam Vice President, we heard from the head of Moms Demand Action earlier in the broadcast who said the president has it in his power to do something right now. Harris: And the president has said he is prepared to sign legislation. Mason: But he can also take executive action. Harris:  I don't think the president is excluding that. But again, I want to be clear that if we really want something that is going to be lasting, we need to pass legislation. Mason: Alright, Vice President Harris stay with us. We want to ask you about your personal reaction to the recent racial attacks and also get your take on the situation unfolding at the border. Harris: Okay. Mason: But first, we're going to take a quick break. Harris: Sure. King: Vice President Kamala Harris is still with us as our exclusive interview with her continues. Madam Vice President, these are such difficult times. We were all still reeling from the shootings in Atlanta. The flags had been lowered half-mast and were back up and now they're lowered again for what's happened in Colorado. But many people are very frustrated with the shooting in Atlanta because it has not been called a hate crime. Should it be? Harris: Listen. I mean Gayle look, you've got six Asian American women in Asian American businesses, and you know when you look at it you have to ask this question which is what is going on. And the seriousness of AAPI hate crime especially over the course of the last year is profound, people are being assaulted, people are being you know, cursed out, people are being treated, people are being denied service because they are Asian American. And look, I think we have to be clear that we have a history in America that we need to deal with. A history that included the Chinese exclusion act, as a law, that we interned Japanese Americans who also fought for the liberty of Americans in war, and we have this rise in hate crimes. And when I was attorney general in California, I published a hate crime report every year. It is not new, but it has grown and it must be confronted and dealt with. King: What do we do?   Harris: What do we do? We have to do a number of things. One is we have to hold the people who commit hate crimes accountable, we also need to speak the truth about our history and not gloss over it. We need to also talk about what we must do, to really think about how we define who is an American. And understand that it is the very essence of the strength our nation that we are a land of immigrants, people who have come from around the globe here and contributed to our vitality, our strength. And all people are part of it. The Chinese helped build the railroads of America. King: Isn't it part of holding people accountable though? At least calling it a hate crime. I think, In Atlanta now, it's been now a week. They still aren't calling it what you know it's like. If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, smells like a duck, it's a duck. There's been such a reluctance to call it that.   Harris: Well I'm not prosecuting that case, so I am not going to tell it how, but I've spoken very clearly about it. Which is exactly, that we are looking at a situation where Asian women have been killed. Let's also talk about the reality of race and sex in terms of the intersectionality of it all. And what we have seen in terms of crimes against Asian women in particular in our country.  Recently and historically. King: Yeah, your voice matters in this conversation. Mason: Madam Vice President, the White House has been criticized by members of its own party for not having enough Asian Americans in the high levels of the government at this point. Senator Tammy Duckworth in particular, very critical of the absence there. What's being done to change that? Are there enough? Harris: Yeah, well, Anthony you're right. Well first of all, let's just speak truth. Representation matters and when you look at the composition of the United States Congress, less than 4% of those serving in Congress are Asian American, AAPI \u2014 Asian American and Pacific Islander. You look at the CEOs of our major companies and corporations in America, less than 3% are Asian American and AAPI. So we need to talk about this. Representation matters and we've got to address it. We are very proud that among our Cabinet we have majority people of color. We are very, and it's historic in that way. We are proud that we have an equal number of women and men, but there's still more work to be done. There's no question about that. King: Let's talk a look at what's happening at the border. Rightly or wrongly people are coming in record numbers because they believe the Biden administration has encouraged certainly children to come. What are you going to do about that? It's chaotic. Some are calling it a crisis and you all, your team is under fire because both Republicans and Democrats said look, if you're going to change the Trump policy, the previous policy, at least have a game plan. And there doesn't appear right now to be a game plan. Harris: Well ok, look it's a huge problem. I'm not going to pretend it's not. It's a huge problem and are there, are we looking at overcrowding at the border? Particularly of these kids? Yes. Should these kids be in the custody of HHS, the Health and Human Services instead of the Border Patrol? Yes. Should we be processing these cases faster? Yes. This is, however, not going to be solved overnight. There are things that we need to do especially since there was a system in place previously before the last administration to allow us to process these kids in their country of origin. That was dismantled; we have to reconstruct it. It's not gonna happen overnight, but you know we have senior administration officials right now in Mexico and Guatemala also dealing with in addition what needs to happen at the border the root causes... King:\u00a0Will you and the president be going down to the border anytime soon? Harris: At some point, absolutely we will go down to the border and I've been down to the border and our secretary of the Homeland Security Alex Mayorkas has been down there twice. Senior administration officials have been down there and yes we will go. But the reality also is that in addition to the border, we also need to deal with the root causes. We need to deal with what's happening in the Northern Triangle and address it in a way that is about not only diplomacy but bringing our allies together. Dealing with what we need to do around aid in a way that is about developing those countries so that we also deal with the cause of why people are coming into our country. Mason: That's a long-term proposition. In the meantime... Harris: It is. Mason: In the meantime there are 500 children... Harris: But we can't give up on that. Mason: Understood, but there are 500 children a day and we don't have enough housing already who are crossing into the border. What do we do in the meantime to stop it? Harris: Well, we do what we need to do to actually reconstruct the systems, Anthony, that are about processing these cases and that is taking some time. Look, we've been in office less than 100 days. We're addressing it, we're dealing with it but it's gonna take some time. And are we frustrated? Are you frustrated? Yes, we are. King: Are you enjoying the job? And then we gotta go. Yes or no. Harris: I am enjoying this job, thank you. I feel very, I feel a great sense of responsibility to make sure we address the needs of the people. King: Well, everybody's watching. Thank you very much Vice President Harris. Harris: Thank you, good to be with you both. Thank you.",

Election integrity, bail reform, border security, social media censorship, transgender sports and critical race theory are among the issues Abbott wants lawmakers to tackle over the session, which could last up to 30 days.\u00a0 \"The 87th Legislative Session was a monumental success for the people of Texas, but we have unfinished business to ensure that Texas remains the most exceptional state in America,\" Abbott said in a statement.\u00a0 The special session comes several weeks after Texas House Democrats staged a walkout to defeat a bill that would have overhauled the state's election laws.\u00a0 The special session could bolster Abbott's conservative credentials ahead of his re-election campaign and also boost his national profile ahead of a potential presidential bid in 2024. Abbott is facing multiple 2022 primary challengers from his right, including Texas GOP Chairman Allen West, who announced his candidacy on July 4.\u00a0 \"The worst-kept secret in Austin is that Greg Abbott is running for president,\" Democratic state Representative Rafael Anchia told CBS News. \"Look at the last few bill signing ceremonies by (Florida Governor) Ron DeSantis and Abbott is going to want to match that blow-for-blow.\" The special session's agenda also includes funding for the state legislature and legislative staff. Abbott vetoed that funding last month after the Democratic walkout. Texas Democrats and other organizations have asked the Texas Supreme Court to override that veto, but the court has not weighed in yet. One notable item not on the agenda: help for the state's electric grid, which struggled to produce enough electricity for Texans during a heavy snowstorm in February.\u00a0 Perhaps no issue will receive as much national attention as the renewed fight over proposed changes to Texas' voting laws.\u00a0 The\u00a0final version of SB 7, the bill that lawmakers failed to pass in May, provides an indication of what lawmakers are going to focus on. That bill would have set limits on the hours that early voting can be conducted, banned drive-through voting, added new requirements for mail voting and made it a felony for public officials to send unsolicited absentee ballot applications. Two of the more controversial provisions from that bill, delaying the start time for Sunday early voting and lowering the standard for overturning an election based on claims of fraud, will not be included in a new election bill, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick tweeted on Tuesday. Patrick also serves as president of the Senate.\u00a0 \"I will gavel in the Texas Senate tomorrow morning at 10 AM. We are ready to pass all of the legislation on Governor Abbott's Special Session call starting with SB1 \u2014 Election Security. Hearings will begin Saturday,\" Patrick tweeted on Wednesday.\u00a0 The Texas House election bill\u00a0posted Wednesday night had many similar provisions to SB7. The bill would ban drive-through voting and require early voting to happen between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. It would require counties with at least 55,000 people to hold the most early voting hours, which would cover more counties than the current 100,000 person floor for those hours.\u00a0 The bill has some ID requirements for mail-in voting, which has voters provide a driver's license or personal ID number, last four digits of their Social Security Number or sign a statement affirming they don't have one of those. It has similar protections for partisan poll watchers and keeps some criminal penalties set in SB 7. The bill allows Sunday voting to start as early at 9 a.m., rather than 1 p.m. in SB 7, and does not lower the standard for overturning an election. Republican state Senator Bryan Hughes, one of the authors of the Senate's election billSB1, said the Senate's bill will include many provisions from last session's election measure, such as extending early voting hours for some medium-sized counties and eliminating drive-through voting and 24-hour voting. Those practices were used by Harris County, home to Houston, during the 2020 election.\u00a0 \"We believe that when people trust the system and know their vote is going to count and count accurately, they're going to want to participate,\" Hughes said. \"These are dealing with specific issues that have come up in Texas elections.\" Democrats have tried to keep up the pressure against the passage of a sweeping election bill. Several Democratic lawmakers went to Washington, D.C., in June to meet with Vice President Harris and Congressional Democrats about voting rights.\u00a0 Trey Martinez Fischer, one of the Democrats who led the walkout in May, said House Democrats and Republicans were able to work together during the spring session to take some of the \"sharp edges\" off of a previous version of the Senate's voting bill. He said Democrats are willing to work with leadership again, but did not rule out another walkout. \"Every option is on the table. The tools we used in the regular session to defeat voter suppression are going to be the tools we'll use in the special session,\" Martinez Fischer said.\u00a0 Texas Democrats have a history of walkouts. They broke quorum twice in 2003, including leaving the state to go to Oklahoma, during a battle over redistricting.\u00a0 Martinez Fischer and other Democrats sent a letter to Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan on Monday asking for a \"fair, transparent, and accessible process throughout the special session.\" They also said no action should be taken on bills until legislative funding has been restored.\u00a0 \"If they're going to take our input, then we have the opportunity to govern together,\" Martinez Fischer said. \"If they want to govern in a hyper-partisan fashion, there's not a single Democrat who will remain on that House floor and let Republicans run over our voting rights.\"\u00a0 Martinez Fischer said he hasn't received a response from the state House speaker, but he's optimistic that a new committee that Phelan announced on Tuesday \"brings a more diverse group of leaders together\" who are known for being \"pragmatic and bipartisan.\" Voting rights and election reforms have been one of the top political issues in 2021. State lawmakers around the country considered hundreds of bills to amend election laws. Georgia, Florida and Iowa were among the states that passed some of the most high-profile changes. The Justice Department announced in June that it is suing Georgia over its new voting law. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled that two voting rules in Arizona do not violate a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. \u00a0 CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Democratic lawmakers from Texas declared Monday night that they were \"determined to kill this bill\" after they left the state earlier in the day to prevent a vote in the state legislature on Republican election bills.\u00a0 By leaving the state, lawmakers are preventing a quorum during the special legislative session that is being held because they\u00a0scuttled the May legislative session\u00a0\u2014  \u00a0also by leaving \u2014 to block a sweeping elections bill. More than 50 Democratic members of the Texas House left the state.\u00a0 \"We are determined to kill this bill in this special session that will end on August 7. We will stay out until then in order to do that,\" Texas House Democratic Caucus Chair Chris Turner said at a press conference Monday night after landing in the Washington, D.C., area. \"There is no more time. We must pass strong federal voter protection legislation.\" Currently, there are two main election bills in the House and Senate.\u00a0Both measures would eliminate drive-thru and 24-hour early voting, expand early voting hours to some medium-sized counties, add identification requirements for voting by mail, increase criminal penalties for some election officials who don't follow regulations and give more powers to poll watchers.\u00a0 Opponents say the bills would make it more difficult for thousands of Texans, especially in minority communities, to vote. On Saturday and into early Sunday, Texas lawmakers heard hundreds of hours of testimony from state residents against the proposals.\u00a0 Texas lawmakers returned to Austin last week to start a special session. Governor Greg Abbott asked lawmakers to address election integrity, bail reform, border security, social media censorship, transgender sports and critical race theory. Passing an election bill is one of the top priorities for Republican lawmakers during the special session. Texas House Democratic leaders said in a statement that they stand \"united in our decision to break quorum and refuse to let the Republican-led legislature force through legislation that would trample on Texans' freedom to vote.\" They urged Congress to pass the For the People Act, a sweeping federal election bill, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, which is aimed at shoring up a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.\u00a0 \"We are now taking the fight to our nation's capital. We are living on borrowed time in Texas,\" Texas House Democratic caucus chair Chris Turner and other leaders said in a statement Monday.\u00a0 Texas state Representative Julie Johnson tweeted a photo of lawmakers leaving, writing that \"when it comes to protecting our right to vote, all cards are on the table.\" Abbott slammed the decision to leave in a statement Monday and said Democrats need to \"put aside partisan political games that they were elected to do.\" \"Texas Democrats' decision to break a quorum of the Texas Legislature and abandon the Texas State Capitol inflicts harm on the very Texans who elected them to serve,\" Abbott said, noting that the legislature also won't be able to work on property taxes and foster care funding as well. \"Their constituents must not be denied these important resources simply because their elected representative refused to show up to work.\" GOP House Speaker Dade Phelan issued a statement Monday that condemned the Democrats, and he said the Texas House will \"use every available resource under the Texas Constitution and the unanimously-passed House Rules to secure a quorum.\"\u00a0 \"The special session clock is ticking \u2014 I expect all Members to be present at our Capitol in order to immediately get to work on these issues,\" Phelan said.\u00a0 According to the House Rules, \"when a call of the house is moved for one of the above purposes and seconded by 15 members (of whom the speaker may be one) and ordered by a majority vote, the main entrance to the hall and all other doors leading out of the hall shall be locked and no member permitted to leave the house without the written permission of the speaker. The names of members present shall be recorded. All absentees for whom no sufficient excuse is made may, by order of a majority of those present, be sent for and arrested, wherever they may be found, by the sergeant-at-arms or an officer appointed by the sergeant-at-arms for that purpose, and their attendance shall be secured and retained.\" The decision to leave the state echoes a move by Democratic lawmakers in 2003 who fled to Oklahoma during a fight over redistricting. Leaving the state prevents law enforcement officials from rounding up lawmakers and forcing them to go back to work.\u00a0 Republicans lawmakers in the House and Senate introduced the major election bills last week that were largely similar to the bill Democrats blocked in May. Committees in both chambers heard hours of testimony before ultimately advancing the bills. They were slated to receive floor votes as early as this week.\u00a0 And even if Democrats remain out of the state for the rest of the 30-day special session, Abbott is able to call additional special sessions to tackle his legislative priorities.\u00a0 The Texas Democratic Party applauded the lawmakers' plans to leave Texas.\u00a0 \"Our lawmakers have refused to be complicit in Republicans' destructive attacks \u2014 and they're doing what Texans need them to do: hold the line so that not one more anti-voter law can be passed in Texas,\" Texas Democratic Party chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement.\u00a0 Texas state Representative Julie Johnson tweeted a photo of lawmakers leaving on a plane, writing \"when it comes to protecting our right to vote, all cards are on the table. We broke #quorum again today because the Gov & #txlege Repubs chose to bully Texans out of our constitutional rights instead of finding solutions to problems that really exist. #SuppressionSession #DemsOut\"\u00a0 She deleted a tweet with the same text that showed the lawmakers on the bus, which had been called out by Republicans for showing a case of beer. Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, who also serves as president of the Texas Senate, said he expects Senate Democrats to be present on Tuesday. President Biden is scheduled to give a major address on voting rights in Philadelphia on Tuesday. During her press briefing Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said she was going to check if anyone from the White House would meet with the lawmakers. Texas Democratic state lawmakers also went to Washington, D.C., in June to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris and members of Congress.\u00a0 During a voting rights listening session in Detroit, Harris said the Texas Democratic lawmakers are showing \"extraordinary courage and commitment.\" Harris added that she applauds their \"standing for the rights of all Americans.\" \"I applaud their standing for the rights of all Americans and all Texans to express their voice through their vote unencumbered,\" Harris said. \"They are leaders who are marching in the path that so many others before did. When they fought and many died for our right to vote.\" Ed O'Keefe and Tim Perry contributed to this report. CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "A crowded congressional special election in Texas' 6th District could give Republicans a first look at Donald Trump's staying power in the party ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. The race also gives Democrats a chance to compete after falling short of their 2020 goals in the state.\u00a0 Twenty-three candidates, including 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats, have jumped into the race to succeed Republican Ron Wright, who died in February from COVID-19 and lung cancer. He had just won reelection in November by almost\u00a0 9 points.\u00a0 All the candidates will appear on the same ballot on May 1 and the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, will move on to a summer runoff if no candidate cracks 50%.\u00a0 Republicans have garnered most of the out-of-state attention in this race. Dan Rodimer, a former WWE wrestler, rode a bull in his campaign launch and showed off a southern accent\u00a0 - that was lacking in ads from his 2020 House run in Nevada's 3rd District. In a hit on CNN, Rodimer chalked up any perceived difference to losing his voice.\u00a0 Sery Kim, a Trump administration official in the Small Business Administration, said at a forum earlier this month that she didn't want Chinese immigrants in the country.\u00a0 The comment cost Kim, who is Korean-American, her endorsements from Korean-American Republican Congresswomen Young Kim and Michelle Steel. Sery claimed she was referring to the Chinese Communist Party. Marine Michael Wood\u00a0calls himself an anti-Trump Republican. He's picked up financial backing from Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger (whom Wood says he talks with \"every day\"), Ohio Congressman Anthony Gonzalez and Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney. All three Republicans voted to impeach Mr. Trump in January.\u00a0 But local Republicans point to three others as the front runners: newly-elected State Representative Jake Ellzey; Brian Harrison, former Trump administration Health and Human Services chief of staff; and Wright's widow, Susan Wright, a longtime local party activist. Ellzey, who narrowly lost in the 2018 GOP primary for the seat, has been endorsed by former Texas Governor Rick Perry and has raised almost $500,000 in direct contributions, more than any GOP candidate since January.\u00a0 The conservative Club for Growth Action PAC has spent close to $160,000 opposing Ellzey. Susan Wright has made her experience during her husband's tenure part of her pitch, citing her familiarity with district outreach and how Congress works. She's been endorsed by the state party, local party officials and five Texas U.S. House members. Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs and New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and her E-PAC organization are also backing her. \"Their support in my mind is a reaffirmation that I'm ready to do this job,\" she said, adding that she's also talked to Louisiana Congresswoman Julia Letlow, who also recently lost her own husband, the late Congressman Luke Letlow, to COVID-19 and won the special election to take his seat \"Running for this seat is both challenging and rewarding, but I don't question my decision to do it,\" she said.\u00a0 Part of Harrison's pitch is his own time in Washington, particularly his work at HHS during the Trump administration. The occupation listed on his filing is \"HUSBAND, FATHER, SWAMP DRAINER.\" His campaign website shows a picture of him and Mr. Trump in the Oval Office and says he was \"recruited by the Trump Administration.\" Mr. Trump has not endorsed anyone in this race, though Harrison's campaign points to endorsements or donations from more than 100 \"senior Trump officials.\" The district has been trending further away from national Republicans during Trump's tenure. Mitt Romney won the seat by 17% during his 2012 run, while Mr. Trump won by 3% in 2020.\u00a0 Ellis and Navarro counties are GOP strongholds, but the district's portion of Tarrant County has grown demographically and is where you'll find the most \"purple,\" according to Tarrant County Republican Party Finance Chair Mona Bailey. \"I think we're a 50-50 mixed bag right now concerning Trump,\" said Bailey. \"Most of us think he had the right message. Some people think maybe he wasn't the right messenger. But in Tarrant County, you're not going to find that said out loud a lot.\" \"I do think that a lot of people are trying to figure out what 2022 is going to mean to us and ultimately 2024. And I'm not sure Trump is an automatic part of that conversation for everybody anymore,\" added Tarrant County GOP Chair Rick Barnes. Both Barnes and Bailey have backed Wright. \u00a0 Harrison has no reservations about courting Mr. Trump's base and doesn't expect it to alienate other GOP voters.\u00a0 \"Voters in Texas are tired of establishment Republicans talking a good talk in Texas but not fighting the fight and delivering victories in Washington,\" Harrison said.  Democratic candidates are tying GOP candidates to Mr. Trump and Republican state leadership after a winter storm roiled the state's power grid in February. \"Families who have power are bringing in strangers during a pandemic. But our Senator leaves for a beach vacation,\" said non-profit worker and educator Shawn Lassiter in her campaign launch. Republicans are betting on antipathy toward President Biden in their campaign pitches. Mailers from Susan Wright's campaign show President Biden with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and claim she'll \"End the Biden Border Crisis.\" One from Ellzey says he'll stop \"the Biden Tax Increase, the Biden Border Crisis, the Biden War on Jobs,\" and \"Biden's Attacks on the 2nd Amendment.\" Harrison has filed a federal lawsuit against the Biden administration over its actions around Title 42, which was invoked by Mr. Trump and allowed the suspension of U.S. asylum laws due to the pandemic.\u00a0 \"We cannot solve the crisis at the border with brute force. We need to get to the core of the problem,\" Democratic candidate Jana Lynne Sanchez responded when asked about the border.\u00a0 Democrat Lydia Bean, who was a state house candidate in 2020, says the stimulus checks and the American Rescue Plan have been popular with voters. \"People are mad that none of our Texas Republicans voted for the American Rescue Plan, which is just shameful,\" she said. \"People feel enthusiastic about the Biden administration so far.\"\u00a0 Democrats are running a different race compared to 2020, this time, they're knocking on doors in person instead of virtually. The remote campaign, according to a state party assessment that said it caused them to fall behind Republicans, who talked to voters in person. \"That's probably the biggest mistake that Democrats made, was not doing the door-to-door canvassing in 2020. When I'm able to talk to voters directly about my plan to create a healthier, more equitable, more prosperous Texas, they respond to that,\" Sanchez said. Polls show Sanchez as the most likely Democrat candidate to reach a runoff, and prevent a Republican vs. Republican match-up, although Lassiter has raised more than any Democrat, with $322,254 in contributions according to her latest FEC report. Bean also has a slight advantage over Sanchez in cash on hand going into the remaining weeks before the election. While the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee doesn't play in primaries, Sanchez has been backed by BOLD PAC, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The Collective PAC, which backs Black candidates, has given $5,000 to Lassiter.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "Russia has built up roughly 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine, prompting fears of an attack in early 2022. U.S. intelligence is warning that Russia could invade Ukraine as early as January, a U.S. official confirmed to CBS News last week.\u00a0 It's not yet clear if Russia actually plans to invade \u2014 but the buildup of forces has sparked international concern. At a virtual summit on Tuesday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Biden reiterated the U.S.' commitment to Ukrainian independence and threatened severe economic sanctions if Russia invades.\u00a0 Here's what you need to know about the conflict.\u00a0 There are an estimated 100,000 Russian forces massing near the Ukrainian border. Those forces currently lack the support units needed to sustain an invasion, but a U.S. official told CBS News that Russia has embarked on a sudden and rapid program to establish a ready reserve of the support it would need. U.S. officials have also accused Moscow of mounting an aggressive information operation to destabilize Ukraine politically, undermine its social cohesion and pin blame for any escalation on Kyiv and NATO.\u00a0 National security adviser Jake Sullivan said Tuesday the administration does not believe Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a decision on whether to invade Ukraine, but said Mr. Biden has made clear the repercussions if he does.\u00a0 The international community is concerned because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014. In the freezing months of February and March, Russia annexed Crimea, a part of Ukraine that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union. The annexation is not recognized by the international community.\u00a0 Since the 2014 annexation, there has been a proxy war in the Donbas region of Ukraine between Russian-backed forces and the Ukrainian government. A peace deal in 2015 largely ended the major battles, but the fighting continues. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the Ukrainian government. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks often of the ethnic ties between Russia and Ukraine and warns against NATO expanding eastward into what he considers his sphere of influence. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union before declaring its independence in 1991.\u00a0 Putin also argues that assistance from the West to Ukraine poses threats to Russia's border. But the Kremlin says Russia has no intentions of invading Ukraine and that its troop movements are defensive in nature. \u00a0\u00a0 The Ukrainian people have expressed growing support for Western institutions, including membership in NATO. While pro-Russian sentiment does exist in some eastern parts of the country, Ukrainians ousted a pro-Russia president in 2014 and have consistently elected pro-Western politicians since.\u00a0 Russian forces started building up near the Ukrainian border this spring, prompting the U.S. government to call on Russia to explain the presence of the troops. Mr. Biden called Putin to express his concern. The Russians started withdrawing at the end of April, and said the movements had been part of a large-scale military exercise. Mr. Biden and Putin then had a summit in Geneva in June where Mr. Biden said he confirmed the U.S.'s commitment to Ukraine's independence. \u00a0 The latest build-up, which started in October, has prompted more calls from U.S. officials for Russia to explain its intentions. This week, Mr. Biden and Putin held a two-hour virtual meeting largely devoted to discussing Ukraine. According to a White House readout, Mr. Biden reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and called for de-escalation.\u00a0 Mr. Biden on Wednesday said sending U.S. troops to act unilaterally is not on the table. However, the president has said the U.S. and European allies would increase military support to Ukraine and impose severe economic sanctions, including cutting Russia off from the international finance system and suspending the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, if Russia invades.\u00a0 The U.S. has been training and advising Ukrainian forces since 2015, and has also provided over $2.5 billion in security assistance since 2014. The support includes items like air surveillance radars, armed patrol boats, and Javelin anti-tank systems, according to the Department of Defense.\u00a0 U.S. officials say Russia could launch an incursion at any time, but its forces do not yet have the logistical units in place to sustain an operation for more than a couple weeks.\u00a0 The U.S. assessment is that Russia would wait for the ground to freeze before sending tanks and other tracked vehicles into Ukraine.\u00a0 CIA Director William Burns said Monday that Putin may also be waiting for a moment when other European countries are \"distracted\" with their own affairs, citing the new incoming government in Germany and France's presidential elections next year.\u00a0 But for now, it is not clear if Putin wants to actually mount an invasion or is using the threat of an invasion to win concessions from the West.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the Pentagon.",

            "article_content": "Goya Foods is facing renewed calls to boycott the company's products after CEO Robert Unanue falsely claimed Donald Trump to be \"the real, the legitimate, and the still actual president of the United States.\" Unanue made his remarks on Sunday in addressing the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida. He told the partisan crowd that \"we still have faith that the majority of people in the United States voted for the president,\" a reference to Mr. Trump, who lost the November election to President Joe Biden in the Electoral College as well as by more than 7 million votes. The executive made his unfounded assertion after Goya's board in January reportedly voted to censure him, telling him he could no longer talk to the press without its approval, according to a New York Post\u00a0report.\u00a0CNN also cited sources it said were familiar with the private company's action, which came after Unanue told Fox Business that President Biden's election was \"unverified.\" \u00a0 Unanue later told the Post that he'd independently come to a decision to no longer publicly speak about politics.\u00a0 Goya did not respond to a request for comment on Unanue's latest comments, which had some critics of his support for Trump once again vowing not to purchase the company's products on social media. The CEO of Goya foods says he believes that Trump is still the rightful president. Dayam. We use a lot of Goya. Need to switch away from the products. #BoycottGoya Unanue's words also prompted condemnation by the nonprofit Hispanic Federation, which called on \"the corporate governance structures at Goya Foods [to] act\" against its CEO. In a Monday statement signed by more than a dozen Latino advocacy groups, the federation called Unanue's assertions \"an affront to the millions of Latino voters in this nation who, despite significant voter suppression efforts, mustered the courage and\u00a0 conviction to cast their ballots.\" Goya bills itself as the country's largest Hispanic-owned food company. It first faced a backlash last summer when Unanue praised Mr. Trump in a speech at the White House Rose Garden. Not long after, #BoycottGoya, #GoyaFoods and #Goyaway began trending on social media, a scenario now on replay. The #Goya board might want to \"can\" its CEO. (Get it?) And this isn't just pillow talk. Those calling for a boycott of Goya products during the summer posted a litany of derogatory comments made by Mr. Trump as well as his policies, including his administration's separations of detained immigrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border. \"We learned to bake bread in this pandemic, we can learn to make our own adobo con pimienta. Bye.\"\u00a0tweeted\u00a0actor Lin-Manuel Miranda. Former U.S. housing secretary and Democratic presidential candidate Julian Castro\u00a0bashed\u00a0Unanue on Twitter for extolling a former president who he said has vilified Goya's Hispanic customer base, while Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said she'll learn to make some of the Latin American staples Goya sells. Unanue's grandparents started Goya Foods in 1936 after emigrating to the U.S. from Spain. The family-owned firm manufactures about 2,500 products, from seasonings and cooking oils to beans and other Latin American staples as well as frozen products and snacks. Goya offerings are ubiquitous in grocery stores across the U.S., sometimes taking up their own entire aisle. Unanue claimed during a radio interview in December that calls by Ocasio-Cortez and others to boycott his food products actually attracted new customers to buy Goya as well as maintained old ones, especially among conservative-leaning Hispanics.\u00a0 \"You're not going to change a consumer because one idiot like myself says something politically or whatever,\" he said at the time.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Georgia's runoff election \"changes everything\" during a Wednesday briefing, saying shifts in the Senate will return money to New York and help the state fight the spread of the coronavirus. Democrat Raphael Warnock defeated incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler, a Republican, on Tuesday in a runoff race while Democratic challenger Jon Ossoff held a narrow lead over incumbent Senator David Perdue, a Republican, on Wednesday, as votes were still being counted in that race. An Ossoff win would give the Senate a 50-50 split along party lines, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie-breaker vote. It would also make Senator Chuck Schumer, a New Yorker, Senate majority leader. Cuomo accused Republicans in Washington of sending New York taxpayers' dollars to Republican states \"as a pure political exercise,\" blaming the state's $15 billion budget shortfall on \"federal negligence\" of the coronavirus.\u00a0 \"They have literally taken billions of dollars from us, and that was a function of the Senate and the president and they are both gone. And today, Washington theft ends and compensation for the victims of the crimes of the past four years begins. And New Yorkers have been crime victims as far as I'm concerned by the theft of the federal government,\" he said. Cuomo also asked the federal government to take action on screening incoming passengers in New York airports, saying the state did not have authority to require incoming travelers to be tested for COVID-19 but he has asked federal officials to have Customs and Border Protection do so. \"We don't want tens of thousands of people coming through our airports every day from countries around the world who were not tested \u2014 it's just that simple, and it makes total common sense,\" he said. The state saw its first confirmed diagnosis of the new, apparently more contagious virus variant\u00a0this week, detected in Saratoga Springs. Though the person had previously reported to not have any travel history, Cuomo said Wednesday that case was possibly connected to travel to the United Kingdom, where the variant was first identified. Total coronavirus hospitalizations in the state Wednesday stood at 8,655 and there were 161 new deaths due to the virus.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 With the chaotic evacuation of thousands of Americans and at-risk Afghans from Kabul dominating the headlines after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, Republicans see a political opening to use the fallout from President Biden's withdrawal to question his capabilities, in hopes of wresting control of Congress from Democrats.\u00a0 While foreign policy was not a top issue for voters in the last two elections, \"the challenge for the Biden administration is it sets a narrative of competence, or lack thereof, and Americans don't like losing. Nobody likes losing, but especially in a way where you're humiliated,\" Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster who has worked on various congressional campaigns, told CBS News. The president has taken a hit from the chaos in Kabul. A CBS News poll released Sunday found 44% of Americans believe the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan has gone \"very badly\" \u2014 though 63% of Americans approve of the drawdown. Forty-seven percent, meanwhile, approve of Mr. Biden's handling of the withdrawal, down from 60% in July. The poll showed Mr. Biden's overall job rating has fallen, too, with 50% of Americans saying they approve of his performance, an eight-point drop since July.\u00a0 The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), which helps Republicans win seats in the House, seized on the decline in Mr. Biden's ratings on his handling of the withdrawal and posted a\u00a0video on social media\u00a0featured footage of scores of Afghans rushing to get to the airport in Kabul after the\u00a0collapse of the Afghan government. The clip knocked Biden for waiting several days to address the American people while the chaos unfolded, claiming his \"incompetence & failure has made America less safe.\" The NRCC also capitalized on the president's falling job approval ratings to slam Democrats more broadly. Spokesman Mike Berg said in a statement Tuesday that voters are \"rejecting Democrats' agenda of higher prices, higher crime, weak leadership and open borders.\"\u00a0 The NRCC has already\u00a0announced Wednesday\u00a0three sets of ads focusing on inflation, with the most recent targeting 15 incumbent Democrats\u00a0 Voters, he said, \"want candidates' or politicians' rhetoric to match their records.\" Other GOP organizations were also quick to use the footage from Afghanistan to ding Mr. Biden. Citizens United and America First Policy Institute, run by former members of the Trump administration, ran ads on Facebook juxtaposing the president's remarks about the withdrawal with video showing chaos in Kabul, as first\u00a0reported by Axios. The ads featured an\u00a0assertion\u00a0from Mr. Biden made on July 8 that it was \"highly unlikely\" the Taliban would take over Afghanistan. Several\u00a0Republican\u00a0congressional candidates\u00a0are also highlighting the crisis in Afghanistan in sponsored posts on social media. \"This snowballs into other themes on the notion that in 2020, then-candidate Biden made the centerpiece of his campaign a return to normalcy. He projected himself as somebody who was going to be a leader on issues,\" Matt Terrill, a Republican strategist and partner at Firehouse Strategies, told CBS News. \"This is a huge blunder that members on both sides are calling him out on. It snowballs into other issues like leadership, the ability to manage and lead.\" Terrill said Mr. Biden's handling of the drawdown could impact Senate races in Georgia and Arizona, where there are high populations of veterans or active-duty military and Democrats are attempting to hold on to their seats. \"The elections are going to be referendums on the incumbents, in particular this midterm,\" Terrill said. \"It's about trust, it's about confidence. It's about Americans' confidence in their leaders.\" The midterm elections are 15 months away, and the outcome will determine whether Democrats maintain control of Congress. In the Senate, which is evenly divided, Vice President Kamala Harris casts tie-breaking votes, giving Democrats a razor-thin edge. But in the House, Democrats also hold a tiny majority of just eight seats. Focusing on the president's handling of Afghanistan holds some peril for Republicans, though: their longtime support for the 20-year war there and attempts to use the chaos in Kabul to their advantage could force them to defend the years the U.S. spent there. \"This is a bipartisan albatross around the neck,\" Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, told CBS News. \"It's very difficult for people to say they're innocent of anything, and the blame game in this case is probably accurate, because whoever you point to is going to have some degree of blame. It's a tough issue to use.\" And Sabato also pointed out that Mr. Biden has a substantial counterargument \u2014 that he can \"reasonably say\" he's the first president in two decades to follow through with a pledge to end the war in Afghanistan. Sabato noted the president makes a valid point that leaving was always going to be difficult, as Mr. Biden\u00a0said Sunday. \"It was always going to be messy,\" Sabato said of the evacuations of Americans and Afghan allies from Kabul. \"They clearly could've done a better job in planning, I don't think they deny that, but is that enough for people to determine their vote in a midterm election when other big issues are on the table? I don't think so.\" The drawdown in Afghanistan, he continued, \"will not be a footnote, but a relatively short chapter of the campaign.\" Instead, Sabato predicted many Americans will be interested in the state of the coronavirus pandemic and the economy, come November 2022. While Bolger agreed the situation in Afghanistan won't be the focus of next year's contests, it will be \"one piece of a mosaic\" about Mr. Biden's handling of crises and a \"messaging arc\" that the White House has to get under control. \"He's fumbling the ball on Afghanistan, COVID, the border, inflation,\" he said. \"So the whole picture that's being painted just seven months into his presidency is not a good looking picture, and once it goes off the tracks, it's hard to get it back on the track.\"",

            "article_content": "In just one week in late December, three House Democrats announced they wouldn't seek reelection in 2022: New Jersey's Albio Sires, Florida's Stephanie Murphy and California's Lucille Roybal-Allard. In early January, Congressman Bobby Rush was the first House Democrat to say this would be his final term in office, followed by Representative Brenda Lawrence later that same day. That makes 25 House Democrats who have announced they're retiring or running for another office next year, as the party braces for the possible loss of its already slim majority in the House in next year's midterm elections.\u00a0 By comparison, just 11 House Republicans have said they're not coming back after their 2020 term ends. Two members, Steve Stivers of Ohio and Devin Nunes of California, resigned before the end of their term to take new jobs elsewhere.\u00a0 It bears noting that just because a majority party has the greater number of vacant seats going into an election, it's not always the case that it will have a bad year. For instance, there were 17 seats left open by House Democrats in 2010, compared to 20 on the Republican side, but the Republican Tea Party wave, an anti-tax, small-government movement, flipped the chamber and added 63 new GOP seats.\u00a0 Republicans also had more open seats going into the 2020 elections, with 35, compared to 12 seats for Democrats. But the GOP still ended up flipping 15 seats, leaving Democrats with a single-digit majority. But in 1994, there were 31 Democratic seats and 21 Republican seats open; that year, Republicans won the House for the first time since 1952, running on the Reagan-inspired Contract with America, a list of legislation they vowed to pass if they had the majority.\u00a0 In 2018, Democrats won the chamber from Republicans, who had more than 40 open seats going into the election, compared to 22 for Democrats. \"If you're a [retiring] Democrat, one of the elements you're thinking about, is that it may be a bad year,\" said former Tennessee House Democrat Bart Gordon, who retired in 2010. \"But you don't go through hard elections and all the fundraising and the time away from your family and just throw up your hands and say, 'It's going to be a bad election.' It's a combination of a variety of things.\" Democrats are counting other factors going into 2022. They point to redistricting and a new peak in political polarization in Congress, which culminated in the attacks on the Capitol on January 6, as other reasons for the high rate of retirements, which is expected to grow further as more states finish their redistricting process. California's Grace Napolitano, Georgia's Sanford Bishop, Tennessee's Steve Cohen and New Jersey's Tom Malinowski are all being monitored for potential retirement.\u00a0 Age and time spent in Congress may also be a consideration. Eleven of the 23 retiring members are over the age of 70 years old, and eleven of them have served in Congress at least 15 years.\u00a0 \"If you're going to retire now, or you're going to get out of the game, I think you're going out on top. I think you're providing yourself more opportunity to realize that at some point it's just probably better to go out,\" said Los Angeles County Democratic Party Chair Mark Gonzalez.\u00a0 Stephanie Murphy, a House Democrat who announced her retirement this week, is only 43 years old and has spent five years in Congress. While she won her 2020 reelection by more than 12 points and said she didn't fear losing her reelection, she was targeted immediately by House Republican groups this cycle\u2013 in part because Republicans control the redrawing of her Orlando suburban district. Six of the 23 members retiring were drawn into districts that either incorporated more Republican voters, worsening their political fortunes, or were pitted against another Democratic incumbent in the same district because their state lost a Congressional seat in the reapportionment dictated by the 2020 Census. \"It's a surprise for us and disappointing because she's been a great advocate for us here in Florida, as well as all of her work on the January 6 committee,\" Wes Hodge, the Orlando Democratic Party chair, said of Murphy's retirement. \"Republicans will get what they want, there's no question. So the question is how ugly do they draw this map? While some retiring Democrats like Cheri Bustos of Illinois or Peter DeFazio of Oregon in fact saw their districts grow more Democratic during redistricting, most of the retiring lawmakers in states that had finished drawing their lines felt they were put in awkward or politically tougher situations.\u00a0 In North Carolina, G.K. Butterfield saw his Democratic leaning seat become a toss-up district. Roybal-Allard and Lowenthal both announced their retirements right before a final Congressional map revealed that parts of their two Los Angeles-area seats would be combined, setting\u00a0 up a matchup between two Democratic incumbents.\u00a0 Ron Kind's Wisconsin seat was unlikely to change much in this round of redistricting. It's a seat he won by 2 points in 2020. Former President Trump won Kind's district by 4.7 points in 2020 and, like Murphy, he was high on the target list for House Republicans. But Kind, who announced his retirement in July, has found his way to win in his rural, western Wisconsin district since he was first elected 26 years ago. While he was confident he could win reelection, he said he was \"running out of gas\" and was sick of \"the toxic political environment.\" \"Congress is a reflection of where the American people are. And unfortunately, the American people are very polarized and very divided right now,\" he said.\u00a0 The 2020 House elections resulted in a record low of 16 split-ticket districts, that is, where a\u00a0 House member's party affiliation differed from that of the presidential candidate who won the district. A CBS News poll before Virginia's election for governor in November found voters' choices were highly motivated by their opposition to the other political party.\u00a0 Kind declined to predict how House Democrats will do next November, citing the unknown on COVID-19 and the economy. He acknowledged the frustrations with Biden and Capitol Hill Democrats, but said the first years of an administration \"are always a challenge.\" \"There seems to be a trend here of Republican administrations just making a god awful mess, and then a Democratic president getting elected and then everyone expecting them to have it all solved in six months,\" Kind said. \"And it just doesn't work that way.\" While Republicans are using moderate Democrats 'votes for Biden's \"Build Back Better\" plan against them, blaming them for overspending and causing rising inflation, Democrats say their work on the Biden agenda can help them buck the political headwinds going into 2022.\u00a0 However, that could also backfire, since the president's social spending plan now appears to be stalled or possibly dead. \"The hardest part for us is how do you sell a Democrat voter on [BBB] if Democrats are not even the ones voting for a Democratic agenda?\" Gonzalez said, referencing Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and his hamstringing of Biden's plan. Democrats face a real challenge on how to campaign on the national agenda, said Hodge. \"It's interesting because we're talking about things like helping poor families to work, to better people's lives here in America, to work on reforming health care. How are these bad things?\" Hodge said.\u00a0 But Republicans are betting it's not likely that social spending plans will resonate with voters if in 2022 inflation is still high and COVID-19 surges remain. \"Democrats are living on another planet if they think any piece of legislation is going to make voters forget the skyrocketing inflation, rampant crime and border crisis their policies created,\" said National Republican Congressional Committee Communications Director Michael McAdams. \"[They] dug themselves a hole they can't escape so the smart ones are calling it quits while they still can.\" Kind said Democrats running in 2022 have to get away from the disarray on the national stage and keep their campaigns local.\u00a0 \"Congress has been operating under a top-down management for too long,\" said Kind, who voted against Nancy Pelosi for Speaker in 2019, but for her in 2021. \"My advice to any members operating in a competitive district is they're best served if you can personalize and localize the election and stay away from the national currents.\" Gordon, a board member for the U.S. Association for the Former Members of Congress, said Democrats in Congress have done a terrible job at explaining to Americans what the infrastructure and social spending bills will do.\u00a0 \"There's been too much discussion about process. Who cares about what reconciliation is? We're talking about reconciliation, filibusters, and we're not talking about how people's lives are going to be improved,\" he said. Gordon, who retired before the 2010 GOP wave, suggested that while Democrats can run on Biden's agenda, this may be one of those election cycles when the messaging will fall on deaf ears. \"There comes those periods where folks have their mind made up, just tune out and want a change,\" he said.\u00a0 In keeping with a recent annual tradition, Gordon has invited all the retiring members to his House in January 2022 to get together to talk about transition out of office.\u00a0 He's expecting a packed house.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "Gaza City\u00a0\u2014 Rockets streamed out of Gaza and Israel pounded the territory with airstrikes early Wednesday as the most severe outbreak of violence since the 2014 war took on many hallmarks of that devastating 50-day conflict. As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reported on Wednesday, what began weeks ago as protests in Jerusalem over restrictions at a major Muslim holy site and the planned eviction of Palestinian families has morphed into a new war.\u00a0 And on Wednesday, there was no end in sight. Israel's Defense Minister said the attacks on armed groups in Gaza were to be stepped up, to bring what he promised to be \"total, long term quiet.\"\u00a0 Gaza's Hamas rulers and other militant groups have fired barrages of hundreds of rockets that at times have overwhelmed Israel's missile defenses, causing air raid sirens and explosions to echo across Tel Aviv, Israel's biggest metropolitan area, and other cities. Israeli airstrikes have leveled multistory buildings across the Gaza Strip, where 2 million Palestinians have lived under a crippling Israeli-Egyptian blockade since Hamas took power in 2007. Warning shots have allowed civilians to evacuate the buildings, but the material losses will be immense. Israel faced heavy criticism over the tactic during the 2014 war. U.N. Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland tweeted, \"Stop the fire immediately. We're escalating towards a full scale war. Leaders on all sides have to take the responsibility of de-escalation. The cost of war in Gaza is devastating & is being paid by ordinary people. UN is working w/ all sides to restore calm. Stop the violence now.\"  Just after daybreak Wednesday, Israel unleashed dozens of airstrikes in the course of a few minutes, targeting police and security installations, witnesses said. A wall of dark gray smoke rose over Gaza City.\u00a0 The Health Ministry\u00a0in Gaza said at least 48 people had been killed in the strikes over the last two days, including 14 children and three women, and more than 300 others wounded.\u00a0 The Israeli military insists it only targets terrorists \u2014 Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders and their installations, but as Palmer reports, the material damage is immense, and for the human beings in the over-crowded enclave, there's no safe place. Samah Haboub, a mother of four in Gaza, said she was thrown across her bedroom in a \"moment of horror\" by an airstrike on an apartment tower next door. She and her children, aged three to 14, ran down the stairway of their apartment block along with other residents, many of them screaming and crying. \"There is almost no safe place in Gaza,\" she said. Six Israelis, including three women and a child, were killed by rocket fire Tuesday and early Wednesday, and dozens of people were wounded. \u00a0The Israeli military said Palestinian militants had fired more 1,050 rockets since the conflict began, with 200 of them falling short and landing inside Gaza. IDF combat soldier Staff Sgt. Omer Tabib of the Nahal Brigade, was killed this morning by an Anti-Tank missile fired by Hamas from Gaza into Israel. He was 21 years old.May his memory be a blessing. pic.twitter.com/M3b3KXw4sP One of the Israelis killed was a soldier hit on Wednesday by an anti-tank missile fired on his vehicle near the Gaza border. Palmer reported on Wednesday that it's not just an air war. There's been violence on the ground, too. Overnight in Ramallah, in the West Bank, police fired tear gas to chase away hundreds of young men who, like most Palestinians, have had enough of the Israeli occupation. The latest eruption of violence began a month ago in Jerusalem, where heavy-handed police tactics during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers ignited protests and clashes with police. A focal point was the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, a holy site sacred to Jews and Muslims.  Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since the Islamic militant group seized power in Gaza from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. The conflicts ended after regional and international powers convinced both sides to accept an informal truce.  While the violence has been widely condemned, there is no sign that either side is willing to back down. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to expand the offensive, saying \"this will take time,\" and the unrest in Jerusalem has spread to the occupied West Bank and within Israel itself as Hamas has called for a full-scale Palestinian intifada, or uprising. In the Israeli city of Lod, a 52-year-old man and his 16-year-old daughter were killed early Wednesday when a rocket had landed in the courtyard of their one-story home. Their car parked outside was wrecked and the interior of the house was filled by debris.  Lod also saw heavy clashes after thousands of mourners joined a funeral for an Arab man killed by a suspected Jewish gunman the previous night. The crowd fought with police, and set a synagogue and some 30 vehicles, including a police car, on fire, Israeli media reported. Paramedics said a 56-year-old man was seriously hurt after his car was pelted with stones.  \"An intifada erupted in Lod, you have to bring in the army,\" the city's mayor, Yair Revivo, said. Authorities have declared a state of emergency and ordered a deployment of paramilitary border guards from the West Bank as reinforcements.  In neighboring Ramle, ultra-nationalist Jewish demonstrators were filmed attacking cars belonging to Arabs. In the northern port town of Acre, protesters torched a Jewish-owned restaurant and hotel. Police arrested dozens of others at Arab protests in other towns. Israel is in political limbo following four inconclusive elections in less than two years.   Opponents of Netanyahu have been trying to forge a government to oust him, but they are deeply divided among themselves and will likely need the support of an Arab-backed party with Islamist roots. The current tensions might deter the party's leader, Mansour Abbas, from joining a coalition with Jewish parties, at least for the time being.  The sides have three more weeks to reach a deal. If they fail, Israel would likely begin an unprecedented fifth election campaign in just over two years.  Netanyahu appeared with one of his rivals, Defense Minister Benny Gantz, on Tuesday in a show of unity. Gantz said Israel's strikes were \"only the beginning\" and the military said it was activating some 5,000 reservists and sending troop reinforcements to the Gaza border.  Confrontations erupted last weekend at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, which is the third-holiest site in Islam and the holiest site in Judaism. Over four days, Israeli police fired tear gas and stun grenades at Palestinians in the compound who hurled stones and chairs at the forces. At times, police fired stun grenades into the carpeted mosque.  On Monday evening, Hamas began firing rockets from Gaza. From there on, the escalation was rapid.  In a televised address, Hamas' exiled leader, Ismail Haniyeh, said Israel bore responsibility. \"It's the Israeli occupation that set Jerusalem on fire, and the flames reached Gaza,\" he said. Diplomats sought to intervene, with Qatar, Egypt and the United Nations working to deliver a cease-fire. All three serve as mediators between Israel and Hamas.  The U.N. Security Council planned to hold its second closed emergency meeting in three days Wednesday on the escalating violence, an indication of growing international concern. Council diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions have been private, said the U.N.'s most powerful body did not issue a statement because of U.S. concerns that it could escalate tensions. The U.S. has called on both sides to rein in the violence, condemned the Palestinian rocket attacks in particular. CBS News Radio correspondent Robert Berger, who's covered the Middle East for decades, said the Biden administration appears to be treading cautiously as it wants to avoid getting off to a bad start with Israel.\u00a0 Berger noted also that as Israeli cities are being bombarded, it would be difficult for the U.S. not to back Israel's right to self-defense. That's what Israel would like to hear, unequivocally, from President Biden, but Israel realizes it will come under increasing pressure from the U.S. to show restraint, so it may be trying to hit Hamas as hard as it can before diplomatic time runs out. An official familiar with the travel plans confirmed to CBS News' Christina Ruffini on Wednesday that Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Israeli-Palestinian affairs Hady Amr had been expected to travel to Tel Aviv this week and likely still would, depending on flights being permitted to land in the country amid the ongoing rocket fire. Axios first reported on Wednesday that Amr was being despatched to Jerusalem. \u00a0 The Arab League, some of whose members have grown closer to the Jewish state over the last year, said Israel's actions were \"indiscriminate and irresponsible\" and blamed it for \"dangerous escalation\" in Jerusalem. Hamas confirmed on Wednesday that its top commander in Gaza City was killed in a strike. Israel claims it has killed dozens of the group's fighters, including a number of senior commanders. Islamic Jihad confirmed that three senior commanders were killed in a strike on their hideout in a Gaza City apartment building. Netanyahu said Israel had attacked hundreds of targets. The fiercest attack was a set of airstrikes that brought down an entire 12-story building. The building housed important Hamas offices, as well as a gym and some start-up businesses. Israel fired a series of warning shots before demolishing the building, allowing people to flee and there were no casualties. Israeli aircraft heavily damaged another Gaza City building early Wednesday. The nine-story structure housed residential apartments, medical companies and a dental clinic. A drone fired five warning rockets before the bombing. Israel said the building housed Hamas intelligence offices and the group's command responsible for planning attacks on Israeli targets in the occupied West Bank. Fighter jets struck the building again after journalists and rescuers had gathered around. There was no immediate word on casualties. The high-rise stood 650 feet from the Associated Press bureau in Gaza City, and smoke and debris reached the office. Soon after the bombing, Hamas announced that it would resume its attacks, and fired 100 rockets at the Israeli desert town of Beersheba. Hamas said the renewed barrage was in response to the strike on the building.",

Today on Face the Nation, we will check in on the challenges facing America as we prepare to count our blessings this Thanksgiving. President Biden used the time-honored tradition of the turkey pardon to celebrate the House approving his roughly $2 trillion social and environmental spending package and the signing of his $1.2 trillion infrastructure package. This year's winners, named after one of America's favorite lunches, may have escaped the Thanksgiving dinner table, but not the presidential wisecracks.

Instead of getting basted, these two turkeys are getting boosted. (LAUGHTER) (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Up on Capitol Hill, House Democrats celebrated their victory on Build Back Better, or BBB, with progressives and moderates finally coming together for the win. The bill is now off to the Senate, where it faces a much tougher test. Will growing concerns about inflation put pressure on the party to act quickly? New York Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, pushing to keep paid leave in the bill, will be with us. We will also talk to Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz about the mysterious case of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai and the likely U.S. diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics. (Begin VT) WOMAN: Kyle H. Rittenhouse, not guilty. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Then: protests across the country, as 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse is acquitted of all charges in the shootings of three men during the unrest following Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year. We will ask the president of the NAACP, Derrick Johnson, what this case and two other ongoing trials say about race and justice in America. Finally, after months of mixed signals on COVID booster shots, the CDC approves them for all adults. Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb will be with us. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have a lot to get to today. We begin with a brand-new CBS News poll. It doesn't have a lot of good news politically for President Biden. His approval rating is at 44 percent, his lowest in our polling since he took office. And it's the economy that is taking the toll on the president's standing, as prices for food, gas and other items continue to rise; 67 percent of Americans now disapprove of the president's handling of inflation. Joining us now to discuss it is CBS News director of surveys and elections Anthony Salvanto. Anthony, the economy is in recovery, but many Americans apparently don't feel that way. ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret. That's right, because, to many Americans, when they rate the economy, it's what's right in front of them, the prices they're paying in this case at that gas pump or that cash register. Let me tell you a story about views on the economy over the course of this year. Back in the winter, views were low, but then, as people thought the pandemic was easing and optimism was on the upswing as we headed into the summer, views of the economy started to rise. Then, as we headed into the fall, in our polling, well, people started feeling the effects of inflation and views of the economy started to dip again back down to the lower level, where they are today. Now, how does this relate to President Biden? Well, when you look at how people evaluate him in handling a range of issues, on handling the economy specifically, on handling inflation specifically, he's underwater, at 39 percent on the economy, at 33 percent good on handling inflation. And then the kicker here, Margaret, is that when you ask people how they're evaluating Joe Biden, which criteria, they say, top answers, the economy and inflation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, just how significantly is inflation impacting Americans' lives? ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, first of all, people say that they notice the things they usually buy are costing more. They notice that some things are hard to get on store shelves. And then you say, well, what impact does that have on people? And for a majority, they tell us that that's either a difficulty or even a hardship. That's particularly the case for people in middle and low incomes. So, what do they say they're doing about it? Well, a lot of folks say that they're cutting back, cutting back on spending, maybe holding off buying one of those big-ticket items, maybe even curtailing their holiday spending a little bit. And the other thing here, Margaret, is, people know why there is inflation. They tell us they know that there are supply chain issues, that there's pent-up demand after the pandemic. So those are market forces. But, as we often see in polling and opinion, even if it's market forces, people sometimes want some relief from those forces. And that's where they turn to political leaders and say, they want them to do something about it, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You didn't cause it, but I want you to fix it. Anthony, Democrats know they have a problem with these economic headwinds, but the argument is that the trillions of dollars in spending packages will offset that. How do Democrats feel about the strategy? How do they feel about the president himself? ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, let me start here. Democrats, like most Americans, say they're feeling the effects of inflation, things costing more than they did, things often not in stock. Now, Democrats don't say that to the same extent Republicans do, because, frankly, there's always a little bit of partisanship that creeps into some of these responses. But you -- when you look at the way Democrats then rate the president on handling inflation specifically, yes, a majority approve, but he's at 38 percent disapprove, which, for the president's base, is not exactly a great number, in context. And then, when you look at his approval rating among Democrats, well, it's 80 percent. That's good. But in this modern political era, where the base is so important to a politician, well, 20 percent disapproval, that's among the lowest that you will see. So, that's a place where they think they probably want to shore up the base. The infighting maybe in Congress hasn't helped, certainly Democrats feeling the effects of inflation. And those are the numbers, I think, to watch going forward, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony Salvanto, thank you. And joining us now is senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Good morning to you, Senator. Thank you for being here. SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to get to some of the agenda items. The Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, was with us last week, and she said it doesn't look like paid leave is going to make it into the final Build Back Better bill. That's due to Senator Joe Manchin's opposition. How can you change his mind? KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Well, Joe Manchin has come a long way on paid leave. I have been talking to him now for about three weeks on the topic. And in the beginning of our conversations, he didn't know a lot about paid leave. And he's come forward with a lot of really smart questions about, how would you build it? What would it look like? He really wants it to be an earned benefit, something that is self-sustaining. And so do I. And he really wants something that will last for generations. So, I'm optimistic that Senator Manchin and I can continue to talk about ways to put paid leave in this bill, because, long term, he wants it to be something that's bipartisan. But I have looked, and I have talked to all the Republicans who are interested in paid leave, and none of them have an interest in what he wants to do, which is this earned benefit idea. So, I think Senator Manchin and I can come together, hopefully in the next couple of weeks on something that could be included in this package that would be a Democratic-only proposal that we could start with, something -- something modest perhaps that we can start paid leave with, and then work long term with those Republicans on a bigger idea to get to the grand idea of full 12-week paid leave for all life events for all people when they need to meet with family need, whether it's a new baby or an ill loved one or a dying parent. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, modest, you mean four weeks' leave? KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: I would be grateful if we could meet the House proposal. I think that would be a great start to have universal paid leave for all people, all workers. And we know paid leave helps people get back to work. We know, if it's parental leave, parents, mothers are 40 percent more likely to get back to work if they have paid leave, which goes to Senator Manchin's concern that he wants to strengthen our social safety nets, he wants to strengthen Social Security. That's what paid leave does. It gets people back to work. It allows people to stay in the work force even when there's a family emergency. If you don't have paid leave, and there's a family emergency, sometimes, your only recourse is quitting. If you have to quit your job, getting rehired is very difficult. So, if your main concern is strengthening social safety nets like Social Security, paid leave is one of the solutions. And so I'm hopeful that if I can use the next three weeks to really impress upon Senator Manchin that some things can only be done with Democrats only, that now is the only time to do that perhaps in the next decade. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the proposal, as it stands now, it would cost $200 billion over 10 years. Senator Manchin has also said he's worried about Social Security, and it's the same -- when you say earned benefit, how would you actually make this happen? KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: So, I want to work with Senator Manchin on some ideas he has. He likes employer/employee contribution systems. A lot of states around the country already have that through unemployment insurance, through disability insurance. There's ways we might be able to create this program. MARGARET BRENNAN: Like the state of New York. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Correct. And what Senator Manchin is doing right now is, he's approving every aspect of the Build Back Better proposal about how to pay for it. So, he's in the driver's seat on how to pay for these proposals. And so I'm just hopeful that he can remain open-minded to include some provisions for paid leave, because this is the only moment to get paid leave done. The bipartisan ideas he have -- he has, they will not come to fruition with the Republican senators that are interested in paid leave today, because they don't -- they don't -- they aren't interested today in a universal plan that's an earned benefit, because I have spoken to them. MARGARET BRENNAN: For you... (CROSSTALK) KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: So, that's why I think, for Senator Manchin, now is the time. If he has a vision for what he wants to do... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: ... putting in this Dem-only proposal is the only opportunity, in my opinion. MARGARET BRENNAN: And would love to have him come on and answer some of the questions you're raising right now about how to do that. One of the other sticking points is the reduction in taxes for high earners, and that would definitely be of interest to your voters in New York, raising the cap on the so-called SALT deduction, state and local taxes. Is that something that for you needs to stay in this? KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: So, for Senator Schumer and I and the senators from these states that have very high local and state taxes, like New York, New Jersey, California, when President Trump put forward his $1.5 trillion tax cuts, he really did it in a way that disproportionately harmed these large states. MARGARET BRENNAN: He brought the cap down to $10,000. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: He did. (CROSSTALK) KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: And so that hurt a lot of middle-class -- middle-class families in New York, particularly in places like Westchester and Long Island, where a firefighter and a teacher would have been harmed by that deduction being reduced to such a low cap. And so what we're trying to do is restore that cap to... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: ... covering all middle-class wage earners. And the House came up with a compromise to have that cap be at $80,000. We hope to retain that in the Senate. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some of the numbers we showed viewers at the beginning of this program regarding concerns about the economy and the president. The majority of the infrastructure bill doesn't go into effect until 2023- 2024. Build Back Better, as we know, we're talking about it. It's not a done deal. So, what -- what is the message you have for how to fix the economy now and how to tell voters that, if they stick with Democrats, if they stick with unified government, that you can actually deliver on this, because you don't have much time before those midterm races? KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: We are doing everything to lower costs for everyday families, because people's costs are going up. You have these macro forces, because of the pandemic, that are very difficult to address. So, what these bills do is, the infrastructure bill will fix some of the supply chain problems, because... MARGARET BRENNAN: Not immediately. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: But at least invest. It invests in ports. It invests in ways to begin to fix the supply chain problems that we've had. Second, in the Build Back Better bill, it can lower costs for prescription drugs. It's one of the biggest costs that a lot of families have, particularly our seniors. It can lower costs for child care. You know how expensive child care is, affordable day care, universal pre-K. That's going to take zero through 5 and make it more affordable for families. It's -- for many families... MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you really think Democrats have been able to explain this to voters yet? KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Well, we are. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because we're still talking about a bill that we don't know what's in or out of it. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: So, the push and pull of what's in the bill, what's not in the bill, that's going to be resolved in the next few weeks. And once we sign this bill into law, we can go around our states and districts and talk about why affordable day care matters. I know that, if families have to put 20, 30, 40 percent of their income just into child care, what's that's done for families is, sometimes, they don't have a second child or don't have a third child. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Sometimes, they have to quit their job because it's more cost-effective to stay home. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: That means that parent can't be a wage earner. It means less money is going into the economy. It means they can't grow in their careers and earn more money. It stifles economic growth. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: It's very bad. So, affordable day care is one of the basic investments in infrastructure that we need, so more people are working. (CROSSTALK) KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: That's how we lower costs for people in things like housing, child care and in prescription drugs. MARGARET BRENNAN: That takes time. Before I let you go though, I want to make sure I ask you about military sexual assault. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been confident that you could get this passed. Are you confident this stays in this must-pass defense bill? KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: So, we have our military justice reform that takes all serious crimes out of the chain of command and gives a decision about whether to prosecute these crimes to trained military prosecutors who are unbiased and will give justice to survivors of sexual assault and other serious crimes. Right now, that's in the Senate bill. The only way this does not become law is if four men, behind closed doors, take it out in conference. And that would be an outrage, because this bill is supported by 66 senators... MARGARET BRENNAN: You're worried that it will? KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: ... including Josh Hawley, Ted Cruz, who's going to be on your show, Liz Warren and Bernie Sanders. How many bills in America are supported by those four individuals? Not many. And then, on the House side, it's supported by 220 House members. That... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Democracy should not be shunned. This is something that should not be done behind closed doors in the dead of night. It should be allowed to pass, and everyone should make sure that their voices are heard on this issue. If we want justice for service members, justice for sexual assault survivors and justice for every female service member... MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: ... you need this reform. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator, thank you for coming in. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a minute. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who joins us from Houston. Good morning to you, Senator. SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Overnight, you did see Chinese state-run media release images of tennis player Peng Shuai in Beijing. It's the first time she's been seen in two weeks since she mysteriously disappeared after criticizing and claiming that one of the former leaders of China committed sexual assault against her. Do you have any idea what -- what is going on here? TED CRUZ: Well, we don't know for sure, but there are reasons to be deeply, deeply skeptical. Peng Shuai is one of the best tennis players in the world. She's the first Chinese player ever to be ranked number one in the world in doubles for women's or men's. And she posted on social media a serious allegation of sexual assault, sexual assault by the former vice premier of China, by a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee. And, within 30 minutes, the Chinese communist government caused that accusation of sexual assault to miraculously disappear. And since that point, Peng Shuai has not been seen. Now... MARGARET BRENNAN: Should the U.S. be doing more? -- TED CRUZ: ... after there was criticism, after everyone noticed she disappeared, they -- they put out -- there was an e-mail that claimed to be from her that -- that frankly read like bad \"Saturday Night Live,\" like a hostage e-mail. And these latest images that the Chinese government is putting out, they're trying to pretend everything is OK. But I got to say, the Women's Tennis Association has been extraordinary standing up to China. They have been defending this athlete. They've been calling on China to have full and complete transparency, and the Chinese communist government is flabbergasted because they're not used to seeing sports leagues... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. TED CRUZ: ... or big corporate interests stand up to them. I really commend... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. TED CRUZ: ... the Women's Tennis Association for putting their players first. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And I know you and I have talked about that in the past, when sports leagues don't do that. TED CRUZ: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, so despite concern right now that China is carrying out actively a genocide against Muslims in that country, it's still set to hold the Olympics in three months. President Biden has said he's considering a diplomatic boycott. Do you think he should go further? Because other 2024 presidential candidates, and I know you are considered to be likely one of them, are really kind of competing to be as hard-line as they possibly can on China. Nikki Haley, Tom Cotton say this should be a full boycott. Do you support one? TED CRUZ: Yes, so, listen, I have been leaning in hard saying we ought to move the Olympics out of China. That's what we should have done. The IOC refused to do that. I think it's a mistake to have a full boycott of the Olympics. You know, Jimmy Carter tried that in the 1970s. All it did was punish a generation of athletes. We've got young men and young women, Americans, who have spent their whole lives practicing for this moment. I don't want to punish those young athletes. What we ought to do -- I do agree with the notion of a so-called diplomatic boycott... MARGARET BRENNAN: You agree with President Biden? TED CRUZ: ... which means we don't send high-ranking Cabinet officials over there, we don't send -- we try to minimize the attention. But I also think it's important we do two things at the Olympics in China, number one, that we actually show the courage the Women's Tennis Association is showing to call out the murder, the genocide, the torture, the lies, the complicity in COVID-19 of the Chinese communist government, to speak the truth. And then, number two, I really hope our young men and women that they go over there and kick their commie asses. We need to win in the Olympics. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Putting that aside, there are, on a practical level, corporations who spend a ton of money on sponsorships around the Olympics, Coca-Cola, Google, Procter & Gamble. They're all Olympic sponsors. Should they still go ahead with those activities? TED CRUZ: Look, I think it makes sense for corporations to cut off their ads. I would love to see corporations show a tiny bit of courage. You know, when China engages in horrific slave labor, companies like Nike turn a blind eye. When you look at the NBA -- I'm a die-hard hoops fan. The NBA's reaction to China is terrible, terrible. They're terrified of upsetting the Chinese communist dictators. They value the money so much that, in fact -- you and I both remember when Daryl Morey, who was the general manager of the Rockets, sent one little innocuous tweet about Hong Kong. And the NBA bent over backwards groveling to the Chinese communists. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. TED CRUZ: I was in Hong Kong at the time. In fact, you and I did a show at that time... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. TED CRUZ: ... when I dressed in all black in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. TED CRUZ: I understand why the NBA did it. They're looking at hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars. I understand why Nike does it. But what is really impressive about the Women's Tennis Association is, they've said they will cancel their matches in China... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. TED CRUZ: ... they will give up tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars if Peng Shuai is not released... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. TED CRUZ: ... if there isn't transparency. That's the kind of courage we need other players to have. MARGARET BRENNAN: Understand. And they are standing alone on that. I want to ask you about... TED CRUZ: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're blocking a number of President Biden's nominees to national security posts. The White House said it's an unprecedented effort of obstruction, Senator Murphy said, talking to you it's like dealing with a terrorists. Aren't you playing politics with national security? (LAUGHTER) TED CRUZ: Well, actually, quite the opposite. I'm trying to get President Biden to stop acquiescing and surrendering to our enemies. In China, I introduced an amendment to say that we should not purchase any green vehicles or solar panels made with slave labor in communist China, in concentration camps. Every Democrat but Joe Manchin voted against it. On Russia, one of the first things, Joe Biden did was surrender to Vladimir Putin on Nord Stream 2. He gave Putin a multibillion-dollar pipeline, a pipeline that we had stopped. I had authored bipartisan sanctions legislation. Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly supported my legislation, and we killed that pipeline dead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. TED CRUZ: Joe Biden came in and surrendered. It is Margaret, I believe, a generational geopolitical mistake. If this pipeline is allowed to go online, it will give billions of dollars to Russia. They will use it... MARGARET BRENNAN: Well... TED CRUZ: ... for military aggression against America and our allies. It will undermine European security, American security. And it enriches Russia. And Biden simply surrendered to Putin. That was a mistake. And so I placed a hold on these nominees in order to try to pressure Biden to follow the law. MARGARET BRENNAN: When will you lift it? TED CRUZ: To follow the law. I will lift it when he follows the law. And, in fact, I have suggested a simple, reasonable compromise, which is, I have said I will lift many of the holds if he simply triggers under a law called CAATSA, which is a Russian sanctions law passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. TED CRUZ: Under CAATSA, he could list Nord Stream 2 AG, which is the umbrella company... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. TED CRUZ: ... for Nord Stream, and then delist it. That would solve his political objective of surrendering to Putin, but it would trigger an automatic congressional override veto. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator... TED CRUZ: I have said, if they trigger the override veto, the vote, then I will lift the hold. But the reason Biden doesn't want to do that is he knows -- or he fears he will lose the vote in Congress... MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator... TED CRUZ: ... because his policy of surrendering to Russia is indefensible. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to keep talking to you. I'm going to keep talking to you, Senator. TED CRUZ: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I'm going to ask you to stay put if you could, because I have to take this break. TED CRUZ: Great. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're going to continue our conversation on the other side of it. Stay with us. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Tune in to Face the Nation next week for a special interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci. We look back into the origins of COVID. That's next Sunday on Face the Nation. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with more from Senator Ted Cruz and the head of the NAACP. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to continue our conversation with Senator Ted Cruz. Senator, just before the break we were talking about the importance of standing up to some of the autocrats around the world. I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about the state of our own democracy. I know you have condemned the violence on January 6th, but in that book \"Peril,\" Bb Woodward and Robert Costa reported detailed conversations you had with the president, Donald Trump at that time, on January 6th and that you knew there was no congressional authority to overturn the election. Didn't indulging the doubters damage our democracy and our standing in the world? TED CRUZ: Well, I haven't read that particular book, and I didn't happen to have any conversations with President Trump on January 6th. But I can tell you, that under the Constitution, under the -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Didn't you talk to him as they detail in the -- in the -- they detail a number of conversations you had in the book with the president about challenging the election. TED CRUZ: I -- I have no idea -- I have no idea what that book says. I have no idea what that book says, but I did not have any conversations with him on January 6th. But I also know what the Constitution provides, and the -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Or leading up to January 6th? TED CRUZ: I had many conversations with him in days and weeks and months leading up to January 6th. I -- I talked to the president sometimes as often as once a week or once a day. I -- but my point is simple, under the Constitution, Congress has a role and has a responsibility when it comes to certifying votes. And what I did, I brought together a group of 11 senators, and we objected to call for an electoral commission to review the claims of voter fraud -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. TED CRUZ: And to assess and make a determination to consider the evidence. And there's a strong historical precedent for that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. TED CRUZ: You look at 1876, in the election of 1876, there was a contested election. There were serious allegations of election fraud. And what Congress did in 1876 is it appointed an electoral commission. It consisted of five members of the Senate, five members of the House, five Supreme Court justices. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but the -- the people -- you know that the people -- you know -- you know that what you're laying out is an intellectualized argument here is not what people gathered and chanting things like Mike Pence were talking about that. You know that. TED CRUZ: Look, I -- I -- I think the violence that happened on that day was horrific. I think any acts of violence, regardless of your political orientation, if you're right wing, left wing, of you have no ideology at all, if you commit an act of violence, if you assault a police officer, if you're violent against anyone, you should be prosecuted and go to jail. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. TED CRUZ: And that's what the law is. And so I -- I absolutely condemn acts of violence. But -- but what - - what I did was led 11 senators in a constitutional -- MARGARET BRENNAN: And the inspiration for them. TED CRUZ: in a constitutional option, which I think would have been much better for our democracy because we, right now, have a substantial chunk of our country that has real doubts about the integrity of the election. And if we had had a credible, electoral commission do an emergency audit, it would have enhanced faith in democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. TED CRUZ: But, instead, Democrats and a lot of the press decided to just engage in incendiary rhetoric, rather than acknowledge voter fraud is realm, it is a problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, do you have a -- I want to -- TED CRUZ: And -- and -- and the allegations of voter fraud needed to be examined on the merits. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, Senator, there -- there is no evidence of fraud that would have really drawn the outcome of the election into doubt. You know that. I want to ask you about 2024 and a race -- I want to ask you, are you -- are you -- TED CRUZ: Voter fraud has been persistent from the very first election that ever occurred. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to run for president in 2024? Would you challenge President Trump or are you endorsing him? TED CRUZ: Look, I have no idea what's going to happen in 2024. Donald Trump is going to have to make a choice, first of all, whether he's going to run or not. I think if he chose to run, he would be very, very formidable. I can tell you that when I ran in 2016, we came incredibly close. I came in second. There's a long history of runner-ups becoming the next nominee. And it was the most fun I've ever had in my life. But there's a lot of time between now and 2024. My focus right now is 2022, because I think next November is going to be a wave election, an awful lot like 2010 was. I think Republicans are going to retake the House. They're going to retake the Senate. And I am spending my time recruiting candidates, supporting candidates, and working to retire both Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer from their leadership positions. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. TED CRUZ: Because I think the damage being done to this country-- MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. TED CRUZ: Inflation, jobs being killed, open borders, weakness on foreign policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. TED CRUZ: I think Virginia and New Jersey were foreshadowing for what's coming November of next year. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator, sounds like -- sounds like a campaign slogan. All right, we will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Like many Americans, we've been closely watching two trials related to race and the criminal justice system. Mark Strassman reports from Atlanta. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMAN (voice over): Kyle Rittenhouse, not guilty, sparked protests from New York -- MAN: All persons leave the area now. MARK STRASSMAN: To Portland, Oregon, which police there labeled a riot. But in the divided states of America, that verdict from Wisconsin means both redemption -- MARK MCCLOSKEY, (U.S. Senate Candidate (R-MO)): It's nice to know that when individuals take the stand to defend themselves, that the jury system in this country will recognize their right of self-defense. MARK STRASSMAN: And repudiation. KYLE JOHNSON (Organizer, Black Leaders Organizing Communities): You can't tell me that these institutions are not sick. You cannot tell me that these institutions are not tainted with racism. MARK STRASSMAN: In the chaos of Kenosha last August, Rittenhouse, then 17, killed two men with his AR-15-style assault rifle. He claimed self-defense. Rittenhouse drove in from Illinois armed for battle. He knew outage already ran high. Two days earlier, a white cop had shot a black man seven times in the back. The officer was never charged. EDITORS NOTE: Coverage during \"Face the Nation\" today of the protests following the verdict in the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse stated Rittenhouse \"drove in from Illinois armed for battle.\" Kyle Rittenhouse testified that he did not drive to Kenosha with a weapon. It was not illegal for Rittenhouse to posses that particular weapon. We apologize for this oversight in language. Jacob Blake remains paralyzed from the waist down. Justin Blake, his uncle, angry about the Rittenhouse verdict. JUSTIN BLAKE, (Jacob Blake's Uncle): We knew he wasn't going to jail for life. But we thought he'd go to jail and get spanked a little bit for his actions. MARK STRASSMAN: And he believes had Rittenhouse been black -- JUSTIN BLAKE: They would have had him on the ground eating dirt or shot him dead on sight. MARK STRASSMAN: Lots to unpack here. This country's ongoing moment of racial reckoning, vigilantism, and self-defense claims from armed people who deputize themselves. And frustration with what many see as America's two systems of justice, separate and unequal. This murder trial of three men in Brunswick, Georgia, has all those issues. TRAVIS MCMICHAEL, (Defendant): It was a -- this was a life-or-death situation. And I'm going to have to stop him from doing this. So, I shot. MARK STRASSMAN: Ahmaud Arbery was jogging through a neighborhood. Three white men suspected him of burglary. They chased him, cornered him like a rat, one of them said later. In a confrontation, he initiated, Travis McMichael killed Arbery with his shotgun. McMichael also claimed self-defense, often tough cases for prosecutors. They grilled him on the stand. How was Arbery a threat? WOMAN: Didn't pull out any guns? TRAVIS MCMICHAEL: No, ma'am. WOMAN: Didn't pull out any knife? TRAVIS MCMICHAEL: No, ma'am. WOMAN: He hasn't said one word to you? TRAVIS MCMICHAEL: He has not. WOMAN: He's not threatened you in any way, verbally or physically? TRAVIS MCMICHAEL: No, ma'am. MARK STRASSMAN: The Arbery case has echoes of Trayvon Martin nine years earlier. Both times, wannabe cops misidentified burglary suspects, young black men shot dead, gunman claims self-defense. No one's arrested for weeks. A jury later found George Zimmerman, Martin's killer, not guilty of murder. In that Georgia case, closing arguments will begin tomorrow. Only one black juror will hear them. MAN: This court has found that there appears to be intentional discrimination in the panel. MARK STRASSMAN: That verdict, whatever it is, will fuel America's clashing definitions of justice and fairness. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: That was Mark Strassman reporting. We go now to the headline of the NAACP, Derrick Johnson, who joins us from Jackson, Mississippi. Good morning to you, sir. DERRICK JOHNSON, (President And CEO, NAACP): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the jury accepted Kyle Rittenhouse's explanation that he was acting in self- defense. President Biden said, you know, this was disappointing in some ways, but the jury system works, and we have to abide by it. You say the verdict itself was dangerous. DERRICK JOHNSON: You know, it's hard for African-Americans to reconcile what we witnessed in that trial. We have far too many individuals sitting in jail for crimes they didn't commit or overcharged for crimes that were committed. And here you have a 17-year-old who illegally purchased a gun, traveled across state lines to protect property that was not his, for owners that -- who did not invite him, and he put himself in harm's way based on the rhetoric that he seen on social media platforms. So it's hard to reconcile the verdict with the experience that many African-Americans have faced over the -- several decades. So this -- this trial for us is a warning shot that vigilante justice is allowed in this country, or in particular communities. MARGARET BRENNAN: Kyle Rittenhouse, as you know, has become this sort of icon for some within the conservative movement. He was used back -- during the campaign by the - - by the then Biden campaign team in a campaign video that positioned him as a white supremacist. His mother said that was defamatory to him. The bottom line is, this is being politicized. And I'm wondering what you think the impact of that is. DERRICK JOHNSON: Well, the current political environment has allowed for this type of behavior. The prior administration's opened the door. And many individuals who operate under the banner of white supremacy have run through the door, whether it's Charlottesville or the killings in Pittsburgh at the synagogue, or in Louisville. And, unfortunately, until we have mature politicians willing to stand up, regardless of political affiliations, and address the questions of mob violence, vigilantism, but more importantly, the underlying issue of race in this country, something we have never truly addressed. MARGARET BRENNAN: But there is no evidence of him being a white supremacist himself, correct? DERRICK JOHNSON: Well, it's not about the evidence of him being a white supremacist. It is about the position that individuals like him find themselves in where they think they have to go and protect property because of peaceful protest in some cases of Black Lives Matter organizing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. DERRICK JOHNSON: Black Lives Matter is a values proposition. It's not an organization, in one sense, it's not about a hash tag, it's a value proposition that the lives of African-Americans have been diminished, and our lives matter. And when you have scenarios like what took place in Wisconsin that caused people to stand up for this police officer who paralyzed another innocent individual, you have to begin to ask -- we have to ask ourselves the questions, do we value the lives of not only African-Americans, but everyone? And what -- what he did was take up the mantle because the political climate allowed for him to do that. We had a white supremacist in the White House, and it opened the door to this floodgate of vigilante violence. And that's the real question here. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about a lawsuit that the NAACP has. You, along with Congressman Bennie Thompson, are suing the former president and Rudy Giuliani, his personal attorney, along with some extremist groups, alleging that they violated the Ku Klux Klan Act by conspiring with white supremacists to incite the violence at the Capitol on January 6th. As you watch what's happening in Charlottesville, how do you think that that trial, if it has any connection at all, will influence your case? DERRICK JOHNSON: You know, understanding the act was created after the Civil War had ended, and you had members of Congress pursuing a course to carry out their sworn duty. And any time you have a disruption for members of Congress from carrying out their sworn duty, that's a disruption and a violation of the act. And that's what we sued on. Congressman Thompson had to step down as the lead plaintiff. Barbara Lee is now the lead plaintiff. But when you witness what took place on January 6th, it falls squarely on what the framers of the act intended. That members of Congress, Senate or House members, should not be under any threat of intimidation, violence, that would prevent them from carrying out their duty. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I want to ask -- DERRICK JOHNSON: But to witness what was taking place -- go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, before I let you go, I want to quickly ask you about the current president. His approval rating among black voters has dipped, 65 percent approve, 35 percent disapprove, according to our latest polling. Do you believe President Biden's leading -- living up to the promises he made to black voters? DERRICK JOHNSON: Still more work to do. I mean he's -- he's -- he's delivered on many promises. But the key thing for many of my members and people I talk to is voting right protection. And it's the time for the Senate to do their job, adopt voting right protections. The House has done their job. The Senate must do their job. The president must sign the bill. And I also believe that as we progress in this administration, that will be the true tell. We are within a year of the administration. A lot of has been accomplished. There's still so much work to be done. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DERRICK JOHNSON: But the number one issue is voting right protections for African-American and for our democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. We'll watch those issues. Thank you very much, Mr. Johnson, for your time. Don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Here in the U.S., the number of Covid-19 cases continues to increase, up 20 percent in the last two weeks, but the situation is far worse in parts of Europe. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Charlie D'Agata reports from Poland. (Begin VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice over): The streets were ablaze as rioting erupted overnight in the Netherlands in a backlash against strict new Covid rules. A night after police fired on a demonstration in scenes the mayor called \"an orgy of violence.\" Tens of thousands protested in Austria, too, after the government there not only announced a new lockdown starting tomorrow, but ordered that vaccines would be compulsory by February 1st. The country has one of the lowest vaccination rates in Europe and one of the highest daily infection rates. Per capita, five times worse than the United States. Europe has been racking up record numbers this week, a surge so worrying the World Health Organization warns up to half a million more Covid deaths by this spring. In Germany, they're pulling down Christmas markets and considering a countrywide lockdown, too. Poland also recording the highest infection rates since April. In this ward, the only empty bed we found had been occupied by a woman who just died. CHARLIE D'AGATA (on camera): Europeans thought the darkest days of this nightmare pandemic were behind them. Yet, the Covid intensive care units are filling up once more. The difference is, last time, getting a vaccine was not an option. How many patients will survive? How many will die? MAN: Generally, about -- I don't know, about 20 percent will survive. CHARLIE D'AGATA: Twenty percent survive. MAN: Yes. CHARLIE D'AGATA: None of them have been vaccinated. MAN: Yes. CHARLIE D'AGATA: None. CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice over): Spokesperson Katazerna Malinofska (ph) said the numbers speak for themselves. WOMAN: Ninety-five persons who are treated in intensive care are unvaccinated, and 99 person who die is unvaccinated. (End VT) CHARLIE D'AGATA: With the worst of the winter months ahead, health officials now face some tough decisions, mandatory lockdowns, compulsory vaccinations, or follow Austria's lead and do both. Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Charlie D'Agata, thank you. We go now to former FDA Commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who is on the board of Pfizer. Good morning to you. DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, (Former FDA Commissioner): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, 62 million Americans who are eligible to be vaccinated still aren't. And according to the CDC, 85 percent of the counties in this country are in substantial or high transmission. So, you've already predicted a post-Thanksgiving spike. Is it too early in places like Washington, D.C., to lift mask requirements? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think local officials need to base the rules on what the local prevalence is. And, right now, in some parts of the country, prevalence is very low when you look at the south and the southeast, even parts of the tristate region and the mid-Atlantic region, I think we need to be mindful that when we lift these restrictions we may have to implement them if things worsen. Right now we're better in this country than we were a year from -- year ago. There were 170,000 cases on a seven day average a year from now, a year ago from today. We had about 77,000 people hospitalized. So we're in a better circumstance, but we're probably not as good as we should be given all the tools we have between the vaccines and the highly effective drugs and also how much infection we've had in this country and how much immunity is already in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Last Sunday you told us it was one of the biggest missed opportunities for the administration to not have rolled out boosters and made them eligible for all early on. The CDC now has said all adults may get a booster shot and that those over age 50 should get a booster. Can you interpret that language for us? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think the reluctant nature by which CDC has been stepping into this debate reflects a broader ambivalence, or a broader debate happening in a public health community about whether the vaccine should be used as tools to protect people from bad outcomes from Covid or whether they should be used as tools to try to end the pandemic and control transmission. If you're recommending boosters for people 50 at over at this point, you're recommending a booster so that you can improve their immunity and protect them from a bad Covid outcome because we see clear evidence of declining immune protection in -- from the vaccines after six months, and that person is now at increased risk of having a severe case of Covid and having a bad outcome. If you're recommending boosters at this point for younger individuals, people who are 20, people who are in their teens, even 30s, in that case there's a perception that you're recommending the booster, not necessarily to protect that individual, because they probably still have pretty good immune protection from the first two doses, and they were at lower risk anyway, but you're recommending the booster as a tool to try to make them less likely to pass on the virus. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've already seen governors in Connecticut and New Mexico say three doses is fully vaccinated. Should the CDC say you need a booster to be considered fully vaccinated? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think at some point they're going to, but not this year. I think eventually this will be considered a three-dose vaccine. But I would be hard pressed to believe CDC is going to make that recommendation any time soon. In part because of this debate about whether or not younger people who are at less risk should be receiving that third dose. In states where governors are looking to do this -- and I think some local communities will do it, some businesses are probably going to do it quite soon. I think in cases where entities are going to mandate three doses for people who are six months out from this second dose, they're doing that because they're using the vaccine as a way to control transmission and try to end this pandemic. And, you know, there are people in the public health community who don't think that that's an inappropriate way to use the vaccine. But this is a debate that's going on right now in the public health community. And CDC's sort of stuttering approach to how they've embraced boosters is reflective of that debate. MARGARET BRENNAN: The Labor Department's OSHA division said it's suspending enforcement of that Biden requirement to test or vaccinate business employees. We also saw Disney halt vaccine requirements in the state of Florida after the governor there said businesses can't carry out that kind of mandate. In both cases, you have the government telling businesses what to do. If you're a business owner, if you're an employee, I mean, what should you be doing right now? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think it's not inappropriate for businesses to mandate vaccines. And certain businesses absolutely should be mandating vaccinations in their workplaces, healthcare settings, settings where you can't protect employees with other tools other than to make sure that you can keep the infection out of that setting. So settings where you have lots of employees working very closely together, it's hard to work in a masked environment in perpetuity. I mean this is the unfortunate consequence of government officials getting into these private decisions. If we ultimately left these decision to mandate vaccines up to states, local districts, private business, I don't think you'd see this be a political fight at a national level. Now it's become a political fight at a national level, unfortunately, and you're going to see some governors trying to position themselves on this issue, like you've seen in Florida, and you're going to see the federal government, the Biden administration, now fighting those states and fighting to implement these OSHA rules. The end result is that I think businesses that were going to move forward on mandates have moved forward. And businesses that are reluctant to do it are probably going to wait in place and see what happens with the outcome of the litigation involving OSHA. By the time this lawsuits ends up getting involved, probably we'll be through the surge that we're seeing right now, this delta surge, and maybe on the back end of the pandemic here. MARGARET BRENNAN: But for people, it leaves a lot of confusion with them about what they can be expected to do and what they can expect of their coworkers when they walk into the office. Dr. Gottlieb, more to talk about with you, as always, but we've got to leave it there today. Thank you for your time and have a good Thanksgiving. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. We want to wish you and your families a happy and healthy Thanksgiving. And we will see you next Sunday with a big interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci. Until then, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.",

            "article_content": "Some of the Texas Democrats who staged a walkout to defeat a sweeping election bill are in Washington, D.C., to crank up pressure on Senators to take action on voting rights. The lawmakers are expected to sit down with several members of Congress on Tuesday and are set to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday. Texas Democrats and voting rights activists are also planning a major rally in Austin on Sunday featuring former Congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas.\u00a0 The trip to Washington comes after Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia said\u00a0he will not support the For the People Act, known as S. 1. That bill would require states to overhaul voter registration systems, expand access to early and mail voting, revise campaign finance laws and reform the redistricting process. Manchin and other Democrats also oppose eliminating the filibuster, which means any federal election legislation would need support from at least 10 Republicans.\u00a0 The Texas Democrats are expected to meet with Democratic Senators Amy Klobuchar and Jeff Merkley, who sponsored the Senate bill, but they're not scheduled to meet with Manchin. The group is also expected to meet with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and staffers who work for Texas' two Republican Senators, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn. The lawmakers will also speak at the Senate Democrats' lunch. The Texas lawmakers hope their visit to Washington will reignite a sense of urgency on voting rights. They know their victory in Texas is almost certain to be short-lived because Governor Greg Abbott has pledged to call a special session to address election reform. The bill that was defeated set limits on early voting hours, banned drive-through voting, made it a felony for officials to send unsolicited absentee ballot requests and lowered the standard for overturning an election based on fraud. Texas Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, who represents part of San Antonio, told CBS News that there are a number of \"options on the table\" for Democrats to push back against an election bill when a special session is convened. He did not rule out another walkout, which would deprive Republicans of a quorum needed to pass legislation, but he hopes for action at the federal level. \"When Texas Democrats walked off the House floor to deny a quorum, to block a bill, I think that lit a small spark and reignited the national debate on voting rights,\" Martinez Fischer said. \"If we can bring that small spark from Texas and help light a fire in the bellies of these United States Senators, I think it will be time well spent.\" Manchin said he doesn't plan to support the For The People Act because it lacks bipartisan support, but he does support the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. That bill, which is cosponsored by Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, would restore a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that required certain jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination to receive pre-clearance before changing voting rules. But it faces a bleak future after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called it \"unnecessary.\" President Biden recently announced that Harris would be leading the administration's efforts on voting rights.\u00a0 Following a meeting Monday with voting rights advocates in Greenville, South Carolina, Harris told reporters that in some states, fundamental rights are being \"trampled\" upon and that the president is ready to sign into law both the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. She said the administration supports doing \"everything that we could possibly do to push back against laws that are designed to suppress people's right to vote.\" The Republican National Committee said in a statement, \"Biden, Harris, and the Democrats are more interested in desperate stunts and partisan takeover of elections than listening to the American people who want her to visit the border and also support commonsense election integrity reforms, including broadly-supported voter ID laws.\"\u00a0 At the rally Sunday in Austin, O'Rourke wants the message to be \"loud and clear for the members of the U.S. Senate, for the president and for the country that Texas is on the front lines of this fight.\"\u00a0 \"There really is no other option than to make the For the People Act work. There's one person, more than any other, who can make this happen: that's the president of the United States,\" O'Rourke told CBS News. \"I'm confident if President Biden makes this number one priority, then he will have the power to bring this country and the senators who represent this country together around this.\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "In the end, the vote to remove Representative Liz Cheney from her leadership position Wednesday morning was swift and relatively unceremonious, taking about as long as it would to order a morning cup of coffee, around 15 minutes. But it's far from certain that Republicans will be able to dispense with Cheney entirely as they look toward 2022, set on winning back control in Washington.\u00a0 Cheney has repeatedly made it clear that while she lost the battle, she is not surrendering the larger fight and will seek public ways to push her message. To that end, she welcomed the chance to talk with reporters right after the vote to remove her. \"We cannot both embrace the 'big lie' and embrace the Constitution. And going forward, the nation needs it,\" she said. \"I am committed and dedicated to ensuring that that's how this party goes forward. And I plan to lead the fight to do that.\"\u00a0 And in a sign of how she may now have a broader platform outside of leadership, she sat for an interview with NBC News later on Tuesday to reiterate that she sees herself as \"one of the leaders in a fight to help to restore our party.\"\u00a0 \"This is the opening salvo in that battle, and it is a battle we have to win because it's not just about the Republican party. It's about the country,\" Cheney said. But whether there is a meaningful constituency within the party for such an approach remains an open question. Cheney's ouster further signals Mr. Trump's hold over the GOP and served as a warning to Republicans about the pitfalls of criticizing him, even though he's been out of office for four months. Mr. Trump continues to send out weekly statements claiming that the election was rigged, and he has been cheering on the efforts to remove Cheney from leadership.\u00a0 The Wyoming Republican \u2014 who was once seen as a rising party star and passed on a Senate bid in order to ascend the ranks in the House \u2014 has spoken out against perpetuating Mr. Trump's falsehoods about the election. Her House colleagues found this to be a distraction. And her likely successor for the leadership role, Representative Elise Stefanik, has seen her own star rise as she has endeared herself to the former president.\u00a0 Cheney's removal was carried out behind closed doors and by voice vote, intended by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to show unity and to quickly move on. But it also prevented members from having to go on record with their vote for or against Cheney. She spoke briefly at the beginning of the meeting, acknowledging that if the conference wanted a leader who would enable the former president and spread disinformation, she wasn't the woman for the job. Then she led a short prayer, quoting from John 8:32: \"Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.\" Cheney and allies see her removal as punishment for such truth telling. \"Liz has committed the only sin of being consistent and telling the truth,\" said Republican Congressman\u00a0 Adam Kinzinger, who along with Cheney was one of only 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump. \"The truth is that the election was not stolen. Seventy-four million voters were not disenfranchised, they were just outnumbered and it's important for our party to take inventory of that and go out and win the next election, instead of continuing the 'big lie.'\" A recent CBS News poll shows 70 % of Republicans don't think Joe Biden was the legitimate winner of the 2020 election. GOP-led state legislatures across the country are pushing through changes to voting laws in reaction to Trump's loss. The Republican-led state Senate in Arizona is conducting an audit of ballots against the will of local election officials. And Republicans across the country have seen increased energy and unity among the grassroots around an \"election integrity\" message.\u00a0 Colorado Republican Representative Ken Buck said Cheney \"was canceled today for speaking her mind and disagreeing with the narrative that President Trump has put forth,\" and suggested there could be consequences for the party in next year's midterms if it drowns out the GOP's policy message.\u00a0 \"There are major issues \u2014 the border, spending,\" Buck said. \"But to suggest that the American people in 2022 won't consider the fact that we were unwilling to stand up to a narrative that the election was stolen, I think will be taken into consideration with their vote.\"\u00a0 There is a contingent of Republicans who share Cheney's concern about the 2022 consequences of adherence to Mr. Trump, but they're mostly in the Senate.\u00a0 \"I don't think that relitigating the 2020 election is a winning strategy going forward,\" said John Thune, the second highest ranking Senate Republican. \"I think if we're going to win elections in 2022, we have to be talking about the issues the American people care about... I hope that all Republicans can start looking forward, not looking backward.\"\u00a0 Republicans who opposed Cheney argued that her removal was necessary to move forward. Cheney, who was charged with House Republicans' messaging in her capacity as conference chair, was increasingly viewed as being out of sync with the rest of House GOP leaders. \"It just became too much of a distraction. Our goal right now is to be focused on what's happening in our country,\" said freshman Congressman Byron Donalds. \"We have gas lines all over the place, we have unemployment, we just missed a jobs report by 750,000 jobs in the United States...when you miss like that, but you're focused on what Republicans are going to do with their conference chair? We have a distraction that needs to be resolved.\" Donalds is one of several new GOP House members who represent the most diverse class of party freshman yet. Even as Mr. Trump lost the presidency, Republicans gained seats in the House and are within striking distance of winning back the majority next year. McCarthy and others have calculated that keeping Mr. Trump and his supporters in the fold is critical to that effort.\u00a0 Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that while Cheney has been a \"solid conservative,\" the congresswoman \"has taken a position regarding former President Trump which is out of the mainstream of the Republican Party.\"\u00a0 McCarthy, who hopes to become speaker if Republicans win back the House, has developed a reputation for reading and following the political winds that drive his caucus in order to stay in power. He backed Cheney during a previously unsuccessful effort by some House conservatives to remove her from her leadership post in February after she voted to impeach the Mr. Trump.\u00a0 In a letter to the GOP conference announcing the vote to remove Cheney this week, McCarthy said it was necessary to remove any distractions standing between Republicans and the goal of taking the House next year.\u00a0 But as Republicans gained House seats with Mr. Trump on the ballot, they lost the U.S. Senate in part because of his false election claims. While campaigning for two Senate seats in Georgia's runoff elections, the former president continued to claim the election was rigged, a message that ultimately suppressed turnout among the base.\u00a0 House Republicans are set to choose Cheney's replacement on Friday, an expedited timeline. Some conservatives criticized Stefanik as being too far to the left because she voted against some of Mr. Trump's legislative priorities while he was in office, such as the president's $1.9 trillion tax measure.\u00a0 But she has support from President Trump, McCarthy, and Representative Steve Scalise, the House GOP whip, which make for powerful backers. \"I don't think there would be anybody that wants to risk a future chairmanship or a future role in the party to take on Elise Stefanik,\" said Buck, a Freedom Caucus member who is not supporting her. Stefanik, the youngest Republican woman ever elected to Congress, came to office on a more moderate platform and in the more traditional mold of the party. But her evolution mirrors that of the party. Her district voted for Barack Obama twice before supporting Trump twice, and has trended in the former president's direction. Stefanik has become a staunch ally of the president, and was one of his most outspoken defenders during the first impeachment trial. In a letter to colleagues Wednesday, Stefanik said \"a unified leadership team is the key foundation as we work to regain the majority.\" Rebecca Kaplan, Zak Hudak, Nikole Killion and Jack Turman contributed to this report.\u00a0 Caitlin Huey-Burns is a political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "House Republicans plan to vote Wednesday on whether to strip Representative Liz Cheney of her leadership post in the House as a result of her criticisms of former President Trump and his baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. The highest-ranking two Republicans in the House want Cheney to be replaced with Representative\u00a0Elise Stefanik, a staunch Trump ally, as GOP Conference chair. Cheney won't give up the spot willingly, and she plans to force the conference to vote on whether to remove her, according to a source familiar with her plans. In a defiant speech on the House floor Tuesday night, on the eve of the vote, Cheney said she will not \"watch in silence\" amid Mr. Trump's baseless claims that the election was stolen from him. \"This is not about policy, this is not about partisanship, this is about our duty as Americans,\" Cheney said. \"Remaining silent and ignoring the lie emboldens the liar. I will not participate in that. I will not sit back and watch in silence while others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law and joins the former president's crusade to undermine our democracy.\" If the conference chooses to remove Cheney, as House Republican leadership expects it to, the vote will trigger an overhaul of the GOP's messaging, further solidifying it as the party of Mr. Trump.\u00a0 \u00a0 The House Republican Conference is simply the organizational body for all the GOP members in the House of Representatives. The conference chair is responsible for scheduling meetings where members can discuss issues and legislation within their own party. But the chair also has a major role in party messaging, both coordinating media availabilities and interviews with members and speaking on behalf of the caucus.\u00a0 The job gives Cheney the third-highest position among House Republicans, behind Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise. However, conference chairs have seldom reached higher positions within the party.\u00a0 Cheney is at risk of losing her job as conference chair because she has repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump and rejected his unfounded theories about the election, while other members of House GOP leadership and some members have stood behind the former president and his claims.\u00a0 She began publicly breaking with McCarthy over how the party should handle Trump after pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol January 6. She called for Trump to be impeached for his role in the event and later voted to impeach him, while McCarthy urged members to move forward.\u00a0 For her impeachment vote, Cheney faced a similar attempt to unseat her as conference chair in early February. At the meeting, McCarthy strongly advised members against unseating Cheney as well as removing Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments for promoting conspiracy theories and apparently endorsing violence toward Democratic politicians. In both cases, the conference voted overwhelmingly not to take action. Just 61 Republicans voted to remove Cheney from her post, while 145 voted for her to stay in the vote by secret ballot.  But days later, the GOP in Cheney's home state of Wyoming voted overwhelmingly to censure her for voting to impeach Mr. Trump.\u00a0 In late April at House Republicans' annual retreat in Florida, the fracturing grew between Cheney and pro-Trump members when Cheney told reporters \"our elected leaders are the ones who are in charge,\" as opposed to Mr. Trump.\u00a0 Since, Cheney has continued to challenge Mr. Trump's benefit to the party as well as his baseless claims that Democrats cheated in the 2020 election. \"While embracing or ignoring Trump's statements might seem attractive to some for fundraising and political purposes, that approach will do profound long-term damage to our party and our country,\" Cheney wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last week.  Almost immediately, McCarthy and Scalise began taking steps behind the scenes to unseat Cheney from her conference chair post. Since then, both of them have said they support Cheney's removal and replacement with Stefanik.\u00a0 \"Each day spent relitigating the past is one day less we have to seize the future,\" McCarthy wrote to GOP members Monday. \"These internal conflicts need to be resolved so as to not detract from the efforts of our collective team. Having heard from so many of you in recent days, it's clear that we need to make a change.\" Representative Virginia Foxx, a House veteran who's facing a far-right primary challenger in her reelection battle, is expected to introduce a resolution to remove Cheney from the job when the conference meets Wednesday, according to sources familiar with the plans . The vote is expected to be done by secret ballot or by voice and decided by a simple majority, as was the previous one, according to two sources familiar with the process. Because there are 218 Republican members in the House, at least 110 would need to vote against Cheney to remove her.  If the attempt to oust her is successful, the conference would then need to elect a replacement chair. That election would likely take place at a later conference meeting, leaving time for a candidate forum in between, according to sources familiar with the plans.\u00a0 Like all conference meetings, both of these events would take place behind closed doors.\u00a0 Stefanik, a four-term congresswoman from upstate New York, is the current frontrunner to be the next GOP Conference chair if Cheney loses the job.\u00a0 Stefanik was an establishment Republican who worked for former President George W. Bush and former House Speaker Paul Ryan. During the 2016 election, Stefanik was so reluctant to embrace Mr. Trump that she referred to him as \"my party's presidential nominee,\" rather than by his name. But by the first impeachment inquiry into the former president a year and a half ago, Stefanik had become one of his staunchest allies on the Hill. On Monday, he repaid her for her loyalty.\u00a0 \"The House GOP has a massive opportunity to upgrade this week from warmonger Liz Cheney to gifted communicator Elise Stefanik. Elise has intelligence, an endorsement from American Patriot Brandon Judd and the National Border Patrol Council, she has an A+ from the NRA, and she loves our Veterans,\" Mr. Trump said in a statement. Stefanik also has a history of helping other members win election and reelection. Her Elevate PAC donated to nearly 50 Republican women running for House spots the last election cycle.\u00a0 Still, Stefanik's moderate history worries some in the GOP as it coalesces around the former president's ideals. The Conservative Club for Growth PAC last week said in a statement that Stefanik has among the most liberal voting records in the House GOP. \"House Republicans should find a conservative to lead messaging and win back the House Majority,\" the group said.\u00a0 Some members of the right-wing Freedom Caucus have already come out against Cheney. Representative Chip Roy sent a memo to members Tuesday indicating he wanted to hold off on putting Stefanik in the leadership post.\u00a0 \"Therefore, with all due respect to my friend, Elise Stefanik, let us contemplate the message\u00a0 Republican leadership is about to send by rushing to coronate a spokesperson whose voting record\u00a0 embodies much of what led to the 2018 ass-kicking we received by Democrats,\" Roy wrote in the memo. To quell similar concerns among the most conservative members, Stefanik plans to meet with the Freedom Caucus after the vote on Cheney, according to sources familiar with the plans. She has also told GOP members she plans to serve only one term as conference chair, according to a GOP aide.\u00a0 But Stefanik's reaction to the January 6 riot at the Capitol stands in stark contrast to Cheney's. While Cheney called for Mr. Trump's impeachment in the days that followed, Stefanik was unfazed. She returned to the House chamber after the event and unsuccessfully objected to the election results in Pennsylvania.\u00a0 A source familiar with the GOP's plans confirms that there will be a candidate forum for potential candidates for the conference chair position on Thursday with an election planned for Friday. In a speech on the House floor Tuesday night, Cheney was emphatic that \"the election is over.\"\u00a0 \"Today we face a threat, America has never seen before,\" Cheney said. \"A former president, who provoked a violent attack on this Capitol, in an effort to steal the election has resumed his aggressive efforts to convince Americans that the election was stolen from him.\" Cheney urged her fellow Republicans that they must \"speak the truth\" because \"millions of Americans have been misled by the former president. They have heard only his words and not the truth.\" Nikole Killion and Rebecca Kaplan contributed to this report.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the House.",

            "article_content": "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris that aired Sunday, December 26, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Medical experts are projecting that we could see as many as a million infections per day because of this new Omicron variant. Is our healthcare system prepared for what's coming? VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We are prepared for it, and there's no question. I mean, if you think of where we are today as compared to even a year ago, we have vaccines. We are clear that wearing masks, especially in public spaces, makes a difference. We have the tools now to really keep ourselves safe. And I think part of the issue that is confronting us as a country and as a society is ensuring that everyone is doing everything they individually have the power to do to slow this thing down. And I can't stress enough, one, I understand why people are concerned about this. Parents with young children. There is a lot about this moment that is frustrating. But let's not forget our individual power to actually do something about it. Everyone has to get vaccinated. The vaccines are free. They are safe and they'll save your life. Get the booster shot. Against Omicron it almost guarantees that you are unlikely to have to go to the hospital much less God forbid that- that you die because of this virus. There are things that people can do, and I can't stress enough that right now everyone has the ability to make these choices that will have a result and an impact on themselves and their community, MARGARET BRENNAN: But particularly in the Northeast, we're already seeing hospitals overwhelmed with Delta. Inflation is real. It's going to be with us as long as the pandemic dominates. As you know, the exhaustion is just with us all the time. When can you tell the American people this will end? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: What I can say is that we have the power today to have an impact on tomorrow, and we can't shortchange the significance of that. We have the power today to go out and if you've not been boosted, go get boosted. The power today to go and get vaccinated. And that will have an impact on where we end up tomorrow. And that is again, where every individual has it within their ability and- and many may argue within their responsibility to actually take on these- these- accept the tools that are available to do something about this issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it the fault of the unvaccinated? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I don't think this is a moment to talk about fault. It- it is no one's fault that this virus hit our shores or hit the world. I would not blame it on anyone in that way. But it is more about individual power and responsibility, and it's about the decisions that everyone has the choice to make, no doubt. But it is clear that everyone has the ability to make a choice to save their lives and- and to prevent hospitalization if they get vaccinated and if they get the booster. And so I urge people to do that. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is going to be hard for the economy. Are you going to need to ask Congress for another relief package? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Well, I'm glad you talked about the economy. Let's talk about the economy. First of all, as an administration, as we look at the end of the year, there are specific facts that we are proud of on the issue of the economy. We have reduced unemployment down to 4.2%. The economists predicted that we wouldn't get there for another couple of years, but here we are. We have reduced the deficit by over $300 billion. We have created over 6 million jobs, so there are good things that happened- have happened as it relates to the strength of the economy. Let's also talk about the most recent facts. Excuse me, not Moody's, but Goldman Sachs indicated that the failure to pass BBB, the Build Back Better Act is going to have a negative impact on our fiscal health.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mmhm.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: But the converse is also true. And again, what is within our grasp to pass Build Back Better? Where we bring down the cost of living. When we talk about the economy, the average person in America is going to measure the economy based on can they actually just afford to get through the day and through the month. The cost of living, can they keep up with the cost of living, child care, elder care, prescription drugs? And that's one of the reasons our priority. To your point about the economy that has been the fuel behind our insistence that we find common ground in Congress to pass the Build Back Better Act so we can bring down the cost of living for- for real Americans working people. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the Build Back Better act like it still has some life to it. As you know, Sen. Joe Manchin said, he's a no. You don't have the votes. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: You know, I was in the Senate for four years before I came here, and I have seen the ups and downs in terms of legislation. I mean, those of us who study history, recent or- or ancient know that there are many times over the course of history where legislation was doomed to be dead and it still kept going. The Affordable Care Act being one of the most recent examples of that, or even the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act now not deal, where lots of folks said it was dead on arrival, but we got it done. So, I'm not giving up the president's not giving up, and frankly, the stakes are too high. I mean, we're literally talking about saying that no family should pay more than 7% of their income in child care. We're saying that people who have diabetes, I have family members. Many people know or have diabetes. The only thing that will keep them alive is insulin, and it is so expensive. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it is the cost of the bill that has led Sen. Joe Manchin at least publicly to say it's actually going to hurt the economy. His argument is that it'll add to inflation, among many other things. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: And- and Goldman Sachs just today said that actually, we know that Build Back Better will strengthen the economy. And so, I think there is without any question, room for discussion about what actually will be the impact to the economy. And objective, leading and highly respected economists are weighing in on this discussion to say, in fact, no. And you can look at the impact on- on- on the economy and see that not only is it morally right to say parents shouldn't have to struggle to take care of their basic needs like caring for their children and their parents- and their parents and their elder relatives. But it actually makes economic sense to do that and it brings down the cost of living. MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you look at what's actually possible right now,-- VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014do you feel that Senator Manchin is playing fair with you? I mean, he went on television and said no, pretty definitively. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I think the stakes are too high for this to be in any way about any specific individual. We have to- you know, one of the things\u2014 MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a 50-50 Senate, though, so you need him. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: It is. I'm the tiebreaker. I'm the tie vote. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's- exactly. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: In fact, the president and I joke and when I leave one of our meetings to go break a tie, he says, Well, that's going to be a winning vote. Whenever I vote, we win. It's a- it's a joke we have, but- the stakes are so high. And we can't afford in this moment of time where we have an opportunity to do something so substantial in terms of public policy in America, to literally help families. To- we can't- I- I refuse to get caught up in the what might be personal politics when the people who are waking up at three o'clock in the morning worried about how they're going to get by could care less about the politics of D.C. They just want us to fix things. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't feel betrayed? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: No, I don't feel- I don't have any personal feelings about this. This is about let's get the job done. Let's get it done. Let's see it through. Let's listen to objective sources of information on the economic impact. Let's travel the country if we haven't already. I have. And talk with families who say I can't afford to do the basic things that I need to do as a responsible adult, like care for my children, care for my older parents or afford to get lifesaving medication like insulin. These are the things that are at stake. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the child care tax credit has already expired. How do you\u2014 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: We have to extend it. MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014come up with\u2014 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: We have to extend it. MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you do that without Sen. Manchin?\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: You don't give up. That's how we do it. We don't give up. That's how. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president has also put you in charge of voting rights. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yeah I- and I asked. Yeah.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You asked it? You wanted this? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I- you may know I am a child of parents who met when they were active in the Civil Rights movement.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN:Mmhm. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I- there is so much about this fight for - justice and the ideals of our democracy that are part of my DNA and on the issue of voting, we have seen 18 at least states, over a dozen states that have passed, I'm told 33 laws that are making it difficult for the American people to vote. You know, I've been meeting with prime ministers and presidents from around the world. One of my favorite interactions was with the now past Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel. She came over for breakfast and we talked about everything that has to do with our relative security as nations and our priorities. And then she asked me about voting. She asked me about voting, and she knew what was going on here, and this is not a subject that was unique to my conversation with her, by the way, in terms of world leaders, because people around the world watch what we do as America, because we have held ourselves out to be a model of the efficacy of the- the ability of a democracy to coexist with an economic strength and power. We have been a role model saying, you can see this and aspire to this and reject autocracies and autocratic leadership. And right now, we're about to take ourselves off the map as a role model, if we let- if we let people destroy one of the most important pillars of a democracy which is free and fair elections. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about what's happening in state capitals around the country. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I am and- and but I'm talking about that, and I'm talking about what's not happening in this Capitol in Washington, D.C., which is the passing of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. We have to- we have to agree- and this is not about saying you should vote for me or you should vote for Democrats. This is about everyone having unfettered access to their right to vote and- and agreeing that this is bigger than one election cycle. This is literally about our standing in the world, it's about the integrity of our democracy. And I do believe of all the things that are on the headline news tonight, tomorrow, for the next week or months, when our kids look back five- ten years from now, at this moment it will be on our watch that we either stood for and fought for our democracy or not. And that I think that is all at stake right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you still have the reality of a 50-50 Senate\u2013 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013and you have two senators who say they're not on board for changing the filibuster in order to try to push this through. So how do you overcome that democratic reality of not having the votes and not having a clear path forward? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: And you're right to talk about the- the structure and the rules of the Senate, and that is real. And we will do, and look at whatever is necessary to push for Congress to take this issue on. And we have to, we have to. MARGARET BRENNAN: A carve out to the filibuster? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that we are going to urge the United States Congress, and we have been, to examine the tools they have available to do what is necessary to fight for and retain the integrity of our voting system in America. MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're open, though, to a carve out to the filibuster to get there.-- VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I \u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013You were when you ran for president on the issue of climate. Are voting rights as important to you? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I believe that voting rights is one of the most significant issues that is facing us as individuals and as leaders today, there's no question, no question. Voting rights lead to every other right, every other right. And so we need to prioritize it as a nation, all of us and understand why voting rights are important and- and- and insist that our elected leaders preserve these rights. But, MARGARET, realize that what's happening right now includes that the entire Republican caucus of the Senate have voted against even debating this subject,-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but so\u2013 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: \u2013even debating, and I- I just- I think it's really important that in this conversation about what's happening in Washington, D.C. on the issue of voting, that we not lose sight of the fact that there is one whole group of people, half of the United States Senate, who are refusing to even debate this issue. Like you can then end up where you are, but stand up before the American people, state your position, defend your position. See if it stands up to logic and reason or your stated, or supposed ideals and values as an- as an American. MARGARET BRENNAN: But to that point, you were just in the Senate\u2013 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013and the president spent decades there. How come you can't pull someone across the aisle on this?--\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: We are trying. MARGARET BRENNAN: Or even Joe Manchin within your own party? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: We are not going to give up on these issues, but you're right. It's a 50-50 Senate. It's a 50-50 Senate and so- but it has to be a combination of us as an administration, but also everyone weighing in. And I'm glad we're having this conversation. I think we have to continue to elevate the conversation about voting rights. Given the daily grind that people are facing, this may not feel like an immediate or urgent matter when in fact it is. And the more we have the opportunity to talk about it, the more I think people will see, yeah, I don't want an America of the future for my kids to be in an America where we are- are- are suppressing the right of the American people to vote. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move on to foreign policy but just to button that up though, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says it's delusional for Democrats to think they're going to win control in 2022 if they don't do something about the filibuster and student debt. Will we see any movement on student debt in the new year? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: So, I know that Sec. Cardona, the Secretary of Education, is working on what we can do and must do frankly to relieve the- the pressures of student loan debt, and it's a real issue. Students across- well graduates and former students across our country are literally making decisions about whether they can have a family, whether they can buy a home. You know, I'll date myself, but you know, I had student loan debt. I remember that coupon book, and I had to fill out the coupon and write the check every month. And it's no small matter, and we need to figure out a way to relieve debt. So it's a fair issue in terms of the seriousness of the issue. Voting we've discussed, it is a very big issue, and what I believe we must do is continue to be vigilant and fighting for folks who have a right to be seen and their circumstances to be heard and understood because we have the ability to actually alleviate the burdens that people are carrying that make it difficult for them to get through the day or in the month. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think you need to deliver on that promise before 2022? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Which promise? MARGARET BRENNAN: On debt forgiveness for student loans? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Well, I think that we have to continue to do what we're doing and figure out how we can creatively relieve the pressure that students are feeling because of their student loan debt. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: On foreign policy, I know you take the presidential daily brief most days you said\u2013 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Every- I read it every day. I read it every day, and then most days the president and I actually do it together with our IC- with the intelligence community. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you see is the biggest national security challenge confronting the U.S.? What is the thing that worries you and keeps you up at night? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Frankly, one of them is our democracy. And that I can talk about because that's not classified. It really does. I-I- there is I think no question in the minds of people who are foreign policy experts that the year 2021 is not the year 2000. You know, I think there's so much about foreign and domestic policy that, for example, was guided and prioritized based on Sept 11, 2001. And we are embarking on a- a new era where the threats to our nation take many forms, including the threat of autocracies taking over and having outsized influence around the world. And so I go back to our- our point about the need to fight for the integrity of our democracy. In addition, it is obviously about what we need to do in the climate crisis. We just did the meetings around COP and recognizing- you know, some used to laugh and say how can you say that the climate crisis is about national security? Well, of course it is. And I can go through the details of why. But what we must do then in- in the face of any and all threats is recognize that one of our greatest strengths is to strengthen our relationship with our allies and partners around the world. And that has been one of the highest priorities of our administration. It has been to re-enter, for example, the Paris Agreement. It has been to-to do the work of working with our European allies. It is the work of building back the trust that is necessary for us to be a member of- of- of a community of nations that share values and priorities. And I think one of the greatest threats that we saw recently is that when we pull out of the- those relationships, we weaken our standing as a nation and therefore weaken, I believe, our security.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhmm. There are 100,000 Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yep.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we going to see a hot war in Europe in the next few weeks? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Well, we are having direct conversations with Russia. The president, as you know, met recently virtually with Putin, and we are very clear that- that Russia should not invade the sovereignty of Ukraine, that we must stand up and we are standing up for its territorial integrity. We are working with our allies in that regard, and we've been very clear that we are prepared to issue sanctions like you've not seen before. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean sanctioning Vladimir Putin directly? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I'm not going to talk about specific sanctions, but we are making that clear to him, and we are in direct conversations. And we are also working very closely with our allies. And again, let's use this issue as an example of the importance of the strength of those relationships. MARGARET BRENNAN: But in the past alongside allies we've sanctioned, it's been punitive. It hasn't prevented anything. It hasn't stopped Vladimir Putin to date. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: And I'll repeat that the type of sanctions that we're talking about are sanctions that we've not done before. MARGARET BRENNAN: Should cyberattacks be considered like terror attacks? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I think that, you know, I actually wrote a book many years ago, and I do believe that it is important for us to have a cyber doctrine. One of the- the areas of focus for me is what I'm doing to lead the space council and three priorities there- essentially, it's a- it's in the context of national security, but one of them is the role and the responsibility that we have to work with our partners and allies around international norms and rules. And that relates to what we are doing in space, be it commercial or- or activity in civil space, or national security. Similarly, on the issue of cyber, it is important that we work with our allies on these issues. When I was in France meeting with Macron, this is one of the issues that we discussed, which is the importance of all of us as allies and partners and even those who are adversaries, making sure that we are all on the same page about what will be interpreted as a threat or not, and with some level of consensus about what the norms and the rules are and what they should be. I think that's critically important as we look at emerging threats, there's no question. Everyone- I think you don't have to read a PDB to know that cyber is one of those issues. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you were last in the room on the decision in Afghanistan to pull out. You've talked about not abandoning allies.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Mhmm.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel personal responsibility for the chaos of that withdrawal? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I fully supported the president's decision to after what was taking on the fact of being an endless war, of pulling American troops out, and I think it's really important to remember that the previous administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban, did not invite the Afghan government to be at the table, and negotiated a deal that- that required and promised as part of an agreement that we would pull out by the end of May. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Mhmm.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: So, we were saddled with that responsibility based on an agreement between the United States and the Taliban and so\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: You agreed to extend it and not to break the agreement with the Taliban. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: \u2013We made the decision that if we were to break the agreement, it would have been a whole other situation, and right now I strongly believe that had we broken that agreement, we would be talking about the war in Afghanistan. And American troops in Afghanistan, and we're not talking about that. I don't regret that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But I know as a candidate, you pledged to protect the gains that were made for Afghan women.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Yes. Yeah. And I feel very strongly about that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Many of those Afghan women are not in school today because the Taliban is in control. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Which is why we are working through the U.N. And doing what we need to do through our friends to provide humanitarian assistance, bypassing the Taliban to make sure that we are supporting women and girls there. One of our big issues in terms of any conversations with the Taliban is exactly this point, which is the condition, the status and the treatment of women and girls, including for girls, access to education, not to mention our concern about counterterrorism and what we need to do in terms of that threat. So, these are real issues there's no question. The United States has been and continues to be, since the end of August, the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan\u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know, a lot of that aid isn't able to make it into the people who need it because of the sanctions on the Taliban being in control. So it's just- Afghan women, do you worry that they were abandoned by the United States essentially? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I worry that the Taliban has not complied with what we know to be the appropriate treatment and the right treatment of girls and women, and that's why we are taking the posture that we are with the Taliban right now, because that is one of our greatest considerations and concerns. MARGARET BRENNAN: You went to Guatemala in June, and you clearly delivered the message, \"do not come.\" You took a lot of grief from progressives in your party for saying that. Do you regret having to say that? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I was in Guatemala because we have to address, in a comprehensive way, the root causes of migration. When I was in Guatemala, I talked with the Guatemalan people about what I've talked to folks in this very room who have convened about this issue, which is the vast majority of people, wherever they are from, don't want to leave home. They don't want to leave the language they speak. The place where they- they pray, their grandmother. Most people don't want to leave home. And when they do, it's for one or two reasons. Either they can't take care of the basic needs of themselves in their family or they're fleeing harm. And so my approach to the issue in Guatemala and its neighboring countries, which has been formerly called the Northern Triangle, is to do what we have, I think, a responsibility to do, as a member of the Western Hemisphere. To assist in dealing with the root causes of migration out of those countries. And that is my primary focus. In fact, just the week before last I convened after many meetings, American CEOs. We started out with 12, now we got 77, partnering with us around investment in Guatemala to deal with a variety of issues that are about their economy and their workers, including women as farmers and workers there.\u00a0 I have been working with our Department of Justice to do what we need to do to enhance prosecutions, investigations and prosecutions around human trafficking and smuggling. That was an area of focus for me when I was attorney general of California was taking on the issue of transnational criminal organizations and human trafficking. It's a big issue that we need to address. So that is the work we're doing. (Crosstalk) MARGARET BRENNAN: I think the critics don't understand that though, the progressives within your own party who are critical of you for that message. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I think it's important to focus on the details of what we collectively want, and I think everyone, regardless of their- where they are on the political spectrum, appreciates the point that people don't want to leave home. And- and what can we do as a neighbor to help them stay at home when that's in fact what they want to do? And I'll tell you, when I was in Guatemala and spoke with the people there, that was emphasized in a way that I knew before I got there, but was really emphasized when I got there. People don't want to leave. They don't want their family members to leave. Their family members didn't want to leave. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think, as you come to the end of this first year,\u00a0 what do you think your biggest failure has been at this point? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: To not get out of D.C. more. (Laughs) I mean, and I actually mean that sincerely for a number of reasons. You know, I- we, the president and I came in, you know, COVID had already started. It was- the pandemic had started. And when we came in, we really couldn't travel. You know, a large part of the relationship that he and I have built has been being in this, you know, together in the same office for hours on end, doing Zooms or whatever because we couldn't get out of D.C. and on issues that are about fighting for anything from voting rights to child care to one of the issues that I care deeply about maternal health. Being with the people who are directly impacted by this work, listening to them so that they, not some pundit, tells us what their priorities are, I think is critically important.\u00a0 People are- people have a right to know and believe that their government actually sees and hears them. And my biggest concern is I don't ever want to be in a bubble when it comes to being aware of and in touch with what people need at any given moment in time. MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know we're- we're running out of time here, but I want to ask you, you know, I've talked to some of your former Senate colleagues and they say you have been given an impossible portfolio. And a lot of people have been harshly critical of that. And I want to ask you if you think some of these things are fair or unfair. Donna Brazile, the former Democratic strategist said, \"all the focus on turnover in your office is overblown, but you do need to renew and repurpose.\" Bakari Sellers said, \"her portfolio is trash. You give someone a portfolio that is not meant for them to succeed.\" Do you think any of this is fair? Do you think you're being set up to fail? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: No, I don't believe I'm being set up to fail. But- but-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Because these are Democrats saying this. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: --But\u00a0 more important I'm the Vice President of the United States, anything that I handle is because it's a tough issue. And it couldn't be handled at some other level. And there are a lot of big, tough issues that need to be addressed. And it has actually been part of my lifelong career to deal with tough issues and this is no different. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think there is such scrutiny? I mean, women are always held to a different standard, that's just a fact. Is the fact that you're a woman and the fact that you are a minority in this office part of why there is such scrutiny? VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: I'll leave that for others to deal with. I, you know, I- I have a job to do. And I'm going to get that job done. Let me just tell you, if you talk about being the first or being- maybe it's because I am that, for the first time maternal health is on the stage at the White House, where we're bringing people in from around the country to talk about maternal mortality, to talk about issues like postpartum care and why we should expand Medicaid coverage so it's not just 60 days, but it's for a year because that's how long she needs that assistance. And to do it because it's the right thing to do regardless of your gender, regardless of your race. And it affects so many women around our country. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's all in Build Back Better. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: Well, I've been working on it before we offered Build Back Better. I will work on it my entire career and elevate it to the extent that I have a microphone in front of me.",

West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin putting the president's $2 trillion social spending plan on ice, as Congress wraps up for the holidays. \u00a0  (Begin VT)\u00a0  KAMALA HARRIS (Vice President of the United States): I'm not giving up. The president's not giving up, and, frankly, the stakes are too high.\u00a0  (End VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Vice President Kamala Harris will tell us about the administration's priorities in the new year and what the scrutiny of her first year in office has taught her.\u00a0  (Begin VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think you're being set up to fail?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS: No, I don't believe I'm being set up to fail. I'm vice president of the United States. Anything that I handle is because it's a tough issue and it couldn't be handled at some other level.\u00a0  (End VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We talked policy and saw the personal side of the first woman, first black and first South Asian vice president.\u00a0  (Begin VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: What gets you fired up?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Injustice. Injustice.\u00a0  (End VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Plus, a Face the Nation holiday tradition. Our year-end correspondents panel returns to wrap up 2021 and look forward to 2022.\u00a0  It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\u00a0  Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.\u00a0  On this day after Christmas, we bring you a special conversation with Vice President Kamala Harris.\u00a0  We met up with her last week in her ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building for a wide-ranging conversation, everything from COVID, to voting rights, to the criticism that she has faced in her job.\u00a0  (Begin VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Medical experts are projecting that we could see as many as a million infections per day because of this new Omicron variant. Is our health care system prepared for what's coming?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We are prepared for it.\u00a0  And there's no question. There is a lot about this moment that is frustrating. But let's not forget our individual power to actually do something about it.\u00a0  Everyone has to get vaccinated. The vaccines are free. They are safe and they'll save your life.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're already seeing hospitals overwhelmed with Delta. Inflation is real. It's going to be with us as long as the pandemic dominates.\u00a0  As you know, the exhaustion is just with us all the time. When can you tell the American people this will end?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We have the power today to have an impact on tomorrow, and we can't shortchange the significance of that. We have the power today to go out and, if you've not been boosted, go get boosted, the power today to go and get vaccinated.\u00a0  And that will have an impact on where we end up tomorrow.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it the fault of the unvaccinated?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I don't think this is a moment to talk about fault.\u00a0  It -- it is no one's fault that this virus hit our shores or hit the world. I would not blame it on anyone in that way.\u00a0  But it is more about individual power and responsibility, and it's about the decisions, that everyone has the choice to make, no doubt. But it is clear that everyone has the ability to make a choice to save their lives and to prevent hospitalization if they get vaccinated and if they get the booster. And so I urge people to do that.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: This is going to be hard for the economy. Are you going to need to ask Congress for another relief package?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, let's talk about the economy.\u00a0  What is within our grasp? To pass Build Back Better. When we talk about the economy, the average person in America is going to measure the economy based on, can they actually just afford to get through the day and through the month? The cost of living, can they keep up with the cost of living, child care, eldercare, prescription drugs?\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the Build Back Better Act like it still has some life to it.\u00a0  As you know, Senator Joe Manchin said he's a no. You don't have the votes.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I'm not giving up. The president's not giving up. And, frankly, the stakes are too high.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: It is the cost of the bill that has led Senator Joe Manchin, at least publicly, to say it's actually going to hurt the economy. His argument is, it'll add to inflation, among many other things.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I think there is, without any question, room for discussion about what actually will be the impact to the economy.\u00a0  And objective, leading and highly respected economists are weighing in on this discussion to say, in fact, no.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: When you look at what's actually possible right now...\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yes.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: ... do you feel that Senator Manchin is playing fair with you?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I think the stakes are too high for this to be in any way about any specific individual. We have to -- you know, one of the things...\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a 50/50 Senate, though, so you need him.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: It is. I'm the tiebreaker. I'm the tie vote.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's -- exactly.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: In fact, the president and I joke.\u00a0  And when I leave one of our meetings to go break a tie, he says, \"Well, that's going to be a winning vote.\" Whenever I vote, we win. It's a -- it's a joke we have.\u00a0  (LAUGHTER)\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: But the stakes are so high.\u00a0  And we can't afford, in this moment of time, where we have an opportunity to do something so substantial in terms of public policy in America, to literally help families, I refuse to get caught up in the what might be personal politics, when the people who are waking up at 3:00 in the morning worried about how they're going to get by could care less about the politics of D.C.\u00a0  They just want us to fix things.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But the child care tax credit has already expired. How do you...\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We have to extend it.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: ... come up with...\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We have to extend it.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you do that without Senator Manchin?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: You don't give up. That's how we do it. We don't give up. That's how.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president has also put you in charge of voting rights.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yes I -- and I have asked, yes.\u00a0  There is so much about this fight for justice and the ideals of our democracy that are part of my DNA. You know, I have been meeting with prime ministers and presidents from around the world. One of my favorite interactions was with the now past Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel.\u00a0  She came over for breakfast. And we talked about everything that has to do with our relative security as nations and our priorities. And then she asked me about voting. She asked me about voting, and she knew what was going on here. And this is not a subject that was unique to my conversation with her, by the way, in terms of world leaders, because people around the world watch what we do as America.\u00a0  And right now, we're about to take ourselves off the map as a role model, if we let -- if we let people destroy one of the most important pillars of a democracy, which is free and fair elections.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about what's happening in state capitals around the country.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I am.\u00a0  I'm talking about that, and I'm talking about what's not happening in this Capitol in Washington, D.C., which is the passing of the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.\u00a0  This is literally about our standing in the world. It's about the integrity of our democracy. When our kids look back five, 10 years from now at this moment, it will be on our watch that we either stood for and fought for our democracy or not. And that -- I think that is all at stake right now.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you still have the reality of a 50/50 Senate...\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Correct.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have two senators who say they're not on board for changing the filibuster in order to try to push this through.\u00a0  So, how do you overcome that democratic reality of not having the votes and not having a clear path forward?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We will do and look at whatever is necessary to push for Congress to take this issue on.\u00a0  And we have to. We have to.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: A carve-out to the filibuster?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I'm not saying that.\u00a0  What I'm saying is that we are going to urge the United States Congress, and we have been, to examine the tools they have available ,to do what is necessary to fight for and retain the integrity of our voting system in America.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're open, though, to a carve-out to the filibuster to get there. ...\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I...\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You were when you ran for president on the issue of climate.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I...\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Are voting rights as important to you?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I believe that voting rights is one of the most significant issues that is facing us as individuals and as leaders today. There's no question, no question.\u00a0  Voting rights lead to every other right, every other right. And so we need to prioritize it as a nation. I think it's really important that, in this conversation about what's happening in Washington, D.C., on the issue of voting, that we not lose sight of the fact that there is one whole group of people, half of the United States Senate, who are refusing to even debate this issue.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to that point, you were just in the Senate.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yes.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president spent decades there. How come you can't pull someone across the aisle on this...\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We are trying.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: ... or manage Joe Manchin within your own party?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We are not going to give up on these issues.\u00a0  But you're right. It's a 50/50 Senate. It's a 50/50 Senate. And so -- but it has to be a combination of us, as an administration, but also everyone weighing in. And I'm glad we're having this conversation. I think we have to continue to elevate the conversation about voting rights.\u00a0  Given the daily grind that people are facing, this may not feel like an immediate or urgent matter, when, in fact, it is. And the more we have the opportunity to talk about it, the more I think people will see, yes, I don't want an America of the future for my kids to be in an America where we are -- are suppressing the right of the American people to vote.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you see is the biggest national security challenge confronting the U.S.? What is the thing that worries you and keeps you up at night?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Frankly, one of them is our democracy.\u00a0  There is, I think, no question in the minds of people who are foreign policy experts that the year 2021 is not the year 2000. You know, I think there's so much about foreign and domestic policy that, for example, was guided and prioritized based on September 11, 2001. And we are embarking on a new era, where the threats to our nation take many forms, including the threat of autocracies taking over and having outsized influence around the world.\u00a0  And so I go back to our -- our point about the need to fight for the integrity of our democracy. In addition, it is obviously about what we need to do in the climate crisis.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 100,000 Russian troops on the border with Ukraine.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yes.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Are we going to see a hot war in Europe in the next few weeks?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Well, we are having direct conversations with Russia.\u00a0  We are very clear that Russia should not invade the sovereignty of Ukraine, that we must stand up and we are standing up for its territorial integrity. We are working with our allies in that regard. And we've been very clear that we are prepared to issue sanctions like you've not seen before.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean sanctioning Vladimir Putin directly?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I'm not going to talk about specific sanctions, but we are making that clear to him. And we are in direct conversations.\u00a0  And we are also working very closely with our allies. And, again, let's use this issue as an example of the importance of the strength of those relationships.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But in the past, alongside allies, we've sanctioned. It's been punitive. It hasn't prevented anything. It hasn't stopped Vladimir Putin to date.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: And I will repeat that the type of sanctions that we're talking about are sanctions that we've not done before.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You said you were last in the room on the decision in Afghanistan to pull out. You've talked about not abandoning allies.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Mm-hmm.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel personal responsibility for the chaos of that withdrawal?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I fully supported the president's decision to -- after what was taking on the fact of being an endless war, of pulling American troops out.\u00a0  And I think it's really important to remember that the previous administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban, did not invite the Afghan government to be at the table, and negotiated a deal that required and promised as part of an agreement that we would pull out by the end of May.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: So, we were saddled with that responsibility based on an agreement between the United States and the Taliban. And so...\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You agreed to the -- extend it and not to break the agreement with the Taliban.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We made the decision that, if we were to break the agreement, it would have been a whole other situation.\u00a0  And, right now, I strongly believe that, had we broken that agreement, we would be talking about the war in Afghanistan and American troops in Afghanistan. And we're not talking about that. I don't regret that.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But I know, as a candidate, you pledged to protect the gains that were made for Afghan women.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yes. Yes. And I feel very strongly about that.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Many of those Afghan women are not in school today because the Taliban is in control.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Which is why we are working through the U.N. and doing what we need to do through our friends to provide humanitarian assistance, bypassing the Taliban, to make sure that we are supporting women and girls there.\u00a0  One of our big issues in terms of any conversations with the Taliban is exactly this point, which is the condition, the status and the treatment of women and girls, including, for girls, access to education, not to mention our concern about counterterrorism and what we need to do in terms of that threat.\u00a0  So, these are real issues, there's no question. The United States has been and continues to be, since the end of August, the biggest donor of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan..\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know a lot of that aid isn't able to make it into the people who need it because of the sanctions on the Taliban being in control.\u00a0  So it's just -- Afghan women, do you worry that they were abandoned by the United States, essentially?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I worry that the Taliban has not complied with what we know to be the appropriate treatment and the right treatment of girls and women.\u00a0  And that's why we are taking the posture that we are with the Taliban right now, because that is one of our greatest considerations and concerns.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think your biggest failure has been at this point?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: To not get out of D.C. more.\u00a0  (LAUGHTER)\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I mean -- and I actually mean that sincerely, for a number of reasons.\u00a0  A large part of the relationship that he and I have built has been being in this -- together in the same office for hours on end, doing Zooms or whatever, because we couldn't get out of D.C.\u00a0  And on issues that are about fighting for anything from voting rights, to child care, to one of the issues that I care deeply about, maternal health. Being with the people who are directly impacted by this work, listening to them, so that they, not some pundit, tells us what their priorities are, I think, is critically important.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: I have talked to some of your former Senate colleagues, and they say you have been given an impossible portfolio.\u00a0  Donna Brazile, the former Democratic strategist, said all the focus on turnover in your office is overblown, but you do need to renew and repurpose.\u00a0  Bakari Sellers said: \"Her portfolio is trash. You give someone a portfolio that is not meant for them to succeed.\"\u00a0  Do you think any of this is fair? Do you think you're being set up to fail?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: No, I don't believe I'm being set up to fail.\u00a0  But -- but...\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Because these are Democrats saying this.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: But, more important, I'm vice president of the United States. Anything that I handle is because it's a tough issue and it couldn't be handled at some other level.\u00a0  And there are a lot of big, tough issues that need to be addressed. And it has actually been part of my lifelong career to deal with tough issues. And this is no different.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think there is such scrutiny?\u00a0  I mean, women are always held to a different standard. That's just a fact. Is the fact that you're a woman and the fact that you are a minority in this office part of why there is such scrutiny?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I will leave that for others to deal with.\u00a0  I have a job to do. And I'm going to get that job done.\u00a0  Let me just tell you, if you talk about being the first or being \u2013 maybe it's because I am that, for the first time, maternal health is on the stage at the White House, where we're bringing people in from around the country to talk about maternal mortality, to talk about issues like postpartum care and why we should expand Medicaid coverage, so it's not just 60 days, but it's for a year, because that's how long she needs that assistance, and to do it because it's the right thing to do, regardless of your gender, regardless of your race.\u00a0  And it affects so many women around our country.\u00a0  (End VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We will have a lot more of our conversation with the vice president in one minute.\u00a0  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  Here's more of our conversation with Vice President Kamala Harris.\u00a0  (Begin VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: When you hear people start talking about 2024, do you feel that's disrespectful to you and to the president?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I think that there are so many issues that are present issues in 2021, that I just don't have the luxury of engaging in that.\u00a0  The pundits can sit back and do whatever they do.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel that what becomes possible is just going to dramatically change after 2022, since Republicans, many project, will be taking the majority?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We will see. We will see. I don't know. We will see.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't feel that calendar really pushing you to get things done in the year ahead, before the midterms?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I mean, I feel a great sense of urgency for a variety of reasons to do everything we do.\u00a0  And, really, it really does boil down to the fact that I have done a lot of work as it relates to children. A day in the life of a child is a very long time. Sense of urgency, right? What we need to do to get public transit, to improve public transit, because people are going to work on buses every day, and the buses are breaking down, sense of urgency, right?\u00a0  I can go down the list, and it really -- for me, the focus is on what wakes people up in the middle of the night. I call it the 3:00-in-the-morning issue. When you wake up at 3:00 in the morning, for most people, what's on their mind is, how are they going to pay their bills? How are they going to take care of the children? Are they going to have a roof over their head, right?\u00a0  These are real issues that affect people every day. They don't have the luxury of waiting about -- talk -- some chatter about what's going to happen in an election that's three years out. They don't.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But, for people -- they're going into their third year of this pandemic.\u00a0  You're talking about cost of living. Was it wrong to consider inflation transitory? I mean, these price spikes seem like they're going to be with us for a while.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We have to address the fact that we have got to deal with the fact that folks are paying for gas, paying for groceries, and are -- need solutions to it. So let's talk about that.\u00a0  Short-term solution includes what we need to do around the supply chain, right? So, we went to the ports of Los Angeles, Long Beach, Savannah, Georgia, and said, hey, guys, no more five days a week, eight hours a day; 24/7, let's move the products because people need their product \u2013 they need what they need.\u00a0  We're dealing with it in terms of the long term. And that's about what we need to do to pass Build Back Better. It strengthens our economy. What do we need to do in terms of bringing down the cost of living, right?\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that your top priority for the new year?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: It is one of them.\u00a0  I don't have the luxury of having just one.\u00a0  (LAUGHTER)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: A fair point. A fair point.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yes. Yes.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: People saw you, a flash of anger the other day, when you did that interview with Charlamagne.\u00a0  (Begin VT)\u00a0  CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD (Radio Talk Show Host): So, who's the real president of this country? Is it Joe Manchin or Joe Biden, Madam Vice President?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Come on, Charlamagne. Come on.\u00a0  CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD: I really -- I can't tell sometimes.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. It's Joe Biden.\u00a0  And I'm vice president. And my name is Kamala Harris. And the reality is, because we are in office, we do the things like the child tax credit, which is going to reduce black child poverty by 50 percent.\u00a0  (End VT)\u00a0  (CROSSTALK)\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Frustration.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Frustration.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yes.\u00a0  (LAUGHTER)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that frustration, we saw that in the Kavanaugh hearings.\u00a0  What gets you fired up?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Injustice. Injustice is just generally what will get me kind of -- it's -- I don't like unfairness.\u00a0  And that is one of the things that will kind of cause me to say, OK some things are fairly innocuous, but unfairness in a way that can be hurtful to someone, I -- that's why I became a prosecutor, you know?\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think you are judged fairly?\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: I will leave others to make that decision.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.\u00a0  VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Yes.\u00a0  (End VT)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Our full interview with the vice president is available on our Web site at FacetheNation.com.\u00a0  We will be right back.\u00a0  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're not able to watch the full Face the Nation, you can set your DVR, or we're available on demand.\u00a0  Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app.\u00a0  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with our annual CBS correspondents panel right here on Face the Nation.\u00a0  Stay with us.\u00a0  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.\u00a0  And our annual CBS News correspondents' year-end roundtable.\u00a0  This year we're joined by some of our beat reporters here in the Washington bureau, including CBS News senior White House and political correspondent Ed O'Keefe, Jan Crawford is CBS News chief legal correspondent, Weijia Jiang is also CBS News senior White House correspondent, CBS News national security correspondent David Martin is also here, and, finally, Nikole Killion, who is CBS News congressional correspondent.\u00a0  So it's good to have you all and see your bright, shiny faces in person.\u00a0  Nikole, this has been just eight months of infighting and tangling over the Build Back Better spending bill that the White House has really made a signature issue for the president.\u00a0  Is it dead on arrival or is this just on life support in 2022?\u00a0  NIKOLE KILLION: I think life support is a better way to look at it. I don't think Democrats are going to give this up without a fight, even with some resistance from Joe Manchin because the reality is, he has been resisting all along and expressing concerns, whether it's about the impact that Build Back Better could have on the economy, could have on inflation, that is something he reiterated towards the end of this year.\u00a0  So, while right now it looks like Democrats are kind of at this stalemate, again, I think you will see Democratic leadership really try to prod him over these next couple of weeks to get on board.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But doesn't this hurt Democrats, the longer this drags on?\u00a0  ED O'KEEFE: I think what's hurting them more than anything is the focus on the process of it all, which they, themselves, have allowed to be the focus by virtue of the arguments they've had in public, the incredible disagreements that they can't seem to get over, and the fact that the president engages behind the scenes, but has done necessarily as much publicly to try to get the warring factions of his party together to say, let's just get a deal.\u00a0  Whatever comes of this Build Back Better debate may not be enough when you ran in 2020 on a promise to do so much more and yet weren't able to secure a big enough majority to make it happen. So, the threat for them is a depressed and confused and upset base of support that may not feel compelled to show up if this infighting continues to bleed into 2022 too much.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0  ED O'KEEFE: And if they remain so focused on all of that and don't get out in the country to try to sell and explain it to skeptical Americans.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0  WEIJIA JIANG: And remember who is at the center of this, right, and that's Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who has a lot less to lose political than the others.\u00a0  ED O'KEEFE: Sure.\u00a0  WEIJIA JIANG: Because he comes from Virginia, a deeply red state, and he's aware of that. So, again, when you're talking about the political ramifications of this, he is probably thinking of that less, and might even be thinking the other way, of how a no vote could garner even more support in this state.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But what he has also argued is this would hurt the economy. On the other hand, President Biden has argued this is just absolutely a requirement for the kind of economic recovery and rebuilding he says is necessary.\u00a0  So, what's the strategy if you can't get $2 trillion through?\u00a0  WEIJIA JIANG: Well, I think the problem is that, you know, when you look at West Virginia, and you look at how poor it is, when you look at all the levels of unemployment and how much the need is there for some of the measures in the social spending plan, the poison pill is attached to it, and that is the president's sweeping climate proposals. So perhaps, if there was a way to decouple them, Manchin would be more on board. But I do not think that that is something that the White House would be willing to entertain because it's really their only and maybe last shot at passing these huge climate change proposals that he would like.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: West Virginia native yourself, of course.\u00a0  But, Ed, you know, it is the Federal Reserve's job to control inflation. Let's be clear here. But it doesn't matter, the commander-in-chief will get the blame for it if the spending continues to spike.\u00a0  Does the White House believe that the price spikes are actually a short- term issue?\u00a0  ED O'KEEFE: Well, they thought that certainly at the end of the summer into the fall. But I think if you look at what the Fed has said since, they now understand that this is going to continue further into next year. There's going to be this kind of, you know, once in a lifetime, perhaps, economic disruption that leads to a long and painful and expensive reshuffling.\u00a0  And when things are bad economically, they take it out on those in charge, and that's Democrats. So you add that plus the historic nature of a mid- term when the party in power usually loses seats any way --\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0  ED O'KEEFE: And they know they could be in for a real shellacking.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: David Martin, you know, I was speaking to a White House official the other day who was talking about the holiday season and saying Vladimir Putin may be making himself known to the world. Do we see a hot war in Europe at the beginning of 2022?\u00a0  DAVID MARTIN: Well, the estimate is that once the ground freezes so that Russian tanks and personnel carriers can get good traction, they'll be -- they'll be liable to go from all those western districts of Russia, into eastern Ukraine.\u00a0  I mean what Putin is trying to do here is basically walk back history by pulling Ukraine back into the Russian sphere of influence. And he's made these demands, like he needs a legally binding guarantee that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO. I mean surely he knows that's a non-starter.\u00a0  So, the question here is, is that just his going-in position, or is that his pretext for an invasion once his demands are turned down.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we went through a part of this back in 2014 when Vladimir Putin annexed part of Ukraine. He did it in a different way last time.\u00a0  Why so overt this time with a military build-up?\u00a0  DAVID MARTIN: Well, there's a -- much more substantial military force waiting for him. Ukraine has been getting military equipment from the U.S. So it requires a bigger operation. Whether they launch that operation, of course, remains to be seen.\u00a0  But the U.S. clearly has intelligence that goes beyond the simple fact that these units are gathering together there in Russia. They know something about what the Russian military staff is planning. And what they intend to do with those forces. And right now they are clearly making the preparations, making the plans, to go into eastern Ukraine.\u00a0  Whether or not it happens, Vladimir Putin pay not know yet.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And the U.S. intelligence says he hasn't made up his mind.\u00a0  But, of course, this is being watched because it's a test case of what President Biden will do and how he will respond to an adversary. And on the heels of Afghanistan, which looked quite chaotic, this is a big test.\u00a0  DAVID MARTIN: Yes. It is. I think one of the biggest dangers for 2022 is that countries like China, Russia, Iran are going to look at what happened in Afghanistan and decide the U.S. is a spent force and we can roll. And that's not a good mindset to be in.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: No.\u00a0  Jan.\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: I just have to say, every time we do these annual correspondent panels, David says something that, you know, makes my heart stop.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Terrible.\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: Yes. We're all kind of running around chasing shiny objects, and David just says, listen, I mean it's -- every year. Every year.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Every year.\u00a0  DAVID MARTIN: Every year.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you know what's scarry is he's usually right.\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: Oh, no, I know, believe me.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Jan, in terms of predictions, the big one that I remember you making just a few weeks back about the future of Roe vs. Wade in the Supreme Court was that we won't really know the answer to the question on the court's direction until maybe June.\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: Right. I mean and history is a guide for that as well if you want to look back.\u00a0  In 1992, which is the last time the Supreme Court had a frontal assault on Roe vs. Wade, they were at the brink of overturning it then. They had five votes to overturn it and then, at the last minute, of course, Justice Kennedy -- former Justice Kennedy switched his vote to preserve it. So, while there may be five votes now, and I suspect that there are, anything can happen between now and June.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: So those who are saying it will be overturned are perhaps making too early of a call?\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: It's -- it may well be overturned. I would not be surprised.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: And what does that scenario look like then? We just have a patchwork of different states with different laws?\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: Right. You know, the court would take the position that, as conservatives have long maintained, since Roe was released, that it's a lawless opinion with no basis in the Constitution. There's not a right to an abortion in the Constitution. That would mean that the court would be neutral, and the Constitution is neutral on the issue of abortion, so it would go back to the states.\u00a0  And the legislators, which are closer to the voters, as the argument, would then decide whether to allow abortion, what restrictions to allow. The political process would happen in the individual states or in Congress to, you know, take the court out of the issue of abortion, basically, and let the state legislatures decide.\u00a0  ED O'KEEFE: To Jan's point, keep an eye on the states. We're going into a year when you're going to have dozens of competitive governor's races and I would argue, at least in recent history, this will probably be the most consequential cycle for governors' races for a lot of reasons. One, because abortion may very well become an urgent issue. Two, because voting rights remains a concern and there are ways in the states to either party to restrict or expand access.\u00a0  But for the biggest reason, perhaps, if certain presidential battleground states swing towards control of one party or another, they are potentially setting up the playing field going into 2024. You have big races in places like Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, which were all deciding factors in 2020. If Republicans take full control of those, there will be pressure put on them by a certain former president to put some things in place that would make it harder.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: When you go to those state capitals, Nikole, I mean, what is it, 19 states, 33 laws that make it harder for Americans to vote. The White House points to that. They look at the anniversary of the January 6th siege at the Capitol and they say politically, or at least optically, they're going to start talking about building momentum for voting rights.\u00a0  Does anything actually get passed in 2022?\u00a0  NIKOLE KILLION: I mean, again, I think it comes down to the numbers. It is going to be a difficult thread to weave, but, as I said, I think there will be a very deliberate effort to try to move forward on it if they can.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House wants to get caught trying, Weijia?\u00a0  WEIJIA JIANG: Oh, absolutely. We were just talking to some White House folks who said, you know, they were realistic about this as well. And they know that it is going to be a struggle. The problem is the president knows, also, how critical this issue is for the black community. He's aware of the promises that he's made. So, he has to show that he is at least doing everything he can to get it done.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: And, David, all of this gets intertwined into January 6th and the insurrection. When you look at what's happening right now and the folks you talk to at the Pentagon, do they believe the biggest national security threat is internal or external?\u00a0  DAVID MARTIN: Internal. No question.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: (INAUDIBLE).\u00a0  DAVID MARTIN: Military people will say that to you. The biggest threat to the United States of America is the reincarnation of January 6th. And if we lose our democracy, what the heck does all that other stuff matter. Who cares about hypersonic weapons if you don't have a democracy? So, yes.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Jen, when you look to the courts and this question of faith in our institutions, when we look around the Capitol, there's a lack of faith in a lot of institutions.\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: True, although --\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that still there in the court?\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: No, I mean I think that -- yes, I think there is still faith in the United States Supreme Court historically and even recently. It's been the institution that polls the best, way better than Congress and certainly the press. And, you know --\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You picked like the two lowest there, Jan.\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: I did. Yes. Used car salesmen are also there, and lawyers. But the court has -- and, you know, I think that that is the way the court has conducted itself, you know, and -- and Justice Breyer has been a big proponent of that. The court's senior liberal, going out, talking to groups, and expressing, you know, his strong belief that you see that it's like this beacon of democracy. And, you know, that gets to the question as, how much longer is Justice Breyer going to be around on that Supreme Court? He may very well retire this year. There's been a lot of pressure, of course, from people on the left that he would step down while President Biden could nominate and have his replacement confirmed.\u00a0  So, you know, there's a lot we could talk about, about the court and its legitimacy. So far it's definitely declined, but it hasn't taken the kind of hits that other people have. Some people have suggested if they overturn Roe, that would further weaken its legitimacy.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Justice Sotomayor certainly indicated that.\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: But on the right, they have just the different view, that if they uphold Roe, the, quote, lawless decision, that that would undermine it.\u00a0  So, you know, those arguments cut both ways as well. It dipped after Bush v. Gore, but then it ticked back up again.\u00a0  But it's important, as Justice Breyer points out, the Supreme Court doesn't have a standing army to go enforce its decisions. It relies on the public's confidence and trust.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do we assume that this is a Republican-controlled Senate, Republican-controlled House in 2022?\u00a0  NIKOLE KILLION: I think Republicans assume that. And that is what they are working towards.\u00a0  I mean, look, on the House side, it's really not that hard. There are only five seats they have to flip to get back in power. And so very often you will hear House Republicans even referring to Speaker Pelosi already as a lame-duck speaker. So they're measuring the drapes, OK.\u00a0  You know, in the Senate, it's a little trickier because of this split dynamic. Certainly it's possible, I'd say at this stage in the game, where it could go either way. But I think, you know, Mitch McConnell is there to stay. And I think whether this -- he is in the majority or the minority, I think you will see him continue to take that role in the forefront. But, definitely, history is not necessarily on the side of Democrats this go round --\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0  NIKOLE KILLION: And many of them have acknowledged, you know, that they do face some difficult head winds going forward.\u00a0  WEIJIA JIANG: And I think it's difficult to imagine the president accomplishing much on his agenda when it was already so difficult with Democrats in control. And I think that actually exposed how much conflict there is within that party. And I don't know that they had anticipated it being done in the open in the way that it was.\u00a0  But even when you look at all of the president's successes, it came with a lot of public fighting. When it came to the American Rescue Plan, or even the bipartisan infrastructure law that just passed, you saw how moderates and progressives really butted heads and had to, you know, had to put that aside. But it was still out there. Everybody saw it.\u00a0  NIKOLE KILLION: I don't (ph) think (ph) many Democrat leaders argue, I mean, that's the sausage making process in Washington, right? I mean, yes, we could all be kumbaya, but on the same token there are some differences. And we have seen that evolve in the party over the last couple of years. At the end of the day, they have gotten some things done, maybe not everything, but, you know, it's a work in progress.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0  WEIJIA JIANG: Because the party has evolved so much. So I think that \u2013 you know, we'll see.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We are going to take a quick break right now and we will be back with more from our panel.\u00a0  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with more from our correspondents' panel. And this is when we ask you to do the thing you hate doing, which is predict the future, but they are informed predictions, I know.\u00a0  Jan, what is it that you see happening in 2022?\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: Well, I normally predict that Alabama will win the national championship. So, you know, that's getting kind of too easy to predict.\u00a0  So -- but I'm going to focus on the court and the issue of abortion. I am - - I predict that the supreme court will overturn Roe vs. Wade. Say that the Constitution and the court is going to be neutral on the issue of abortion, which would send that back to the states to decide how they wanted to handle it, a specific state by state issue. The vote could well be 6-3, with the chief justice joining them, five more conservative justices, after failing to put forward a more incremental approach.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: That would have huge implications?\u00a0  JAN CRAWFORD: Yes. No, I mean it would radically shift the debate, which -- in the confirmation process for the Supreme Court justices, it would shift all of that back to the states. It would also mean that states legislators could no longer play politics with the issue of abortion, knowing that the Supreme Court would overturn it.\u00a0  So, all of a sudden, in the state legislatures, those positions that politicians now are taking to pander to the left, or more specifically to the right, knowing the court will step in, all of that now is real. And so they will actually have to make real decisions based on what their voters want, or they're out of office.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: David.\u00a0  DAVID MARTIN: I'm going to duck the tough one of whether Putin will invade Ukraine or not. If he hasn't made up his mind, I shouldn't have to make up mine.\u00a0  There are two mysteries out there, what's causing Havana syndrome, this -- these debilitating symptoms that hit Americans overseas, that seem to be the subject of some kind of directed energy attack, and where are these unexplained aerial phenomenon we call UFOs, these drone-like objects that show up in the middle of U.S. military exercises. Where the heck are they coming from? So, I'm predicting one of those two will be solved in 2022.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll hold you to it, David.\u00a0  DAVID MARTIN: OK.\u00a0  WEIJIA JIANG: I can't follow that.\u00a0  You know, I've been thinking a lot about the president's goals ever since he took office and how a curveball like omicron can just set everything back. And I do predict that things are going to get worse before they get better with the pandemic. And I don't think that the president will implement any lockdowns or restrictions that we saw in 2020, which is something that we've been talking about a lot because, you know, what can you do if you can't force someone to get the vaccine and the virus continues to spin out of control, is he going to, you know, have another 15 days to slow the spread? And I think the answer is no because he is so committed to his economic agenda and he understands what a shutdown would mean.\u00a0  So, I think it will be up to states and local officials to do that, but I don't predict any federal guidelines for shutdowns in 2022.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: And even the governors are hesitant because of the political cost at this point.\u00a0  WEIJIA JIANG: Correct. Yes.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Ed, it's up to you to protect yourself. All of us who protect ourselves.\u00a0  What is your prediction of 2022?\u00a0  ED O'KEEFE: I'm going to tiptoe slightly in the direction of what you and David cover with this by predicting that the president, once we get clear of the worst of this, and once he's able to globe-trot a little more, will make trips in the coming year to Latin-America and Africa.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't put Ireland on there?\u00a0  ED O'KEEFE: I did not put Ireland on there because that one's going to happen no matter what. By Latin America and Africa, and people may wonder why. They have to remember, everything this president does has China in the background. And this would be designed as an attempt to go to those parts of the world and say, stick with democracy, stick with the United States, avoid the Chinese influence in investment that's coming your way and remember that we stand with you as well.\u00a0  President Trump didn't go to Africa. There's been a belief in the Biden administration that such a trip needs to happen sooner rather than later. Latin America as well, with so many struggling democracies in that part of the world going would send a big signal and he would try to meet with some leaders form that region. But those are two trips they would probably like to make and I predict he will make.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: Nikole.\u00a0  NIKOLE KILLION: I think in terms of the mid-terms, I think one dynamic to watch, and in covering politics for many years now, we keep talking about the increased number of women who are running and people of color. And I think especially when you look at black women in particular, I think you will see a barrier being broken, whether that's in the Senate or whether that's in the governor's mansion. And I think what's jaw-dropping is there has never, never been a black woman elected as governor in U.S. history. You have five running, Stacey Abrams, you have candidates in South Carolina, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, Iowa. There are a number of lieutenant governors. We'll see Winsome Sears be inaugurated in Virginia, the first African-American woman lieutenant governor for that state, a Republican.\u00a0  I also think, you know, for all of the talk of having the first black president, Barack Obama, having the first black vice president and vice president of south Asian descent, I think sometimes people forget that there's a deficit now in the Senate. As diverse as Congress is right now, there's no black women in the Senate. So you have a number of candidates, Val Demings, Cheri Beasley and others who are running. But I do think those are two spaces to watch in the mid-terms in 2022.\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, we will be watching.\u00a0  Thanks to all of you for joining us. Have great holidays.\u00a0  ED O'KEEFE: You too.\u00a0  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. And we want to wish you a very happy and healthy new year. We'll see you in 2022.\u00a0  For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. \u00a0 ",

Now, here in the U.S., COVID-19 cases are setting new records, seemingly out of control. The Delta variant still accounts for most new infections, but the ultra-contagious Omicron is now in at least 43 states.\r\n \r\n\t(Begin VT)\r\n \r\n\tJOE BIDEN (President of the United States): Omicron is here. It's going to start to spread much more rapidly at the beginning of the year.\r\n \r\n\t(End VT)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: The scenes are familiar, long lines for testing, overwhelmed hospitals and medical personnel, and revised plans from business and some schools to go back to virtual.\r\n \r\n\tStill, officials are adamant: It may feel like deja vu, but it's not. We have tools to protect people, so use them.\r\n \r\n\t(Begin VT)\r\n \r\n\tPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: If you're vaccinated and you had your booster shot, you're protected from severe illness and death, period.\r\n \r\n\t(End VT)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins, for the latest on our COVID winter wave. And, as always, we will check in with former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb.\r\n \r\n\tPlus: the other surge in the U.S.; 100,000 Americans are dead from opioids this year. We will ask the new administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Anne Milgram, about what her agency is doing to stem the tide.\r\n \r\n\tFinally, we will have a dramatic look at the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan from former President Ghani's top aide, Hamdullah Mohib, who fled that country alongside Ghani as Kabul fell.\r\n \r\n\t(Begin VT)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: There's reports that you had to fly at low altitude because you were trying to avoid the Americans knowing that you were fleeing.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB (Former Afghanistan National Security Adviser): Absolutely.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: why?\r\n \r\n\tMOHIB: Trust was gone. There was no trust.\r\n \r\n\t(End VT)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.\r\n \r\n\tGood morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. With less than a week to go until Christmas, it's tough to be effusive with holiday cheer, as a COVID tidal wave builds and is likely to worsen due to holiday gatherings.\r\n \r\n\tOfficials around the world are struggling to learn more about the Omicron variant. What they do know is that your best protection is to get vaccinated and boosted.\r\n \r\n\tMark Strassmann begins our coverage.\r\n \r\n\t(Begin VT)\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): Omicron's alarm bells ring out across America.\r\n \r\n\tIn California.\r\n \r\n\tWOMAN: When I look around the corner ahead, what I see is a deluge of Omicron.\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: Ohio.\r\n \r\n\tGOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE (R-Ohio): People are gathering together. Our medical personnel have just been slammed. All of this constitutes this perfect storm.\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: And especially New York.\r\n \r\n\tGOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL (D-New York): I believe it's going to get even stronger and more virulent. And we are in for a rough ride this winter season.\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: New Yorkers stampede for testing. COVID cases nearly doubled in one week. Twice this week, the state set the highest single-day count of new cases since the pandemic's early months.\r\n \r\n\tWOMAN: I feel like everyone has COVID, and I'm just trying to be safe, you know? This week has been crazy.\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: Two years into the virus, America's seeing a run on testing once again. We're left to make our own COVID calculus, evaluating personal risk and exposure moment to moment.\r\n \r\n\tAmerica's bruising from a one-two punch, Delta and Omicron, the newest variant about to become dominant, its severity unclear, its contagiousness overt. Cases more than double every few days. Experts warn about a potential tsunami of sickness.\r\n \r\n\tPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: For unvaccinated, we are looking at a winner of severe illness and death for unvaccinated, for themselves, their families and the hospitals they will soon overwhelm.\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: Another milestone in mourning. Bells told Thursday for 800,000 Americans dead from the virus. That's almost the population of San Francisco. Roughly 1,200 Americans still die daily from the virus.\r\n \r\n\tWOMAN: Today was pretty hard because it's my third one this week.\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: One of many American hospitals buckling under caseloads.\r\n \r\n\tThe NFL is reeling from a blindside blitz of outbreaks, three of this weekend's games postponed for a couple of days. The NBA, the NHL and the NCAA are also playing defense to keep COVID from spreading. Multiple apply that risk of community spread on college campuses. On many, COVID has exploded again, just in time for the holidays, as infected students head home for winter break.\r\n \r\n\t(End VT)\r\n \r\n\tMARK STRASSMANN: With Christmas next weekend, more than 100 million of us will travel at least 50 miles over the next few days.\r\n \r\n\tSo many people are sick from COVID. Everyone is sick of COVID. And home for the holidays has an irresistible appeal, but an undeniable risk -- Margaret.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Our Mark Strassmann in Atlanta.\r\n \r\n\tU.S. health officials are closely watching Omicron cases in the United Kingdom for signs as to what could be headed here.\r\n \r\n\tCBS News foreign correspondent Imtiaz Tyab reports from London.\r\n \r\n\tIMTIAZ TYAB: Margaret, good morning.\r\n \r\n\tWell, London really now is the epicenter of Omicron infections right across the U.K., with over half from the new variants, all of which is wreaking havoc nearly everywhere.\r\n \r\n\t(Begin VT)\r\n \r\n\tIMTIAZ TYAB (voice-over): Britain is convulsing under the strain caused by Omicron. In Central London, violence broke out between police and anti- vaxxers outside Parliament, where demonstrators were demanding an end to vaccine mandates and other COVID measures.\r\n \r\n\tThe address comes as chilling new government figures show England has recorded the highest number of children admitted to hospital with COVID since the start of the pandemic; 65 under-18s were hospitalized with COVID on December the 12th, with more than half just 5 years old and under.\r\n \r\n\tWOMAN: They're a lot younger than the patients that we used to -- that we had in the first and second surge.\r\n \r\n\tIMTIAZ TYAB: As record numbers of new infections threatened to strain the U.K.'s already struggling national health system, Britain's booster shot program has been turbocharged.\r\n \r\n\tEvery minute, 100 people are being boosted in London alone.\r\n \r\n\tMAN: So, the waiting time is two-and-a-half to three hours.\r\n \r\n\tIMTIAZ TYAB: Despite the long lines in places, few here were complaining.\r\n \r\n\tIs that why you're getting your booster?\r\n \r\n\tWOMAN: Yes, definitely, peace of mind, really, if anything else.\r\n \r\n\tIMTIAZ TYAB: Across Europe, Omicron concerns have led to a wave of new COVID restrictions, including in the Netherlands, where holiday shoppers were given just a few hours' notice the country was going into a full national lockdown until at least mid-January.\r\n \r\n\tCaretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the country will have -- quote -- \"another Christmas that is completely different from what we would like,\" calling it very bad news.\r\n \r\n\tBut there is a glimmer of hope. The first at-home treatment for COVID has been given to patients in the U.K. as part of a major Oxford University study. Molnupiravir will be tested on 10,000 people at risk of serious illness, a move and a medication being described as a game-changer.\r\n \r\n\t(End VT)\r\n \r\n\tIMTIAZ TYAB: Now, officially, Britain is still open for business, but it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas plans are once again in disarray, as people right up and down the country are canceling plans because of Omicron -- Margaret.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Imtiaz, thank you.\r\n \r\n\tWe go now to the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Francis Collins.\r\n \r\n\tGood morning.\r\n \r\n\tAnd before we begin, Doctor, I want to note that this is your last day as director. You're not retiring, but you are stepping aside from NIH, so thank you for your service to the country.\r\n \r\n\tDR. FRANCIS COLLINS (Director, National Institutes of Health): Thanks, Margaret. It's great to be with you this morning.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: As you step aside, it seems like the virus, though, is not going along with you.\r\n \r\n\tIn fact, this Omicron variant seems to be raging around the world. Did you see this mutation coming? And is our health system prepared for what is about to hit?\r\n \r\n\tDR. FRANCIS COLLINS: Yes, this is a big challenge.\r\n \r\n\tIt's a brand-new version, and it is so different that it has the properties to potentially be invasive of the vaccines and the other measures that we've taken. I'm glad to say it's not totally successful at that.\r\n \r\n\tA big message for today is, if you've had vaccines and a booster, you're very well-protected against Omicron causing you severe disease. So, anybody listening to this who's in that 60 percent of Americans who are eligible for a booster, but haven't yet gotten one, this is the week to do it. Do not wait.\r\n \r\n\tWhat do we know about Omicron? We know that it's very contagious. You saw what happened in South Africa initially, then in Europe and now in the U.S. It's doubling about every two to four days, and we're going to see that number of cases go up pretty steeply over the course of the next couple of weeks.\r\n \r\n\tAnd that's obviously something that's going to require all of us to double down on the things that we know we should be doing in terms of being safe, wearing masks, avoiding indoor gatherings of other people who aren't vaccinated.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tYou predicted a few days ago we could see a million cases a day of Omicron infection. Is the health system prepared?\r\n \r\n\tDR. FRANCIS COLLINS: Big question is, are those million cases going to be sick enough to need health care and especially hospitalization?\r\n \r\n\tThis is a big remaining question, Margaret, is this virus actually not quite as capable of causing severe disease? There are some encouraging signs in South Africa that there's not as much in the way of hospitalization, even though the virus just ran crazy through the area around Johannesburg.\r\n \r\n\tBut that's their population. Ours may be different. I don't know what this virus will do to somebody who's unvaccinated and maybe has a medical condition or is over 65. Just sort of holding our breath to see how severe the cases will be.\r\n \r\n\tThere's certainly some chance, though, that our hospitals are going to be pretty stressed. They already are with Delta, of course. Government is prepared now to start sending out surge teams as needed to places that are really hit hard, and the president's going to have more to say about that in a speech on Tuesday.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Among the unvaccinated are those who are not eligible yet, the very young.\r\n \r\n\tIn South Africa, we did see a high number of infections in children and hospitalizations. Do you have any insight into why?\r\n \r\n\tDR. FRANCIS COLLINS: That's another really good question. I was on the phone for an hour-and-a-half yesterday with the South African public health people looking at some of that data.\r\n \r\n\tYou know, it's not absolutely clear what's going on there. It's also possible that, because people are really worried about kids, they're more likely to get put in the hospital in South Africa just as a precaution. I'm not absolutely convinced that the evidence says that Omicron is more dangerous than Delta was.\r\n \r\n\tBut we have got to watch that closely. Obviously, we don't want to see that happen in our country as well. And, certainly, kids who haven't yet been vaccinated -- and, of course, that's any under 5, really, we ought to think about surrounding them with vaccinated people to keep them from getting infected.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Would you advise people against traveling this winter? I mean, what you're talking about, it almost seems inevitable that people will get ill.\r\n \r\n\tDR. FRANCIS COLLINS: Well, certainly, this virus is going to be all around us. I'm not going to say you shouldn't travel, but you should do so very carefully.\r\n \r\n\tAnd I think airplanes, now with required masking, probably being on an airplane is a fairly safe place to be. But think about how you're going to get there and how you can make sure you're safe along the way. And that certainly means, if you're not vaccinated, I would say travel is really not a great idea, because you are in a very vulnerable place now with Omicron.\r\n \r\n\tIf you are vaccinated and boosted, wear your mask when you're in any kind of public place. You don't know who might be around you might actually be infected without being even aware of their symptoms, because Omicron can do that too. Just do so with great -- careful.\r\n \r\n\tAnd particularly avoid those large indoor gatherings with a lot of people where sometimes caution gets thrown to the winds. You know, people are listening to this, Margaret, and they're all going, I am so sick of hearing this.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tDR. FRANCIS COLLINS: And I am too.\r\n \r\n\tBut the virus is not sick of us, and it is still out there looking for us, and we've got to double down on these things if we're going to get through the next few months.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: But as people learn to live or manage around this, they are increasingly reliant on the testing that the administration has emphasized we all need to rely on as sort of a regular staple in our lives.\r\n \r\n\tDr. Fauci said this week we're getting information that not all of the diagnostic tests will be accurate with Omicron. So, for families who want to gather and test ahead of time, which tests work?\r\n \r\n\tDR. FRANCIS COLLINS: Well, FDA is working on that intensively right now.\r\n \r\n\tAnd I will say with some pride NIH is deeply engaged in helping out with that, and I think in the next few days we'll have more definitive answers about that. Right now, I'm pretty reassured by the early evidence that the commonly used tests that you can get in the pharmacy that allow you to do testing at home are probably going to be OK.\r\n \r\n\tSo, hold tight on that. There are a few of these so-called PCR tests, actually ones that are not in very heavy use, that may not work for Omicron, and those are posted on the FDA Web site.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: We keep hearing it'll be different this time because we do have tools that work.\r\n \r\n\tOne of the things we did...\r\n \r\n\tDR. FRANCIS COLLINS: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: ... hear, though, is that there's really only one of the available monoclonal antibodies that seems to be effective for those who are sick with COVID.\r\n \r\n\tWhat does that mean in terms of taking tools out of the tool chest? Do we have enough supply of the only one that works? If someone gets sick, do they need to ask for it by name?\r\n \r\n\tDR. FRANCIS COLLINS: Yes, that's a really good question.\r\n \r\n\tIt is the GSK Vir monoclonal antibody that still sticks to the spike protein that Omicron has. Remember this -- I'm holding up my virus here. Those spikes are what the antibody has to stick to, and the Omicron version of the spike is just different enough that some of the other monoclonals don't stick. This one does.\r\n \r\n\tThere is a big push to increase the production of those. And, obviously, we're going to have to be careful to save that particular monoclonal for the people at really high risk, because they're the ones who are going to benefit most from it.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Supply and preparedness, we will watch that.\r\n \r\n\tThank you very much, Doctor. And good luck to you in your, not retirement, but your new line of work.\r\n \r\n\tDR. FRANCIS COLLINS: Well, thank you very much.\r\n \r\n\tAnd a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Merry Christmas.\r\n \r\n\tFace the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to former FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member, Dr. Scott Gottlieb.\r\n \r\n\tGood morning to you, Doctor.\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Good morning.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: The administration and certainly Dr. Collins really issuing some warnings there to take this seriously.\r\n \r\n\tThey still, even though Omicron was discovered nearly a month ago, don't seem to have a lot of answers to big questions. Does what you've seen so far indicate that this will cause a more severe illness?\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There's no indication that it causes more severe illness.\r\n \r\n\tWhat we've seen in South Africa, in particular, is a decoupling between the cases and hospitalizations. So, hospitalizations are down about 30 percent relative to cases, and we're probably not measuring all the cases in South Africa. We're probably only picking up a small fraction.\r\n \r\n\tAnd more severe cases requiring ICU admissions are down 80 percent relative to past waves in cases versus ICU admissions, so it does appear to be a less severe illness. Now, a lot of people believe, including myself, that the reason why it's manifesting as a less severe illness is probably because we have baseline immunity in the population.\r\n \r\n\tProbably around 80 percent of Americans and 90 percent of South Africans have some level of immunity, either from prior infection or through vaccination. So even though we're still getting infected because this is spreading through immune evasion, it's spreading by evading the immunity that we've acquired. We have some baseline immunity that protects us from getting very sick.\r\n \r\n\tAnd that's, in fact, what you're probably seeing in terms of these hospitalization statistics.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: But that takes us to the unvaccinated or ineligible.\r\n \r\n\tAs we said, you sit on the board of Pfizer. We learned this week that when it comes to their vaccine, for those under the age of 5, that it's going to take more time. You had been predicting first quarter of 2022 for young children to be vaccinated. Can you level-set for parents? How much longer do we have to wait?\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It depends on what the circumstances are.\r\n \r\n\tThat base case is now getting pushed out to the second quarter of 2022. So, what we've done, what Pfizer did was test a significantly lower dose in young children, in the toddlers. It's a 3-microgram dose, compared to a 10- microgram dose that's being used in children 5 to 12, and a 30-microgram dose in teenagers and adults.\r\n \r\n\tAnd the reason to go with a substantially lower dose is, you're very focused on tolerability in young children. You don't want to have vaccine- related side effects, like injection site reactions, pain, fevers. And so they test at very low doses to try to achieve a very tolerable vaccine.\r\n \r\n\tNow, in 6 months to 2 years, that low dose produced a comparable effect in terms of the immune response when compared to 16-to-25-year-olds. And what you're measuring is antibody response. So, the antibody response in the very young children was comparable to the antibody response we see in 16- to-25 year olds.\r\n \r\n\tBut in 2 to 4, it was less. And so what the company is doing right now is going back and extending the trial and looking at three doses, to see if three full doses -- and we know this is going to be a three-dose vaccine -- regardless whether three doses produces a comparable level of immune response, compared to the 16-to-25 year olds. We believe it will. I believe it will.\r\n \r\n\tBut I also think that if we start to see bad outcomes in kids -- hopefully, we don't. But if we see kids getting in trouble with Omicron, I do believe FDA will be in a position to make an earlier authorization on the basis of the data we have right now, because even that lower antibody response in the 2-to-4-year-olds is still providing some baseline immunity that should protect them from more severe outcomes from this disease.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: And that could be key because, as Dr. Collins said, he still doesn't have a good answer as to why there were those larger infections among small children in South Africa.\r\n \r\n\tBack here, we've been talking for months now, Doctor, about learning to live with COVID. But now we've got this Delta wave and the overlay of Omicron on top of it. Do we need to put the brakes on the return to normal?\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think people are really tired of living diminished lives from COVID generally. And you're seeing that in terms of what people are doing.\r\n \r\n\tThey're reengaging activity that we know are going to be conducive to the spread of this virus. Omicron really has thrown a curveball here. I think that this is a temporary incident. I think Omicron is going to blow its way through the population probably very quickly, when you look at what happened in South Africa and even what's happening in the U.K. right now, where it's moving very fast.\r\n \r\n\tBut we do face a hard four to six weeks ahead of us, as this moves through the population. I think it is prudent, especially for people who are going to be around vulnerable individuals, to take added precautions heading into the holidays.\r\n \r\n\tTry to use testing. Make sure you're boosted. Take precautions within your settings and your social settings as well. Use the high-quality masks when you go out. I don't -- a lot of people don't want to be a link in a chain of transmission that could get to a vulnerable individual, either a young child or an older individual, even if they themselves know that there is significantly less risk from a bad outcome from this virus.\r\n \r\n\tSo, we should be prudent over the next four to six weeks.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Being prudent means testing before you go into those family settings.\r\n \r\n\tYou heard Dr. Collins say: Stay tuned. We'll tell you which tests work.\r\n \r\n\tDo you have any indication which ones do?\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, FDA is testing the -- testing the tests. It's evaluating them against live virus this weekend.\r\n \r\n\tAnd so are the manufacturers. So, they've gotten hold of plasma from patients who've been infected with Omicron and live virus, and they'll be doing those evaluations. I think we're going to know much more very early in this week.\r\n \r\n\tEvery indication is that the mass market tests that people are using should be -- should hold up with this new virus. They should be able to detect it. So, I think most of the tests that individuals are using are going to be just fine. It might be some of the smaller market tests that aren't in wide use that might be more suspect.\r\n \r\n\tBut things like the BinaxNOW, which have been evaluated very carefully, should be fine.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: You said weeks ago that the confusing language around the rollout of boosters was one of the most costly mistakes potentially of the pandemic.\r\n \r\n\tWe just heard from Dr. Collins that, when it comes to one of the few tools in terms of monoclonal antibodies that seems to work, that they need to ramp up supply, that America doesn't have the stockpile it needs right now. Why not?\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think we haven't looked ahead at the unknown unknowns, tried to predict what could happen and prepare for it.\r\n \r\n\tThe Vir, BioNTech antibody we always knew was going to be preserved against a lot of different mutated forms of this virus. We should have crashed the production of that stockpiled much more. The government only contracted for that about a month ago. We have 55,000 doses right now that are finally being forward-deployed, and we'll have 300,000 in Jan.\r\n \r\n\tThere's another drug. Lilly has a drug that's cleared two phase two studies that could be ready to be deployed as well. There's 300,000 doses sitting on pallets waiting to be forward-deployed. It's pending regulatory review by the FDA. That's another one that we should be looking very hard at, trying to move that to the market more quickly.\r\n \r\n\tWe have to get to a platform where we can update these monoclonal antibodies more quickly as new variants arise, similar to what we're doing with the vaccines. The vaccine division has moved very quickly to allow new iterations to come to market as the virus has evolved. We need to do the same thing with drugs and not treat each monoclonal antibody against each iteration of this virus as if it's a brand-new drug.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, should parents expect to send their kids back to in-person school after Christmas?\r\n \r\n\tDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think, in most places of the country, the answer is yes.\r\n \r\n\tIn some hard-hit parts of the country where there is a high prevalence of Delta right now, high flu prevalence like the Northeast, the Great Lakes region, and now Omicron later on top of that, where health care systems could get pressed, I think that you could see some districts make decisions to extend the breaks.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Dr Gottlieb, thank you very much.\r\n \r\n\tAnd we'll be right back with much more Face the Nation.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: This week, I will be sitting down for an in-depth interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.\r\n \r\n\tYou can see it across our CBS News platforms, starting with the CBS Evening News Monday, then CBS Mornings Tuesday. And we will have more on Face the Nation next Sunday.\r\n \r\n\tBe sure to also catch excerpts on our digital network, CBSN, and on CBSNews.com. That is starting tomorrow evening on CBS.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a look at the growing opioid crisis with the head of the DEA, Anne Milgram.\r\n \r\n\tWe will also hear from Hamdullah Mohib, the national security adviser under former Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, about the dramatic moments the day Kabul collapsed under the Taliban.\r\n \r\n\tStay with us.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: We now turn to the growing opioid crisis, and we want to welcome to the program Anne Milgram, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration.\r\n \r\n\tGood morning to you.\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM, ADMINISTRATOR, DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION: Good morning. Thank you for having me.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Why is it so hard to cut off the flow of fentanyl, which is the drug that seems to be fueling these overdoses.\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: Fentanyl is a different drug threat than we've seen before. It's synthetic, meaning that it's manmade, it's made of chemicals. Right now those chemicals are largely sourced from China. They're going to the Mexican criminal drug cartels that are then mass producing, often at an industrial scale, fentanyl.\r\n \r\n\tFentanyl, tiny, tiny amounts can be deadly.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Are people seeking it out as a drug, or is it just something that they're surprised is mixed into the drugs their seeking?\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: The cartels are mass producing these pills in Mexico mostly, and they're making them look like they're real oxycodone, like they're real hydrocodone, Percocet, Adderall. And then they're bringing them, flooding them into the United States and falsely advertise them, marketing them as though they were real pharmaceuticals. So you have a teen on Snapchat, an older American who's looking for a pain medicine that they might be able to get cheaper online, and they're finding these pills -- Americans believe that they're getting the actual pharmaceutical pill. They're not. What they're getting is fentanyl. And that is why we're seeing 100,000 overdose deaths this year, 64,000 of those are attributed to synthetic opioids, like fentanyl.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden signed two executive orders to fight drug trafficking, and it allowed for a crackdown on fentanyl producers, particularly in China. What tools does this give you now? I mean how do you get Beijing to hand over the bad guys?\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: There are hundreds of thousands of unregulated chemical companies in China that are sending these drugs, these precursor chemicals that can be made into fentanyl. Those chemical companies are adverting, you can use this to make fentanyl. So we know what they're doing. China knows what they're doing. They need to do more.\r\n \r\n\tWhat the president's executive order does is it gives us new tools, particularly around illicit finance. One of the things that drives drug trafficking worldwide is money laundering, taking those profits and laundering them through different means. We see a lot of that illicit finance happening both in China and in Mexico. The other EO by the president set up an organization across government focused on transnational organized crime. That is narcotic trafficking.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: The social media companies you have said are very much a conduit, TikTok, Snapchat.\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: Yes.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: How -- are people seeking out these drugs intentionally on these social media platforms? And what are you doing to get the companies to crack down?\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: Drug traffickers are harnessing social media because it is accessible. They're able to access millions of Americans. And it is anonymous. And they're able to sell these fake pills and to lie on those social media sites about that. So we know every single day across America that drugs are being sold on these social media sites, Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook.\r\n \r\n\tWhen you go on your smartphone, wherever you are, those traffickers are there, too. And the minute you open up one of those social media apps, they're there and they're waiting. They want to make it one click to get drugs into people's hands.\r\n \r\n\tWe know what's happening, and so do the social media companies. In our takedown, 76 of our cases are directly linked to social media websites, where there is extensive narcotics trafficking happening.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: So you're building a case against the social media companies?\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: We built a case against the -- at this moment, the criminal drug networks. And we've drawn the line between the Mexico criminal cartels that are mass producing elicit fentanyl and making these fake pills and pouring it into the United States.\r\n \r\n\tWhat we're doing is investigating. We want to understand everything about how this is happening. And, of course, the social media companies need to do more.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: So, what would you tell parents who are listening at home, terrified at what you're describing, what can they actually do?\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: Well, they need to sit and talk with their kids. The researcher is clear that when parents talk to their children, drug use goes down in half. And we know that there are kids who don't understand these risks. We know that there are older Americans as well.\r\n \r\n\tThis is a new threat. So people shouldn't be expected to know it. We need to help people understand, one pill can kill. The only medicine that they should take is what's prescribed to them personally and filled at a local pharmacy.\r\n \r\n\tAnd, also, the other piece of this is what we see dealers and drug trafficking networks doing now is that they're lacing other drugs with fentanyl. They're lacing cocaine, methamphetamine, heroine, even - there was a case recently in Connecticut with marijuana being laced with fentanyl. So, no drugs are safe right now because fentanyl is being put into those drugs because it's highly addictive.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: But then they're killing their customers unintentionally.\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: They're killing their customers.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Why isn't intervention working?\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: It is working in one sense, which is that we've taken off 20 million fake pills this year. We estimate, at the DEA lab, that four in 10 of those pills are potentially deadly. We've taken off 15,000 pounds of fentanyl this year. That is enough potentially lethal doses to kill every single American. We're focused on tracking those overdose deaths and working back to understand the full network, from Mexico to main street, that is causing harm and is killing Americans. It's not enough for us to do one drug trafficker here and there. We have to be targeted at the entire network so that we can take them down.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: What is the current Mexican government doing when you ask them to help you?\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: We have to do more than we've ever done before. And so does Mexico and so does China. The administration has a new high-level security dialogue with Mexico. And my message to all of our partners is that the DEA is standing up to do more to protect American communities.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: But where do you fit into the migration crisis right now? I mean is -- is stopping the flow of drugs a required step to stop the flow of people as well, if it's the cartels who are behind both?\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: The cartels will do anything to get drugs in, in every way you can imagine. Yes, we see it coming through the border. We see it coming through ports, through airplanes, through freight services, through parcel delivery services.\r\n \r\n\tFentanyl, tiny quantities, are deadly and extremely potent and addictive. So it's not in years' past where someone would have to bring kilos upon kilos into the United States. It is almost minuscule qualities right now.\r\n \r\n\tSo the threat has changed enormously.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: All right.\r\n \r\n\tAnne Milgram, thank you for your time today.\r\n \r\n\tANNE MILGRAM: Thank you.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: We learned last week that more than 60,000 Afghans, who had helped the U.S., were left behind, following the chaos of the Biden administration's scramble to get Americans and those who support us out of Afghanistan. Under Taliban control, Afghanistan is facing a severe crisis. The U.N. predicts that more than one million children under the age of five could die of starvation this winter.\r\n \r\n\tWe've spoken with U.S. officials about the Afghanistan withdrawal and the day the elected president, Ashraf Ghani, fled the country. But President Ghani has not spoken publicly. And we are now hearing for the first time from Hamdullah Mohib, Ghani's national security advisor, in an exclusive U.S. television interview.\r\n \r\n\tAlthough Mohib told us that we all share the blame for what happened, that's not what President Biden told the American people.\r\n \r\n\tWe begin by playing a clip of the president for Mohib when we spoke with him earlier.\r\n \r\n\t(Begin VT)\r\n \r\n\tJOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Afghan political leaders gave up and fled the country. The Afghan military collapsed, sometime without trying to fight.\r\n \r\n\tWe gave them every tool they could need.\r\n \r\n\tWe provided close air support. We gave them every chance to determine their own future. We could not provide them was the will to fight for that future.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: What do you make of that assessment? Did you lack the will?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB, FORMER AFGHAN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Absolutely not. The Afghan people made tremendous sacrifices for Afghanistan. I think it's -- it would be dishonor to take that away. What happened was the rug was pulled under the Afghans' feet. The decision to talk directly and engage the Taliban and make a deal with the Taliban that didn't include the Afghan government was protested, myself, in this city, about what was going to happen to our government, what was going to happen to us, the --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: That was a U.S. agreement under the Trump administration with the Taliban that the Biden administration honored?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Exactly. And -- and those decisions, that decision to talk directly to the Taliban without the presence of the Afghan government, and -- and then the full transparency with the Afghan government led to the collapse that happened on -- on August 15th.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: That was the day that the Taliban seized control. They were already in the city. By the end of the day, they had seized control.\r\n \r\n\tDid you have any idea when you woke up that money that you would be fleeing the country?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: No.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: When did you?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: In fact, the -- the -- the night before, my staff contacted me and asked if we would -- if we should start shredding and burning sensitive documents. And we -- I didn't believe that it would be so -- so soon. We still thought the Taliban had at least two more weeks until the U.S. presence in Kabul. We had several cities and provinces around Kabul that were still under Afghan government's control. But by that morning, by 4:00 a.m. that morning, we had lost all of those provinces, plus a key district in Kabul and --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: So you woke up that morning knowing that the Taliban is essentially knocking on the door of the capital?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Correct.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: When did you decide to flee?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Well, about 2:30 p.m. The news that came in at that point made me understand that we no longer have -- no longer have a consolidated force. There was no single power to control it. Most of them had abandoned their posts. Kabul was a city that was not ready for that kind of fighting. It was a city -- and security forces could do crimes, but they weren't ready to fight against the Taliban in a battle in -- in that.\r\n \r\n\tSo we -- we saw the police and many other forces abandoning their posts and -- and not turning up to work that day.\r\n \r\n\tBut what happened at 2:30 was that I got the news that two helicopters, one that was part of the president's fleet, was hijacked by a rogue ADSF (ph) element and then another was shot.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: A rogue soldier?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Yes. I understood that this is the end, that even the airport is no longer secure for -- for the Afghan president or anyone else around. And the fight is now going to be inside the city. And that was the only thing left that the president could do to save lives and -- and to ensure that -- that there was still American troops left to be able to secure -- because they were in the negotiations.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: It wasn't the Afghans that were negotiating anymore.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: At 2:30, you walk up to President Ghani and you say what?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: I tell him it's time to leave, sir.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Why?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Because there was no other decision left for him to do, right.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think would have happened if you'd stayed?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Well, fighting would have ensued. We had -- we had two weeks. We could have continued fighting inside Kabul, destroy most of the city. And thousands of people --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Who would have been fighting, though, because you're describing forces melting away?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Forces -- well, whatever forces were left.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: But you know you are harshly criticized, as is President Ghani, for choosing to flea that day.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: We had to make a decision that was right for Afghanistan.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: What did you take with you on that plane? You know there's been allegations of corruption and that money was taken.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Look, those are allegations that are -- people know no person with the right mind would believe. The decision to leave was a very last-minute decision. This wasn't --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: You didn't take cash with you?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Absolutely not. No.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: What did you take with you?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: We didn't -- we just took ourselves. Most of the people that came on that flight didn't even have another -- a change of clothes. So, in -- in -- in Uzbekistan and in the Emirates, even for the president, we had to buy him a change of clothes.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: You took helicopters from the presidential palace to another country.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Correct.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: To Uzbekistan. There is reports that you had to fly at low altitude because you were trying to avoid the Americans knowing that you were fleeing?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Absolutely.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Why?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: The trust was gone. There was no trust.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: What did you think the Americans were going to do?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: I had asked the Americans for something simple the day before. And it was a test to say, if this deal doesn't work out, a deal that would have a transfer of power to the Taliban, and if this didn't work, would we be rescued? And the response was non-committal.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: You asked the United States to help you evacuate from Afghanistan?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: I did. If this deal didn't work, would that be the case? There were intelligence supports both from Afghan sources, the Americans, and -- and independent that the plan for -- by -- not by the Taliban, their sponsors was, they wanted Ashraf Ghani's head. And it's embarrassing enough to have lost our country. We're not going to lose another president and be embarrassed like that in Afghanistan and be killed.\r\n \r\n\tWhat we've tried to see was to see if there was anywhere that the president could go and resist and continue to be in Afghanistan, but that was no longer possible. Now --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: There was no safe place in Afghanistan for the president to be?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: There was no safe place. Absolutely. Unless he wanted the war to continue, unless we wanted to see a civil war return.\r\n \r\n\tWhat was being discussed in Doha was nothing less than a surrender. And if it is a surrender, why take two more weeks and risk the lives of millions of Afghans and -- and then in the end do exactly the same thing anyway?\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: The argument is now that had you had a peaceful transfer of power, instead of the Taliban taking it by force, that we wouldn't have children starving to death in Afghanistan right now because money would have still poured into this new government, even though the Taliban was part of it, that international aid organizations would be able to provide food, oxygen, and hospitals.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: What is stopping that from now -- from happening now?\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: The United States and the world having sanctions on the Taliban.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Well, why? The question is, if we were to give the Taliban exactly what they wanted, then, you know, the legitimacy given by the president but for a surrender, you know, this is not an argument. This doesn't make sense to me in any way. In any way.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is what the Biden administration would argue, and many Afghans, that there was a very narrow sort of window of opportunity where in those final weeks President Ghani could have negotiated an exit that would have avoided the situation and the chaos that ensued. Was there a deal on the table?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: There was no deal on the table. This is an excuse. Look, I was -- I was --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: This is what Secretary Blinken, on this program, said it was there that he spoke to President Ghani on -- on August the 14th. He thought he had a deal and the next day Ghani fled.\r\n \r\n\t(Begin VT)\r\n \r\n\tANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I was on the phone with - with President Ghani on a -- on a Saturday night, pressing him to make sure he was ready to agree with the -- the plan we were trying to put into effect to do a transfer of power to -- to a new government that would have been led by the Taliban, but been inclusive, and included all aspects of - of Afghan society. And he told me on the phone he was prepared to do that. But if the Taliban wouldn't go along, he was willing to fight to the death, and the very next day he fled.\r\n \r\n\t(End VT)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: That's what he says.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: I was -- I was closely involved in that negotiation. I worked out the terms with the Americans on what would be, you know, that peaceful transfer of power. It was not going to happen on August 15th. It was going to happen when we still had multiple provinces under Afghan control and we still had a consolidated force. The Taliban, that day, were all over the city. And we didn't have, like I said, a consolidated force to keep the order. But that basically means a surrender to the Taliban.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: It's been reported you received a text message from one of the Taliban leaders that day on August 15th. What did he propose?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Surrender. He said, you issue a statement of surrender, and then we negotiate. I told him that's not how it works.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: You know, the Biden and Trump administration's envoy to the Taliban, Zalmay Khalilzhad, the former ambassador, who was on this program recently, said the U.S. should have pressed President Ghani harder to make concessions so that there was a peaceful transfer of power. He told my colleague, Michael Moral, that Ghani insisted until the very end he would not leave until a successor was decided in an election. It was late and Ghani was making demands as if he had won the war rather than he was losing the war.\r\n \r\n\tWhat he is describing is delusion. Did you ever say to him, Mr. President, the Taliban is coming to power, whether we like it or not, we have to take a negotiated deal?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Yes. He wanted elections because he felt that that would be the way he hands over power. But he's not wrong to think that. He was being -- he was being assured in every meeting, on every statement that the international community wants to see a democratic Afghanistan, a sovereign Afghanistan, an Afghanistan that's at peace with itself and its neighbors. So we had these four things to look forward to. In this statement was --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: The United States says President Ghani just wanted to stay in power, and that's it.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Well -- well --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: He didn't want to negotiate his exit.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: This was never -- this was never clear. There wasn't a U.S. secretary of state, or a national security adviser, anyone higher that has come to Afghanistan, spent a day or two. This is a mission in which we have both shed blood together, made tremendous amount of sacrifices and is worthy of protection.\r\n \r\n\tTo spend a day or two, talk with the president and key leaders in Afghanistan to say, here is what the Americans want to do, right. You're right, we didn't read the writing on the wall. The writing on the wall was that a withdrawal will take place no matter what. We thought that the preservation of the last 20 years, the last two decades, mattered, and that is where we -- we -- we -- we -- we misunderstood.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: President Ghani himself has been described as sort of living in a bubble, reading books on the grounds of the palace while the country is disintegrating.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: I would never believe that just because President Ghani read books led to the collapse of the state. I don't -- I think that's a -- that's a lame excuse, whoever presents it.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: No, but there are criticism that -- that he was - but the criticism is that he was out of touch with reality, that he was living in a bubble, that there was corruption and ineptness within the government.\r\n \r\n\tYou're the national security adviser. You're the one who gives him the hard news, we have to go. Did you ever give him the hard news, Mr. President, we have to agree to negotiate our exit here because the Americans are gone, they're leaving us?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: President Ghani received hard news every second of the day. Afghanistan was at war. Every minute with lost an Afghan across the country. There was no good news.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: Right now there is, as we talked about, no money flowing into Afghanistan because the Taliban are now running the government. Do you think, if you had stayed, that it would have made a difference?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: No. If the condition was that a Taliban government be in place, there would have been a Taliban government in place just two weeks later.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't feel a sense of responsibility when you hear about what the U.N. is saying, that this is going to be a bleak winter of starvation?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: Absolutely. Well, of course I feel responsible. I feel responsible now, and I fell responsible then. I think what -- what the outcome is, is unfair to the Afghan people. A decision was made to include and be able to have -- to see the Taliban in government, right? And - and then --\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: The United States, the Biden administration agreed to what the Trump administration agreed to, which was the Taliban's coming back into power.\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: You know, when -- when that decision was made, I think it is important to make assumptions about how there will be collaboration with -- with that government in place. And how we're going to deliver aid to people that are in need.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think your biggest mistake was?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: We should have understood that the United States and -- has made its decision and -- and would withdraw under any circumstances. And I think that probably is one of the -- one of the reasons we weren't able to secure another outcome.\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: You felt that you were going to have the United States change its mind based on conditions on the ground?\r\n \r\n\tHAMDULLAH MOHIB: No. I felt -- I felt that our partners, the United States included, believed in a democratic Afghanistan, a place where we were going to preserve the gains of the last 20 years. I thought those gains meant something.\r\n \r\n\t(End VT)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: You can watch the full interview on facethenation.com.\r\n \r\n\tWe'll be back in a moment.\r\n \r\n\t(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\r\n \r\n\tMARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz that aired Sunday, November 21, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who joins us from Houston. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-TX): Good morning, MARGARET. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Overnight, you did see Chinese state run media release images of tennis player Peng Shuai in Beijing. It's the first time she's been seen in two weeks since she mysteriously disappeared after criticizing and claiming that one of the former leaders of China committed sexual assault against her. Do you have any idea what- what is going on here? SEN. CRUZ: Well, we don't know for sure, but there are reasons to be deeply, deeply skeptical. Peng Shuai was one of the best tennis players in the world. She's the first Chinese player ever to be ranked number one in the world in doubles for women's or men's. And she posted on social media a serious allegation of sexual assault. Sexual assault by the former vice premier of China, by a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee. And within 30 minutes, the Chinese communist government caused that that accusation of sexual assault to miraculously disappear. And since that point Peng Shuai has not been seen. Now--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --Should the U.S. be doing more?--\u00a0 SEN. CRUZ: After there- there was criticism, after everyone noticed she disappeared, they- they put out- There was an email that claimed to be from her that- that frankly read like a bad- bad Saturday Night Live, like a hostage email. And these latest images that the Chinese government is putting out, they're trying to pretend everything is OK. But I got to say, the Women's Tennis Association has been extraordinary standing up to China. They have been defending this athlete. They've been calling on China to have full and complete transparency, and the Chinese communist government is flabbergasted because they're not used to seeing sports leagues-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Right-- SEN. CRUZ: --or- or- or big corporate interests stand up to them. I really commend-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Right-- SEN. CRUZ: --the Women's Tennis Association for putting their players first. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And I know you and I have talked about that in the past, when sports leagues don't do that. But so despite concern right now that China is carrying out, actively, a genocide against Muslims in that country, it's still set to hold the Olympics in three months. President Biden has said he's considering a diplomatic boycott. Do you think he should go further because other 2024 presidential candidates, and I know you are considered to be likely one of them, are really kind of competing to be as hard line as they possibly can on China. Nikki Haley, Tom Cotton say this should be a full boycott. Do you support one? SEN. CRUZ: Yeah. So, listen, I've been leaning in hard saying we ought to move the Olympics out of China, that's what we should have done. The IOC refused to do that. I think it's a mistake to have a full boycott of the Olympics. You know, Jimmy Carter tried that in the 1970s. All it did was punish a generation of athletes. We've got young men and young women, Americans, who spent their whole lives practicing for this moment. I don't want to punish those young athletes. What we ought to do- I do agree with the notion of a so-called diplomatic boycott-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --You agree with President Biden?-- SEN. CRUZ: --which means we don't send high ranking cabinet officials over there. We don't send- we- we try to minimize the attention. But I also think it's important we do two things at the Olympics in China. Number one, that we actually show the courage the Women's Tennis Association is showing to call out the murder, the genocide, the torture, the lies, the complicity in COVID-19 of the Chinese communist government to speak the truth. And then number two, I really hope our young men and women that they go over there and kick their commie asses. We need to win in the Olympics. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Putting that aside, there are, on a practical level, corporations who spend a ton of money on sponsorships around the Olympics: Coca-Cola, Google, Procter and Gamble. They're all Olympic sponsors. Should they still go ahead with those activities? SEN. CRUZ: Look, I- I think it makes sense for corporations to cut off their ads. I'd love to see corporations show a tiny bit of courage. You know, when China engages in horrific slave labor, companies like Nike turn a blind eye. When you look at the NBA, I'm a die-hard hoops fan, the NBA's reaction to China's terrible. Terrible. They're terrified of upsetting the Chinese communist dictators. They value the money so much that in fact, you know, you and I both remember when Daryl Morey, who was the general manager of the Rockets, sent one little innocuous tweet about Hong Kong and the NBA bent over backwards groveling to the Chinese communists. I was in Hong Kong at the time. In fact, you and I did a show at that time.-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0 SEN. CRUZ: --I dressed in all black in solidarity with the Hong Kong protesters.-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SEN. CRUZ: --I understand why the NBA did it. They're looking at hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars. I understand why Nike does it. But you know what- what is really impressive about the Women's Tennis Association is they've said they will cancel their matches in China. They will give up tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars, if Peng Shuai is not released, if there isn't transparency. That's the kind of courage we need other players to have. MARGARET BRENNAN: Understand, and they are standing alone on that. I want to ask you about your blocking a number of President Biden's nominees to national security posts. The White House said it's an unprecedented effort of obstruction, Sen. Murphy said, \"talking to you it's like dealing with the terrorists.\" Aren't you playing politics with national security? SEN. CRUZ: Well, actually quite the opposite, I'm trying to get President Biden to stop acquiescing and surrendering to our enemies. In China, I introduced an amendment to say that we should not purchase any green vehicles or solar panels made with slave labor in communist China in concentration camps. Every Democrat but Joe Manchin voted against it. On Russia, one of the first things Joe Biden did was surrender to Vladimir Putin on Nord Stream two. He gave Putin a multi-billion-dollar pipeline, a pipeline that we had stopped. I had authored bipartisan sanctions legislation. Democrats and Republicans overwhelmingly supported my legislation, and we killed that pipeline dead. Joe Biden came in and surrendered. It is MARGARET, I believe, a generational geopolitical mistake. If this pipeline is allowed to go online, it will give billions of dollars to Russia. They will use it well for military aggression against America and our allies. It will undermine European security, American security and- and enriches Russia. And Biden simply surrendered to Putin. That was a mistake. And so I place the hold on these nominees in order to try to pressure Biden to follow the law,-- MARGARET BRENNAN: When will you lift it? SEN. CRUZ: --to follow the law. I'll lift it when he follows the law. And in fact, I've suggested a simple, reasonable compromise which, as I've said, I will lift many of the holds if he simply triggers under a law called CAATSA, which is a Russian sanctions law passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. Under CAATSA, he could list Nord Stream 2 AG, which is the umbrella company for Nord Stream, and then delist it. That would solve his political objective of surrendering to Putin, but it would trigger an automatic congressional override veto. I've said if they trigger the override veto- the vote, then I'll lift the hold. But the reason Biden doesn't want to do that is he knows that- he fears he will lose in Congress because its policy of surrendering to Russia is indefensible. MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm going to keep talking to you, Senator. I'm going to ask you to stay put if you could, because I have to take this break and we're going to continue our conversation on the other side of it. Stay with us. We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION, we want to continue our conversation with Sen. Ted Cruz. Senator, just before the break, we were talking about the importance of standing up to some of the autocrats around the world. I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about the state of our own democracy. I know you have condemned the violence on Jan. 6, but in that book Peril, Bob Woodward and Robert Costa reported detailed conversations you had with the President Donald Trump at that time on Jan. 6, and that you knew there was no congressional authority to overturn the election. Didn't indulging the doubters damage our democracy and our standing in the world? SEN. CRUZ: Well, I haven't read that particular book, and I didn't happen to have any conversations with President Trump on Jan. 6--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Didn't you talk to him as they detail in the--\u00a0 SEN. CRUZ: But I can tell you under the constitution--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --but they detailed a number of conversations you had in the book with the president about challenging the election. SEN CRUZ: I have no idea- I have no idea what that book says-- but I did not have any conversations with them on Jan. 6. But I also know what the constitution provides and the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Or leading up to Jan. 6?-- SEN. CRUZ: --I had many conversations with him in days and weeks and months leading up to Jan. 6, I-I talked to the president sometimes as often as once a week or once a day. But my point is simple. Under the Constitution, Congress has a role, it has a responsibility when it comes to certifying votes. And what I did, I brought together a group of 11 senators, and we objected to call for a Foreign Electoral Commission to review the claims of voter fraud and to assess and make a determination to consider the evidence. And there's a strong historical precedent for that.-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SEN. CRUZ: You look at 1876 and the election of 1876, there was a contested election. There were serious allegations of election fraud, and what Congress did in 1876 is it appointed an electoral commission-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But the- the people-- SEN. CRUZ: --it consisted of five members of the Senate, five members of the House, five Supreme Court Justices.-- \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You know- you know that what you're laying out is an intellectualized argument here is not what people gathered and chanting things like \"{hang} Mike Pence\" were talking about. You know that? SEN. CRUZ: Look, I think the violence that happened on that day was horrific. I think any acts of violence, regardless of your political orientation, if you're right wing, left wing or you have no ideology at all, if you commit an act of violence, if you assault a police officer, if you're violent against anyone, you should be prosecuted and go to jail. And that's what the law is. And so, I absolutely condemned acts of violence. But- but what? What are the inspiration for the 11 senators in a constitution- in a constitutional option, which I think would have been much better for our democracy because we right now have a substantial chunk of our country that has real doubts about the integrity of the election. And if we had had a credible electoral commission do an emergency audit, it would have enhanced faith in democracy. But instead, Democrats and a lot of the press decided to just engage in incendiary rhetoric rather than acknowledge voter fraud is real. It is a problem--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --Well, do you have- I want to-- SEN. CRUZ: --and one of the allegations of voter fraud needed to be examined on the merits. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, senator. There is no evidence of fraud that would have really drawn the outcome of the election into doubt. You know that. I want to ask you about 2024 and a race. I want to ask you, are you-- SEN. CRUZ: Voter fraud has been persistent from the very first election that has ever occurred. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to run for president in 2024? Would you challenge President Trump or are you endorsing him? SEN. CRUZ: Look, I have no idea what's going to happen in 2024. Donald Trump is going to have to make a choice. First of all, whether he's going to run or not, I think if he chose to run, he would be very, very formidable. I can tell you that- that when I ran in 2016, we came incredibly close. I came in second. There's a long history of runner-ups becoming the next nominee, and it was the most fun I've ever had in my life. But there's a lot of time between now and 2024. My focus right now is 2022 because I think next November is going to be a wave election, an awful lot like 2010 was. I think Republicans are going to retake the House, they're going to retake the Senate. And I am spending my time recruiting candidates, supporting candidates and working to retire both-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Alright.-- SEN. CRUZ: --Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer from their leadership positions. Because I think the damage being done-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Okay.-- SEN. CRUZ: --to the country, inflation, jobs being killed, open borders, weakness on foreign policy.-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Yeah.-- SEN. CRUZ: --I think Virginia and New Jersey were foreshadowing for what's coming November of next year. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator, it sounds like- sounds like a campaign slogan. All right. We will be right back.",

The three reenact a \"PDB briefing\" of the sort that took place at Langley in then-Director Panetta's office. Morell, Panetta and Bash discuss the way forward in Afghanistan, the type and variety of threats posed by Vladimir Putin's Russia, the prospect of a nuclear Iran, and the long-term challenge posed by China. They also discuss domestic political divisions that could imperil U.S. stability and security.\u00a0 Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. Intelligence Matters: Leon Panetta and Jeremy Bash Producer: Olivia Gazis\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Mr. Secretary, welcome back to intelligence matters. LEON PANETTA: Great to be with you. MICHAEL MORELL: You were guest Number #1 on Intelligence Matters four years ago and today you are guest #220. And we've got a couple of million listeners, both as a podcast and as a radio show. So we have grown quite a bit since the last time you were on the show. But thank you for taking the time. LEON PANETTA: Well, congratulations. It just shows how important what you're doing with this program means to the country and to the world. MICHAEL MORELL: And welcome, Jeremy. JEREMY BASH: Great to be here. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Jeremy - for those that don't know, Jeremy was Secretary Panetta's chief of staff at both the CIA and at the Department of Defense. And today, Jeremy is co-founder and managing director of a Washington, DC consulting firm, Beacon Global Strategies. So, Jeremy, welcome. JEREMY BASH: Thank you. MICHAEL MORELL: Thanks for joining us. So guys, what I wanted to do today is something that we don't normally do. Normally I ask the questions and a person answers. I want to take us back to what we did every morning at the Central Intelligence Agency, when ,Mr. Secretary, you were the director. We would join you for your PDB briefing, and, you remember, it lasted an hour. A briefer would come in and tee up the issues and then we would talk about them. We would kick around ideas. You would ask a lot of questions. The only person or people we're missing are the briefer, and we're missing Fran Moore, who was the head of analysis at the time. She would join us, right? So we are missing a couple of people, but I want to recreate for our listeners what one of those sessions looked like, if that makes sense. JEREMY BASH: You'd have to get the Secretary his mug that he drink coffee out of every morning that said, \"CIA: California Italian-American.\" We have that somewhere? MICHAEL MORELL: We could find one real quick, I'd bet. There's got to be one here. We're taping this at Beacon Global Strategies office, so I'm sure. LEON PANETTA: I still have that mug. I use it every morning. MICHAEL MORELL: So let's start with Afghanistan, because basically, I want to talk about it and get it out of the way, because it's actually behind us now. But I think people will want to know what we think about it. Longest war in American history, and we lost. The Taliban won. And our exit from the country was not orderly, and it cost the lives of 13 American servicemen. So I'm wondering, as we look back at the war, I'm wondering if you guys think there are things that we could have done differently during those 20 years that would have changed the outcome, would have allowed an Afghan government to have survived our departure. Or whether it was inevitable that whenever we left, the Taliban was going to take over. So that's one question. And then the second question we can talk about is why was our departure so disorderly, and why does that matter? What signal does it send the world? So let's kick around Afghanistan a little bit. LEON PANETTA: You know, I don't think it was inevitable. And for me personally, having been Director and also a Secretary of Defense, having been responsible for deploying people into harm's way in Afghanistan and having witnessed the sacrifices that were made, this was kind of a gut-punch in terms of what happened there.  The reason we were there is because of 9/11 and because we made a decision to go after al Qaeda and those who were responsible for planning 9/11. But we also made a decision that Afghanistan would not be allowed to become a safe haven for al Qaeda that frankly gave al Qaeda the opportunity to plan the 9/11 type attack. And we wanted to make sure that that never happened again.\u00a0 And so we actually, for 20 years, managed to prevent another 9/11 attack. And I think we need to think about that, that we in fact did protect our country from a 9/11 attack. And obviously, I was very proud at the CIA of the mission to go after Bin Laden, al Qaeda, and I think we did a lot of things to undermine al Qaeda's leadership. So I feel very good about that. I do think that there should have been a point, perhaps after the Bin Laden raid, where there should have been greater consideration about, 'Where the hell do we go now?' And I think we just kind of took it for granted. We kind of continued to do what we were doing. There was always the sense that somehow we were making some progress, so let's just keep doing it. But I really think that was a moment where we should have sat down and really thought, 'Where are we going? What's our mission? What do we want to achieve?' I think we built up too much dependence on the part of the Afghan military and the United States, and that the most important thing we should have done is develop greater independence on their part so that it really is their country think that they would care about it rather than just simply relying on the United States. I think there was a better way to do this and frankly, we missed that boat. MICHAEL MORELL: And the other thing we missed, right, was the deep, deep corruption in Afghanistan. Perhaps there was something we could have done to better get that under control because, at the end of the day, that contributed to the collapse. At the end of the day, it contributed to Afghans welcoming the Taliban's return to power. Jeremy? JEREMY BASH: Well, I was going to just tee this up for you, Mr. Secretary, which is that when President Biden made his announcement in the spring, the argument he basically made - which I think was pretty sound and I think you also tended to agree with it - was that, given the deal that Donald Trump had struck with the Taliban that we were going to be out of there by March, Joe Biden, effectively was saying, \"We're going to decelerate that departure, but we're going to have to leave because if the Taliban is going to attack us, we'd have to plus up our forces.' So there's no status quo option. There's no just hanging out there with 2,500 troops. 'We're either going to have to get out or we're going to have to plus up. And I don't want to be the fifth president to increase our force posture in Afghanistan.\" I think you thought at the time that the policy, although it carried some risk, was correct. But I could detect, Secretary, in your voice, when you endorsed the policy that you were worried about the following months; that you foresaw potentially a messy exit. LEON PANETTA: Yeah, because Jeremy, I guess - once a president's chief of staff, always a president's chief of staff, in the sense that I always think about when a president makes a decision that the key to that decision is the execution of that decision. And if you don't effectively execute that decision, then the decision isn't worth much. That's just the reality. And I just felt that while, you know, I understood the decision, that something fell apart in the execution.  That, whatever the planning process, whatever the contingency process -- I mean, as secretary of defense, my God, we plan for every contingency. We spend half of our time trying to figure out what's going to happen if we have to go to war in Taiwan or we have to go to war with China or with Russia, for everything. We planned for everything. That's what we do. You know, it's a planning operation. And I find it hard to believe that there were not plans on the table to deal with the contingencies that we saw happening because this was not a classified operation. You could basically stand back and see what was happening in Afghanistan. You could see the collapse of the Afghan military. You could see what the Taliban was doing, in gradually moving through that country and establishing control of the country. I mean, it was happening before our eyes. And so somebody, somewhere should have said, 'If this thing totally collapses, what the hell do we do?' JEREMY BASH: Just curious, do you both, as former leaders of CIA, believe that CIA and the intelligence community is going to shoulder the responsibility for dealing with the counterterrorism problem in Afghanistan and be our presence there, in effect, because we don't have a diplomatic presence, we don't have a military presence? MICHAEL MORELL: So we, as a nation, have two issues here. One is the reconstitution of al Qaeda in Afghanistan, right. We have to make sure, as a country, we've got to make sure that doesn't happen.  And then two is ISIS in Afghanistan, which is actually an enemy of the Taliban. Al Qaeda is a friend of the Taliban, but ISIS is an enemy. But ISIS today is a significant threat. So we've got to watch both of those. That takes intelligence. So we've got to figure out how to collect intelligence on those two groups and what their capabilities are and what their plans and intentions are. And then the United States military has to figure out if the president orders them to degrade those two groups. How do they do that, right? So this is the over the horizon thing.  And I think the intelligence piece of the over-the-horizon strategy is going to be hard. LEON PANETTA: Yeah. Right. MICHAEL MORELL: Maybe the military piece is a little easier, I don't know. But I think that's our challenge going forward in Afghanistan, and I hope we don't lose focus on it, right, as we focus on other issues that we have to spend time on. LEON PANETTA: I think we've got to come to the realization that the security problem in Afghanistan has not gone away, that it's gotten worse and that the Taliban in charge of Afghanistan --this is not a Taliban that really has moved into the 21st century. There was a lot of talk that they would understand, that they would really have to start paying attention to international rules and international relations, et cetera. But I don't see that. I see a Taliban that pretty much has put in place the same kind of operation that they had on 9/11, and that they're going to allow terrorists to be able to have a safe haven, particularly al Qaeda. And then ISIS is going to be able to operate there as well, whether they like it or not. And so we have a responsibility, particularly because of al Qaeda and what they did, to make sure that we're continuing to follow that problem. And I think we need to have continuing intelligence on that so that we know what's taking place. I mean, the one thing I do see now is that there appears to be, either through the press and through some of the people that are there, a little more awareness of what the hell's going on in Afghanistan. And that's a good thing. We seem to know kind of what what some of the things are the Taliban is up to.  I think we're going to have to have very good intelligence to keep track of just exactly what al Qaeda's doing. And then, you know, I think we've got to have the operational capability to act if they take a step that looks like it threatens our security. MICHAEL MORELL: I think the good news here is that we've actually figured out how to do this over the last 20 years. And we do it around the world in a number of places on a daily basis. This is just a little harder because we're not in the country. And it's a big country. So being able to get there -- I wonder if Pakistan, might, at the end of the day, oddly, be an option for us here. JEREMY BASH: Yeah, we had to cooperate a lot back when you were both leading CIA with Pakistan. Of course, some of that changed after May 1st, 2011 and the Bin Laden operation. But before that, there was good dialogue, good cooperation, good sharing of information. And we may have to get back there. And I'd just maybe add one more point to this, which is, Michael, you said we've gotten pretty good at going after people globally. The Find-Fix-Finish approach that both the Special Operations Command and the I=intelligence community have worked together on. I think one of the things that Joe Biden was exactly right about is that it's not just about Afghanistan. We have to do it in the Sahel. We have to do it in Yemen. We do it in Syria. We have to do it in South Asia. We have to do it in a lot of places. Somalia, absolutely. And so one of the things that I think the intelligence community will be called upon to do is to maintain the focus, the intelligence collection, the analysis and ultimately the options to kinetically strike terrorist targets across a very wide swath of the globe. MICHAEL MORELL: And I want to say something here because when you came to CIA, Mr. Secretary, as the director, we were just focused on al Qaeda in the AfPak border region. And you said, \"Well, what about all these al Qaeda guys in Yemen and all these al Qaeda guys in Somalia and in Africa? Shouldn't we be focusing on them?\" And we stood up a big effort to do that, you'll remember. LEON PANETTA: Yeah. I think, Michael, you're right, that one of the things we really learned to do well was counterterrorism. It took a while, but I really think we became a very effective counterterrorism operation, both at CIA and at Defense, for that matter. And the relationship between intelligence and the military became really, I think, very effective at being able to conduct operations. And we were doing this stuff sometimes seven or eight times a night in Afghanistan or Iraq or elsewhere. And the fact is, we've used counterterrorism to go after terrorists wherever they were, because terrorism has metastasized, whether it's al-Shabab, whether it's Boko Haram, whether it's different versions of al Qaeda. And we've been able, frankly, to keep a handle on that, and I think we're going to have to continue to do that. So the issue then becomes, how do we deal with it now in Afghanistan? It hasn't gone away. It's become a little tougher problem. And I think it's got to be counterterrorism. I think we do have to develop our relationship with Pakistan because that's a logical base to try to work from. They, I think, are now worried, having probably encouraged the Taliban to undermine stability in Afghanistan, they now see a situation where the Taliban could very well threaten them. MICHAEL MORELL: I think the bottom line for me, and I know there's a joke at the working level in the national security community that \"over the horizon\" means \"over the rainbow.\" But I'm actually confident that if we focus on this, right, if the intelligence community focuses on collecting intelligence and the military focuses on how do we reach out and touch those groups if we have to, that we'll be able to do this. LEON PANETTA: Bill McRaven - it was interesting, when we were talking about what was going to happen in Afghanistan and the president, at that point, talked about the over horizon approach, Bill McRaven had this kind of approach that, 'We can do whatever the hell is necessary and that we have the capability to do it and do it well.' And I trust his judgment. Now, obviously, it takes some work, but I really do think that we have the ability not only to gather the right intelligence, but to actually go after bad guys if we know that they're up to trouble. MICHAEL MORELL: So I want to switch topics here. I ultimately want to get to China, but I think there's two near-term issues that I want to talk about first. And maybe we'll take Russia to start. The Russians are amassing troops along the Ukrainian border. The Ukrainians say there's up to 90,000 Russian troops there. I find it deeply concerning. I'm actually worried about those Russian troops coming across that border. So that's one near-term issue with Russia. The other near-term issue is so-called Havana Syndrome. These attacks around the world against our intelligence officers and our diplomats. The cause of these attacks are unknown. We can't pin it on Russia at this point. We don't have enough evidence to do that, but everybody thinks it's Russia. So Russia, all of a sudden is is at the top of the national security list again here. How do we think about deterring the Russians from going into Ukraine, from conducting these attacks? How should we think about dealing with Putin, I guess, is the fundamental question here? LEON PANETTA: Well, you know, having been an analyst at CIA, and you know this as well, Jeremy, having dealt with the Russians, I mean, I remember there were moments when I was director, I thought there was an opportunity to try to find areas that we could work together with the Russians and we were pursuing that. But I always remember these old timers at CIA basically saying, \"Don't waste your time.\" And now I understand them better than ever, because I think Putin - we know Putin. I think we know him pretty well, frankly, from an intelligence point of view. And that he is a bully. And what bullies do when they sense weakness, they become bullies. I think Putin has sensed weakness on the part of the United States going back a ways, and he felt he could take advantage of that weakness, and that's why Crimea fell, and that's why Ukraine is in the situation it's in, and the Russians go charging into Syria and they conduct these cyber attacks against the United States. I think they've really developed their ability to disrupt. And Putin is smart in the way he's doing this.  And so he's now increasing forces in the Ukraine. At the same time, he's continuing to use cyber. He's continuing to, you know - as far as we know - Russia may be behind the so-called Havana Syndrome that's taking place, which is another form of disruption. And bottom line is that the United States and President Biden- and I think he began to do this when he met with Putin initially - is to make very clear to Russia that there are lines that they can't cross. And when he made clear to Putin that we have infrastructure, sensitive infrastructure -- and by the way, so do the Russians. And that if they do cyber attacks against us, that we can respond in kind. I think that's a smart statement to make with Putin so that he understands that there is a price to be paid. And if he doesn't think we're going to act, if he doesn't think we're going to be true to our word, then that makes Russia that much more dangerous. JEREMY BASH: Yeah, I just think a key here is NATO, because what Putin fears fundamentally is that there's a transatlantic alliance between the United States and 27, 25 other countries on the European continent, in his quote, unquote \"near abroad,\" as he would call it, that as a military alliance - which, by the way, is a nuclear military alliance, we've got tactical nuclear weapons in Europe to deter Russian aggression - that that military alliance will hang together and that if Russia poses a threat to the European continent, to our interests, that will rally together. Now, of course, Ukraine is not in NATO. So he feels like he's got some room to push the envelope. But I think we have to figure out ways, through our alliance and through our direct messaging, to say to him that effectively, \"We will regard your usurpation of the sovereignty of another country on the European continent as something that Europe and the United States will together defend.\" And I think Russia has gotten very good at asymmetric warfare as, Mr. Secretary, you just laid out. I think we've got to increase our capabilities to push back in those domains as well. MICHAEL MORELL: So the other thing that he fears, right, is his own people coming out into the streets and saying, \"We don't like the direction our country's going. We want a greater say in how we're governed. And by the way, we want you to go away.\" He's afraid of that. And that's what happened in Kiev, right? That's why he reacted so strongly in the first place to what happened in Ukraine. And so I think as we think about our policy choices, we need to think about threatening him with sanctions that really would bite the Russian economy, right? The sanctions that have been imposed so far by President Obama and President Trump and President Biden, with one little exception, which I want to come back to, have been sanctioning specific individuals and specific entities. We haven't hit the economy itself. And I think that when President Biden put on his sanctions in April in response to a number of things the Russians had done, he did the entities and he did the people, but he took a shot across the bow. He told American financial institutions that they could not buy Russian sovereign debt. That was designed, beautifully, I think, as a message to Putin that we were willing to kind of go nuclear on the sanctions if he continues to misbehave. So we have to make him think that we will hurt his economy if he does something reckless. I think that's really important. LEON PANETTA: Yeah. Look, the bottom line is we have to be credible. Credible in terms of what we say we're going to do with Russia. Because I think, you know, there are kind of two or three things that happened over these last number of years that gave Putin a sense that we were not credible. One was the fact that President Trump kept undermining the NATO alliance and kept -- I mean, he was doing he was doing Putin's work, to be frank, because his disruption of NATO was exactly what Putin was looking for. Anything that disrupts NATO, anything that weakens NATO is to Putin's advantage. And so that was happening. Secondly, the United States was not responding when he went into Crimea, when he went into Ukraine, when Russia went into Syria, went into Libya. And even on the cyber stuff, I mean, when they were doing the cyber attacks against the United States, I was always asking myself, \"Where is the offensive side of our cyber capability to make clear to the Russians that if they're going to do this to us, we're going to do it to them?\" And so I think Putin got a clear message that he could basically do what what the hell he wants to do. That has got to change now. You're right on how we approach with sanctions. I do think we've got to continue to support the Ukraine to make clear that we are, you know, we are going to give them every capability to try to protect themselves. We need to continue to strengthen NATO so that we're we're sending a clear message that NATO is not going away and that we're willing to use Article Five if necessary, if he decides to move in other places. I think there's a series of steps that the United States has to take that'll say to Putin, \"This is a different game now. You're not going to get a license to do whatever the hell you want.\" That's number one. Number two, I think if we do that in a credible way, I actually think you can then sit down and talk with the Russians. I think there is that opening because Putin will say, \"Wait a minute, these guys really do mean trouble\" and that it is worth talking about nuclear constraints and some of the other things we can do together on terrorism. So I think it really makes sense to have the United States really, really become the world leader that, we'd been since World War II and that we have to get back to being. MICHAEL MORELL: Mr. Secretary, you talked about the intelligence assessment of Putin - thug, bully. That's absolutely right. I think Bob Gates said, \"When you look in his eyes, you see KGB, KGB, KGB,\" right? And part of that intelligence assessment of him is the only thing that matters to him is relative power. How much do I have? How much do you have? And so if you can give him the perception that you do have power and you're willing to use it, that changes the dynamic completely. JEREMY BASH: Yeah, absolutely. I think President Biden set up his Europe engagement earlier this year exactly right, which is, meet with democracies, meet with the European Union, meet with NATO, even with all of the entities that Russia fears. And then at the end, sit down, Putin say, 'We've got the world rallied behind our model of democratic capitalism, a free market, economies of the liberal international order of human rights. We're watching you. And if you try to impose your model militarily or otherwise on the free world, they're going to be consequences.\" LEON PANETTA: Yeah, I think the thing that Putin may very well test is whether President Biden is words or whether it's action. And they may at some point try to test that, just to determine whether or not the United States really has bite here. MICHAEL MORELL: He may be doing that right now as we speak on the Ukrainian border. That may be what this is about, right? And the really hard question comes - what if he does go across that border? What does President Biden do? Or what if a third country arrests a team of Russian intelligence operatives with the weapon that is making people sick from this Havana Syndrome? What does President Biden do? Right? That's a really tough question. JEREMY BASH: Yeah. And that's where I think we've got to be clear-eyed and impose actual costs and consequences, particularly on the Havana Syndrome, because that's no different than, frankly, a terrorist organization blowing up our people. That's a lethal and a sub-lethal weapon directed at our people. And as you guys who had to lead organizations where you send people into harm's way, you know that nothing is more important than force protection. MICHAEL MORELL: You know, in a way, Jeremy, you just made me think of something. If Russia is behind Havana Syndrome, they are a terrorist state. These are terrorist acts. LEON PANETTA: Those are acts of war, not just terrorist acts. MICHAEL MORELL: Absolutely. So let's talk about Iran a little bit because this is not getting enough attention, either. I don't think Russia is getting enough attention in media and I don't think Iran is getting enough attention.  So the Iranians in the past two years - I'm playing the role of briefer here - LEON PANETTA: Well, you're right at home. (Laughter) MICHAEL MORELL: The Iranians in the past two years have aggressively pushed their nuclear program forward. They're employing advanced centrifuges to enrich uranium. They're enriching uranium to 60 percent. Power reactors need between three and five, and they're enriching to 60. They are producing uranium metal, which is what you do when you want to make a nuclear weapon. It's at the core of a nuclear weapon. And they're occasionally cutting access to the International Atomic Energy Agency. So they are moving aggressively forward.  I've had experts tell me that they are further along today on their nuclear program than they were when we made the nuclear deal with them in 2015. So they're doing that. They're also being very aggressive in the region against Sunni Arab countries and against the United States. Iranian proxies conducted an attack just two weeks ago against our forces in Syria. They routinely - Iranian proxies in Iraq routinely attack the embassy in Baghdad. Iran itself is fighting Israel in Syria. The Israelis are watching all of this. Some experts believe that the Israelis are thinking again about taking matters into their own hands with regard to the Iranian nuclear program, possibly thinking about conducting a strike. So Iran, again, is, as it was for us, right in 2011 and 2012, a major issue. So how do we think about this? LEON PANETTA: I think in many ways Iran is doing what Putin is doing what China is doing, is basically testing the United States. And there, obviously, Iran has a hard line government - become more hardline now - they're doing all of the things you talked about in terms of continuing to enrich their nuclear capability, their nuclear fuel and I really believe they are moving towards the ability to quickly develop a nuclear weapon. And all the pieces are coming together.\u00a0 And without question, Israel is going to be very concerned if they feel that Iran can rush to the development of a nuclear weapon. When Israel was concerned about about it when we were in office, there was not much question in our mind that Israel was in fact planning to attack Iran. And we obviously spent a lot of time -- President Obama spent a lot of time trying to convince them not to do something on their own. That we, too, would react if they developed a nuclear weapon and that we had a greater capability to be able to do something about it and hold the alliance together. And Israel, to its credit, you know, decided to work with us rather than against us on that. I think we may face the same issue now, which is that if Israel feels that the United States is not moving fast enough to try to deal with this issue - and again, that comes down to these negotiations and whether or not Iran really does show up and try to negotiate and whether it looks serious because the concern I have is that I'm not seeing a real sense that they're serious about sitting down and trying to return to the former agreement. If I saw that there was an effort to try to somehow renegotiate that agreement, not just on nuclear, but some of these other areas and that that was where everybody was going to go, I'd feel a lot better about the situation.  But my concern is that if this is just on the nuclear issue, I think Iran is going to play us for chumps. And if they do that, then we could very well have a situation where the United States is going to have to decide whether we are going to have to work with Israel to try to restrain them from developing a nuclear weapon. That's going to be a big decision. MICHAEL MORELL: I think the politics in both countries suggests that getting to a deal is going to be really hard because if you're President Biden and you cut a deal with the Iranians on the nuclear front, you're going to face the same criticism that President Obama faced right before a midterm election. And if you're in Iran and you're a hardliner, the argument that another deal with America when they walked away from the first one, right, is a pretty strong argument. So I don't think the politics are good here in either place for getting to a deal. JEREMY BASH: Yeah, I agree. And think about it: the Iranians are going to probably only settle for a worse deal for us from our perspective, meaning a better deal for them because they're going to say, \"Hey, Trump can be re-elected in 2024 and they'll yank out. And so we'll be right back where we were.\" So our ambitions have to be calibrated a little bit. I think we have to condition the discussion here and on the Hill to say, \"Look, if we get a deal, it's actually not going to be as good as the JCPOA.\" Even though everyone is trying to say it should be better and stronger and longer-lasting than the JCPOA - it's not going to be as good. That's the fundamental decision we're going to make, which is, do we do a deal that's not as good because we hope that the best way to prevent Iran from getting a weapon is some form of diplomacy and trying to keep our eye on it. And what worries me, Michael, is that we've got relatively little visibility into their program. They keep IAEA inspectors out at their will, and we know from other reporting that they're developing their program. And so I think actually Secretary Blinken hit the right note, which is, on a CBS program, Face the Nation, he said last weekend, \"We have to keep all options on the table.\" He kind of went back to that framework, implying that there could be a military consequence to Iran having a breakout capability. MICHAEL MORELL: We really have to do the two things the Secretary talked about is, one, we have to convince the Iranians that we are willing to use force if necessary, and we have to convince the Israelis that we're willing to go with them in the right circumstances. OK. China. Which may, at the end of the day, be the hardest of these. China's now seen by many people as an enemy. It's really hard to find anybody on Capitol Hill who has anything nice to say about China. It's still maybe one of the few issues where Democrats and Republicans actually agree on. So maybe the place to start on China is, how do we see the challenge that China poses to the United States? LEON PANETTA: This discussion just confirms something I've been saying for a long time, which is there are an awful lot of danger points in the world today that the United States is confronting, any one of which could result in a major conflict of some kind. And that's certainly true with China. But it also raises the issue that the United States alone - while we're obviously a powerful country militarily and that we have a strong, hopefully a strong diplomatic arm as well - that we're not going to be able to deal with these challenges alone. We have got to build alliances, obviously in dealing with Russia. We've got to strengthen NATO. In dealing with Iran, we have to have our allies with us, both moderate Arabs, Israel as well as European countries.  And when it comes to China, I think we have got to really build up our allies there. Now, the administration has taken some steps to have the Quad, have Australia, India and South Korea and Japan work with us. And that's important. I think, frankly, we ought to be doing more with the ASEAN countries to try to build up their security and work with them and build a stronger alliance with them. Because I think the one thing that China and Russia, for that matter, Iran, the one thing they hate are alliances and our strength is really the ability to pull these alliances together. MICHAEL MORELL: They don't have alliances. People don't want to be friends with them. LEON PANETTA: They're autocracies. And so I think China clearly represents a concern for the future. We know what they're doing technologically. We know the investments they're making. We know that they're trying to explore, again, the vacuum that they thought the United States left for them. They're going into marketplaces that we should have been in. They're going into countries with with all of their financing, with their diplomacy and kind of putting a lot of pressure on other countries to abide by China's interests. They are being very aggressive. And I think they're operating on the basis that the United States might very well not act. And again, I guess it comes back to that message that I thought we had to send Putin. I think it's the same message we have to send Xi, which is that we will. We will, in fact, take action. They need to know that and that there's a better way to try to resolve our differences through negotiation. MICHAEL MORELL: So one part of this strategy is the allies. The other part of the strategy has to be getting our own house in order, both economically, particularly from a technological perspective, and politically, right, because if we don't, then it really doesn't matter, right? We lose. And so, you know, at the end of the day, this comes back to us here at home and the kind of mess we're in politically and what that means for getting things done that move our economy and our society forward. How do you think about that, Jeremy? JEREMY BASH: Well, I think we are on the cusp of a new era of industrial strategy in the United States, meaning we need to have a regulatory approach, we need to have a foreign policy approach, and we need to have a domestic investment approach that matches the moment and the challenge that China presents. So if you look at what Xi Jinping has said publicly, he's said, \"We want to dominate artificial intelligence, quantum, 5G, autonomy, life sciences, space and cyber.\" And these are areas where the United States and our allies have to stay aligned on our regulatory approach. Are we going to just break up Big Tech because we don't like the last thing Facebook did? Or are we actually going to keep our major technology companies which invest in those areas strong, capable, globally-deployed to compete with the Huaweis and the Weibos and the TikToks? That's a regulatory approach on national security. As the Secretary mentioned, I think we have to improve our alliance structure and and build out other new capabilities. But third, we have to invest here at home in the technology areas that will make us be able to compete globally and we have to get infrastructure passed because if we're strong at home and we have renewal and we have capability at home, then we'll be able to prove our model. And after all, the industrial strategy competition is really about the model of state capitalism, state-controlled capitalism and autocracy, versus free market capitalism. And I think we have to prove the value of our model to deliver for our people. MICHAEL MORELL: We have to get over this fear of the government working together with industry, right? And actually, if you go back to the beginning of the Cold War, we did. We did. The government and industry worked together to put together all sorts of intelligence and weapons systems that helped win the Cold War.  But Mr. Secretary, I'm going to give you the last word here on American politics, because we got to get that right, too, if we're going to be strong in the world. So how do we do that? How do we get out of this mess we're in politically? LEON PANETTA: Well, and that really brings us to probably the greatest threat we face. I think it was Mike Mullen, I remember, once said that that the debt is probably one of the big threats to our national security.  And I would say that today, probably the greatest threat is the dysfunction in our democracy and the inability of both parties to be able to work together to govern and to do the things that Jeremy was talking about. Because if if we're going to develop an industrial policy, if we're going to deal with China, we're going to deal with Russia, if we're going to deal with our allies, we've got to show the world that we can govern and that is what worries me the most right now because, I look at our democracy, which has to deal with all these challenges, and I see two parties that are in their trenches throwing grenades at one another as opposed to working together. And you know, I understand the politics. We've dealt with politics our entire history. But in the end, both parties have been willing to recognize that when it comes to national issues that affect our security, they have to work together. So the answer to your question in the end, Michael, is leadership and whether or not we're going to lead. I often tell the students at our institute that in a democracy we govern either by leadership or crisis. And I think too often today we're governing by crisis. And somehow we have got to be able to get people who are willing to lead, but more importantly, take the risks that you have to take in order to lead. Leadership is not about taking care of your base. It's not about being popular. It's not about playing the political game. Leadership is about taking risks in order to be able to protect our country. MICHAEL MORELL: Secretary Panetta, Jeremy, thank you so much for joining us. This brought back great memories of the favorite hour of my day. LEON PANETTA: I felt very comfortable with this discussion. We've done it a hundred times before. (Laughter). MICHAEL MORELL: Thank you both.",

            "article_content": "\"We were normal, good, law-abiding citizens, and you guys did this to us!\" shouted one aggrieved man. \"We can now add January 6, 2021 to that very short list of dates in American history that will live forever in infamy,\" said Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.  Just how will history record this day? Was it a riot? Domestic terrorism? An insurrection?  Our best hope is that it's at least a turning point. The symbol of our democracy shuddered under the pounding. Those watching at home shuddered, too. The extremists brought Confederate flags, nooses, body armor, and zip-ties for handcuffs.  The images prompted President-Elect Joe Biden to use a word we rarely hear from our leaders \u2013 certainly not about ourselves. \"This is not dissent,\" Biden said. \"It borders on sedition.\" Since Election Day, it's as if there had been a pot of political stew left on the stove to burn, simmering with conspiracy theories about the election \u2026 delusions not just glowing in the underbelly of the internet, but from the White House and many members of Congress, too.  \"A lot of these folks have been hearing for months now that the election has been stolen from them; they heard that it was going to be stolen from them before Election Night,\" said Renee DiResta, a researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory, which in part studies the use of misinformation online. \"They had been fed a consistent, misleading false narrative alongside calls from the more extreme elements that said, 'We have to do something about this.' The idea that this was going to stay as some online message board commentary is just wildly na\u00efve.\" \"Because it had real world consequences?\" asked correspondent Lee Cowan.  \"There's no distinction anymore been online and offline,\" DiResta said.  With just hours before Joe Biden's victory was set to be certified, came a battle cry: \"We will never give up, we will never concede,\" President Trump told his supporters. \"You don't concede when there's theft involved.\" On Capitol Hill Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had lost, too. Georgia's runoff election will soon leave him in the minority \u2013 and yet, he was prepared to accept what his president couldn't. \"If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral,\" he said.  Still, eight Republican Senators and 139 House Republicans were still intent on stalling the inevitable \u2013 announcing they would object to the certification of Joe Biden as the winner.  \"What does it say to the nearly half the country that believes this election was rigged, if we vote not even to consider the claims of illegality and fraud in this election?\" stated Texas Senator Ted Cruz on the Senate floor.  Outside, the tidal wave of denial began pouring down Pennsylvania Avenue. It crashed onto the steps of the Capitol, and seeped all the way to the doors of the House Chamber itself.  Guns were drawn. Representatives fled. People died, including U.S. Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, a 12-year veteran of the force. Scores of arrests have been made in the wake of the mayhem, and the FBI promises there will be more.\u00a0 It is into the teeth of that America the next administration is about to walk.  \"Nobody looks at this country and says, 'I wish my government worked like that!'\" said Ian Bremmer, a geopolitical strategist of sorts \u2013 he founded the Eurasia Group, which advises clients on political risk. \"In 1989 when the [Berlin Wall] came down, we won the Cold War because people around the world looked to the United States as an example of good governance. You can't say that today.\" This past week, Bremmer said, was just the latest tarnish on our reputation: \"Anyone that thinks that we are suddenly going to be welcomed back as America is going to be the global policeman, the architect of global trade, we're the cheerleader of global values \u2026 we have squandered that legacy.\" Congress did resume its Constitutional duties that night, presided over by the outgoing Vice President. \"To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today, you did not win,\" Mike Pence said.  There were calls for restraint heading in to the all-night session. \"The best way we can show respect for the voters who are upset is by telling them the truth!\" said Senator Mitt Romney.\u00a0 Sen. Cory Booker said, \"We brought this Hell upon ourselves!\" With the halls and offices around them laying in ruin, some of those who had objected to certifying the election changed their minds. Others didn't. It didn't matter. By 3:46 a.m., the Electoral College vote counting was over; Joe Biden defeated President Trump 306-232.  In the days that followed, whispers of declaring Mr. Trump unfit for office turned into actual discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment.  House Democrats drafted an Article of Impeachment against the president, for inciting an insurrection. It could be acted on as early as Monday. \"He must be removed from office,\" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\u00a0 By Friday Twitter had banned the President. His more than 88 million followers will have to find him someplace else. Facebook and Instagram blocked him, too.  Those watching the collapse from inside the White House urged the President to publicly grasp a reality that some are still sure he doesn't necessarily believe. That did not apparently include attending his rival's inaugural. He announced he would pass on that. While Mr. Trump seemed to accept he had lost the battle, he still insisted the war is far from over.\u00a0 \"To all of my wonderful supporters,\" the president added, \"I know you are disappointed, but I also want you to know, that our incredible journey is only just beginning.\" Abraham Lincoln once talked of the choice between rule and ruin. That was tested this past week.  But unity isn't some kind of unicorn.\u00a0You might remember a moment on 9/11, after the Capitol was spared an attack, when Democrats stood next to Republicans and spontaneously broke into a chorus of \"God Bless America.\" Whatever acrimony existed, whatever perceived sins had been committed, melted under a common purpose: to defend democracy. That was two decades ago. Hardly ancient history \u2026 at least, we hope.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For more info:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Story produced by Mark Hudspeth.

            "article_content": "When Republican Rep. Bill Posey of Florida ended an Oct. 21 House floor speech with a fist pump and the phrase \"Let's go, Brandon!\" it may have seemed cryptic and weird to many who were listening. But the phrase was already growing in right-wing circles, and now the seemingly upbeat sentiment \u2014 actually a stand-in for swearing at Joe Biden \u2014 is everywhere. South Carolina Republican Jeff Duncan wore a \"Let's Go Brandon\" face mask at the Capitol last week. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz posed with a \"Let's Go Brandon\" sign at the World Series. Sen. Mitch McConnell's press secretary retweeted a photo of the phrase on a construction sign in Virginia. The line has become conservative code for something far more vulgar: \"F--- Joe Biden.\" It's all the rage among Republicans wanting to prove their conservative credentials, a not-so-secret handshake that signals they're in sync with the party's base. Americans are accustomed to their leaders being publicly jeered, and former President Donald Trump's often-coarse language seemed to expand the boundaries of what counts as normal political speech. But how did Republicans settle on the Brandon phrase as a G-rated substitute for its more vulgar three-word cousin? It started at an October 2 NASCAR race at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Brandon Brown, a 28-year-old driver, had won his first Xfinity Series and was being interviewed by an NBC Sports reporter. The crowd behind him was chanting something at first difficult to make out. The reporter suggested they were chanting \"Let's go, Brandon\" to cheer the driver. But it became increasingly clear they were saying: \"F--- Joe Biden.\" NASCAR and NBC have since taken steps to limit \"ambient crowd noise\" during interviews, but it was too late \u2014 the phrase already had taken off. When the president visited a construction site in suburban Chicago a few weeks ago to promote his vaccinate-or-test mandate, protesters deployed both three-word phrases. This past week, Mr. Biden's motorcade was driving past a \"Let's Go Brandon\" banner as the president passed through Plainfield, New Jersey. And a group chanted \"Let's go, Brandon\" outside a Virginia park on Monday when Mr. Biden made an appearance on behalf of the Democratic candidate for governor, Terry McAuliffe. Two protesters dropped the euphemism entirely, holding up hand-drawn signs with the profanity. On Friday morning on a Southwest flight from Houston to Albuquerque, the pilot signed off his greeting over the public address system with the phrase, to audible gasps from some passengers.  TFW you\u2019re trying to go on vacation and then the pilot says the very thing you\u2019re working on over the loud speaker and you have to try to get him comment but then almost get removed from plane.  https://t.co/xZI5FtLzJB Southwest said in a statement that the airline \"takes pride in providing a welcoming, comfortable, and respectful environment\" and that \"behavior from any individual that is divisive or offensive is not condoned.\" Veteran GOP ad maker Jim Innocenzi had no qualms about the coded crudity, calling it \"hilarious.\" \"Unless you are living in a cave, you know what it means,\" he said. \"But it's done with a little bit of a class. And if you object and are taking it too seriously, go away.\" America's presidents have endured meanness for centuries; Grover Cleveland faced chants of \"Ma, Ma Where's my Pa?\" in the 1880s over rumors he'd fathered an illegitimate child. Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson were the subject of poems that leaned into racist tropes and allegations of bigamy. \"We have a sense of the dignity of the office of president that has consistently been violated to our horror over the course of American history,\" said Cal Jillson, a politics expert and professor in the political science department at Southern Methodist University. \"We never fail to be horrified by some new outrage.\" There were plenty of old outrages. \"F--- Trump\" graffiti still marks many an overpass in Washington, D.C. George W. Bush had a shoe thrown in his face. Bill Clinton was criticized with such fervor that his most vocal critics were labeled the \"Clinton crazies.\" The biggest difference, though, between the sentiments hurled at the Grover Clevelands of yore and modern politicians is the amplification they get on social media. \"Before the expansion of social media a few years ago, there wasn't an easily accessible public forum to shout your nastiest and darkest public opinions,\" said Matthew Delmont, a history professor at Dartmouth College. Even the racism and vitriol to which former President Barack Obama was subjected was tempered in part because Twitter was relatively new. There was no TikTok. As for Facebook, leaked company documents have recently revealed how the platform increasingly ignored hate speech and misinformation and allowed it to proliferate. A portion of the U.S. was already angry well before the Brandon moment, believing the 2020 presidential election was rigged despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary, which has stood the test of recounts and court cases. But anger has now moved beyond die-hard Trump supporters, said Stanley Renshon, a political scientist and psychoanalyst at the City University of New York. He cited the Afghanistan withdrawal, the southern border situation and rancorous school board debates as situations in which increasing numbers who were not vocally anti-Biden now feel that \"how American institutions are telling the American public what they clearly see and understand to be true, is in fact not true.\" Trump hasn't missed the moment. His Save America PAC now sells a $45 T-shirt featuring \"Let's go Brandon\" above an American flag. One message to supporters reads, \"#FJB or LET'S GO BRANDON? Either way, President Trump wants YOU to have our ICONIC new shirt.\" Separately, T-shirts are popping up in storefronts with the slogan and the NASCAR logo. And as for the real Brandon, things haven't been so great. He drives for a short-staffed, underfunded team owned by his father. And while that win \u2014 his first career victory \u2014 was huge for him, the team has long struggled for sponsorship and existing partners have not been marketing the driver since the slogan.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's presidency is over and his Twitter feed silenced, but at the first major conservative gathering of the year, the message is clear: Mr. Trump is here to stay.\u00a0 Elected officials and activists who spoke on the first day of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held in Florida this year, focused on COVID-19 restrictions, the so-called cancel culture, how the 2020 election was administered and the threats they see from Democratic policies. While there was barely any mention of the attack at the Capitol last month, speakers railed against the \"liberal mob\" and riots over the summer. The conference doesn't feature open critics of the former president, so praise for Mr. Trump, who still has the support of most GOP voters, was a theme of the opening day.\u00a0 \"There are a whole lot of voices in Washington that want to just erase the last four years,\" Texas Senator Ted Cruz told the crowd. \"Let me tell you right now: Donald J. Trump ain't going anywhere.\" Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton told a story about an immigrant attributing his economic success to the former president, and celebrated Mr. Trump ability to attract Latino voters in the 2020 election. And Missouri Senator Josh Hawley received a standing ovation when he told the crowd of his objection to the election results on January 6. He blasted Twitter for banning Trump, and ended his speech with: \"America now, America first, America forever.\" Many speakers urged the Republican Party against a return to its pre-Trump origins and criticized some of the policies past GOP leaders have pushed.\u00a0 \"We will not win the future by trying to go back to where the Republican Party used to be,\" said Florida Senator Rick Scott, who also chairs the Senate Republicans' campaign operation. \"If we do, we will lose the working base that President Trump so animated. We're going to lose elections across the country and ultimately we're going to lose our nation.\" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is up for reelection in 2022, set his own mark for conservatives going forward, saying the party rejects open borders, \"weakness\" against China and \"military adventurism.\" \u00a0\"We will not go back to the days of the failed Republican establishment of yesteryear,\" he said. \"Hold the line, stand your ground, and don't ever, ever back down.\" Hawley told the people attending CPAC that they \"represent what's coming next.\" \"To the people who say to us, 'Oh, you're the past. Your moment has passed, it's over. It's Joe Biden's America now,'\" he said. \"I just want to say, 'we're not the past. We're the future,'\" he said. At the event, Hawley wore the widespread criticism of his objection to the counting of Electoral College votes on January 6 as a badge of honor. \u00a0 \"I was called a traitor, I was called a seditionist,\" he said of the reaction to his vote. \"I'm not going anywhere. I'm standing right here. I'm going to stand up for you, because if we can't have free and open debate in this country, we're not going to have a country left.\" His phrasing echoed a remark made by Mr. Trump to his supporters that day: \"If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\" Nearly a dozen speakers at the event have been mentioned as possible 2024 presidential candidates. \"For a second there, I thought we were in Des Moines,\" Cruz quipped about the speaking lineup.\u00a0 Cotton, among the likely White House hopefuls, suggested Republicans might not be running against Biden in four years. \"They want to give amnesty to 15 to 20 million illegal aliens. With no strings attached, with voting rights \u2014presumably in time for what they hope will be Kamala Harris' reelection campaign,\" he said. But as a roster of Republicans compete to boost their profiles, it is Mr. Trump who is the marquee speaker, set to make his first public remarks since leaving office at the conference on Sunday. Mr. Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., joked that the conference should be called \"TPAC\" because of the support the former president has among the audience. He offered a brief preview of his father's speech, telling the crowd, \"I imagine it will not be what we call a 'low-energy' speech. And I assure you that it will solidify Donald Trump and all of your feelings about the MAGA Movement as the future of the Republican Party.\" Polling shows Mr. Trump still holds a firm grip on the Republican Party's base. A Suffolk University/USA Today poll published earlier this week found nearly 6 in 10 Trump supporters said they'd like to see him run for president again in 2024 and 76% said they'd vote for him if he sought the Republican nomination.\u00a0 Saturday's notable speakers include Florida Senator Marco Rubio, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, who have been floated as potential 2024 presidential candidates.",

            "article_content": "Yangon, Myanmar\u00a0\u2014 A young woman who was shot in the head by police last week during a protest against the military coup in Myanmar died Friday, her family said. It was the first confirmed death among thousands of protesters who have faced off against security forces since the junta took power on February 1, detained the country's elected leaders and prevented Parliament from convening. \u00a0 Mya Thwet Thwet Khine was shot during a demonstration in the capital, Naypyitaw, on February 9, two days before her 20th birthday. Video showed her sheltering from water cannons and suddenly dropping to the ground after a bullet penetrated the motorcycle helmet she was wearing. She had been on life support in a hospital with what doctors said was no chance of recovery. \u00a0 Her sister, speaking from the hospital's mortuary, urged people not to give up their struggle to restore democracy. \"Please participate and continue fighting until we achieve our goal,\" said Mya Thatoe Nwe. She said the funeral would be held Sunday. Protesters have hailed Mya Thwet Thwet Khine as a hero and commemorated her during demonstrations earlier this week. News of her death is likely to inflame passions in the protest movement, which has embraced nonviolent civil disobedience. A spokesman for the ruling military did not deny that she had been shot by security forces, but said at a news conference this week that she was in a crowd that had thrown rocks at police and the case was under investigation. There were no independent accounts of her taking part in any violence. Human Rights Watch accused the police in Naypyitaw of having \"blood on their hands.\" \u00a0 \"The officer who pulled the trigger must be investigated, arrested, and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,\" said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of the New York-based group. \"That's the only suitable way to honor the memory of this brave young woman.\" \u00a0 Demonstrations continued Friday in Yangon, the country's biggest city, and elsewhere. Security forces have been relatively restrained so far in confronting protesters in Yangon, but appeared to be toughening their stance in areas where there is less media presence. Police used force for a second day to arrest protesters in Myitkyina, the capital of the remote northern state of Kachin. The Kachin ethnic minority has long been in conflict with the central government, and there has been intermittent armed struggle against the army there for decades. \u00a0 On Thursday night in the southeastern city of Dawei, several people were wounded by rubber bullets when police staged nighttime raids to try to arrest activists, local media reported. Large but peaceful protest marches have taken place in the city, with negotiations between the demonstrators and the authorities to avoid confrontations. \u00a0 Tom Andrews, the independent U.N. human rights expert on Myanmar, told The Associated Press this week that the initial restraint of police in dealing with \"robust citizen opposition to the coup\" has moved in some instances to use of rubber bullets, real ammunition and water cannons. Speaking from the United States, he also said \"hardened\" troops were being deployed from border areas to some cities, raising the possibility of bloodshed and \"a tragic loss of life.\" \u00a0 The junta says it took power \u2014 after detaining national leader Aung San Suu Kyi and preventing Parliament from convening \u2014 because elections last November were tainted by voting irregularities. The election outcome, in which Suu Kyi's party won by a landslide, was affirmed by an election commission that has since been replaced by the military. The junta says it will hold new elections in a year's time. \u00a0 The U.S., Britain and Canadian governments have imposed sanctions on the new military leaders, and they and other governments have called for Suu Kyi's administration to be restored. \u00a0 The coup was a major setback to Myanmar's transition to democracy after 50 years of army rule. Suu Kyi come to power after her National League for Democracy party won a 2015 election, but the generals retained substantial power under the constitution, which was adopted under a military regime.",

            "article_content": "The following is an extended transcript of an interview with Dr. Scott Gottlieb that aired on Sunday, September 19, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: So why did you write this book? Who do you want to read it? DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: A lot of the commentary around what happened, what went wrong, I think was very political. It was focused on a lot of the political mistakes that were made. I don't think anyone started to delve into the more systemic problems, more systemic shortcomings, the structural features of government that I think made us excessively vulnerable to the pandemic. And I wanted to start to tell that story. I think if we're going to make sure we're better prepared if this happens again, and this will happen again, we start- we have to start examining, what are the features of government that failed? Why were we made so excessively vulnerable? And there certainly were political shortcomings, but there were a lot of things about the way the agencies were structured, the way the agencies responded, the kind of planning we had done in the past that we thought would better prepare us for this pandemic that weren't up to the task. MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is something you want public health leaders, lawmakers to learn some lessons from. DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I think at some point we're going to start to reflect on what went wrong. We're going to put together commissions, put together authoritative groups to try to, you know, come to some consensus about what we need to do differently to better prepare for the future. And I want this book to be part of that dialogue. This was my attempt to, you know, lay out what I think some of the things that left us vulnerable were and how we can start to repair them, how we can start to build better resiliency against these kinds of threats going forward. So I would hope that this book is going to be part of that dialogue. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have some personal anecdotes in there. In fact, you start the book talking about the attacks on 9/11 and you were a young resident up in New York City. Why did you start there? DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah. So I was on elective that month. I remember the day. And so I was sort of swing labor. I was an extra hand. I wasn't assigned to a floor. And I was post-call, so I had come off-call the night before. We saw the first plane hit the World Trade Center and then when the second plane hit, I got called into the hospital. And I spent the day working the floors, mostly trying to discharge patients because we thought that there would be a flood of patients coming into the hospital, so we were trying to clear up beds. And then at night I was assigned to a triage center in- in Chelsea Piers, downtown, near the- near the former World Trade Centers. And when I got there, I walked into a field house and it was a cavernous field house and they had set up, at some point over the course of the day, basically the equivalent of hundreds of hospital beds, but not just staffed hospital beds, but these were surgical beds. They had advanced medical equipment in hundreds of stations. And it was- it was like nothing I've ever seen before or since. So somewhere, you know, around New York City, someone had made a decision that New York needed to be prepared for a mass casualty event, and they had mothballed all the equipment that would be needed to do it, to handle it. And they had mothballed the logistics to set it up within hours. And the reason I told that story was because nothing equivalent really existed here. You know, in New York City, we had the first attack on the World Trade Center. There was a decision made by someone at some point that New York needed to make- prepare certain capacities. What I saw was part of that very clearly. And when COVID came, you know, we had this sort of illusion that we had prepared for a pandemic and that we had certain capacities that had been mothballed and preparations that had been made. But they were ill-suited to the- to the crisis we faced. And even the ones that were sort of appropriately measured to what we were facing weren't ready. A metaphor for it was the masks and the ventilators. We had stockpiled, not enough, obviously, masks and ventilators, and they didn't work. The ones we had didn't work. The masks were expired, the ventilators hadn't been serviced. And that's just sort of a metaphor for the lack of preparation. But, you know, I think we didn't- we didn't really have the foresight to understand that a virus could threaten us in this way.\u00a0 We had planned for a pandemic flu. I had been part of some of that planning back in 2003 and 2005 when I was at FDA, during my first- my first stint, but we didn't really understand how the planning that we had engaged in for influenza wouldn't be applicable to a coronavirus. MARGARET BRENNAN: So we prepared for the wrong threat. DR. GOTTLIEB: We prepared for the wrong threat. But even- even if we had prepared for the right threat, the preparations still weren't adequate. We still didn't have the kinds of capacities we needed to, you know, flip- forward deploy the medical resources that would be required. I think we didn't envision that in a setting of a global crisis, there would be a global run on the supply chains that were needed to properly supply the medical equipment. Just the swabs used to conduct diagnostic tests, we ran out of them. One of the bottlenecks to conducting more diagnostic testing wasn't that we didn't have the PCR machines, the sophisticated machines. It wasn't that we didn't have the labs, we didn't have the swabs to actually collect the samples. So we didn't understand that if you had a global crisis of this magnitude, suddenly the supply chains that we relied on would be pulled on by every country at the same time, and we couldn't rely on them anymore. So what we needed was just a whole different mindset. We needed to build domestic capacity to do the production domestically. We needed to keep the- the apparatus that we thought we would need hot, not just warm. We couldn't just build it and mothball it. We needed to keep it operating. We needed to keep it functional. We needed to have a logistical capability to deploy these tools. We didn't- we didn't have the ability to scale diagnostic testing because we couldn't deploy enough testing centers. We didn't have the ability to mass vaccinate the population because we didn't have any mothballed capacity to set up vaccination sites. And that's what I saw on 9/11. I mean, obviously small microcosm. It was a city. It wasn't across the whole country. I mean, the country wouldn't\u00a0 have been able to deal with a crisis of that magnitude, but someone had thought about how to build the apparatus and the means to deploy it very quickly for a certain contingency. We didn't do that against a viral contingency, even though we had anticipated and expected that at some point we'd be challenged with a pandemic. MARGARET BRENNAN: So it's been 18 months now since we were hit with this pandemic. In the book, you write, the next one very well could be a new variant of a bird flu. Are we as vulnerable to that kind of new threat as we were to COVID 19? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think we're still vulnerable. There's nothing that's really been changed with respect- respect to our posture. I think where we might have less vulnerability is that, you know, fool me once, we're more aware of the threats that could emerge from around the world, we might- we're going to respond more quickly. You know, next time we see an emerging infection, we're not going to wait six weeks or two months to start manufacturing the diagnostic tests. So we're going to make certain decisions up front that could have been made earlier in the setting of COVID, weren't because we didn't properly anticipate the threat that it posed. I think next time, you know, we're going to be more apt to do too much and not too little when something emerges. But in terms of the capacities that we need to respond, I don't know that we're any better in terms of our ability to actually mobilize the sort of manufacturing and the distribution capacity that we're going to need. We don't have the infrastructure to do that. Where we're better probably is that we validated some of the technology that we would use against a new threat. So the idea of fully synthetic vaccines being able to pivot very quickly to a vaccine. A lot of the technologies that were sort of available that allowed us to pivot very quickly to the development of countermeasures in this instance now have been validated. We were at a sort of a technological inflection point in the setting of this pandemic with the technologies we used to develop our vaccines and some of our therapeutics. And now-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That was just luck, is what you're saying. DR. GOTTLIEB: We were at the cusp of- we were sort of bridging two scientific states. If this had happened four years ago, we would have developed our vaccines the way we traditionally develop vaccines. We would try to grow the virus in cell cultures, the same way the Chinese developed their vaccine. You grow the virus in large quantities in cell cultures, you inactivate it, you cleave off the proteins and you basically put the virus's proteins in a syringe and that serves as the vaccine stock. That's how we make flu vaccine. What we did in this case was we were able to derive vaccine constructs fully synthetically just off the sequence data alone. So if you look at Moderna's vaccine, Pfizer's vaccine, where I serve on the board of directors, even J&J's vaccine and AstraZeneca's vaccine, the constructs were derived from the sequence. They didn't need the live virus, they didn't need to grow the virus. So we were right at that inflection point where that technology was becoming available, and that allowed us to pivot to vaccines very quickly. If this had happened five years from now, that technology probably would have been mainstreamed. And what happened in the setting of the pandemic is we sort of accelerated our way through that technology curve because we developed the vaccines and we deployed them. 380 million Americans have received a vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: So after the 9/11 attacks, we had this wholesale, you know, rejiggering of the U.S. government and you had a 9/11 commission. Do you think in this setting now that that kind of commission is even possible? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think it's- I think it's necessary. I think we're going to have to do it. I'm-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Politically, is it possible? DR. GOTTLIEB: It's difficult, you know, and I think it's difficult for a variety of reasons. You know, it's probably, I've asked myself, why haven't we done it yet? I mean, there's been some groups that have come together, you know, The National Academy of Medicine, other groups. The Biden administration put out sort of the blueprint for what a pandemic strategy would look like. My- my assumption is it's too early. You know, we're still- we're still grappling with this pandemic. So I keep telling myself, maybe it's too early and that's why Congress hasn't convened a commission. That's why we don't see a bipartisan group emerging to try to do this work. You've seen some legislation proposed, but nothing that's sort of a grand effort to really come up with a comprehensive approach to how we're going to prepare better for the future. I think the other thing we're going to have to grapple with, it's not just a question of the politics of the moment and the inability to get a consensus around big issues. And that is- that is a problem right now. I think that the public health establishment as a whole has taken a hit in the setting of this pandemic. And this isn't just a sort of Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal thing. I think that there's a lot of people around the country who feel that the advice they got from public health officials wasn't precise, changed, wasn't- wasn't formulated in a way where it was sort of immutable, wasn't carefully explained, wasn't propagated in a way that it could be assimilated into people's lives. You know, how do I wear a mask? What mask should I wear? When should I wear a mask? When not? And things changed. And so people were confused by it and lost confidence in it. And I think that there's going to be- part of the dialogue we have around how do we prepare better for the next pandemic, I think, unfortunately, is going to also be a discussion of what role should public health agencies and public health officials play and how much should policymakers really be overseeing what they're doing in the setting of a crisis? Should they really be in control? That's going to be a hard discussion because if we're not going to sort of support the primacy of public health and public health officials in the setting of a- of a public health crisis, it's hard- it's hard to start, it's hard to get started. And I think that's going to be the first bridge we need to cross as we step into this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the elephant in the room with all that politically is also who was president at the time of the pandemic. And I want to come back to that because personality obviously was a factor here. But your broader point is that this is not a book about Donald Trump's leadership. This is a point about the overall health care system in the United States. You say the CDC, which is supposed to be the gold standard public health agency, \"doesn't have an operational capability to manage a crisis of this scale.\" So if the CDC doesn't, who does? DR. GOTTLIEB: Nobody does. I mean, there was a perception early on in this crisis that the CDC has this, that they would have the capacity to develop a diagnostic test and deploy it and gather the data that we would need and do the analytics to try to gauge, you know, sort of scope out what the contours of the response would be, and they would be able to deploy the diagnostic test and deploy the vaccine and stand up this infrastructure. They're not a logistical organization. CDC has a very retrospective mindset. It's a high-science organization that does deep analytical analysis of data that's oftentimes out of sync to when the decisions need to get made. They're not- they're not the JSOC, they're not the Joint Special Operations Command. They don't surface real time information to- to inform current policy making.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not a quick reaction force. DR. GOTTLIEB: Right, they'd rather take the data, analyze it for four months and publish it in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. And the idea that they were going to be able to mass manufacture a diagnostic test and forward deploy it, they clearly- they contaminated their own test. So they- they- they botched the manufacture of their test. But even if they had succeeded, even if they had gotten that test out on time perfectly, what they were going to do- the blueprint was that they would develop tests for the public health labs. Well, the public health labs in this country, there's 100 of them. They can each do about 100 tests a day. So even at full tilt, if everything had gone perfectly, we'd be doing 10,000 tests a day. We needed hundreds of thousands of tests a day. So what had to happen early on was we needed to turn to the commercial manufacturers, like South Korea did, and start mass producing tests. That's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: We needed to turn to private industry earlier in the pandemic. DR. GOTTLIEB: We needed an all-of-the-above approach. We needed to get the public health labs stood up. We needed to simultaneously get the clinical labs stood up, labs inside hospitals. And we needed to get private manufacturers developing test kits that can go in every commercial lab around the country. That needed to happen in January. Certainly by the end of January, we had enough awareness that this could be a global pandemic, that someone could have hit the red button and said, we need it- an all-of-the-above approach here. But CDC had the ball. CDC was following their standard blueprint. Their blueprint is- could keep up with a slow moving outbreak. It was quasi sufficient in the setting of Zika, which was a slower moving infection. But in a fast moving epidemic like this, it was unmatched. And, you know, in fairness to CDC, there were a lot of policymakers who assumed that they would be able to complete this mission and wrongly assumed what their capabilities were. Now, CDC should have raised their hand and said, we really don't have this. I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't they? Is that a failure of Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC, at the time? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think it's very difficult for an agency to have this self-awareness that they don't have the capacity to respond the way they're being asked. And I think it's very difficult for an agency to self-organize differently in the setting of a crisis. And- and so that's asking a lot of them. Ultimately, there was a recognition that you needed to marry the sort of scientific capability of government agencies with the logistical capability of something like a FEMA or a DOD. When we created Operation Warp Speed to try to accelerate the development of a vaccine, because that was a marriage between NIH, the scientists, FDA, the regulators, and the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense brought the capability to know how to scale up manufacturing and scale up distribution. We needed to do that at day one. We needed to get FEMA and the DOD engaged with the CDC in trying to organize a national level response, and that- that was a failure of political leadership. I mean, and it was a failure of vision. But, you know, there were a lot of people who were good political leaders who wrongly assumed the CDC had this mission. MARGARET BRENNAN: So in terms of the American public hearing all these criticisms you're laying out, they're wondering, well has this been fixed yet? When you talk about the CDC, you say they botched the development of a test, they stood in the way of private labs, they applied a flu model, the wrong model, they couldn't imagine looking for asymptomatic spread, they had a lack of data to back up public health decisions. That's a huge indictment. Have any of those things been fixed? DR. GOTTLIEB: Some of them have been fixed. I mean, I think- I think it's better because there's a recognition of those shortcomings. So those- those statements, I don't think are terribly controversial anymore. I think people, either quietly or overtly, recognize the shortcomings of the agency-- MARGARET BRENNAN: We've heard Dr. Deborah Birx say that on FACE THE NATION, we've heard Matt Pottinger, the former deputy national security adviser, say that on FACE THE NATION. I haven't heard a lot of officials talk about the level of detail you are right now and say, we are still with a real big problem at the CDC. DR. GOTTLIEB: Well we haven't done anything to create a new capacity. What you're going to need going forward is an organization, if you want to have true pandemic preparedness, if you want to have better infrastructure for dealing with a public health crisis of this magnitude, you're going to need to have an organization that is in the business of serving- surfacing actionable intelligence, has a different mindset around information, doesn't need to be the final definitive answer, but knows how to surface information to policymakers who are making active decisions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this a new agency? DR. GOTTLIEB: I don't- it could be a new agency, but I think that that would be a mistake. I think the right way to do it probably is to build a capacity inside CDC because if you try to sort of create a new agency, you're going to ignite all kinds of turf wars across Washington. If you try to consolidate agencies, like we did with the Department of Homeland Security, you know, you're stealing other- other agencies' authorities, and that's always difficult. I think this could reside inside CDC, but it needs to be a much different organization. You know, CDC over the years evolved much more towards a disease prevention mission, reducing heart disease, smoking cessation, and away from its core disease control, overseas operations. You know, the- the service that they have, the epidemiological service which goes into hot zones and and, you know, gets samples of viruses and brings them back and studies them and develops countermeasures, that sort of the the heroic part of the agency that's often talked about, movies get made about it. Over time, I think that that has been subordinated to the more policy aspects of the CDC's mission. So I don't know that you sort of fundamentally reform CDC. I think what you try to do is grow up a new capacity inside the organization that has a different culture, different mindset, different resources, different capability. The component that they recently created, where they created this new modeling center inside CDC, a disease- a pandemic modeling center, that could be-- MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration has done this. DR. GOTTLIEB: --right, by the Biden administration. That could be the kernel that becomes the, you know, the new flower inside CDC. I think that the- the mindset of that organization, the people who are staffing it right now, who come out of a national security world, could bring a new esprit de corps into that organization. And you can grow out this capacity from there, but someone needs to build it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Biden administration has asked for $65 billion to strengthen pandemic preparedness. Congress hasn't funded it yet. But-- DR. GOTTLIEB: I don't think this is going to be a money problem. I think people are going to appropriate the funds. I think that it's going to be a strategy problem, and that's really what I try to do here is- is sort of lay out some of the foundation of what went wrong and how we can think of a different strategy. You know, the Biden administration plan that they put forward, it's a high level plan, it has all the right elements, but it's not a plan yet, it's more like a strategic framework for a plan. We still need to decide what that plan is, and there's going to be an intense debate because, you know, people- people's missions are going to be disrupted. You know, CDC, for example, with the diagnostic tests. You know, if we wanted to have the commercial manufacturers early on engaged in developing a diagnostic test, someone had to share the samples, the virus samples, with them. CDC held on to them, wouldn't give them to the commercial manufacturers. Someone needed to create some kind of funding mechanism so the commercial manufacturers had some understanding that they weren't going to just get stuck with the bill. They would have stepped forward. But at some point you needed to fund that. There's no mechanism for that. I mean, BARDA could have done it, but it's not really within BARDA's mandate. They fund very early research. So there was no agency capable of funding the handoff to a commercial manufacturer of a diagnostic test. And I keep coming back to this because a lot of our early problems really flowed from our inability to scale testing. It wasn't just that we couldn't diagnose the infections and tell where the virus was. We couldn't tell where it wasn't. So when we did the '15 Days to Slow the Spread' and the subsequent 30 days to slow the spread, it was basically a national shutdown for 45 days, an extraordinary measure. I mean, a historic decision to shut down most commercial activity in the country. Very clearly, we needed to do that in New York. I mean, New York, the health care system was breached in New York. New York was on the brink of collapse. New Orleans was on the brink of collapse. Boston was on the brink of collapse. Los Angeles had pervasive spread, San Francisco and Seattle. Austin, Texas, didn't have a lot of spread, Jacksonville didn't, Wyoming didn't, but we didn't know. So we shut down the whole country and then when the virus eventually traveled to the Deep South, people down there said, you know what? We're not shutting down now. You told us to do it in the spring and we did, we didn't have to. We're done with shutdowns. And-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And that could have been avoided. DR. GOTTLIEB: That could have been avoided because if we had a diagnostic test and we knew where the virus was and where it wasn't, we could have targeted the population-wide mitigation just to places where the virus was pervasive and in the places where it wasn't yet pervasive, we could have used testing, tracing, quarantines to try to control the spread. It would have eventually become a confluent epidemic across the whole country, but we could have delayed that. We could have substantially delayed that and we could have preserved the political capital in places where the virus wasn't so that when it got there, they would have still been willing to take the tough decisions to close bars, close restaurants, do all the things that we knew were going to control spread and buy us time until we got to a vaccine. But we basically spent that card right up front. We shut down the whole country and we didn't have to. So not having that diagnostic test, what- set in motion a lot of the challenges that we faced going forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: You say, \"the point isn't that federal health officials were wrong, the point is they were working with faulty tools, faulty data sets.\"\u00a0 DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so-- MARGARET BRENNAN: They didn't know what they didn't know. DR. GOTTLIEB: They didn't understand that this wasn't spreading like flu. So they didn't have a diagnostic so they said, well we're going to rely on the Influenza-like Illness Surveillance System. This is a surveillance system that was grown up, in part to deal with a pandemic flu, that basically monitors for people presenting to hospitals with flu-like symptoms who are testing negative for flu. But in any given week, 50,000 people present to hospitals with flu-like symptoms and test negative for flu. So you can have tens of thousands of cases hiding in plain sight with the Influenza-like Illness Surveillance System. Plus, this wasn't always presenting like flu, so people were getting symptoms that didn't comport with flu. So if you're just looking for flu symptoms, you might not see coronavirus spreading. So they were very confident early on that there was no community spread. Meanwhile, there was widespread community transmission. And it wasn't until the beginning of March that Redfield saw a signal in the New York data, picked up the phone, I talk about it, and called Howard Zuckerman, the New York State Health Commissioner, and said, you guys have a problem. It was the first time they saw an outlier. But if you look at the data all through February and you look at the percentages of people presenting with flu-like symptoms who were testing negative for flu, it wasn't- it wasn't red, but it wasn't green. It was at the high end of a normal range. So if you looked at a 10 year average, it was at the high end of that 10 year average, certainly against the backdrop of what was happening around the world. We shouldn't have derived any comfort from that. And so we just didn't have the tools, we didn't have sensitive enough tools to know that there wasn't community spread. And in the absence of not having those tools in place, which would have been a diagnostic test, and actually screening people, we shouldn't have been so confident that this wasn't spreading. We should have been doing things differently in anticipation that this probably was spreading, we just weren't picking it up, which in fact was the case. MARGARET BRENNAN: You also say this should have been viewed as a national security threat, and that's how we need to think of pandemics. President Biden went out in July to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and said generally he agrees with that. What does that actually mean, though? Have you seen the Intelligence Community, to date, react and protect us going forward? Do they have the tools needed? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think the Intelligence Community has different tools that should be focused on this mission. You know, there's two pieces to that- that idea, that we have to look at public health preparedness through the lens of national security. One is the domestic piece, how we prepare, thinking about this as something that could be a low-probability but high-impact event. And how do we prepare about other events like that? The risk of a radiological attack, the risk of a meteor strike. I mean, we make certain preparations for things that are unlikely to happen. But if they happen, they're so catastrophic that we have to prepare. This crowded- this- this subordinated all our other national priorities. We cannot allow something like this to hit us this bad again. So we have to prepare differently domestically. But internationally, what that means is, we've historically relied on international conventions and capacity-building in other nations, basically going into nations that could be- would be hotspots and trying to build capacities in those nations as a way to create an early tripwire to warn us of an emerging disease. We rely on other nations to tell us when they have an outbreak. That has repeatedly failed. It failed in this case, China didn't surface the early information, they still haven't shared the source strains. But we can go through a litany of country after country that was host to novel outbreaks of SARS-like viruses, novel outbreaks of- of influenzas, novel outbreaks of Ebola, that didn't surface the information in a timely fashion. And so the question becomes, can we still rely on the international health regulations and the W.H.O and the World Health Assembly? Are we going to all hold hands again and promise that we really mean it this time and we're going to share information? Or do we need to get our clandestine services more engaged in this mission? And I think we're going to need to get our clandestine services more engaged in this mission. It's one of things I talk about, because that's a very big departure from where we've been in the past. In the past, there was always an assumption that this- that the public health mission was the CDC's mission. The CDC and the public health officials didn't want the spy agencies anywhere near that because they felt it would corrode their authority to act outside the U.S., that everyone would be perceived as a spy. And traditionally, the National Security Agency said, the CDC has this, this really isn't our mission. It was seen as a sort of a softer aspect of the overall national security mission. I think that needs to change. I think given what we've seen, not just how this impacted us, the death and disease, how this changed the course of history, the geopolitical impact. Would China have moved on Hong Kong if the world wasn't distracted by COVID? So we can't allow something like this to happen again, and that's- we're going to have to get our spy agencies involved. There was data very clearly available in China, in Wuhan, that if we were looking for it, we could have detected this much sooner. We could have answered some key questions. We could have seen the asymptomatic spread, we could have seen the human-to-human transmission. There was sequence data that was being- flying around by mid-December inside China, and probably earlier than that, being sent to commercial labs. That signals intelligence that could be intercepted if you know what you're looking for. So there was a lot of information that could have been had. And in the hands of good political leadership, you could have mounted- you could have had some key questions answered early that could have allowed us to mount a more robust response. And a two or four week head start on something like this can make a very big difference. MARGARET BRENNAN: On the intelligence front, you said it was- you talk about a lot of this sort of towards the end of your book, and this is a more current conversation about the origins of COVID. The president ordered this 90-day review of intelligence and it came to basically no conclusion. What did you learn in the course of your research about the origins of COVID? DR. GOTTLIEB: I learned that we're not going to answer this question absent one or two things happening. Either we find the intermediate host, the animal that was the- that spread COVID, or there's a whistleblower inside China. Or someone close to this, who knows that this came out of a lab, comes forward, defects, goes overseas, or we intercept some communication that we shouldn't have had access to. Absent something like that, we're not going to be able to answer this question. This is going to be a battle of competing narratives. I think over time, the side of the ledger that- that says that this might have come out of a lab has grown more robust and the side of the ledger that says this came out of a natural species has not really moved. And if anything, you can argue that side of the ledger has been diminished by a couple of facts. Number one, we've looked for the intermediate host and we haven't found it. And number two, the idea that the- the market, this initial market, was the source of the initial spread has been firmly debunked. Even the Chinese acknowledged that. And that was a big part of the thesis around the zoonotic origin, the animal origin, because the idea was that the animal was in that market. We now know that market wasn't the source of the spread, it was a path along the spread. MARGARET BRENNAN: Beijing has even acknowledged that to a certain extent-- DR. GOTTLIEB: --Beijing has acknowledged it, right-- MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say intermediate host, you mean what happened between the bat and the human.\u00a0 DR. GOTTLIEB: Right-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Who came in between. DR. GOTTLIEB: There's an animal, maybe a pangolin, there's some other animal in between and it could have been- it wasn't necessarily a bat, and it could've been a bat to a human, but we haven't found the virus in nature. And there's been a pretty exhaustive search. The Chinese have mounted an exhaustive search. And I don't think that the fact that they've been looking for it proves that they know it didn't come out of a lab. I think that they would be looking for it, even if they knew it came out of a lab. And the reality is if it came out of a lab, the number of people who actually are aware of that could be a very small subset of people.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say, came out of a lab, you are saying through a lab accident, not a construct? DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah. No, I don't think anyone, and the administration has said this in the intelligence report they put out that they don't believe- they- they've sort of firmly debunked the idea that this was something that could have deliberately come out of a lab or was deliberately engineered. But the possibility is that you've had labs doing research on novel coronaviruses. You had novel coronaviruses being brought to those labs, particularly the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We know that they were doing that research in what's called BSL-2 labs, lower security labs where tight precautions aren't taken. We now know that they were infecting transgenic animals with coronaviruses, with novel coronaviruses-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Transgenic meaning? DR. GOTTLIEB: --as part of the research. Animals with human-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Partially humanized? DR. GOTTLIEB: Right, animals with human immune systems. So that- that again makes- is- is another step that makes it more likely that it could have spread to humans because now you're infecting animals with human immune systems, so they're humanized viruses. You're adapting the viruses to animals to try to infect the human immune system. All those set up the conditions for risk. And we also know that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was a sloppy lab. At the time that it opened there was an article in the journal\u00a0Science\u00a0raising questions about the integrity of that lab, where scientists at the time that it opened in 2017 said, we're worried about the procedures in this lab. We're worried about the training, we're worried about the way it was built. We know that the lab was conducting high-end research with the Chinese military. The French were in that lab and were eventually kicked out. And the time- at the time that they were kicked out, they were aware that the Chinese military had moved into that lab. So there were circumstances created around that facility and there were operating procedures around that facility that created a lot of risk. That doesn't mean it came out of a lab, but it certainly makes that a suspect location. And there was another lab. The CDC, the Chinese CDC, maintained a lab literally blocks from the wet market that was first implicated in this virus that was also conducting coronavirus research in BSL-2 labs. MARGARET BRENNAN: So other than the whodunnit factor, why does it matter? Why do we need to know who Patient Zero is and how will that affect the Biden administration's response? DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, it matters a lot because if we determine that- first of all, if we determine if this came out of a lab or we even assess that there's a high probability that this came out of a lab, I think it changes how we try to govern research internationally. We're going to need something like the International Atomic Energy Agency for BSL-4 labs. We're going to have to look much more carefully about who's creating BSL-4 labs, the kind of research going on in those labs-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the U.N.? DR. GOTTLIEB: Should-- it's going to probably be a global organization, come out of the World Health Organization, some kind of international consensus around providing oversight on these labs because there's a lot of them cropping up right now. A lot of countries are building BSL-4 labs and starting to engage in this high-end research. And the- the most speculative, most dangerous research often goes to the countries willing to conduct it. And the countries willing to conduct it are oftentimes the countries that have the poorest controls. The other thing we're going to need to look at is, do we continue to do things like publish the sequences of novel viruses? So when- when labs create novel compilations, when they create a novel virus for purposes of trying to assess, you know what its- what activity it could have in humans, once you publish that sequence as part of normal scientific discourse and part of the scientific process, you basically provide a recipe to anyone who's a rogue actor on how to manufacture that virus. And I think we're going to have to look at, you know, the- whether or not that's a good idea going forward and maybe not publish information like that, have a consensus that we're not going to publish that kind of information because the other thing that comes out of this is that this hurt us a lot more than it hurt other countries. It hurt the West a lot more than it hurt other countries.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? DR. GOTTLIEB: We proved uniquely incapable of implementing respiratory precautions, getting consensus around things like mask wearing, the mitigation that was required. A lot of countries did better than us. A lot of countries in the Pacific Rim did better than us. And the old doctrine was that no country that's trying to develop a pathogen for a deliberate purpose for- as a bioweapon, and this wasn't a bioweapon. This very clearly was not a weaponized virus. But going forward, a country, a rogue actor that's looking to develop a biological weapon, the presumption was they wouldn't use a respiratory pathogen because it would blow back on them. But now looking at how this disrupted the West relative to other parts of the world, I think that calculus needs to be reassessed. And so it raises the stakes around the risk of doing this research, allowing this research to go on, publishing things that could facilitate this research if we know that there's rogue actors that might be on the margin more likely to look at a novel influenza as something that could potentially be weaponized. And even if you could just develop a respiratory pathogen that could disable, you know, a group of people or, you know, make people sick for three or four days, that might be a weapon you use on troop movements. So, you know, we need to think differently about these risks now, having seen how this disproportionately impacted certain countries relative to others. This was an asymmetric risk to the West and to the United States in particular, relative to other nations MARGARET BRENNAN: Who handled this the best on the global scale? Which countries? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, it's a tough question because there were certain countries that kept the virus out or, you know, were able to preserve life, but-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Australia? DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, but the question becomes, what price did they pay for that, in terms of what they imposed on their population, the economic impact? You know, I think if you look at some of the countries in the Pacific Rim like Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, they handled it very well insofar as they didn't adopt all the same draconian measures that countries like China did where they locked down the entire country, but they were still able to maintain control over it. And, you know, in South Korea's case, they did it through very aggressive testing and tracing. They employed certain aspects of their, you know, state apparatus to basically collect information on people that wouldn't have been feasible in a Western democracy. We would never have tolerated it. But I don't think- people always point to that and say, you know, we couldn't do what South Korea did because they- they used their police state to basically monitor people. That was a small aspect of what they did. I think the core of what they did was really deploying testing on a massive scale, encouraging people to get tested. They literally had testing devices for sale in vending machines, in subway stations, and using that as a way to get people diagnosed and encouraging people to get into quarantine if they have the infection. That was the core of what they did and they did it successfully.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Who didn't handle it well? I mean, do you put the United States on the list of worst responders? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, I think it's hard to say who handled it the worst. I think that we're at- we're at the top of the list of countries that were the hardest hit by the pandemic for sure, and had a very difficult time putting in place the measures that were going to help control the spread. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that simply just because we track what's happening? I mean, is that an unfair criticism to say, the United States? DR. GOTTLIEB: No, there's I think there is good enough global tracking among a lot of our counterparts that we can make an assessment that we were disproportionately impacted by this. I mean, there were certainly countries that had a higher death rate on a per capita basis. There were countries as hard, if not harder hit, but of the industrialized countries, of countries that- where there was an expectation that we'd be able to do better, where we had tremendous capacities, where we had a very good health care system, where we had access to the technology, we had the ability to develop therapeutics and vaccines and get early access to them. Relative to what our assets set was, we did pretty badly with this virus. MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of are we better now, you wrote that the virus \"rode in on the breath of hundreds of thousands of travelers.\" Both Presidents Biden and Trump put in travel restrictions. Would you tell the Biden administration now to lift them? Because you're arguing they're largely ineffective. DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, they're largely ineffective now. I mean, I think that if we're going to put in place a travel restriction, you know, you could defend, a- a travel restriction that requires people to be vaccinated to come into the country. If we're trying to create, you know, a bubble around activity in this country and putting in place our own mandates around vaccination, it makes sense to require people to be vaccinated if they come in. That's something I think that's defensible. But the idea of broad travel restrictions based on region, when there's just as much virus here as there are in parts of the world where we're restricting access, I don't think that makes sense anymore. You know, the travel restrictions had limited value early on. I think we over-relied on the travel restrictions and we thought we could actually erect walls and keep this virus out or keep it out for longer than we could. We couldn't. They weren't nearly as effective, I think, as people assumed or even people now sort of surmised. But- but there was some logic in putting in place some travel restrictions early when we knew that there were specific countries, Italy in particular was heavily seeding New York. Obviously, people traveling from Wuhan where there was a raging epidemic, those kinds of restrictions made sense at the time. At this point, there's so much virus around the world, I'm not sure what we're keeping out. We're more likely to have restrictions imposed on us than be in a position of imposing restrictions on other nations. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well you also make the argument that that can backfire because you say then countries are- are basically not incentivized to come clean.\u00a0 DR. GOTTLIEB: Well this-- MARGARET BRENNAN: They're- they're incentivized to cover up what's happening. DR. GOTTLIEB: Right, this gets back to the question of, will we need to rely on our clandestine services more to gather information? So if we go into this, and we've already started down this path, and we go back to the World Health Assembly, the W.H.O. convenes a meeting, everyone comes together and says, we really mean it this time. Now we're going to- if something like this emerges again, we're all going to agree that we're going to share the data, we're going to share the source strains. Well, what did COVID teach the world? COVID taught the world that if you're host to an emerging infection that looks threatening, the first thing other countries are going to do is erect trade and travel restrictions on you and try to isolate you. Like before COVID, that was controversial. The idea of actually isolating an- a nation was highly controversial because there was a presumption that if you isolate a nation that's host to an outbreak, you'll destabilize that nation and make it harder for them to combat the outbreak. But what's the first thing that happened when the British said, we have this- this concerning new strain of COVID called B.1.1.7 that seems more contagious. The French closed the Chunnel, right? So now we've taught nations that if you come forward and raise your hand that you're host to an outbreak, you're going to face some kind of sanction for that. So if that's the case, how can we rely on countries being forthcoming? We're going to have to rely much more on our ability to actively gather the information we need of an emerging outbreak and not just hope that people tell the truth and tell it in a timely fashion. MARGARET BRENNAN: So away from airports to other borders, here at home. You've advised a number of governors, Democrats and Republicans, on how to respond to this pandemic. Which cities, which states actually handled this well? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think my home state of Connecticut did a good job. And if you look at what the governor did there, he deployed testing very aggressively early. They rolled out the vaccine on the- on the basis of age. They kept it simple. They got the population vaccinated very quickly by keeping the- the framework by which they were distributing vaccines just simple, you know, older people first and they walked down the age continuum. They put in place community-based sites to try to go into hard-to-reach community and make vaccine accessible. The state has 85 percent of its adult population vaccinated now, one of the highest in the nation. There were a lot of things done early with the testing, the focus on the nursing homes in that state, that I think put it in a better position. Now, Connecticut suffered badly in the first throes of this epidemic, as did the entire tri-state region. That was a time when we were- we didn't know what we were dealing with. I mean, we were literally treating COVID with hydroxychloroquine and Pepcid. So, you know, there was excessive death and disease during that first wave, and Connecticut was not spared that first wave. But I think they learned and put in place a lot of measures that helped them weather this better than other states. Massachusetts, too, I- I worked with Governor Baker up there and had a very heavy focus on testing. In most days, Massachusetts was top of the list of 50 states in terms of the amount of testing they were doing. They pioneered wastewater testing as a way to get an early tripwire. So you shed coronavirus into your feces and so you can actually look at sewage to see when coronavirus levels are rising as a barometer of how much virus is in the population. They pioneered the use of that to be able to detect when the virus was starting to circulate in communities so they could target the public health measures into communities where the virus was starting to spread. So a lot of use of testing very early, I think, put them also in a better position. Now again, the Northeast suffered badly from this virus. You have a lot- you have dense cities, you had early introduction of the virus. But I think relative to where we- they could have been, they made some good decisions. MARGARET BRENNAN: You named a Democrat and a Republican.\u00a0 DR. GOTTLIEB: I did.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: All of this has become politicized. Do you think that with the rollout of boosters, for example, which is again going to test some of the public messaging and trust, what is the lesson for the Biden administration as they roll out boosters? Do they need to change the playbook from what the Trump administration did? DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I think the logistical lesson on the rollout of the boosters is that they need to have in place the infrastructure to actually distribute those vaccines in hard-to-reach communities and hard-to-reach settings. And so that- the challenge during the Trump administration, with the early days of rolling out the vaccine, the vaccine was authorized by FDA mid-December. We didn't start vaccinating inside the nursing home until weeks after that, and this was a point in time when the nursing homes were really the setting with the most death and disease. We were losing at the peak about 7,000 people a week across nursing homes in the U.S.. And it was a point, I had talked to some health officials at the time, and I said, we've done everything we can. You know, they restricted access to visitors, they were testing the staff, and they couldn't keep the virus out of nursing homes and couldn't keep the patients safe. And so the only thing, people said to me, the only way we're going to prevent this epidemic from spreading in these settings is by vaccinating the population. So there was an awareness of how important a vaccine was in that setting. But it took a full, probably three weeks, until we really started that because the logistical planning hadn't been put in place in advance of the authorization. So the vaccine was authorized, then they started the process of getting the consents, the informed consent in place to actually go into the nursing homes and start distributing the vaccine. I think what the Biden administration has done here is by backing into an approximate date, and I know they were beaten up a little bit for putting out a date ,but by putting out an approximate date, they're now able to start that planning process in advance and so that the boosters are made available by FDA, if FDA does authorize it and the advisory committee, the CDC ultimately judges it to be appropriate for a certain population, they're going to be ready to start making it available to nursing homes right away. So there's not going to be a delay. So I think they're in a better position. I don't know that the vaccine boosters are going to be controversial from the standpoint of sort of right versus left politics. I think where the fault lines are going to be is on some of the mandates that the administration is putting in place. And I think there the question you need to ask is whether or not the benefits of the mandates in terms of what you're going to achieve is going to be offset by the cost in terms of the acrimony and the political division and the hardening of positions of people who see this as something that's being forced on them where their decision making is being taken away. The more we can allow people to feel empowered around this decision, even people who are skeptical of getting vaccinated, the more likely they are to make the decision to get vaccinated. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you just emphasized some of the fault lines there. You worked for two Republican administrations, for the Bush administration and for the Trump administration. How does it sit with you when you hear members of your party, the Republican Party, describe all this along civil liberties lines? Not making the medical argument, but simply around civil liberties. DR. GOTTLIEB: Look, I think it's a misjudgment, because I think that there is- there is this argument that this is an individual choice. Your choice to get vaccinated is an individual choice, and it's not an individual choice. This is a- this is a decision that affects your community. This is a collective choice. If you go- and just like with childhood vaccinations, if you go into a school setting and you're not vaccinated for measles and you introduce measles into that setting, you're affecting your community. So these are collective decisions. But I think to the extent that they're decisions that impact the community, impact your workplace, if you're- if you choose to be unvaccinated, you introduce the virus into your workplace and a worker takes it home and then infects their young child. You introduce it into a school, you didn't vaccinate your child, your child introduces it to the school. I think if we're going to impose requirements on vaccination, to the extent possible, we should be making those decisions at the local community level within the context of the community that's going to be affected by that choice, rather than pull this away and make this a federal decision. So I don't think governors should tell schools and businesses, you can't mandate a vaccine. If a business makes a decision that the only way that I could protect my employees or- or my customers is by having a fully vaccinated workforce, they should have the ability to make that decision.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not just shots, we're talking about masks. I mean, it has become a partisan issue and still is. In the state of Florida, for example, a ban on mask mandates. That is at the local level.\u00a0 DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, and the- and the mask debate is inexplicable to me. I can't- I can't decouple it. I can't explain it. I can't defend it because, you know, at least with the vaccine, there's people- people generally, I worked at FDA and I had- I've treated patients and I've talked, counseled a lot of patients through difficult medical decisions. People generally have an apprehension about taking a medical product, especially when they're healthy, especially for a preventative purpose. I understand just sort of people's general questions and concerns about a novel medical product, but a mask is such a simple intervention. It's not going to cause you any harm. It's just an act of, you know, community responsibility, it's an act of respect. You know, even after I was vaccinated and prevalence levels were very low in my state, I continued to wear a mask in pharmacies and grocery stores. Not because I felt vulnerable. You know, in- in July and August, I felt pretty safe in Connecticut. Prevalence levels were low, I was vaccinated. But other people were wearing masks and I didn't want them to feel uncomfortable. So I think there's sort of an act of civic virtue and so to- to oppose mask wearing, to me, I don't understand that. I can't, you know, even explain the political rationale that this is somehow an exercise of someone's personal freedom, not to wear a mask in a setting where you're trying to protect the people around you. People's hesitancy around vaccines isn't new. People want to understand a medical product before they put it into them, particularly around children. So that is an understandable discussion. You can counsel patients through that. I think- I think there's a lot of people who right now haven't been vaccinated who are persuadable. They just have a long consideration period, and we should respect that. And my concern around, you know, the mandates. And I think, you know, the federal government is well within its right to mandate vaccination for federal workers, for health care workers. I think even mandating vaccination within the Medicare program could be something that's defensible, that providers and health plans need to get a certain percentage- certain high percentage of their Medicare recipients vaccinated. But when you impose the mandate down to the level of small businesses, now you're setting up the political fault lines and you're taking something that was sort of subjectively political, and it's going to be objectively political. Now- now you're going to see the debate play out and you're going to see the governors oppose it, you're going to see the litigation. And so my concern is that, you know, we might have picked up another, we were- we were going to get to 80 percent of adults vaccinated in this country. We're at 75 percent right now. Actually, 76 percent. The Biden administration has done a good job. We were going to get to 80 on our current trajectory. We might have gotten to 82 by the end of the fall, winter. With a mandate, where are we going to get \u2014 86, 87, so we'll pick up three percent, probably most of them have already had COVID. So are you going to get enough benefit from a public health standpoint for the price you pay in terms of hardening those lines? I think that was worth a very vigorous debate. I- I hope the White House had it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which governors handled this the worst? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, which governors had the worst outcomes? I think in terms-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And by outcomes, you mean deaths? DR. GOTTLIEB: Deaths. Certainly looking at South Dakota, you know where this was just allowed to travel largely unfettered with public health interventions, where you saw one of the highest death rates per capita. You have to look back and say that was a bad experience. You know, people always look at the deaths per capita and you know, New Jersey is right up there and New York is going to be high. I think we really need to look at the post initial wave period. What happened after that initial wave in New York? Because New York was devastated by this at a time when we didn't know how to treat COVID. You know, we were using Pepcid. We were using therapeutics that clearly had no value. Once we learned how to treat this, once we were able to reduce the case fatality rate by half, by the summertime, and we got there, we got there pretty quickly. States that were still excessively engulfed by this and had a lot of death and disease, those were in part policy decisions. Those were in part, the result of policy choices that those states made. New York and Connecticut and New Jersey didn't have the benefit of making a lot of policy decisions. I mean, by the time that they were- they started to get an awareness of this, they were already so heavily seeded that they were just trying to keep their health care systems operating. MARGARET BRENNAN: So for Americans who, I mean, if you accept that this has already become politicized and you look ahead to future elections, one of the governors you just mentioned is projected to be a presidential contender. Right? You have others. So for an American at home, how do they judge response to COVID and say this one worked, this one doesn't. Is it on deaths? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think it's looking at what happened within the states. There was- there are going to absolutely be disparities in the state-by-state experience. And you know, it's- it's not easy to decouple in every case, the policy from the experience, because, you know, this wasn't an epidemic that was experienced the same way nationally, this was highly regionalized. Some states were made excessively vulnerable through features of the states that had nothing to do with policy, New York because New York City was so dense. But what you were starting to see after that first wave was a much more regionalized experience based on differences in policy approaches. And, you know, certainly Florida made certain decisions. I mean, the governor kept schools open, and a lot of people believe he made a good decision. He- they ignored the advice on six feet of distancing. Probably the single costliest recommendation that CDC made that you had to maintain six feet of distance that wasn't based on good judgment and good science was ultimately changed. And so he said we're only going to maintain three feet, which is where the CDC is now, and was able to keep schools open. But at the same time, you know, they let the virus spread largely unchecked in terms of personal mitigation. People weren't wearing masks. They weren't encouraged to wear masks. Vaccination was encouraged for the elderly population, but not widely. So they didn't aggressively try to vaccinate anyone except their elderly population. So they made policy choices. And the consequence was an infection that largely engulfed most parts of the- of the state. I mean, Florida probably has one of the highest positivity rates of any state in the nation right now. When the seroprevalence data comes out, when the data on- on how many people have had COVID comes out, Florida is going to be up there. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Governor DeSantis would say, look at the economy. DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I mean, I'm not in a position to judge his economy relative to other- other states. You know, the decision to try to keep kids in school was the right decision. The decision to let the virus spread the way it has and not even employ mitigation in the school as they're doing now, I disagree with that decision. I think that- that there are things we could have done that were, you know, relatively easy interventions like requiring people to wear masks, trying to get people high quality masks that could have slowed the spread, could have kept certain settings like schools safer. Right now, the epidemic in Florida is largely inside the school. The case- the cases are declining across every age category, except young children because the epidemic has moved into those schools, and Florida has made a decision that they're not going to deploy mitigation in that setting. They're not doing testing in most of the schools, they're not requiring kids to wear masks, so they have spread. Now, it's not clear that those measures are going to be effective against Delta. We're going to find out because in the Northeast, we're adopting those measures and we're going to see whether or not they're able to- we're able to prevent epidemics of Delta in a school setting. But you don't go into a situation like that and tie one hand behind your back because you know what the outcome is going to be. The outcome is going to be that kids are going to get infected with COVID. And there was a study that just came out in Israel showing about 10 percent of kids who get COVID have long- term symptoms. There was a study in England showing about 2 percent have persistent symptoms. That's not trivial. You know, if you end up infecting millions of children and 2 percent have residual symptoms, neurological symptoms, that's a lot of morbidity that a lot of children are going to have to carry for at least some period of time that's going to affect their lives. So I- I wouldn't be cavalier about the risk in kids, even though they clearly do better with the infection than older individuals. And I wouldn't go into these situations, the school situation, without adopting measures that we know can- can potentially prevent the spread. So, you know, that was a decision that is going to- is having a predictable outcome. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk a little bit about President Trump. So, if I go back in time and I think about the first few days where this strange virus that was just surfacing started to make headlines here at home. February, January, you were starting to see things that weren't yet really being raised as red flags. You were tweeting, you were speaking privately in messages to White House officials. How are you on the outside seeing things that they weren't seeing on the inside? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, I think there was- there was a group of us seeing the same things. So there was a group of public health officials that were very alarmed about what was going on. There were people inside the White House who were concerned. Matt Pottinger, who you've spoken to, Joe Grogan, who's one of the people that I conferred with a lot. I remember very- the first conversation I had with him was in- was in January. MARGARET BRENNAN: You write about that, January 18th.\u00a0 DR. GOTTLIEB: Right, Martin Luther King Day weekend, told him he should ask for a briefing from the department on this, was very concerned about the spread. So there were people who were concerned about it. I think that there wasn't a lot of organization around the response early on. There was a presumption again that the CDC has this, the department has this, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is in control. So, you know, they let- they let that health care apparatus run with the ball. And then you had White House people who were alarmed, asking for information, but not actively managing it. It really wasn't until probably more like the end of February, the March timeframe. I went back and I met with the President in early March and the vice president, that you saw the White House really starting to get engaged and pull this away from the Secretary of Health Human Services and the health care institutions and start to at least try to more actively manage it. And that was the- the genesis of the Coronavirus Task Force. But the task force wasn't set up in a way to be operational. It was more a policy forum. So it didn't really- it wasn't really discharging orders and actually setting in motion action. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's been reported that you were actually considered to come and run that task force. That the president was interested in having you come in and run it. DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, that was written in one of the books. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that true? DR. GOTTLIEB: You know, I don't know for sure. I-I know that there were various points in time that the White House had reached out to me about, would I come in and help them manage certain aspects of this. And every time I said yes. The point at which it felt like it was moving along and it felt real was after the task force. So there was a debate about who should run the task force. The decision was made to put the vice president in charge. It's been reported that I was considered. Yasmeen wrote about it in her book for\u00a0The Washington Post. Subsequent to that, the president asked me to come in. I met with him, I met with the vice president, and asked me to take a position as, sort of as an adviser or helping oversee the task force after the vice president had been put in charge. That felt like it was moving along and more real. Ultimately, it didn't come together.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? DR. GOTTLIEB: I don't know for sure. I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: It wasn't your choice, in other words. DR. GOTTLIEB: It wasn't my choice. I think like anything else, there were probably people in the White House who wanted to see me in that position and probably people in the White House who didn't. And you know, the people who didn't want to see me in that position were able to stall the process out long enough. You know, one thing you learn in government and you've been around Washington, so you know this, if you delay something, you can effectively kill it. And so, you know, if you delay an action, you delay someone coming into a position long enough, eventually either someone loses interest or it just dies on its own accord. And that's effectively what happened. My coming into that kind of a role got delayed in perpetuity.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mhm. It was reported that that was Alex Azar. Is that the person you're smiling about? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, the report on Alex Azar in- in the book I referenced was that, the way I- the report that was in that book was that, the White House- Mick Mulvaney, who was chief of staff at the time, said that if the president put me in charge of the task force, Alex would resign, in the meeting with the president. That's the dialogue that she related. I don't- I don't know how she got that. I trust her sourcing. I know her as a reporter. She has impeccable sourcing. The- the subsequent episode when I was- there was thinking about bringing me in in some kind of role on the task force, I think those were different people. I think that the issues were probably being raised more at the White House level about me coming in. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you regret though, not being on the inside? You had been with the Trump administration till 2019--\u00a0 DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, so I regret not being at the FDA. I don't- I don't know that there is much that I could have done dramatically differently inside the White House, and eventually I would have worn out my welcome because it would have been people inside the White House who wouldn't have liked what I was preaching. And by the- by the election, the White House had gone in a much different direction in terms of the seriousness and what they were doing to approach this. If I had been at FDA with my staff, working with the career staff in the device center, I'm pretty confident that we would have made a very hard pivot to try to instigate the private industry to start getting engaged in developing diagnostic tests early in January. There had been times before when we made that call. After Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, we were very worried that we were going to have a blood shortage in the country because about 50 percent of all the bags used to collect blood in this country, the plastic bags used to collect blood, are manufactured in Puerto Rico, and we couldn't get that facility online. One of the ingredients that goes into making bags is oxygen. We couldn't import oxygen. The only facility capable of manufacturing oxygen on the island we couldn't get started, because we needed- we didn't have enough power to actually start it. So I called around to other manufacturers of plastic bags used for other medical purposes and asked them if they could pivot their production lines into making bags for blood collection. One company agreed to do it. You know, I told the CEO, I said, if you go down this path, we'll work with you, we'll promise you an efficient process. And I said, I'll make it up to you on the back end. When you do this, you know, I'll either- I'll come to your factory, I'll tour your factory. And when they managed to successfully do it, I actually put up a bunch of photos of the production line on Twitter, you know, and basically gave the company some props. MARGARET BRENNAN: And so you wish somebody at the FDA was doing that? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think that could have happened- it would have had to happen at the commissioner level, it couldn't happen below that level. It had to be a political appointee, someone who could call a CEO and, you know, make certain guarantees about what- what you were going to afford them in terms of efficiency, predictability to make this pivot because you're asking a company to shut down a production line that clearly they're making, you know, millions of dollars off of and pivot into something where they might not get reimbursed. I couldn't guarantee that Congress was going to come in and pay for those tests. If I would have called any big manufacturer, though, they would have done it. I- I have no doubt about that. That could have been the secretary, that didn't need to be that- just the commissioner, there were other people in the chain of command who could have made that call. But, you know, having been there and having made those calls and having known that CEOs responded positively in moments of public health crisis, that's the one thing I wish I was there to do. And you know, I wrote articles about doing that at the time. I was writing articles in January, this is what we should do. But, you know, writing op-eds and putting things on Twitter isn't like being there in action and being able to pick up the phone and effectuate the action. I wish I was there. I think that that's- the- the FDA and the optives, the operational divisions of HHS, is where the action happens. That's where you can really affect the outcome. Affecting the outcome from the White House, much harder. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you- it seems like you were trying to affect the outcome from the outside with the op-eds, your television appearances. Given that that's how President Trump received information quite often, do you think you did shape the COVID response? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, there were times when the- when the president engaged me, you know, based on my tweets. I talk about one story where I put out a series of tweets right before I went and did a hit on another network, and as soon as I got off, my phone was lighting up. And sure enough, the president had retweeted me and called me later that day and asked me to come down to the White House to discuss the substance of what I had put out. So I think the messages were getting through, but they were getting through at a point when, early on, when the White House was looking for a strategy, was engaged and was sober about the seriousness of this. I mean, after all, the president did make the decision to do the '15 Days to Slow the Spread' and then the subsequent 30 days, a dramatic action. Later on, I think when the White House pivoted and was wrongly advised that really nothing was going to effectuate the spread, there was no way to really stop this, that we were going to be subject to uncontrolled spread, and we just had this sort of power through this. I don't think that the advice I was given was really consistent with where they were going and what they- what they wanted to be hearing and advice that they were going to take. So at that point, I'm not sure my message was breaking through as effectively as it did at the outset. But- because the orientation changed in terms of how the White House was approaching this. MARGARET BRENNAN: You write in March, when you went in to speak with the president that he was serious, he knew the grave risks. \"When it came to the question of mitigation, he was most sold on the ideas before I had arrived.\" You're describing him as well briefed. DR. GOTTLIEB: So I was invited in that day by some senior White House staff with the premise, at least as I interpreted it, to help sell the president on the idea of mitigation. And you know, they sent me into the Oval Office and said, you know, you try to walk him through this, explain to him, you know, your position on it. And by the time I got there, you know, I had the discussion with him, but he was- it was very clear to me that he was already sold on the idea, like he already understood what- what the plan was and it felt to me, and I had briefed him before, I mean, I didn't know him well, but I had been to the Oval Office 10 times, eight times to brief him on various things. It felt to me at that point that he was very receptive to what I was saying and wanted to move on to other topics. We were talking about other things in that meeting. So, you know, yeah, early on, I think that the president was- there was a point in time when he was gravely concerned about this and that came out in the Bob Woodward book as well, because over this very time period, when I was meeting with him, he was also meeting with Bob Woodward and expressing his deep concern about- about COVID. So, you know, he was understandably heavily criticized for saying to Woodward, allegedly, that, you know, he was trying to send a more reassuring message to the public because he didn't want to panic people, but privately he was very worried about this. I think that the- the challenge with the White House approach is it wasn't consistent. They didn't follow it through. You know, there was a point in time when they were very concerned about this, willing to take dramatic actions. But later on, their attitudes really changed to the point where when the president was contagious with COVID, he ceremoniously took his mask off. And so what message does that send to the country? So the- the approach in attitude shifted, and I think my view is- and I wasn't close to it at this point, so I don't know exactly what they were being told. They brought in a different set of advisers. But my view is that they were sold on the idea that you weren't going to be able to really affect the spread and that anything you did was just going to have so many repercussions in terms of impact on children who might not be in school, impact on the economy, that the costs were worse than the disease. The president always said that, the cure can't be worse than the disease. You know, and the schools as a perfect example, because- and a perfect example of the lack of effective policy making. So the single reason why most schools remained shut was because the CDC was telling them they had to keep kids six feet apart. If- if CDC had said you can only- you have to keep kids three feet apart, then a lot of schools would have been able to open. And in fact, when the Biden administration wanted to open schools in the spring, this past spring, they got the CDC to change that guidance from six feet to three feet. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you write, the six feet was arbitrary? DR. GOTTLIEB: The six feet was arbitrary in and of itself. But if the administration had focused in on that, they might have been able to effect a policy that would have actually achieved their outcome. But that policy making process didn't exist, and the six feet is a perfect example of sort of the lack of rigor around how CDC made recommendations. Nobody knows where it came from. Most people assume that the six feet of distance, the recommendation for keeping six feet apart, comes out of some old studies related to flu, where droplets don't travel more than six feet. We now know COVID spreads through aerosols. We've known that for a while, so how operative is that? The initial recommendation that the CDC brought to the White House, and I talk about this, was 10 feet. And a political appointee in the White House said, we can't recommend 10 feet. Nobody can measure 10 feet. It's inoperable. Society will shut down. So the compromise was around six feet. Now imagine if that detail had leaked out. Everyone would have said, this is the White House politically interfering with the CDC's judgment. The CDC said 10 feet, it should be 10 feet, but 10 feet was no more right than six feet and ultimately became three feet. But when it became three feet, the basis for the CDC's decision to ultimately revise it from six to three feet was a study that they conducted the prior fall. So they changed it in the spring. They had done a study in the fall where they showed that if you have two masked individuals, two people wearing masks, the risk of transmission is reduced 70 percent with masks if you're three feet apart. So they said on the basis of that, we can now make a judgment at three feet is an appropriate distance. Which begs the question, if they had that study result in the fall, why didn't they change the advice in the fall? Why did they wait until the spring? So the whole-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's-- DR. GOTTLIEB: --This is how the whole thing feels arbitrary and not science based. So we talk about a very careful, science based process and then these anecdotes get exposed, and that's where Americans start to lose confidence in how the decisions got made. MARGARET BRENNAN: You do put blame on President Trump for a few things, masking, you- you mentioned there. You said he politicized masks. You say you heard it's because he thought people looked funny in them. You said, you know, he listened to people on the outside too much. But do you think fundamentally, looking at everything you've analyzed, that the outcome of this pandemic would have been different if President Trump wasn't in office? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, it would have been different if we had different political decisions and the White House was exercising different leadership. There's no question about that. There's no question that the White House made mistakes, and the lack of consistency was a big mistake, and also the lack of using the White House as an effective bully pulpit to really galvanize a collective action that can make a difference on the margins. I mean, when you're dealing with something of this magnitude, little things practiced on a large scale make a big difference. If everyone just washes their hands a little bit more, we talk about these things as public health officials, and sometimes it sounds silly. But we know when you aggregate small interventions on a mass scale, if people just go to the grocery store one less time a week, they wash their hands, they wear a mask. All those little things added up over a large population actually can affect the contours of an epidemic. And so getting people to do that requires galvanizing the public, inspiring the public to engage in certain behavior. And that's where the- the lack of consistency, lack of messaging, allowing this to sort of get divided along political fault lines in the setting of an election when things were already, the temperature was already very high, I think really hurt us. And then there were the discrete policy mistakes, decisions not to do this or decisions to do that. But stepping back from that, I think that there were fundamental weaknesses with our response that regardless of who is in power, we had an ill-prepared bureaucracy. We didn't have the right infrastructure, we didn't have the right agencies. The agencies weren't properly empowered, properly resourced. So even if you had competent leadership, very effective leadership up and down the chain, you still would have had some of the same problems. And that's what I try to get at here is some of those really deep rooted systemic problems with the structure of our response and also the assumptions we made about how we would respond. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you resigned from the FDA in 2019. Seeing everything you've seen, do you see a role for yourself in government again? DR. GOTTLIEB: It's impossible to say. I was-- MARGARET BRENNAN: This isn't a playbook for the future secretary?\u00a0 DR. GOTTLIEB: You know, what I would- getting these jobs in government, so many things have to happen right for these opportunities to be open to you, that anyone who wants to be in a position inside government can't plan for it. So- would I- are there things I'd like to do? Is there unfinished business? Are there roles I'd like to play? Sure. Do I think I'm going to have that opportunity? I hope so, but you can't plan for it. And sometimes writing a book isn't the best way to propel a political career, as you know, because sometimes the best way to get a political job is, write less, not more. So, this certainly isn't, you know, a blueprint for that. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do hope that this is a blueprint for some kind of change? DR. GOTTLIEB: I hope this is the part of the conversation that needs to happen about how we plan differently going forward. And we need to bring together a bipartisan commission. We need to bring together thought leaders to try to develop a plan for the future. The blueprint that the Biden administration put out is basically just a structure of that conversation. That conversation needs to happen. I hope this is part of that conversation. I hope that this book becomes something that people who engage in that discussion read-- MARGARET BRENNAN: A 9/11 type commission? DR. GOTTLIEB: It will be- it will be something of that ilk. It's going to be something- it has to be. In order- in order for it to be effective, it's going to have to be something that's broadly bipartisan, widely respected, because it's not just a matter of getting the right infrastructure in place, you know, getting the right chess pieces on the board and restructuring the agencies. I think we have to have a more fundamental question, a discussion about what is the role of public health officials in the setting of a public health crisis and come to agreement about that because that's-that's where you're going to get, on the political right, that's where you're going to get a lot of consternation. There's a perception now that public health officials exercise too much power, sometimes on the basis of faulty information, propagated guidance that had a dramatic impact on people's lives, oftentimes that wasn't based on good science. And so the reaction to that is going to be, maybe they shouldn't be so empowered. And I think we're going to have to pierce that discussion, get over that, come to a consensus around that, sort of re-elevate the role of public health in a way that people find acceptable in order to get the right infrastructure in place. I don't- I don't know that the public health community senses that yet, but I- I worry that- that- that discussion is coming and that discussion needs to precede any broader discussion about what will the role of the CDC be? Well, the role of the CDC is going to depend on what you think the role of a public health agency in a crisis should be. Should CDC's guidance be more subject to notice and comment like a regulation or subject to an advisory committee process where there is some public scrutiny? Should they have to re-educate their guidance once they issue it to make sure it continues to be science based? You might bring more structure and transparency around how decisions get made, maybe that's the solution, but that discussion needs to happen. MARGARET BRENNAN: On the global response, you wrote, \"COVID crushed the global order of public health cooperation.\" Are you saying W.H.O is just not up to the task? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, it's not just the W.H.O.. I mean, past epidemics crush the global order of cooperation, we just didn't learn the lesson. When H1N1, the swine flu in 2009 struck the world, Australia and Canada nationalized the facilities that were producing vaccine destined for the US. They basically held on to our vaccine that was being manufactured in facilities in those countries until they could satisfy their local demand, and then they allowed the vaccine to be shipped here. And we did the same thing. We had a facility in North Carolina that was manufacturing vaccine for the United Kingdom, being operated by GlaxoSmithKline at the time. And we held on to that vaccine and it actually took a call from the British prime minister to President Bush at the time to get us to allow that vaccine to flow to the UK. So we have seen in moments of global- global public health crisis, there's a little bit of every nation for yourself. And so if we want to work on this assumption that everyone's just going to share and you know, lines are going to flow, vaccines are going to flow across borders, it hasn't worked in the past. It hasn't- it didn't work in a setting of COVID. So I think we're going to have to think differently about how we build capacities here domestically to make sure we have what we need to respond to a public health crisis of this magnitude, and not be dependent upon things coming from other nations where those nations are going to want those- those same materials as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Was there quashing of information by the W.H.O.? DR. GOTTLIEB: I think the W.H.O. for too long-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Did they cover up for China is the allegation. DR. GOTTLIEB: They- they weren't willing to confront China, right? They were- they put out statements extolling China's behavior and how forthcoming China was. I mean, it's part of the record now. Tedros- it's- it's in his Twitter feed. It's in the Twitter feed of the head of the W.H.O., giving props to China for how forthcoming they were. Now, was some of that an attempt to try to give them public praise because privately you were- you were, you know, giving them a harder sell? I think some of that was going on in the U.S. with some of the tweets and the statements that we were putting out. I don't know that that was happening at the W.H.O. level because I was talking to some W.H.O. officials at the time, and I've talked to a number since. And I think the W.H.O. really did believe China was behaving in sort of an appropriate way and was providing cover for them as they were getting criticized by other parts of the world. Clearly, they weren't, and I think that that was knowable at the time. China didn't share the source strains. Tedros didn't- the head of the W.H.O. didn't want to push China on sharing the source strains publicly because he said, well, they have no commitment to do it, and he's right. Under the International Health Regulations, there was no requirement that you had to share the samples, but the required- there were requirements that you had to share samples of novel emerging resp- respiratory pathogens in other settings. So clearly, the spirit of the International Health Regulations was that this should be shared, but because it wasn't the letter of the law, the W.H.O. didn't want to push China publicly to do it, even though that would have been very helpful for other nations. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about actual viral samples, not the sequencing. DR. GOTTLIEB: Right, actual samples of the virus because the sequence alone isn't good enough if you want to develop a vaccine or a diagnostic. You actually at some point need the live virus. Now we eventually got the live virus because we had spread here in the United States. But, you know, at least publicly, we didn't have the virus until there was a case in Seattle. It's possible we got the virus earlier from one of China's neighbors, where there were some earlier spread. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that part of the equation being dealt with now? DR. GOTTLIEB: No, I don't think the W.H.O. has taken any steps to reform how it operates in a global crisis like this, whether or not they're able to- whether or not the organization has a self-awareness to do that and is able to self-organize to actually implement meaningful reform. I'm not sure. I think the Biden administration lost an opportunity to compel different behavior out of the W.H.O. by- by simply rejoining the W.H.O. I was critical at the time that the- President Trump made the decision to pull out the W.H.O. I had actually spoken with him directly, urging him not to do it, suggested that there were other ways he could send a strong message to China. Short of pulling out of the W.H.O. But once we pulled out of the W.H.O. and we were going to re-enter, we should have used the reentry to extract some kind of agreement about the W.H.O. engaging in some reform process and as best I know, as best we all know based on what's public, that wasn't done. MARGARET BRENNAN: Leverage was given up? DR. GOTTLIEB: The leverage was given up. Yeah.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 President Biden will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva, Switzerland, on June 16, the White House said Tuesday. Next month's summit between the two leaders will be their first in-person gathering since Mr. Biden took office and comes as tensions between the U.S. and Russia have escalated. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Mr. Biden and Putin will \"discuss the full range of pressing issues, as we seek to restore predictability and stability to the U.S.-Russia relationship.\" Psaki told reporters during the White House press briefing she expects Mr. Biden and Putin will discuss the arms control agenda following the extension of the New START Treaty, U.S. support for Ukraine's sovereignty and the situation in Belarus, where a civilian airliner transiting its airspace was forced to divert and land in its capital city, and a journalist was removed from the flight and taken into custody. The president's upcoming meeting was met with criticism from some Republicans, who said Mr. Biden was rewarding Putin after provocations from Russia. But Psaki pushed back on the characterization and said the summit is a \"vital part of defending America's interests.\" \"This is how diplomacy works,\" she said. \"We don't meet with people only when we agree. It's actually important to meet with leaders when we have a range of disagreements, as we do with Russian leaders. We don't regard the meeting with the Russian president as a reward.\" In a phone call with Putin last month, Mr. Biden proposed their face-to-face session take place in a third country. Since taking office, Mr. Biden has announced a series of actions against Russia in response to a range of issues, including the sweeping SolarWinds cyber breach, interference in the 2020 election and the buildup of Russian troops near the border in eastern Ukraine. Last month, the president announced sanctions targeting 32 Russian entities and individuals, including 10 officials who were expelled from the U.S.\u00a0 The Kremlin took its own retaliatory measures against the U.S., expelling 10 American diplomats and banning eight current and former U.S. officials from Russia, including Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, FBI Director Christopher Wray, Attorney General Merrick Garland and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Mr. Biden's summit with Putin will cap his first international trip as president. The White House announced last month the president will travel to the United Kingdom for the G-7 Summit, followed by a trip to Brussels for NATO and U.S.-European Union Summits. The session next month is not the first in-person meeting for Mr. Biden and Putin. During a visit to the Kremlin in 2011 while serving as vice president, Mr. Biden told Putin, then prime minister, \"I don't think you have a soul.\" The president also told ABC News in an interview in March he thinks the Russian leader is a \"killer\" and vowed Putin would \"pay a price\" for Russia's election interference. Mr. Biden's comment prompted outrage in Russia, and the Kremlin summoned its ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, to Moscow for consultations on relations with the U.S. John Sullivan, U.S. ambassador to Russia, also returned to Washington last month to meet with the Biden administration and discuss the state of U.S.-Russia relations.",

Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said at a press conference last week the Kremlin told Sullivan he should return to Washington for \"serious, detailed consultations.\" The Russian government summoned its ambassador in Washington, Anatoly Antonov, to Moscow for consultations on relations with the U.S. last month after Mr. Biden described Putin as a \"killer\" and said Putin was \"pay a price\" for Russia's election interference. In addition to the sanctions imposed on Russia, the White House has warned Moscow will face consequences if jailed Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, who is on a hunger strike, dies. Navalny was transferred to a prison hospital Monday after his doctors said he would die within days without medical treatment. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Monday that if Navalny dies in Russian custody, \"there will be consequences to the Russian government, and we reserve those options.\"",

Boot explains why he believes much of the administration's success will depend on repairing domestic partisan divisions, and why winning the respect of the U.S.'s enemies may as important as maintaining the respect of its friends. Boot and Morell also discuss the strategic threat posed by China, Russia and others, as well as the near-term consequences of the administration's decision to complete a military drawdown in Afghanistan.\u00a0 Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. Intelligence Matters: Max Boot transcript Producer: Olivia Gazis MICHAEL MORELL: Max, I really want to dig in on the general topic of the impact of our politics on foreign policy, but before we do that, I want to ask you about your most recent book, which was published in 2018: \"The Road Not Taken, Edward Lansdale and the American Tragedy in Vietnam.\" New York Times bestseller, finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in biography and received rave reviews. I read it. It's terrific. My kids read it. They thought it was great. I was lucky enough to meet Mr. Lansdale early in my career, so I was wondering if you could briefly describe the story in the book for our listeners. MAX BOOT: First, let me just say I'm delighted that you and your kids enjoyed the book and I'm jealous that you got to meet at Lansdale, which I never did, even though I spent years writing about his life. But he's been long dead. By the time I I started my work, he was a legendary figure in the world of covert operations.  He was somebody who was a former ad man in San Francisco who joined the SS during World War II, and then after the war joined the Air Force, eventually became an Air Force general. But his greatest success was enjoyed as an operative for the nascent CIA. In the early 1950s, he worked for the CIA in the Philippines, really masterminding the defeat of the rebellion, this communist insurgency in the Philippines, which he did with no U.S. troops on the ground. He really did it by fostering a close relationship with Ramon Magsaysay, the defense minister and later president of the Philippines, and at Lansdale was a pioneer in what we would today call counterinsurgency - this notion that you defeat an insurgency not by killing insurgents, but by winning the trust of the population.  And because of the success that he had in the Philippines in 1954, Allen Dulles, the CIA director, sent him to Saigon, where he helped to set up this new state of South Vietnam and became very close with Ngo Dinh Diem, the first prime minister and then president of the state of South Vietnam. And eventually Lansdale returned home, became a senior official in the Pentagon and ran Operation Mongoose, the Kennedy administration effort to overthrow Fidel Castro. But Lansdale's heart was always in Vietnam, and he returned there in 1965 as a senior official at the US embassy and stayed through the Tet Offensive in 1968. But although Lansdale was very much in favor of helping to defend South Vietnam from communist aggression, he was also very much opposed to the way the Kennedy administration and then the Johnson administration went about it. He strongly opposed the Kennedy-backed coup, which overthrew and killed his friend, Ngo Dinh Diem. And then he also very strongly opposed Johnson's decision to send half a million U.S. troops to South Vietnam. He really thought that defending South Vietnam had to be Vietnam's own fight. And so he was opposed to all the firepower that the United States expended in the war effort. And he returned home in 1968, feeling very dejected and and very downbeat about the U.S. war effort. And so, in telling his story, might tell the story of America's long involvement in Vietnam, beginning in 1954 and finally ending of the fall of South Vietnam in 1975. And along the way I also tell Lansdale's extraordinary personal story. And I was lucky enough to get access to personal letters that he had written both to his first wife as well as his long-time mistress, who eventually became his second wife, a Filipino lady named Pat Kelly, who was incredibly important to his life, the great love of his life. And so I was able to shed light on this private relationship that Lansdale had, which had a great impact on his public duties and the way he he did things in the Philippines and in Vietnam. So it's an extraordinary personal story, but it's also a story that illuminates America's involvement in Vietnam. MICHAEL MORELL: And, Max, why did you write the book? Is this something that you've always wanted to do and finally had the time to get to it? Or is this something that came to you later? MAX BOOT: It was an outgrowth of my previous book, which was called Invisible Armies, which was a history of guerrilla warfare and terrorism since the dawn of time. And I wrote a little bit about Ed Lansdale in that book, and my editor at Liveright suggested that for an encore, I should write a biography of Ed Lansdale. And initially I was skeptical because my reaction was, 'Well, what else is there to say? Haven't I already said it all?' And it turned out very quickly that, no, there was a lot more to say. And I was just incredibly lucky to stumble onto these private letters that Lansdale had written to his long-time mistress, Pat Kelly. I managed to track down Pat Kelly's, one of her granddaughters who was living in Northern Virginia. And I went over to her house and she said to me, 'Hey, you know, Ed Lansdale wrote all these letters to to my grandmother. Would you be interested in seeing them?' And, you know, wow. I mean, for a biographer, this was like striking gold. And, you know, she led me downstairs to her basement and then, lo and behold, on her ping pong table were neatly arrayed all of these letters, many of them still unopened. So I became the first person after Ed Lansdale and Pat Kelly to read these letters. And then I was also lucky enough to win the trust of Ed Lansdale's kids who are living in Long Island and in Florida, and they shared with me the letters that Lansdale wrote to their mother. And so, you know, I was the first person after Landsdale himself to have read both sets of letters, often written simultaneously, both to his first wife and and to his mistress, which provided an unparalleled vantage point into his innermost thinking. And then, you know, on top of that, I was lucky enough to also get access to newly declassified CIA documents which take decades and decades to reach the public domain. And and so together, I was able to paint a picture of Ed Lansdale's public and private life in a way that nobody else has been able to do. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Max, I want to talk about U.S. foreign policy today, something that you write a lot about. But before we get to that, let me let me start by asking you how you describe, you know, what's your narrative about where we are today politically and how we got here? MAX BOOT: We're not in a good place politically because obviously the country is deeply divided. I mean, I think this is the greatest partisan divide certainly of my lifetime in the last 50 years. And it's really been exacerbated by the 'Trumpification' of the Republican Party. I mean, there has been -- there is polarization both ways, with the Democrats becoming more liberal and Republicans becoming more conservative. But it's asymmetric polarization because Republicans have gone much further to the right than Democrats have gone to the left. There are certainly left-wing Democrats. But Joe Biden is very much a mainstream centrist, a center-left Democrat, whereas, by contrast, the Republican Party, which is still unfortunately led by Donald Trump, has gone off into cloud cuckoo land. You see that with most Republicans now expressing approval of the assault on Congress on January 6, Republicans being opposed to doing anything to investigate what happened. You have a majority of Republicans who in one recent survey said they don't trust science. You have about a third of Republicans who in another recent survey said that they think that coronavirus vaccines are spreading microchips that are being implanted in people by the government. I mean, there is just so much craziness on the right. And the Republican Party in many ways is turning against democracy itself. They tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election and now they're still trying to do that in places like Arizona. And they're laying the groundwork for potentially rejecting and overturning the outcome of the 2024 election if a Democrat wins the presidency again.  So, you know, I think what's happening is is greatly alarming. It's really leading to a dysfunction of U.S. politics and that, in turn is hurting Americans standing around the world. I mean, I think that certainly our allies are very happy to see Joe Biden and to see the more moderate, mainstream and internationalist viewpoint that he represents. But I think they're also very nervous about the future of America because they know it's quite possible that Trump or Trump-like figure could come back to power once again and pursue an isolationist and protectionist course once again. That is very different from the kind of foreign policy that the United States has pursued for the last 70 years.  And so, you know, I think it's very hard to be sanguine about the future of the United States. I really think the future of our democracy is very much up for grabs in a way that it has not been in my lifetime. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Max, I want my listeners to understand that you're not saying this as a liberal longtime Democrat, you're saying this is somebody who is conservative and until recently was a member of the Republican Party. MAX BOOT: Well, that's exactly right. I was a lifelong Republican until a day after the 2016 election, and I was somebody who was a foreign policy adviser to John McCain in 2008, to Mitt Romney in 2012 and to Marco Rubio in 2015, 2016. So it gives me no pleasure. And in fact, it's agonizing to me to see the current state of the Republican Party, which I feel has very little resemblance to the Republican Party that I joined in the 1980s. Although, you know, looking at the history more critically as I do now, I can see that there were certainly antecedents and that there were certainly reasons why the Republican Party has wound up as crazy as it is today. The seeds of that craziness were planted decades ago. But I think what's happened in the last four or five years is that the Republican Party used to have this crazy fringe. But the people who were in charge, folks like Mitt Romney and John McCain and George Bush and others were pretty sane and pretty sensible, even if they sometimes did things that a lot of Democrats or liberals would disagree with, they were nevertheless pro-democracy. They were pro science. They were pretty mainstream thinkers. And now, unfortunately, what's happened under Trump is that the fringe has become the mainstream and all sorts of crazy beliefs, including the big lie that Donald Trump supposedly won the 2020 election that has become Republican orthodoxy, rejection of science, embrace of conspiracy theories that has become the Republican mainstream. And that's why I could no longer stay in the Republican Party and why I believe the Republican Party today poses a real danger to American democracy. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Max, how would you describe American foreign policy? MAX BOOT: I think American foreign policy is a restoration project right now after the huge damage that Donald Trump did to our standing in the world, and you could see that damage, for example, in polls of how many people around the world have confidence in the United States to do the right thing. Those numbers plunged, you know, practically into negative numbers under the Trump administration because Trump essentially reversed 70 years of American foreign policy, which was based on promoting free trade, on supporting alliances, on supporting democracy. He wasn't interested in doing any of that. Trump kissed up to dictators. He idolized Vladimir Putin. He said he was in love with Kim Jong Un. He constantly castigated our allies, called NATO a bunch of freeloaders. It was just horrible. He did massive damage to our standing in the world. Not only did he turn America into a pariah, but because he was so unsuccessful and presided over what was probably the worst outbreak of COVID-19 in the world last year, he made America into an object, not just the fear, but also of pity. He really crippled our our standing. And now Joe Biden is trying to undo that damage. And I think he has he's off to a pretty good start. I think during his recent trip to Europe, you saw the way that Biden was embraced by our allies and by the public and in those countries in a way that they did not do with Trump. But I think now the challenge for Biden is not just to win the love of our allies, but to win the respect of our enemies - countries like China and Russia and others in Iran and North Korea; I think that's still a work very much in progress. It's much easier to win support and our allies than to win respect in our adversaries. And that is still something that Biden is still struggling to do as he tries to restore America's standing in the world.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: So, Max, on the question of of allies and how we're doing with allies, you know, when I talk to to folks who I used to work with overseas, they are certainly happy that Joe Biden is reaching out to them in a more traditional sense. But they always ask me a question that I have a really hard time answering. And that question is, you know, 'Michael, can you assure us that what happened in 2016 isn't going to happen again in 2024 or 2028? Because, you know, we can't make our national security policy in four year chunks, right. We have to make it for the long term. And if we can't be confident that America is going to be there, then we have to hedge with your enemies, with China and Russia.' How would you talk to them about that? MAX BOOT; Well, I think that's a legitimate concern. I mean, if they have that concern, I have that concern, too. I mean, I don't know what the future of the United States is going to be. And I'm more uncertain about our future than at any point in our lifetime, because I think some of the basic elements of consensus in our society are gone. You know, you used to be able to count on both parties supporting a fairly centrist internationalist foreign policy, supporting science, trying to, you know, buttress our democracy, trying to support democracy abroad, standing with our allies, promoting free trade, standing up to dictatorships. All of that is very much in doubt if the Republican Party as currently configured comes back into power, because this is still Donald Trump's party. And I think, you know, you see what's happening. There is almost no room for anti-Trump Republicans within the GOP. I mean, look at what happened to Liz Cheney, who lost her leadership post in the House Republican caucus because she dared to challenge the Big Lie. She dared to say that Donald Trump actually lost the election and that the January 6th assault on Congress was an outrage for which people should answer. That was enough to cost her her leadership post. And pretty much all of the Republican presidential hopefuls for the future are all very much in the pro-Trump mode. And in fact, Donald Trump himself is is the leading candidate to win the Republican nomination in 2024 if he decides to run again. So, yeah, I mean, you have to be concerned about the future of the United States. You know, as I said before, even the very longevity of our democracy, which has lasted more than two centuries, is now in doubt because it's you know, it's certainly conceivable that, you know, in 2024, let's imagine that Joe Biden wins another fairly narrow victory over Donald Trump. It's very conceivable that you could have a serious attempt by Republicans to throw out electoral votes in in the swing states by, again, making these crazy accusations of fraud just as they did in the last year. And this time, if there is a Republican majority in both houses, they could actually simply vote to throw out Biden's electoral votes and seat Trump instead. And, you know, that could well be the end of American democracy. I mean, I don't want to be overly apocalyptic here, but we have to understand that is a serious possibility. And so, you know, people around the world, people around the world just can't have the same degree of trust in the United States that they once had. I can't have the same degree of trust in the United States. We have to work to restore and safeguard our democracy. And I would feel a lot better if if Congress could pass the H.R. 1, the the bill to safeguard voting rights. But it looks like so far it's dead in the water. And meanwhile, Republicans in the state legislatures are are voting to restrict voting rights so that they can win. And in 2024, I mean, this is an alarming picture. And, you know, I'd love to tell our friends overseas they have nothing to worry about. But honestly, I'm worried, too. MICHAEL MORELL: So we've talked about the allies on the one hand and the Biden team doing a pretty good job reaching out to them, even though they may have some concerns. And on the other side, you have our adversaries and the need for the United States to have the respect of those adversaries. You said that's still a work in progress. What would you like to see the Biden team do? MAX BOOT: Well, that's a good question, I mean, on this issue, as on so many others, it's easier to diagnose the problem than to come up with a solution. But there's no question that we need to get the attention of our adversaries who are testing us all the time. You see that, for example, in Iraq, where Iranian-backed militias continue rocket attacks on U.S. bases, you certainly see it with Chinese aggression and assertiveness in the South China Sea and around Taiwan. You see it with Russia, which recently massed more troops on the borders with Ukraine. And Putin is now talking about how Ukraine and Belarus and the other old Soviet republics should rightfully be part of of the Russian Federation. So they're all testing us. And I think, you know, the challenge for Biden is to push back in a way that gets their attention, but that isn't reckless and that doesn't raise the risk of war. And I think it's a very difficult balancing act to pull off. I think some of the things they're doing are very good, especially, you know, trying to marshal U.S. allies to stand up to Chinese hacking and aggression. And I think that's that's a very positive step. Instead of taking an America First, go it alone approach, I think it's it's much more productive to to marshal the allies and to meet with the Quad, for example, Japan and and in Australia and India and to get other countries on board. But there are some other actions that Biden is taking that I think, you know, suggest that he will not be as strong in standing up to our adversaries as he needs to be. I think in particular, removing the final 2,500 U.S. troops from Afghanistan, I think sends a bad message and emboldens the Taliban and will likely result in the fall of a pro-Western regime in Kabul. But it also sends a message to others around the world that they can't necessarily rely on American support. So, you know, I think the biggest thing President Biden should do right now, but he won't do, is to rethink the complete pullout from Afghanistan. MICHAEL MORELL: And so we have a pull out from Afghanistan, we have a pullout from Iraq, we have -- MAX BOOT: But we're not really pulling out from Iraq. I mean, that's what's puzzling to me, is we're basically redesignating U.S. forces in Iraq as advisers rather than combat forces. And they're really advisers anyway. But they were also advisers in Afghanistan. So this is one of the things I don't, you know, I'm generally supportive of President Biden and his foreign policy. But this is one of the things I really don't understand. Why is it OK to keep a few thousand troops in Iraq but not in Afghanistan? What is the logic there? I'm not sure that I get it. MICHAEL MORELL: And then how do you think he handled his first interaction with with President Putin? MAX BOOT: I think overall he did pretty well, he certainly - in some ways, it was kind of a low bar because if we all remember the way that Trump dealt with with Putin in Helsinki in 2018, which was a catastrophe, because you have the president of the United States kowtowing to the Russian dictator and accepting the Russian dictator's word over the word of the U.S. intelligence community. So that was, you know, an easily avoidable catastrophe.  And simply by standing up for America, standing up for American values, not kissing up to Putin, Biden did much, much better than the Trump did. But I think now the real test is going to be, does he deliver on some of the threats that he made in Geneva, where he basically said that if Russia continues allowing hacking of the United States, if they allow these attacks from their soil, we will strike back, we will make them pay a price. Well, the hacking continues. So the question is, what kind of price are you going to make Russia pay? So, you know, I think, again, Biden did pretty well on his encounter with Putin. But, you know, it takes more than one meeting. It takes more than a few hours of conversation to change the dynamic in Russian-American relations. And I think there's a lot more work that needs to be done. MICHAEL MORELL: And it takes more than just rhetoric. So I want to ask you about China. I want to ask you how you think about the challenge of China, how you think about the threat that China poses to us as a nation. How do you think about that? MAX BOOT: It's a massive threat, but it's also a very complicated threat, much more complicated than than the Soviet Union was during the years of the Cold War, because we did not have an economic relationship with the Soviet Union so we could afford to deal with the Soviets purely on the level of containment and deterrence. Whereas with China, they're one of our largest trading partners. Our economies and our supply chains are very closely linked with those of of China. And so, you know, we can't just cut them off. And in many ways, the tariffs that that Trump imposed on China were counterproductive. Those costs were really paid by American consumers. So we have a much more complicated balancing act with China, where I think we need to continue trading with them, because that is to the benefit of both countries and of the entire global economy. But at the same time, we need to speak up and protest about their terrible human rights violations against Uyghurs, against Hong Kong and and against the people of China more broadly. And we also need to contain and deter China because there is a very real threat of a war with China either over the South China Sea or over Taiwan, where the rhetoric from China has become more threatening. And you've recently had senior U.S. military officers that the INDOPACOM Command warning that the risk of war with China is growing and that China could try to take Taiwan back by force. So we need to push back very strongly against that in order to deter Chinese aggression. And a lot of the ways we do that are very complicated, having to do with, I think we need to transform our military forces, which are very conventional and, at the moment, are not a good countermeasure for China, which has made huge investments in long-range precision strike capability, space weapons, cyber weapons, submarines, all these asymmetric capabilities designed to neutralize our conventional combat forces. So we need to invest more in unmanned systems and artificial intelligence, in cyber and space, all of these cutting edge capacities. But beyond the military investment, we need to make an investment on the home front in science and technology, improving our education system. We need to be more welcoming to immigrants who are one of our secret weapons that we get so many tremendous talented and skilled foreign-born people here, including many from China itself, who are a tremendous asset to the United States. We need to make it easier to attract and and to keep those people here. But finally - and this gets back to something we were talking about earlier. We also need to heal our politics. We need to turn down the level of partisan divisiveness. We need to try to bring the country closer together, because if we are divided at home, we can't be strong abroad. And of course, countries like Russia and China and others try to encourage discord on the American home front through the use of social media and various other means. And so I think one of the most important things that President Biden is doing, which is not directly related to standing up to China, but one of the most important things he's doing is simply trying to lower the temperature on our politics. And he's not engaging in partisan, cheap shots. He's not using Twitter for name calling. He is trying to be more inclusive and to be a president of all Americans. And you're seeing some payoff for that in terms of his approval ratings, which are consistently over 50 percent, which is a mark that Donald Trump never reached. But unfortunately, his efforts are being undermined by this partisan propaganda machine at Fox News and on Facebook and elsewhere, which insists on seeing Biden as some kind of, you know, Marxist, radical, socialist, anti-American, subversive, and so, you know, in order to be strong against China or other threats, we really have to do a better job of of getting our act together at home. MICHAEL MORELL: It struck me, in fact, when you were listing all the things we needed to do to better compete with China, that a number of those, particularly the ones at home, they're simply not possible as long as our politics is divided. And so there's this link, right, between successfully dealing with China and and fixing our own politics, as you talked about. It's just striking, MAX BOOT: Yeah, that's exactly right. It's very hard to do, and I really do think that President Biden is making a real effort at bipartisanship and trying to heal the partisan divide by trying to turn down the temperature on our politics. But, of course, most of the Republican leadership has no interest in that. They are pursuing a different path where, you know, they're going down Mar a Lago and paying court to Donald Trump and in promoting the Big Lie and spreading misinformation and and engaging in incendiary rhetoric, which they think will result in a in a Republican victory in the midterm election next year, which could very well turn out to be the case.  So, you know, this is this is kind of like one hand clapping. You know, it's hard to have bipartisanship if only one side is interested in it. MICHAEL MORELL: Max, I want to circle back to history again. IN a column in The Washington Post you wrote, and I'm going to quote here, \"I'm a chastened hawk who now regrets my support for the invasion of Iraq.\" And I'm wondering when and why did you realize that your original support for the war was misplaced? MAX BOOT: Well, it's been something that became obvious over the course of a number of years where, you know, the Iraq war became much more costly than I think any anybody who supported it could have imagined. And it didn't result in a clear-cut victory. And, of course, the central rationale for the war, which was the claim about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, that turned out to be false. So, you know, any way you cut it, looking back, you know, I wish I listened to to those voices what warned against this conflict, which included not just folks on the left, but also some folks on the right, like Brent Scowcroft and others. You know, but you can't go back and replay history and we are where we are. And so I think today, even though I wish we'd never gone into Iraq in the first place, I'm still in favor of keeping a few thousand U.S. troops in an advisory capacity in Iraq, because I do think that they serve an important purpose in trying to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State and also in trying to limit the influence of Iran. And unfortunately, this has been one of the biggest byproducts of the American invasion and the toppling of Saddam Hussein, which is to increase Iranian influence in Iraq. And that's the last thing that the United States should have wanted. But that, unfortunately, has happened. And I think that's another reason why in hindsight, I think that the invasion was a mistake, even though it did overthrow the monstrous regime of Saddam Hussein. MICHAEL MORELL: And then just one one final question, Max, maybe to bring us completely full circle here. Do you see any parallels between Iraq and Vietnam or Afghanistan and Vietnam or am I pushing this way too far? MAX BOOT: Well, there are certainly some parallels, I would say, now between Afghanistan and Vietnam, because, you know, this is kind of the how insurgencies work, how guerrillas defeat much more powerful adversaries. They don't do it by out-fighting the enemy. They do it by outlasting the enemy. And, you know, in the case of Vietnam, U.S. forces never lost a major battle to the army of North Vietnam or the Viet Cong. But ultimately, it didn't matter because our inability to defeat the Communists led American public opinion to turn against the war and led to the American pullout in 1973, which two years later resulted in the North Vietnamese invasion and conquest of South Vietnam. And you see a similar dynamic, I think, playing out today in Afghanistan, where, again, U.S. troops have never lost the battle to the Taliban. But it doesn't matter because the Taliban insurgency kept going and President Biden ultimately decided that he didn't want to keep supporting the government of Afghanistan with U.S. troops and so pulled the U.S. troops out. And now the most likely outcome is that the Taliban will probably prevail. So, you know, this is a, you know, another example of a superpower humbled and we should not deceive ourselves. We lost the war in Vietnam and we're losing the war right now in Afghanistan. MICHAEL MORELL: Max, thank you so much for joining us. It's been terrific to have you and I really enjoyed the discussion. MAX BOOT. Thank you very much. Great discussion.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, COVID summer surge threatens America's recovery and brings fresh urgency to the country's vaccination push. Along with the heat and the fires and the drought comes a fourth wave of coronavirus. Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are all on the rise nationwide, with the contagious Delta variant responsible for more than eighty percent of new infections. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I know this has gotten a bit politicized, but I hope it's starting to change. It's not about red states or blue states. It's about life and it's about death. JOHN DICKERSON: But severe illness and death are almost entirely among those who are still unvaccinated. What will it talk to encourage holdouts to get the shot? We'll talk with former Surgeon General Doctor Jerome Adams. And the debate over face coverings is back as some cities reimpose mask mandates. Are they an effective tool against the new viral variants? We'll check in with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Plus-- PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We know that our economic recovery hinges on getting the pandemic under control. JOHN DICKERSON: We'll talk with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo about how much of a threat the Delta variant poses to the economy. And we'll hear from Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas, whose city is grappling with both COVID and crime. Last year there were a record number of homicides in Kansas City. This year is on track to be even worse. What can be done to stem the tide? Finally, we'll get an eye-opening look at the chaotic final year of the Trump presidency with the authors of a new book, \"I Alone Can Fix It,\" Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker. It's all ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. The highly contagious Delta variant is driving the country into a fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Infections continue to surge, and with less than half the country fully vaccinated, public officials are urgently trying to convince the hesitant so that the spike doesn't drag on into the fall. We begin this morning with Mark Strassmann in Atlanta. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): Unvaccinated America is playing COVID roulette with a mix of reluctance and defiance. CROWD (in unison): Unmask our kids. MARK STRASSMANN: And in places like New Orleans, the dominant Delta variant has pounced. LATOYA CANTRELL: It's more aggressive; it is deadlier, and it is in our community. MARK STRASSMANN: Nationally, new COVID cases have spiked almost fifty percent. Rises in all fifty states, and ninety percent of U.S. jurisdictions. WOMAN #1: If you can, please get vaccinated. MARK STRASSMANN: Ominously, week to week COVID hospitalizations and deaths both jumped again. DR. STEVEN STITES: We're past the tipping point. We're in trouble. MARK STRASSMANN: Trouble because of deserted vaccination clinics like this. Everyone has freedom of choice, even when it becomes your problem. GOVERNOR KAY IVEY (R-Alabama): I've done all I know how to do. MARK STRASSMANN: Governor Kay Ivey's problem in Alabama, new cases here up seven hundred sixty-six percent in the last month, in a red state with one of America's lowest vaccination rates. KAY IVEY: Folks supposed to have common sense. But it's time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks. It's the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down. MARK STRASSMANN: Take Kentucky, since March 1st, ninety-five percent of all COVID cases, ninety-two percent of all hospitalizations, and eighty-nine percent of deaths were among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people. MAN: I'm more afraid than anything, I'll put it that way, than I would have been, I guess, if I had gotten-- gotten the vaccine. MARK STRASSMANN: Vaccination rates in the next few weeks may define this fourth phase of the virus. WOMAN #2: Like how I saw my parents struggling to breathe. It took me to-- to watch my parents suffer. MARK STRASSMANN: And there's new vaccine pressure. The NFL warned this week that outbreaks among unvaccinated players could lead to forfeited games and paychecks. And more universities and employers have started to impose vaccine mandates. GOVERNOR STEVE SISOLAK (D-Nevada): Vaccines are how we end the pandemic, how we protect our communities, and we-- how we retire our masks for good. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: But for now, masking is back, not everywhere, but increasingly recommended, even required. Across the south school starts in a couple of weeks, and when it does, Atlanta's system will require students and teachers to wear masks. John. JOHN DICKERSON: Mark Strassmann, thank you. The World Health Organization is warning that countries are in the early stages of another global wave of COVID infections and deaths. This comes as demonstrators in France, Italy, and Australia took to the streets this weekend, protesting against vaccination passes and new lockdown measures. Elizabeth Palmer has the latest from London. ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@CBSLizpalmer): Good morning. The idea of vaccine passports is gaining traction in Europe. Six countries now have some version of them, and France has the strictest rules. There, they will be necessary to even enter many public places. (Begin VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: And that kicked off violent demonstrations in Paris. Riot police tussled with protesters on Saturday, which was dramatic, but actually a side show because most people have accepted the new rules. In the line for the Eiffel Tower, some showed bar codes, others hard copies, and there was even on-site COVID testing so anyone without a passport could get in, too. There were also demonstrations this weekend in Australia. Police in Sydney ducked flower pots hurled by protesters furious about a new lockdown. Australia had kept COVID at bay by closing its borders, but the virus sneaked in anyway, and infections are on the rise. In Brazil thousands of demonstrators hit the streets. But they're demanding more vaccinations and blame President Jair Bolsonaro's bungled COVID response for one of the highest death rates anywhere. Though, currently, Argentina's is even higher. In fact, the countries of South America, where it's now winter, are together losing more people to COVID than anywhere else on Earth. Asia is also hard hit. The Olympics got underway in Tokyo with virtually no spectators. And dozens of athletes have had to pull out after testing positive. Indonesia is overtaking India as the current Asian hotspot. In Jakarta families cued in the streets to buy oxygen. And with ICU beds full, victims often fall ill and die at home. But there are stories of remarkable COVID recoveries. How about a hundred-and-two-year-old Nikolai Bagayev from Moscow, a World War II veteran, who left hospital this week, bursting with pride to have battled the virus and won? (End VT) ELIZABETH PALMER: And there is some global good news, too: over a quarter of the adult population of this Earth has now had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. And overall, deaths are on their way down. John. JOHN DICKERSON: Liz Palmer, thank you. And now we go to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who is also on the board of Pfizer. He joins us from Las Vegas, Nevada. Good morning, Doctor Gottlieb. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: So let's start. People are hearing about increasing cases, maybe wearing masks, even if you're vaccinated. There's also talk of breakthroughs if you're vaccinated. You always want to start with the risk decisions that people have to make for themselves. So how should Americans think about what's happening right now and how they should make their own risk judgments based on what you know? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, the first thing I would urge Americans to do is to get vaccinated. We know the vaccines are highly effective, even against this Delta variant. There was data in The New England Journal of Medicine out this week showing that the vaccines are eighty-eight percent effective against symptomatic disease. And, certainly, anyone who goes out and gets vaccinated right now is going to have a vaccine that protects them through the fall and the winter. So they're going to have broad, durable protection from that vaccine. Whether you're vaccinated or unvaccinated, if you want to add an additional measure of protection, if you're in a high prevalence environment where there's a lot of infection, a mask can still be helpful against this new variant. The physical characteristics of this virus has-- has not changed. The reason it's more transmissible is that there's simply more of it. When people get infected, they get more virus, higher viral levels and they exude more virus, so they're more contagious. But the characteristics of the virus haven't changed as far as we know. So it's not more airborne. It's not more likely to be permeable through a mask. So a mask can still be helpful. I think, though, if you're going to consider wearing a mask, the quality of the mask does matter. So if you can get your hands on a KN95 mask or an N95 mask, that's going to afford you a lot more protection. Initially at the outset of this epidemic, we were encouraging people not to use N95 masks because there weren't enough of those masks for medical workers. Now there's plenty of masks. There's plenty of N95 masks in the system. The Biden administration has done a good job ramping up supply. There's also KN95 masks available. So I would encourage people to look at the quality of the mask and try to get their hands on a better quality of mask. The final piece of advice I would give and the question I get a lot is, if you are vaccinated, can you still spread the virus? We had pretty good data with the old strains of the coronavirus that if you were vaccinated, you were far less likely to transmit the virus. That's probably still true. You're probably less likely to transmit the virus. But if you are vaccinated and you do-- you do develop an asymptomatic or a mildly symptomatic infection, there probably is a higher chance that you can transmit this Delta virus than some of the old strains because there's just more of this virus. The viral levels are higher earlier in the course of the infection. So if you're around vulnerable people, if you're taking care of a newborn or an elderly patient and you're vaccinated, you don't feel well, you should probably get yourself checked out, not assume that you're impervious to any kind of infection, even if you're vaccinated. JOHN DICKERSON: So when you use the word probably it seems like the moment we're in it. Do we have a handle on this Delta variant in terms of how much there is? And some of the questions you just-- you just raised is a little bit more fuzzy than-- than we might hope. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, what we know is that the-- the virus levels that you develop early in the course of the infection are significantly higher with this Delta virus than with the old strains. And that's why people are more contagious. That's why this is spreading more rapidly. But the other thing we know about this is that those virus levels go up very quickly. And that's why we think that the virus is more-- it's easier for this virus to overwhelm the immune system. So, for example, if you have a vaccine that you got seven or eight months ago and your antibody levels are declining, if you get this new Delta variant, it's easier for this Delta variant to overwhelm low antibody levels. And that's why we-- we're considering whether or not some people might need booster-- boosters to increase their antibody levels. So we know that you have more virus onboard earlier in the course of the infection. We know that you're likely to shed more virus that makes you more contagious. It also makes it more likely that you're going to develop an infection from this new variant. JOHN DICKERSON: There was a study done by the COVID-19 Research Consortium that said basically we may be in this period we're in now all the way through into mid-October. The CDC then came out with numbers and said over the next three weeks, there may be between ninety thousand and eight hundred thousand new cases. That seems like a very big range, between ninety and eighty hundred thousand. What's your sense of how long we're going to be in this period we're in? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, people are having a hard time modeling this-- this outbreak. And the CDC relies on outside modelers to do their own estimates and they put out the models that they got from that consensus group. But you're right, if you look at heading into the week of August 14th, the models that the CDC puts-- puts out or put out estimates that there's going to be anywhere from ten thousand infections a day over the course of that week to a hundred thousand infections a day, which really is an indication that they don't have a good sense where we're heading with this outbreak. I believe that there is more virus than we're picking up right now. There's probably a lot of people with mild to subclinical infection since more of the infection is happening in a younger population that's less likely to become very symptomatic. We're not doing a lot of testing. More of the testing that we are doing is antigen-- antigen tests that are being done at home and not getting reported. So I think we're much further into this epidemic than we're picking up and, hopefully, further through this epidemic. If you look at the U.K. right now, and we're probably about three weeks, maybe four weeks behind the U.K., perhaps a little less than that. If you look at the U.K., they do in the last seven days appear to be turning a corner. You're starting to see a downward trajectory on the cases. Now, it's unclear whether that's going to be sustained. They just lifted a lot of the mitigation that they had in place. But if the U.K. is any guide, we are perhaps further into this epidemic and hopefully going to turn a corner in the next two or maybe three weeks. JOHN DICKERSON: In-- in hindsight, would it have been better if the CDC tracked those breakthrough cases on vaccines so that we'd have a clearer picture of those questions you raised, which is how possible is it for a breakthrough and how symptomatic or how much you might be able to spread, even if you've got a very mild case once you've been vaccinated? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think it's absolutely the case. Right now the CDC is only tracking breakthrough infections when people get hospitalized. And so we know that vaccines are very effective at preventing hospitalization in Florida, which is really the epicenter of the epidemic, right now. Ninety-five percent of the people who are hospitalized are people who are not fully vaccinated. But we need to understand whether or not vaccinated people are developing subclinical and mild infections and whether or not they can spread the virus, because that's going to inform the kinds of decisions that they make. And we're just simply not tracking that. So it depended upon data from other countries like Israel for trying to answer those important questions. It's a question I get a lot from vaccinated individuals is whether or not they can spread the infection. Again, we know that they were far less likely to spread the infection with the other variants. We don't know a lot about this Delta. This is a question that can be answered, and CDC should be looking at this. JOHN DICKERSON: Finally, in the last forty seconds we have here--those who have kids going back to school under twelve years old, the vaccine is not available. President Biden said he hoped it would be soon. What's your sense of when that might be available for those under twelve? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. Well, Pfizer, the company I'm on the board of, is one of the companies developing this vaccine. It's a ten-microgram vaccine. So it's going to be a lower dose in children under the age of twelve than the thirty-microgram vaccine that we have for people who are twelve and above that we're also using in adults. The clinical data from this trial looking at this ten-microgram vaccine for children ages five through eleven should be available in September. The FDA recently indicated that it's unlikely to be available before midwinter because I believe that the FDA is likely to require at least six months of follow-up, four to six months of follow-up of the children in that clinical trial. So that puts it more in the winter timeframe. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Doctor Scott Gottlieb, thanks as always. And we'll be back. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We go now to Vice Admiral Doctor Jerome Adams, the U.S. surgeon general in the Trump administration. He joins us from Indianapolis. Good morning, Doctor. JEROME ADAMS, M.D. (Former U.S. Surgeon General/@JeromeAdamsMD): Good morning, John. Good to be with you. JOHN DICKERSON: Let's start with those comments by Governor Kay Ivey of Alabama, which is a state that's had very low vaccination rates. I've seen you out talking, trying to cajole, convince people patiently. She, obviously, took a different approach and hit him right between the eyes. She said, \"Folks are supposed to have common sense, but it's time to start blaming unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks. It's the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down.\" How do you think that's going to go over? JEROME ADAMS: Well, I think everyone has a different approach and different levers. I still think there are a lot of people out there who have legitimate questions and who have legitimate barriers. For instance, there are people who have access issues. They're gig economy workers. There are people who are scared that if they take the vaccine and have side effects, they're not going to be able to go into work the next day and they're going to miss out on a paycheck or may lose their job. You also asked Doctor Gottlieb, I heard, about kids getting vaccinated. Here's what worries me, John. We still have no clear timetable on when we can expect FDA licensure of these vaccines for adults. And a lot of people say that that is still causing their hesitancy, number one. But number two, I can tell you the quickest way to get people vaccinated is through mandates. And we can't have mask mandates. We won't-- you're hearing this from the military and from other businesses until you have full licensure of these vaccines. So if you want to get a bunch of people vaccinated, really quickly, get these vaccines licensed and then you'll see the military make it mandatory. You'll see businesses make it mandatory. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the-- the governor's--she said that-- that people are letting us down. Can we do just a brief public service announcement here? A lot of people have talked about the vaccine as individual choice. It's my choice. Nobody else's business. Others who've been vaccinated say, what do I care if people don't get vaccinated? I'm protected. Can you just remind people why it's important beyond just the boundaries of your own body to get vaccinated? JEROME ADAMS: Well, I always say to people, it is your choice, but choices come with consequences to you and to other people. The consequences to other people are that you may put my eleven-year-old daughter who can't get vaccinated at risk. You may put my wife, who is going through cancer therapy at risk, or my mother, who had a stroke last year in the middle of a pandemic, at additional risk, even though, both she and my mother are vaccinated. But there's also real harm to you because, guess what? More mitigation is coming, whether it's masking or whether it's closures or whether it's your kids having to return to virtual learning, that is coming. And it's coming because this pandemic is spiraling out of control yet again and it's spiraling out of control because we don't have enough people vaccinated. So get vaccinated because it helps your neighbors, but get vaccinated because it's going to help every single American enjoy the freedoms that we want to return to. JOHN DICKERSON: You wrote a piece this week saying that the CDC should change their guidance on masking, that even if you're vaccinated, you should get masked. What made you-- why do you hold that position? JEROME ADAMS: Well, we need to learn from what happened in the past. And in the past, I was reflecting back on my own statements about masking, and I wish in hindsight I hadn't been as definitive. I wish I had been humble enough to understand that this is a new virus. I wish that my message had been heard differently. And what I said and what Tony Fauci really were saying was save the medical mask for the medical workers. But what people heard-- what they heard was that masks don't work, which was not the message that we were trying to send moving forward. The CDC put out new guidance in May and that-- that guidance, quite frankly, has confused citizens; it's frustrated businesses and public health officials who I continue to hear from. And it's been by any quantification of failure. Vaccinations are-- are down and cases are up. So it's time for the CDC, if you don't want to call it, if you don't want to say we're changing the guidance, let's call it a clarification. Let's go out there and clarify that, yes, if you were vaccinated and you're around other people who were vaccinated, you are still probably safe. And I still, when I'm around vaccinated people, I still don't wear a mask. But if you're out in public, if you're around people who you don't know whether they're vaccinated or not, and especially if you're in a community where prevalence is going up, as Doctor Gottlieb said, it is probably going to be safest for you to mask it whether or not you're vaccinated or not. And your public health officials who don't have a good way of knowing or your businesses who don't have a good way of knowing who's vaccinated or not, they're going to have find that they have no other choice but to call on more people to mask it. And the CDC needs to give those businesses, those health officials, a little bit of cover by clarifying the guidance that they have out there. JOHN DICKERSON: How effective do you think that will be, though? I think of Florida and Governor DeSantis there, who has basically built an argument on pushing back against these mandates. When CDC suggested masking for those under twelve in schools, Governor DeSantis said, no, we're not going to do that here. So the CDC can issue guidelines, but there are a lot of people in unvaccinated areas who are only too happy to push against those guidelines. JEROME ADAMS: Well, there's always going to be exceptions, and one of the great things about America is that we have the ability state by state, for people to do what they feel is best for their state. But the fact is for every person you point out like Governor DeSantis, there are a number of other governors and health officials who say, if you give us cover, we're going to move in this direction. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me-- JEROME ADAMS: And businesses still will be able to lean on CDC guidance and say we're doing this because of the CDC guidance, whereas Walmart said we have no way of telling who is vaccinated or not. So we're just going to say no mask for anybody. You have the L.A. County sheriff saying we're not going to enforce a mask mandate because CDC guidance says we don't have to. We've got to give those folks some cover. JOHN DICKERSON: Doctor, I want to get to the question of overdoses. A record number of overdoses last year. This is an issue you've worked on that it's very important to you. Why is the overdose number up? JEROME ADAMS: John, this is personal to me, as-- as I've talked about before, I have family members, my own brother, who's suffering from substance use disorder, and in 2020, we saw numbers skyrocket. We had a record year in 2019, seventy thousand people sadly died of drug overdoses. We blew that away last year because of COVID. Ninety-three thousand people died. And we know that both isolation from COVID, stress from COVID, but also cut off of resources, Forty-three percent of people reported decreases in services available through syringe service programs because of the pandemic, have combined to cause this explosion. And it's disproportionately impacting Black and brown communities, a twenty-percent rise in whites, a thirty-percent rise in Blacks and Hispanics in overdose deaths last year. JOHN DICKERSON: We have twenty seconds. What's the next step? What can be done? JEROME ADAMS: Well, I'm working with the Bipartisan Policy Committee. I want to applaud Congress for combining their mental health and addiction task forces, and we need to really ramp up telehealth services, which came about because of COVID, which are really the silver lining here in terms of making services more available. There is hope, but we've got to be able to pay attention to it. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Doctor Adams, I'm sorry we've run out of time. Thank you so very much for being with us today. And we'll be right back in a moment. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: If you're not able to watch the full FACE THE NATION, you can set your DVR. We're also available on demand through your cable service; plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount Plus app. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Kansas City, Missouri Mayor Quinton Lucas, and authors of I Alone Can Fix It, Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We turn now to the economy and the impact that the COVID resurgence could have on the recovery. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo joins us. Good morning. Thank you so much for being here. GINA RAIMONDO (Secretary of Commerce/@SecRaimondo): Good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: You said this week, if you're asking me what can we do to get our economy back on track, get vaccinated. Give me your sense--you talk to businesses all the time. What are some specific ways in which, I saw that Apple is delaying reopening their-- their headquarters a month because of Delta, what are some specific ways that it's affecting business? GINA RAIMONDO: You know, we-- at this point this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated. You know, ninety-seven percent of people in hospitals are unvaccinated. So what every business leader that I know is just encouraging every employee and every member in their family to get vaccinated so that when they come back to work, a lot of businesses are planning on full back in office post Labor Day. They're saying, you want to feel safe, you should feel safe, you should feel comfortable. We want you back in the office, collaborating. So that means get vaccinated. I don't sense, I will say this, you know, we are not where we were a year ago or six months ago by any stretch. We have highly effective vaccines. So the push now is to get vaccinated. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to talk about going back to the workplace in a minute, but tourism is one of the focuses. You've-- you've tried to help the tourism industry that was hurt. There was a big sell off on Monday and a lot of the stocks that were hurt were tourism stocks. You don't see any issues there with people being nervous about traveling because of this summer surge we're seeing? GINA RAIMONDO: Again, I just-- it really does come back to making sure everybody's vaccinated. You know, I think that people are not nervous because they know these vaccines are incredibly effective on-- on the different variants. There is, you know, I think a frustration by those who are vaccinated with those who aren't vaccinated, saying it's so simple, it's free, it's easy, limited side effects. Let's get this done. JOHN DICKERSON: Speaking of let's get this done, there's an infrastructure bill that's bouncing around. Where do things stand? This is in the bipartisan negotiations to get infrastructure passed. GINA RAIMONDO: Very close. We're in the final strokes or in the final days. We're optimistic. We are all engaging daily, multiple times a day, with members of the Senate and we're feeling really good about it. JOHN DICKERSON: So if it gets through the Senate, you get the ten Republicans you want and the fifty Democrats you want, but Nancy Pelosi has said she's not going to send a bill over until another piece of legislation passes and then passes the Senate. That seems to add a lot of complexity. You got to do that before you get this infrastructure thing you want. GINA RAIMONDO: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: How's that going to work out? GINA RAIMONDO: This-- this is complex. You know this is unusual and complex, but it's what Americans want. It's what Americans deserve. I'll tell you, when I was governor, if I ever worked on an issue where I had both the Chamber of Commerce and the local AFL-CIO saying they supported it and get it done, I knew it had to happen because it was the right thing to do. And that's what we have here. I hear from business leaders every day, get this passed. We need everyone to have broadband. We need improvements in roads and bridges. You hear the same thing from labor and progressive. So, yes, it's complicated. No, we're not there, yet, but it's going to happen. JOHN DICKERSON: So-- but the hurdles are not just the Republicans working out on this infrastructure deal. It's also got to be worked through with the Democratic leader of the House. GINA RAIMONDO: Absolutely. But I know-- I know this. If there's one person in Washington who knows how to get things done, it's Speaker Nancy Pelosi and she knows this is what the American people want. And so, it's-- I'm not going to pretend this is not easy. It is complex, but we make progress every day and I-- we feel optimistic. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the jobs picture. The President was asked in the CNN town hall, a restaurant owner said, I'm having trouble hiring people. And it was really interesting, the President was pretty candid. He said that basically people are looking to make more money and they're looking to bargain. And he said, \"So I think your business in the tourist business is really going to be in a bind for a little while.\" So how is that going to work out? Wages are going up, people want more, but if hiring is not happening, those businesses are-- especially the small ones are going to have trouble staying-- staying afloat. GINA RAIMONDO: There is some of that, to be sure. But the thing that I think we all really have to keep our eye on, in addition to wages is childcare. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. GINA RAIMONDO: Like a lot of people who work in these jobs are women-- JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. GINA RAIMONDO: --waitresses working at a hotel. So schools have to open, childcare has to come back online, and we have to pass the President's Families Plan, which provides for childcare, tax credits, investments in pre-K, investments in home care. Women are in these jobs and they're struggling to juggle between taking care of their kids and going to work. JOHN DICKERSON: And is that the answer to the small business question? Because small businesses say, look, the massive businesses, they can offer childcare, they can give inducements to help women back into the workforce. But our small business, we can't do it. GINA RAIMONDO: Absolutely. Absolutely. That's why, you know, what the President's calling for is every four-year-old in America ought to be able to go to public pre-K. It's good for the kids. It's good for business. You know the-- the Families Plan provides for home care. I-- I read a story recently about a woman who had to give up her job as a paramedic because she couldn't find home care for her autistic son. And she started working for Uber so she could keep the kid in the car with her. JOHN DICKERSON: You mentioned workplaces, people coming back to work after Labor Day. Do CE-- there seems to be some tension between CEOs who want people back, and surveys which show people want to stay with these hybrid environments, thinking of childcare as a part of that, how do you see that tussle getting worked out? GINA RAIMONDO: We need better, higher quality, affordable childcare. You know I do hear from businesses all the time that women are turning down promotions. You know some of their star employees who are women, they want to get a promotion and women say, I can't do it because I-- I have childcare needs or women aren't coming back into the workforce. We still have two million women who fell out of the workforce who haven't re-entered. So, you know, you talk about infrastructure and, yes, we need bridges and roads to get to work. Women need childcare so that they can get to work and be productive and it needs to be affordable. And so I think this is it's core to our competitiveness to have a better kind of family care infrastructure in America that's affordable. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. GINA RAIMONDO: That's affordable. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Secretary Raimondo, we're out of time. Thank you so much for being with us. GINA RAIMONDO: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We go now to Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas, who joins us from our CBS station KCTV in Fairway, Kansas. Good morning, Mister Mayor. QUINTON LUCAS (Mayor of Kansas City, Missouri/@QuintonLucasKC): Good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: The chief medical officer at the University of Kansas Health System said that they are past the tipping point. We talked last week with the Springfield mayor who said he was asking the governor for extra space to handle the COVID patients because they had already passed the tipping point as well. Is that something you're considering with the uptick in COVID cases in Kansas City? QUINTON LUCAS: Abs-- absolutely. We continue to work with our hospital leadership and ask our friends in Jefferson City to help us out not just with outreach on vaccines, but to make sure that we're ready to handle any type of crisis that would come to our hospitals. None of us wanted to be in this position. That's why we have been pushing and clamoring for months for positive messages about vaccines, but certainly now making sure that we're ready with hospital resources in case we need more and more ICU space to address the current crisis. JOHN DICKERSON: You-- last month you said you were concerned about the inability to break that forty percent threshold of vaccination. There's been some help from the Department of Housing and Urban Development that Health and Human Services have-- have helped in Kansas City to get people vaccinated. But the rates are still low, 38.8 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated. What's been the sticking point to improve those numbers? QUINTON LUCAS: You know I-- I think they're painfully low. We have continued to message, perhaps to-- to populations that haven't needed to hear that message. We need to make sure that we're reaching out to young people. Young men of color is a place where we have incredible weakness right now. That's why we're not only being as creative as possible in how we reach out through traditional media, but also concerts. We'll be appearing and giving away tickets at hip-hop concerts, country music concerts, any number of things that say to people that the vaccine is around, the vaccine is safe and it's important for you to take. But another part of that is that we continue to have to push back against negative messaging, some of that messaging from people from this state running for United States Senate that are saying that the federal government is trying to kick down your door, force you to get a vaccine. What we're really trying to say is it is safe. This is not compulsion. This is instead something that's important for yourself and your family. JOHN DICKERSON: You talked about compulsion. Over in St. Louis, they are reinstating the mask mandates in some instances. Are you rethinking that as-- as the Delta variant spreads? And how does the mask mandate question coincide and conflict with the message you're trying to pass about getting vaccinated? QUINTON LUCAS: Well, you know, I think every mayor of a major city in America right now is wondering if it's a time to return to mandates. We have thought at this point thus far that it is not necessary for Kansas City. As the secretary of commerce just noted, ninety-seven percent of the cases that we're seeing in hospitals are from those who are unvaccinated, so breaking through to that population. And I think when you think about that population, maybe about half of our unvaccinated folks are those that want to fight and think that this was all just fake. But there's another half of folks that just haven't done it yet for whatever reason. So we are trying to make sure that we push that message. In terms of compulsion, we are giving more consideration to requiring all of our five thousand city employees to be vaccinated. I think that is something. I do encourage more American businesses, more American local and state governments to consider that as an important step for how we can show how important it is to our jurisdictions. JOHN DICKERSON: I'm going to switch to the topic of-- of crime and-- and violence. When you came into office you-- you were-- said you were committed to having fewer than a hundred murders in Kansas City. The homicide rate went above that and-- and-- and set records. What's been the biggest challenge for you in terms of combating those homicides? QUINTON LUCAS: You know we can say it forever, but-- but firearms, firearms trafficking into our state. Most of the guns used in crimes in Kansas City, indeed, all of the guns used in crimes in my city, Chicago, St. Louis, so many others don't start out in Kansas City or St. Louis or Chicago. We need an ATF that will work with us in terms of fighting firearms trafficking. But I will note something in my state and it's happening in more American states, red states in the South and the Midwest. They've passed new laws that prohibit or make it a crime for our local law enforcement to work with federal agencies on certain issues, particularly as it relates to gun trafficking. We're running into more and more hurdles in terms of how we fight violent crime in our major cities. These are things that have not been helpful in turning around this crisis. We will continue to work with our young people and opportunities and everything under the sun. But most of our murders are committed by firearms. We have too many flooding the streets of our city, too many that are sold illegally in gun shows and we need to make sure that we limit that. JOHN DICKERSON: The attorney general was in Chicago, that-- they are focusing on-on five cities. Kansas City is not one of them. Could you use a little-- a little more federal attention on that issue of gun trafficking? QUINTON LUCAS: You know we've had a wonderful relationship with the White House so far. I've appreciated this administration and I will note something different than from the last administration. When they're working with us they call us in advance. We have a chance to have a long conversation about what our cities need. We're not just sending federal agencies and federal forces in to say, you must take this. And so we will continue to reach out to the White House and many others to make sure that we can have more resources. But back to the point from before, we just want an ATF that's able to do what it is supposed to do, stopping the illegal trafficking of firearms. We need an FBI and others that are focused on preventing violent crime. Those are the things they can help us in all of our cities because, look, we've had generations of doing the same thing. Traditional enforcement efforts don't work the same way that actually working with communities, getting the tools of weapons, working with young people are in terms of changing our violent crime numbers in Kansas City. JOHN DICKERSON: One of the ways to-- you've talked about in terms of changing those crime statistics is community programs getting in-- particularly with teenagers that were decimated or shut down during COVID. How many of those are coming back online and how much time was lost, how much was harmed that'll-- that'll last long after the pandemic is gone in terms of those community efforts to help with the teenagers? QUINTON LUCAS: You know I don't think any of us would mislead the viewers in saying that this was not a tough year in terms of losing very important community programs with young people who were excited to be a part of them. Here in Kansas City, we brought back Mayor's Night Hoops, a basketball program. We're trying to engage with young people as much as possible. But this is kind of the challenge of COVID-19, which is that as we have a Delta variant rising, as we're seeing more concerns with community events, particularly indoor events, as we at some point get to the cold weather months, we want to make sure we can keep doing them. And so we are bringing them all back. We hope we get to keep having them. And so part of that is getting people vaccinated, including these very young people, so that we can make sure we're looking out for them. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Mayor Quinton Lucas, thank you so much for being with us. Good luck to your community. And we'll be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We turn now to a new book that chronicles Donald Trump's tumultuous final year in office. Carol Leonnig and Phil Rucker are the authors of \"I Alone Can Fix It.\" Good morning to both of you. Carol, let's start with you. Your first book ended after the first impeachment. The second book has another impeachment. Is there a through line for President Trump's administration between those two impeachments? CAROL LEONNIG (Co-Author, \"I Alone Can Fix It\"/@CarolLeonnig): Absolutely, there is, John. What's striking about that timeframe is, the President learns as a result of the first impeachment that he's untouchable. There's no consequence for his behavior. There is no consequence for stretching the law, bending it, breaking it. You know in a criminal situation, if he weren't president, there are a lot of people would argue he violated the law the first time around and as well the second time around. So as he becomes more emboldened, he rejects the advice of experts. He's the expert now. He rejects the-- the suggestions of his closest advisers if it's not what he wants because he knows best in his mind. Unfortunately, in 2020, it's no longer a PR spin game. You know it is actually a-- a crisis that puts all of us at risk, and American lives are lost as a result. JOHN DICKERSON: So he learned exactly the wrong lesson before the pandemic? CAROL LEONNIG: Absolutely. JOHN DICKERSON: Phil, you-- you both covered this, in the daily minutia of-- and its zaniness. Was there anything that you saw as you went over this and looked at it from slightly higher perspective that comes when you have to sit and write a book? PHILIP RUCKER (Co-Author, \"I Alone Can Fix It\"/@PhilipRucker): You know, John, when we were covering this day in and day out for the Washington Post in real time, we thought we knew it all. We thought we were in the room with our reporting. But it wasn't until Trump left office and Carol and I did this deeper excavation and sat down with a hundred forty, you know, cabinet members and senior administration officials and advisers to get the full story, that we learned how much worse it really was. How much-- how close the country came to the brink not only of chaos, but of democracy falling. The fears that General Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had, that Trump could actually use the military in those final weeks as-- as President to execute a coup, to stay in power despite the popular will of the voters to elect Joe Biden. It was a harrowing year and an especially harrowing, you know, final few months. JOHN DICKERSON: Carol, when-- when the President, after surviving the first impeachment, had this new armor, this new sense of nothing can touch me. How did that affect the people around him? I mean did they-- were they-- were they unable to do anything or did they say, yes, I'm getting behind that armor and we're going to go do great things? CAROL LEONNIG: I sort of see the presidency in two halves as a result of the reporting that Phil and I did. That first half there are a lot of adults. There are guardrails that are holding the President back from some of his worst impulses and they are not always successful, but largely successful. After that, however, and, sadly, in 2020, when real crisis hits, most of those guardrails have been ground through. And a lot of the people around the President know that they're not going to succeed unless they say, yes, or unless they nod politely. There's another thing Phil and I learned that is sort of made our jaws drop, which is that we didn't know this in real time, or we would have told the American people, many people who were the most ardent supporters of the President were afraid to counter him because they were afraid who would replace them. Would it be worse? Would there be no bulwark at all against orders to vaccinate people before the vaccine was ready? Would there be a loyalist installed to the Defense Department who would do what President Trump wanted all of 2020, which was to sick U.S. active duty military on civil rights protesters during the Black Lives Matter summer. JOHN DICKERSON: That was-- Phil, when you interviewed the President afterwards, he said that was his greatest regret, that he didn't, well, what-- what did he say about the Black Lives Matter protest? PHILIP RUCKER: John, it-- it actually he said it was his only regret from the year 2020. He has no regrets, according to what he told Carol and me about how he handled the pandemic, about the hundreds of thousands of lives lost on his watch. His one regret was that he didn't send active duty U.S. military troops into Portland and to Seattle and to Minneapolis and to Washington to go after the Black Lives Matter protesters. These were people demonstrating injustice in-- in the law enforcement system here in this country. And Trump wanted a show of force. He wanted to send the military into the streets to silence them. JOHN DICKERSON: Carol, when you look back in an administration and talk to aides, you get kind of two sorts. They're the ones who say, oh, my gosh, it was worse than you thought. And then the other kind who are still loyal. I get e-mails from somebody in the Nixon administration who was still-- it's like it's 1972. What was the general temperature of the people you talked to who had served in the Trump administration? CAROL LEONNIG: Almost to a person, even those who were so, so loyal had left with such disappointment and sadness about what happened, the death that could have been avoided. I'll give you an example without naming sources. And again, as you know, we-- we interviewed more than a hundred and forty people who were on the front row to this-- this-- this rollicking ride. But we learned in our reporting that former CDC Director Robert Redfield, his biggest disappointment that he confided to aides was that he could not convince Donald Trump to wear a mask. And he knew that not only would it protect the President, it would send a message to the country. And he believes that American lives, thousands of them, could have been saved if he had been successful. He tried convincing the President's physician, Sean Conley, you know, please reach out to him, get him to do this. The President resisted. He thought it made him look weak. And Conley, the doctor, said to Redfield, I'm so sorry. You know what it's like when you don't have-- when you have a patient that doesn't listen to you. JOHN DICKERSON: Phil, what was the governing principle of-- what was the principle that drove Donald Trump? PHILIP RUCKER: It's really simple. The principle was, how do I better myself and how do I better my political fortunes? That's what Trump talked about and thought about every minute of every day in making decisions throughout the four years of the presidency, but especially in his final year as a crisis hit the American people, the pandemic, the economic crisis, the racial justice crisis. He thought every single moment of that time, how do I look better for November 3rd for the election? And he set aside the other concerns. And that's what was really troubling to the people who served him and confided this in us. JOHN DICKERSON: It-- help me figure out this puzzle, Carol, which is if that's the mindset, why isn't the President talking about vaccines more? He could say Operation Warp Speed, this is a huge success. Get vaccinated. Why-- why has he responded, do you think, the way he has? CAROL LEONNIG: In terms of good governing, sadly, this fits the pattern for Donald Trump. You know none of his answers are exactly consistent. For example, everyone who served him told us, well, I should say everyone we interviewed on this subject told us it would have been so easy for him to protect American public health if he had just listened to his doctors, if he had just said, according to his medical experts-- experts wear the mask. The vaccine works. If he had just continually said that. But not-- but what he was focused on was the daily, hourly, weekly news cycle. I'm going to win the optics war. This was the Trump toolkit that was so inadequate for a real crisis. And what Phil and I were warned about by sources when we wrote the first book, this guy's toolkit is going to be inadequate if-- JOHN DICKERSON: We go to wrap. Sorry, Carol. CAROL LEONNIG: Oh, I'm so sorry. JOHN DICKERSON: No, we've run out of time. Carol, Phil, thank you so much. PHILIP RUCKER: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thank you so much for watching. We'll be here again next week. Join us then. For FACE THE NATION, I'm John Dickerson.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson that aired Sunday, February 14, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning, a special interview with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He, like President Biden, is struggling with the pandemic. The U.K. death rate by percentage of population has now surpassed the US rate and is one of the highest in the world. Good morning to you, Mr. Prime Minister.\u00a0PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM BORIS JOHNSON: Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for joining us. I- I wanted to ask you a little bit of your reflection on what just happened overnight. You strongly condemned the attack on the US Capitol and said it was completely wrong for then President Trump to have consistently cast doubt on the outcome of a free election in terms of America's global standing. What signal did his acquittal make?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: I think the clear message that we get from the proceedings in America is that after all the toings and froings and all the kerfuffle, American democracy is strong and the American Constitution is strong and- and robust. And we're delighted now, I'm very delighted, to have a good relationship with the White House, which is an important part of any UK prime minister's mission. And I've had some good conversations already with- with President Biden, fantastic conversations about the way he sees things. And, you know, MARGARET, there's been some important developments in the way the UK, US thinking has been coming together in the last few weeks, and particularly on issues like climate change, on NATO, on Iran, but above all, on the ways that the US and the UK are going to work together to deal with the environmental challenge that faces our- our planet. And there, I think some of the stuff we're now hearing from the new American administration and from the new White House is incredibly encouraging. And we want to work with the- with the president on that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand you will be hosting President Biden for his first foreign minister's- foreign meeting on the 19th, although it'll be virtual because of COVID. The Trump administration has already pledged about 4 billion dollars in December to the Global Vaccine Alliance in this fight against COVID. And I understand that's the focus of your upcoming meeting with President Biden. What are you asking him to do?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: The United States and the U.K. both have an incredibly proud record of supporting the COVAX Global Vaccine Alliance. So together we contribute huge sums to ensuring that countries around the world that are less fortunate than ours have access to- to vaccines. And we'll be working to- to make sure that that happens. What I also want to see is the- the US and the U.K. working together to learn the lessons from the pandemic and to build back better together. I'm thrilled that President Biden has also got a slogan, \"Build Back Better.\" I think- I think I claim that we used it first. And to be truthful, I think we- we nicked it from someone else before I started using it. But it's the right slogan, MARGARET. We've got to learn from this pandemic. We've got to learn about how to- to share information, how to- how to share drugs properly, how to make sure we don't hoard things like personal protective equipment, as you saw earlier on in the pandemic. We've got to make sure that we- we are distributing vaccines. In the- in the U.K, we now have one of the fastest vaccine rollouts anywhere in the world. As- as your viewers may perhaps know that we've- I think we've done almost 15 million vaccinations in our country. It was- I think more than one in four adults has now had a vaccination. That's- that's tremendously fast progress.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: But we want to make sure that we work with countries like- like the United States so that everybody gets a vaccination. There's no point in in great countries like the United States, the U.K., vaccinating our own populations if we don't ensure that everybody gets a vaccine.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're using the US for more money towards that?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: This is a pandemic. The US has already been extremely generous, as you said yourself, and the U.K. is the second biggest contributor to- to COVAX and to the global anti-virus,--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --the- the Vaccination Alliance that- the Gavi organization. And we'll continue to do that. And, you know, just as the pandemic doesn't respect borders, so the fight against the pandemic is going to be mounted by- by countries coming together. Scientists work together across borders to beat this thing. And today, the incredible thing is that science is really gaining the upper hand--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --and looking at the pandemic in your country, in my country,--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --I reckon science, in this arm wrestle, science is winning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: In this arm wrestle though,\u00a0 I want to ask you about what the World Health Organization report actually constituted--\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN:--because the Biden administration was clear, they have deep concerns about the investigation, about Chinese interference, and they are demanding that China hand over data about the early outbreak. Are you joining them in that call? Is China obscuring what happened?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: One of the things we'll be calling for in the- the G7, which President Biden is going to be joining, I'm glad to say, is the- is global coordination in getting to the bottom of what happens with these diseases. So when you have a zoonotic plague like coronavirus, we need to know exactly how it happened. Indeed, if it's- if it's zoonotic, if it really originated from human contact with the animal kingdom, that's what is asserted. But we need to know exactly what happened. Was it in a- in a wet market? Did it come from the bats? Were the bats associated with the- the pangolins? All these questions are now matters of speculation. We need to see the data. We need to see all the evidence. So I- I thoroughly support what President Biden has said about that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: British government scientists revealed on Friday that that particular strain, B.1.1.7, which was first detected in your country, is likely increased to a greater rate of hospitalization and death, perhaps as much as 40 to 60% more. You're under a lot of political pressure to open your schools. Are you certain you can do that next month?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: We're proceeding in a cautious way, and what you've got at the moment in the U.K. is the virus coming down. You're perfectly correct in what you say about the- the B.1.1.7 variant, though bear in mind that the reason we've been able to isolate this and other variants is that the U.K. conducts far more genomic analysis than any other country. Of all the genomic testing that's going on in the world, we do like 47% here in the UK. So we're pretty good at spotting these mutations of these viruses and- and tracking their movement through our populations. It's absolutely true that it- that this one spreads faster. But what you're now seeing is, thanks to the efforts of the British people, the- the lockdown, plus possibly the- the effects of the vaccine, we're going to start seeing the- the rates coming down more sharply. And they're--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But--\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --they're falling at the moment. We want to be in a position where- where we can begin to open up. So what I've said, MARGARET, is that on March the 8th, we want schools to go back if we possibly can. I'm not saying that we're announcing that today because we're going to be seeing a lot more on the 22nd of this month. We'll be making clear our roadmap.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: And I think what people want to see, and this may be the same in the US as well, is clarity about the way forward and taking steps to unlock that you don't then have to reverse because that I think--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly, and that's what I want to--\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --is what is so difficult for businesses and for people.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to press you on, though, Mr. Prime Minister, because when you announced you were shutting schools in January and you had really prioritized for a long time keeping open schools, when you said they've got to shut down in January, you said they were because they might be vectors of transmission for the community. If you've got this strain circulating and you believe schools are vectors of transmission, how can you reopen them?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: The answer to- to that is that you need to see what the effect of the vaccination program is in removing likely victims- victims in the- in the sense of people who suffer either death or serious disease, what the success of the vaccination program has in removing those people from the path of the- of the disease and also what's happening with the- the rate of infection. It's now coming down, MARGARET, very considerably in our country. What we don't know is quite how fast it's going to be coming down in the next couple of weeks. But we'll be saying a lot more about in the- in the days ahead.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the vaccines that you are using is from UK pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. And there are questions now about how effective it can be against some of the mutant strains, particularly the one first detected in South Africa. Are you concerned you're putting a flawed vaccine into the arms of your constituents, and what's your backup plan?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: We have great confidence in all the vaccinations that we're using and we have no reason to think that they are ineffective against any variation of the- any- any variant, any new variant of the- of the virus in protecting people, MARGARET, against a serious illness and death. And that's- that's a very important consideration for us. When you look at Pfizer or AstraZeneca, or Oxford AstraZeneca, we're confident that these have a major beneficial effect in protecting vulnerable people against- against illness and death and also very probably, and- and this is another important thing, in reducing the spread of the disease. One of the features of Oxford AstraZeneca, that has been recently confirmed by the scientists is that it- it reduces transmission between people as well. There's a 67% reduction in transmission as a result of the use of these vaccinations.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in April, you were hospitalized with COVID. You were quite ill. You were in the ICU. Did you ever think you wouldn't make it?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: I think in common with many people in my country, I'm very grateful to the fantastic work of the- of the NHS and they did an outstanding job and they continue to do an outstanding job. Thankfully, since last April, we now have treatment, some of them actually pioneered here in this country, dexamethasone and others, which make a huge difference to people's experience in hospital. And in addition, as I say, we have the vaccine. So the world has moved on a long way since- since March, April of last year. And it's a very exciting, a very moving thing to see the way science, medicine, human ingenuity is really coming to the rescue of- of humanity. And an absolutely incredible thing to- to see how governments combined with great companies. And, you know, you've got to you've got to hand--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, you're not answering the question, sir.\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --whole free market capitalist system. What's the question?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: If- did you think you might not make it?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: Did I think I was going to- what's the question? Well, no that didn't occur. I mean, I think one of the- one of the- one of the features of this- of this illness is that you don't as- as you undergo it, it's possible you don't realize quite what- what state you're in. I think that is one of the features of it, because your oxygen levels go down in a way that perhaps the patient doesn't necessarily detect themselves.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's why it's so serious. I want to ask you about US-UK relations. You have not yet met President Biden, though you're about to have this virtual meeting. You did have a phone call. Back in 2019, he referred to you, as I'm sure you know, as \"the physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump.\" Are you concerned you're going to start off on the wrong foot?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: I've had, I think, already two long and very good conversations with the president and we had a really good exchange, particularly about climate change and what he wants to do. I think it's today that America has just joined the- the Paris Accords, ended the- the reversal of America's membership of that. And that's great news. We want to- we want to build back better together, particularly in the run up to the COP summit in November in Glasgow this year, which we hoped will be a- a physical incarnation of the- of the leaders of the world to agree with what we hope will be a fantastic thing, which is everybody to get to a net zero carbon emissions by 2050, but also making pledges on the way what they're going to do to get there--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --by 2030. So that means moving to new techno- technology in a way that I think the Biden administration supports, getting much- many more of our vehicles powered by electricity,--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --putting a big bet on hydrogen, putting a big bet on wind power. And the U.K., you may or may not know, is blessed with phenomenal gusts of wind, particularly in the North Sea. And we intend to harness this to become the Saudi Arabia of wind and, as it were, and--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, President Biden--\u00a0\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON. --there's a massive opportunity, I think, for the US and the UK to- to share- to share technology and to work together and using technological solutions--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --to drive down CO2 emissions.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you may see the same- same direction on those issues. But on the issue of Ireland, you may have some difference here. President Biden doesn't want you to put that peace agreement in Northern Ireland at risk at all, has made clear that border needs to stay open and you need to adhere to that EU-UK agreement from December. Can you commit and reassure the US Congress and the US president that you will do so in all circumstances, stick to that agreement?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: You bet. This is fundamental for us, the- the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Peace Agreement, the Good Friday process, the Belfast Agreement, these- these agreements are absolutely crucial--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Northern Ireland Protocol?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --for our continued stability- our continued stability and- and- and success as a- as a UK- and I have a great relationship with- with- with- with Dublin, with Michael Martin, the Irish Taoiseach. And we're going to work together to do some great things and- and, MARGARET, be in no doubt we don't want to do anything to jeopardize the achievements of the- the Northern Irish peace process. It's absolutely vital.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Northern Ireland Protocol specifically? You will adhere to that open border?\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: We want to make sure that there's free movement, north south, free movement east- east west, and- and we guarantee the rights of the- of the people of Northern Ireland, of course.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm told we are at time. Thank you very much for your time today.\u00a0PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: No. MARGARET, thank you so much. Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us. Below is a transcript of the interview that aired Sunday, February 14, 2021: MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning, a special interview with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

What signal did his acquittal make?\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: I think the clear message that we get from the proceedings in America is that after all the to-ings and fro-ings and all the kerfuffle, American democracy is strong and the American Constitution is strong and- and robust. And we're delighted now, I'm very delighted, to have a good relationship with the White House, which is an important part of any UK prime minister's mission. And I've had some good conversations already with- with President Biden, fantastic conversations about the way he sees things. And, you know, MARGARET, there's been some important developments in the way the UK, US thinking has been coming together in the last few weeks, and particularly on issues like climate change, on NATO, on Iran, but above all, on the ways that the US and the UK are going to work together to deal with the environmental challenge that faces our- our planet. And there, I think some of the stuff we're now hearing from the new American administration and from the new White House is incredibly encouraging. And we want to work with the- with the president on that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand you will be hosting President Biden for his first foreign minister's- foreign meeting on the 19th, although it'll be virtual because of COVID. The Trump administration has already pledged about 4 billion dollars in December to the Global Vaccine Alliance in this fight against COVID. And I understand that's the focus of your upcoming meeting with President Biden. What are you asking him to do?\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: The United States and the U.K. both have an incredibly proud record of supporting the COVAX Global Vaccine Alliance. So together we contribute huge sums to ensuring that countries around the world that are less fortunate than ours have access to- to vaccines. And we'll be working to- to make sure that that happens. What I also want to see is the- the US and the U.K. working together to learn the lessons from the pandemic and to build back better together. I'm thrilled that President Biden has also got a slogan, \"Build Back Better.\" I think- I think I claim that we used it first. And to be truthful, I think we- we nicked it from someone else before I started using it. But it's the right slogan, MARGARET. We've got to learn from this pandemic. We've got to learn about how to- to share information, how to- how to share drugs properly, how to make sure we don't hoard things like personal protective equipment, as you saw earlier on in the pandemic. We've got to make sure that we- we are distributing vaccines. In the- in the U.K, we now have one of the fastest vaccine rollouts anywhere in the world. As- as your viewers may perhaps know that we've- I think we've done almost 15 million vaccinations in our country. It was- I think more than one in four adults has now had a vaccination. That's- that's tremendously fast progress. \u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: But we want to make sure that we work with countries like- like the United States so that everybody gets a vaccination. There's no point in in great countries like the United States, the U.K., vaccinating our own populations if we don't ensure that everybody gets a vaccine. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're asking the US for more money towards that? \u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: This is a pandemic. The US has already been extremely generous, as you said yourself, and the U.K. is the second biggest contributor to- to COVAX and to the global anti-virus,--\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --the- the Vaccination Alliance that- the Gavi organization. And we'll continue to do that. I want to ask you about what the World Health Organization report actually constituted-- \u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN:--because the Biden administration was clear, they have deep concerns about the investigation, about Chinese interference, and they are demanding that China hand over data about the early outbreak. Are you joining them in that call? Is China obscuring what happened?\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: One of the things we'll be calling for in the- the G7, which President Biden is going to be joining, I'm glad to say, is the- is global coordination in getting to the bottom of what happens with these diseases. So, when you have a zoonotic plague like coronavirus, we need to know exactly how it happened. Indeed, if it's- if it's zoonotic, if it really originated from human contact with the animal kingdom, that's what is asserted. But we need to know exactly what happened. Was it in a- in a wet market? Did it come from the bats? Were the bats associated with the- the pangolins? All these questions are now matters of speculation. We need to see the data. We need to see all the evidence. So I- I thoroughly support what President Biden has said about that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: British government scientists revealed on Friday that that particular strain, B.1.1.7, which was first detected in your country, is likely increased to a greater rate of hospitalization and death, perhaps as much as 40 to 60% more. You're under a lot of political pressure to open your schools. Are you certain you can do that next month?\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: We're proceeding in a cautious way, and what you've got at the moment in the U.K. is the virus coming down. You're perfectly correct in what you say about the- the B.1.1.7 variant, though bear in mind that the reason we've been able to isolate this and other variants is that the U.K. conducts far more genomic analysis than any other country. Of all the genomic testing that's going on in the world, we do like 47% here in the UK. So, we're pretty good at spotting these mutations of these viruses and- and tracking their movement through our populations. It's absolutely true that it- that this one spreads faster. But what you're now seeing is, thanks to the efforts of the British people, the- the lockdown, plus possibly the- the effects of the vaccine, we're going to start seeing the- the rates coming down more sharply. And they're-- \u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --they're falling at the moment. We want to be in a position where- where we can begin to open up. So what I've said, MARGARET, is that on March the 8th, we want schools to go back if we possibly can. I'm not saying that we're announcing that today because we're going to be seeing a lot more on the 22nd of this month. We'll be making clear our roadmap. \u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: And I think what people want to see, and this may be the same in the US as well, is clarity about the way forward and taking steps to unlock that you don't then have to reverse because that I think--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly, and that's what I want to--\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --is what is so difficult for businesses and for people.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to press you on, though, Mr. Prime Minister, because when you announced you were shutting schools in January and you had really prioritized for a long time keeping open schools, when you said they've got to shut down in January, you said they were because they might be vectors of transmission for the community. If you've got this strain circulating and you believe schools are vectors of transmission, how can you reopen them?\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: The answer to- to that is that you need to see what the effect of the vaccination program is in removing likely victims- victims in the- in the sense of people who suffer either death or serious disease, what the success of the vaccination program has in removing those people from the path of the- of the disease and also what's happening with the-the rate of infection. It's now coming down, MARGARET, very considerably in our country. What we don't know is quite how fast it's going to be coming down in the next couple of weeks\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the vaccines that you are using is from UK pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. And there are questions now about how effective it can be against some of the mutant strains, particularly the one first detected in South Africa. Are you concerned you're putting a flawed vaccine into the arms of your constituents, and what's your backup plan?\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: We have great confidence in all the vaccinations that we're using and we have no reason to think that they are ineffective against any variation of the- any- any variant, any new variant of the- of the virus in protecting people, MARGARET, against a serious illness and death. And that's- that's a very important consideration for us. One of the features of Oxford AstraZeneca, that has been recently confirmed by the scientists is that it- it reduces transmission between people as well. There's a 67% reduction in transmission as a result of the use of these vaccinations.\u00a0 Ok Mr. Prime Minister, we're going to take a short break, Face the Nation will be back in one minute, stay with us. \u00a0 We're back with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in April, you were hospitalized with COVID. You were quite ill. You were in the ICU. Did you ever think you wouldn't make it?\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: I think in common with many people in my country, I'm very grateful to the fantastic work of the- of the NHS and they did an outstanding job and they continue to do an outstanding job. \u00a0 I think one of the- one of the- one of the features of this- of this illness is that you don't as- as you undergo it, it's possible you don't realize quite what- what state you're in. I think that is one of the features of it, because your oxygen levels go down in a way that perhaps the patient doesn't necessarily detect themselves.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's why it's so serious. \u00a0 I want to ask you about US-UK relations. You have not yet met President Biden, though you're about to have this virtual meeting. You did have a phone call. Back in 2019, he referred to you, as I'm sure you know, as \"the physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump.\" Are you concerned you're going to start off on the wrong foot?\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: I've had, I think, already two long and very good conversations with the president and we had a really good exchange, particularly about climate change and what he wants to do. We want to build back better together, particularly in the run up to the COP summit in November in Glasgow this year, which we hoped will be a- a physical incarnation of the- of the leaders of the world to agree with what we hope will be a fantastic thing, which is everybody to get to a net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but also making pledges on the way what they're going to do to get there by 2030.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: On the issue of Ireland, you may have some difference here. President Biden doesn't want you to put that peace agreement in Northern Ireland at risk at all, has made clear that border needs to stay open and you need to adhere to that EU-UK agreement from December. Can you commit and reassure the US Congress and the US president that you will do so in all circumstances, stick to that agreement?\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: You bet. This is fundamental for us, the- the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Peace Agreement, the Good Friday process, the Belfast Agreement, these- these agreements are absolutely crucial-- \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Northern Ireland Protocol?\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: --for our continued stability- our continued stability and- and- and success as a- as a UK- and I have a great relationship with- with- with- with Dublin, with Michael Martin, the Irish Taoiseach. And we're going to work together to do some great things and- and, MARGARET, be in no doubt we don't want to do anything to jeopardize the achievements of the- the Northern Irish peace process. It's absolutely vital.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Northern Ireland Protocol specifically? You will adhere to that open border?\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: We want to make sure that there's free movement, north south, free movement east- east west, and- and we guarantee the rights of the- of the people of Northern Ireland, of course.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Mr. Prime Minister, I'm told we are at time. Thank you very much for your time today.\u00a0 PRIME MINISTER JOHNSON: No. MARGARET, thank you so much. Thank you.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Moscow\u00a0\u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov were set to face off late Wednesday in the first high-level meeting between Russian and American officials under the Biden administration. They will meet as relations between the two rival powers hover near Cold War-lows. \"It would be our preference to have a more stable and more predictable relationship with Russia,\" Blinken said the day before the meeting.  \"If these are stable and predictable sanctions, then it's probably not what we need, and we won't be judging the U.S. calls to normalize relations by their words,\" Lavrov responded a few hours later in Moscow, reiterating a common Russian complaint that the U.S. relies too heavily on economic punishment for its foreign policy. The two senior diplomats have a long list of hurdles to address, including Russia's treatment of jailed opposition figure Alexey Navalny, recent saber-rattling near the Ukrainian border and sanctions that Washington hit Russia with recently over alleged interference in U.S. elections and hacking attacks on American infrastructure.\u00a0 The meeting on the sidelines of the Arctic Council summit in Iceland on Wednesday was likely to make or break a highly anticipated summit between President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, which is expected to take place in June in Europe, if it does in fact go ahead. Bilateral relations were already fraught when they nose-dived in March, after Mr. Biden agreed with a description of Putin as \"a killer.\" Envoys in both countries were recalled to their home capitals for consultations. Washington then imposed new sanctions over \"malign\" activities, denied by the Kremlin, leading to another wave of diplomatic expulsions.  Russia added the U.S. to a new \"list of unfriendly\" nations, preventing the U.S. Embassy from employing local staff.  The White House first floated the idea of a presidential summit last month in an apparent move to restore some lines of communication. The Kremlin said it was considering the offer, but it hasn't publicly confirmed that the meeting will take place.  Despite the increasingly adversarial relations, however, Russia has signaled that it sees issues like nuclear arms control and strategic stability as areas of mutual interest on which the two nations might cooperate.  The Kremlin on Wednesday signaled that Putin would be willing to look past Mr. Biden's previous comments if the meeting does take place this summer. \"This incident is not the main thing,\" the Russian leader's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Wednesday. \"We are talking about strategic stability \u2014 it worries the whole world, it concerns the whole world, and our bilateral relations. These are the main topics on the agenda.\"  Russian officials also responded positively to U.S. media reports suggesting the Biden administration has decided against sanctioning the company in charge of the controversial Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, stretching from Russia to Germany to enable easier Russian gas sales to Europe. The U.S. had previously slammed the project as a threat to European energy security. Mr. Biden and Putin had an early success, prolonging the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty for five more years when the fate of the pact \u2014 the only remaining nuclear treaty between the two atomic bomb-wielding countries \u2014 hung in the balance early in Mr. Biden's tenure.  Now Russia says it wants to get the U.S. back into other agreements that were severed during the four years of the Trump administration, including the Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA) and the Open Skies Treaty. \"The return of the United States to the JCPOA is the main, key issue from our point of view, which requires a solution,\" Lavrov's deputy, Sergey Ryabkov, said Wednesday ahead of the meeting in Iceland. Russia's ambitious economic and military plans for its northern territories have also emerged as a growing point of contention with the U.S., as Russia takes over from Iceland as the rotating chair of the Arctic Council. Ahead of the Reykjavik summit, Blinken criticized Russia's military buildup in the Arctic region and its \"unlawful maritime claims\" after Moscow obliged foreign vessels transiting the so-called \"Northern Route,\" the shipping passage around the country's northern coastline, to obtain permission and let Russian maritime officers board the vessels as they go through. Lavrov rebuked the statement, saying Moscow considers the region \"its own land,\" and that Russia has the right to ensure the security of its northern coastline.\u00a0 CBS News' Svetlana Berdnikova contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In an era of political \"firsts,\" Wednesday evening offered one of the most symbolic when, for the first time, two women flanked an American president on the dais of the House Chamber as he delivered an address to a joint session of Congress. President Biden's remarks\u00a0focused on his first 100 days in office, the sweeping infrastructure proposals he's unveiled and the January 6 attacks at the U.S. Capitol. But it's the moment that formally launches the proceedings that may be most enduring. According to protocol, Vice President Kamala Harris called the proceedings to order and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi formally introduced Mr. Biden to Congress as president for the first time. It's a moment that lasts a few seconds and usually isn't seen by the global television audience. But it was the pinnacle of a remarkable rise for two political figures from California's Bay Area.\u00a0 \u00a0 Mr. Biden acknowledged the historic moment after he introduced \"Madam Speaker\" and \"Madam Vice President.\" \"No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it's about time,\" Mr. Biden said. Both are formed by the political experiences of their parents \u2014 one the daughter of a big city mayor, the other the daughter of civil rights activists. Both are tested by years of resistance from partisan structures that historically threw up roadblocks to slow the rise of a former housewife and a young ambitious attorney.\u00a0 \u00a0 \"It says a lot about country, and a lot about Joe Biden, and it says certainly a lot about both of the women who have made it to that place,\" said former California Senator Barbara Boxer, who once served alongside Pelosi in the House and whose Senate seat Harris filled when she retired. \"It's going to be very emotional for me.\" \u00a0 Aides to Harris consider Wednesday night another marker in an already historic period in the history of the vice presidency and women in politics, but stress that the substance of her work is more important. \u00a0\u00a0 Any time there's a big decision to make at the White House \"President Biden promised that the vice president would be last in the room,\" said Harris' communications director Ashley Etienne. \"What hasn't been covered is that she has been at every table and had a voice in every decision made. And she's been there for every decision of consequence.\" Pelosi, 81, and Harris, 56, represent different paths to power in America. \u00a0\u00a0 The speaker is the daughter of former U.S. representative and Baltimore mayor Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. and grew up in a politically active family, but after college, she married Paul Pelosi and moved to New York and then to San Francisco and spent much of her late 20s and early 30s raising five children. Only after they were nearly grown did she become a Democratic National Committee member and chair of the California Democratic Party, and she first ran for Congress in 1987 at the age of 47. \u00a0\u00a0 When Pelosi came to Washington, she was just one of 25 women in the House \u2014 and the women who made it there were an \"oddity\" to their male colleagues, Boxer recalled.\u00a0 \"Women were unusual. And there was a lot of prejudice surrounding us at every turn. What she has done is so extraordinary,\" Boxer said. \"Not only did she get elected\u2026but to win over your colleagues' trust, it's so hard to do, because everybody has their agendas, and everybody thinks they should be president.\" \u00a0\u00a0 Pelosi blasted through the ranks and broke several barriers, becoming the first woman to hold the title of minority whip, minority leader, and finally, speaker of the House in 2006. \u00a0 \"The sky's the limit for women now in the House, because she's at the sky,\" Boxer said. \u00a0\u00a0 The speaker has proven to be a skilled legislator with an iron grip on the Democratic caucus and a reputation as an expert vote-counter. That prowess helped her round up votes for the 2008 bank bailout that stabilized the economy, shepherd the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010 and then beat back challenges to her speakership when Democrats regained the majority in 2018. Boxer also credited her with passing several COVID relief packages. \u00a0 \u00a0 During the era of former President Trump, she proved to be one of the few politicians who could get under his skin during various negotiations \u2014 including around the government shutdown when she cancelled his planned State of the Union address until the government had reopened. Until Wednesday evening, the most enduring image of Pelosi on the dais for State of the Union was likely the one from last year, when she ripped up her copy of the former president's 2020 address to Congress. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Born and raised in Oakland, California, the vice president is the daughter of Donald Harris and Shyamala Gopalan, academics who met through the civil rights movement. Their activism became a driving factor for Harris' decision to work in the criminal justice system. \u00a0 \"Growing up the way I did knew how law enforcement had a long history of enforcing laws indiscriminately, and often based on race, and racism, that's why I chose to become a prosecutor,\" she said last June. \u00a0 As a Howard University student, she interned in the office of the late Senator Alan Cranston, whose seat she later won. After law school, she worked as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California, and later in San Francisco, winning a bitterly contested district attorney election in 2004. Those close to her then recall that her foray into politics wasn't welcomed by all.\u00a0 Tim Silard, who served as her policy chief in the DA's office, recalled that just 6% of San Francisco residents were Black when she took office, but more than half of those incarcerated by the city were Black and only 40% of African American homicides were ever solved. \"Kamala's very existence, the first woman and the first person of color to be DA, her background and life experience, her demand for change and excellence from the system, all of that was a threat to the old guard,\" Silard said. \"There was tremendous hostility from law enforcement to everything that she was doing and even from within the office \u2013 older white guys had been running that office and had been in positions of power and privilege for decades. They didn't want change and they certainly didn't want a young, dynamic, woman of color who insisted on new ways to be in charge.\" It's a resistance she's often faced. She was elected California attorney general in 2010, but only after securing critical support from Pelosi in a three-way primary that once again raised doubts about her qualifications. Her 2016 election to the U.S. Senate was one of the few bright spots for Democrats that year, and instantly sparked presidential speculation. \u00a0 During her opening weeks as vice president, critics and supporters alike have openly questioned the extent of her role. But recent public activity suggests a hefty portfolio is taking shape in addition to her constant interaction and appearances alongside the president.\u00a0 This week she held meetings with Guatemalan leaders to discuss the root causes of the record-setting influx of migrants to the U.S.-Mexico border. Her office is working on details of a highly-anticipated trip to Mexico and Guatemala in June that is expected to be her first international trip in the role. \u00a0 On Friday, she visited New Hampshire \u2014 her first stop in the Granite State since September 2019, and a visit that might usually invite speculation about her own political future. But it was one of dozens of public stops she's made to promote the Biden administration's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to tout legislative priorities and achievements. Several of them are rooted in work she once did as a senator. During a recent visit to her hometown of Oakland, California, she mentioned the proposed $110 billion to pay for water infrastructure projects nationwide, part of a goal to replace all lead pipes and water service lines across the country. The proposal mirrors elements of two bills she proposed in 2019 and last year shortly before joining Mr. Biden's ticket. \u00a0 In Greensboro, North Carolina, she noted how the American Jobs Plan includes funding for electric school buses, a plan she first introduced in June 2019, and a proposal to ensure that the health and environmental effects of new federal programs consider their potential impacts on low-income or minority communities -- a concept adopted from a bill she first introduced in August 2020. Her New Hampshire visit highlighted how proposed legislation would boost funding for broadband internet in rural areas, part of a legislative push she also made last year before joining the Biden ticket. Pelosi and Harris have seen their fortunes bolstered by California, the first state to elect two women to the Senate at the same time \u2014 Boxer and Senator Dianne Feinstein, who were both elected in 1992. Boxer recalled people telling her it was impossible that two Jewish women from the Bay Area could succeed at the same time. \u00a0 \"What it says about California, is that California has always been wide open to breaking new ground,\" she said. \u00a0 Both women know their place in history tonight \u2014 and speak often about how they know they won't be the last. \u00a0 When she was elected speaker for the first time in 2007, Pelosi told her colleagues: \"For our daughters and granddaughters, today we have broken the marble ceiling ... Now the sky is the limit. Anything is possible.\"\u00a0 Harris often refers to something her mother often told her: \"You may be the first to do many things; make sure you're not the last.\" Ed O'Keefe is a senior White House and political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, the U.S. hits two devastating benchmarks: Half a million dead and one year since the first reported coronavirus death in the U.S. But there is hope on the horizon. Last week began with a sobering tribute to a staggering statistic, five hundred thousand American lives lost due to COVID-19. That's roughly the population of the city of Atlanta.\u00a0PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We often hear people described as ordinary Americans. There's no such thing. There's nothing ordinary about them. The people we lost were extraordinary.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But as the week ended, there is reason for optimism. Last night, the FDA authorized a third vaccine, this one from Johnson & Johnson. It requires only one dose and is one hundred percent effective in preventing coronavirus hospitalization and death. As the race to vaccinate Americans picks up speed, even scientists concede that we could soon be nearing normal. We'll talk to Doctor Anthony Fauci and former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. And as the nation prepares to send kids back to school, Kentucky is the state where teachers are first in line for vaccines. We'll talk to its governor, Democrat Andy Beshear. Then, as former President Trump prepares to take center stage at a conservative gathering, is the Republican Party still the party of Trump?\u00a0WOMAN: Do you believe President Trump should still be speaking-- former President Trump should be speaking at CPAC this weekend?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: Yes, he should.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: I don't believe that he should be playing a role in the future of the party or the country.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: On that high note, thank you all very much.\u00a0SENATOR TED CRUZ: Let me tell you this right now, Donald J. Trump ain't going anywhere.\u00a0BRET BAIER (Fox News): If the President was the party's nominee, would you support him?\u00a0SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (Fox News): Oh, the nominee of the party? Absolutely.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, and Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger will all weigh in on the future of the GOP.\u00a0It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We've got a lot of news this morning. And we want to start with our senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Shipping all over COVID America this week, nearly four million doses of Johnson & Johnson's new single shot vaccine, approved Saturday by the FDA. This third option boosts hopes for mass vaccination. By the end of March, vaccine makers predict they'll produce two hundred forty million doses enough to fully vaccinate half of all U.S. adults. Success against COVID is a science but also an ongoing struggle.\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY (Director, Centers for Disease Control): We may be done with the virus, but clearly the virus is not done with us.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Multiple variants spread worry and worse. The so-called U.K. variant alone now accounts for ten percent of U.S. cases. The CDC sees it as the predominant threat within two weeks. And a caveat comes wrapped inside even seemingly good news, new cases and hospitalizations down sharply. Deaths have also dropped over the last four to six weeks.\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: The latest data suggests that these declines may be stalling, potentially leveling off at still a very high number.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: More than half of Americans say they want the shot, but no one's discovered a vaccine for the politics of COVID.\u00a0PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: And for God's sake, wear your masks.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Fifteen states have no mask mandates, all led by Republican governors.\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM (R-South Dakota): We have to show people how arbitrary these restrictions are, and the coercion, the force, and anti-liberty steps the governments take to enforce them.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: At the CPAC convention meeting this weekend in Orlando, listen to reaction when conservatives were asked to obey the rules of the hotel.\u00a0CARLY PATRICK: You should still be wearing a mask. So if everybody can go ahead, work on that. I know, I know, it's-- it's not the most fun.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: That's one reason immunologists stay worried as all three vaccine makers ramp up production.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Seventy million Americans have had at least one shot, twenty-three million have been fully vaccinated. But demand still dwarf supply. Even with three options, there's still not enough of anything. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, thanks.\u00a0We turn now to the President's chief medical adviser, Doctor Anthony Fauci. Good morning to you, doctor.\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI, MD (Chief Medical Adviser to President Biden/Director, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We had this good news on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine being greenlit overnight. But the COVID response coordinator has said he has been disappointed in the slow pace of manufacturing. How many doses will be available and when will they be available to the public?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: As soon as the EUA is essentially formalized, when-- when doses can come out, you're going to see a few million doses, I mean, literally a handful. But by the end of March, there'll be twenty million and then there will be a total of a hundred million as we get probably to June as we get halfway through the year.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Johnson & Johnson an inferior vaccine, particularly for older Americans?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: No. You know, it-- it's not. You can't say that. We now have, Margaret, clearly three highly efficacious vaccines. They are highly efficacious in many ways, including, importantly, preventing severe or critical disease. If you look at all three of them, they're really very good. The J&J data that just came out and that was just examined by the FDA, when you have advanced critical disease, there were no hospitalizations and no deaths. That's good news, Margaret. So I think rather than parsing out subgroups here, let's just look at the totality of this. We have a really good vaccine.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Supply is increasing, but Americans are still having a hard time getting access to it. There's still some confusion around communication. Listen to how Saturday Night Live captured that challenge.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0KATE MCKINNON (SNL/Broadway Video): The vaccine rollout is going strong, but it's also very confusing. Who can get it? How? When? Where is it? Do both doses go in the same arm, or different arms or what? I don't know.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That was you. Well, what-- what's the biggest hurdle? Since I have the real you, what is the biggest hurdle to getting this vaccine out there?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: Well, the hurdles that you're talking about, the logistics of getting into people's arms, Margaret, is really, truly going to get better and better as the days and weeks go by, particularly now where we're putting up over four hundred community vaccine centers. It's going to be-- get to the pharmacies with many more doses into the pharmacies, mobile units getting it to poorly accessible areas, a lot more vaccinators. That's the thing I think people are not fully appreciative of. You got to have people to get those vaccines into the arms of individuals. And we're employing National Guards and others, retired physicians and nurses, et cetera. We're getting the capability literally getting better every single day of making this much more smoothly than it's gone in the past. It's going to get better, I assure you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC director said this week that there is a very concerning shift in the trajectory of the virus. It seemed we'd been doing better. Is it because of these California and New York variants that you're now more worried?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, not sure. It-- it-- it certainly could be that because we do have some worrisome variants in California and in New York. If you look at the-- the decline of that slope, Margaret, it was really sharp and very encouraging if you look at the rate as it goes down. But over the last several days, it's kind of stopped at around seventy thousand and lingered there for a day or two. That is concerning because the thing we don't want is to have it plateau at seventy thousand per day. That's exactly the thing that happened during previous surges. As it peaked and started to come down, people withdrew some of the intensity of the public health measures and it kind of stabilized at a very high level. That's very dangerous, particularly given the fact that we have these variants around.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What is your guidance to those Americans who have been lucky enough to get both vaccinations, two doses of the vaccine? Can they still transmit the virus to others?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: Theoretically and-- and-- and-- probably in reality, yes. We don't know the exact incidence of that. But let me tell you the reason why we say that. And sometimes it confuses people. The endpoint of efficacy of the vaccine is preventing clinically apparent disease, which means that you could get infected, have nasopharynx virus in your nose and in your mouth. But because you are vaccinated, you could feel perfectly well and the issue is now, can you then transmit it to others? So until we prove that that's not the case, that's the reason why we're recommending that when people are vaccinated and are in the presence of unvaccinated people to put a mask on to prevent them from infecting others.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, Doctor Fauci, about something one of our upcoming guests said. Governor Kristi Noem of South Dakota delivered a speech to a conservative conference yesterday and she touted her decisions. She got a standing ovation when she said she ignored the medical advice of experts and specifically you.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0KRISTI NOEM: We never focused on the case numbers. Instead, we kept our eye on hospital capacity. Now, Doctor Fauci, he told me that on my worst day I'd have ten thousand patients in the hospital. On our worst day, we had a little over six hundred. Now--\u00a0(APPLAUSE)\u00a0KRISTI NOEM: I don't know if you agree with me, but Doctor Fauci is wrong a lot.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: How much of an impediment is sentiment like that to the nation's recovery?\u00a0ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, it's-- it's unfortunate, but it is-- it is not really helpful because sometimes you think things are going well and just take a look at the numbers. They don't lie. We see, Margaret, what happens when you pull back prematurely. Now, you're going to have individual instances of situations where people may not have and didn't see a rebound right away. But you've really got to be careful, particularly now that we have variants in this country that seem to spread more efficiently and maybe even are more dangerous with regard to pathogenicity. So I'm sure that, you know, you can get a standing ovation by saying I'm wrong. But the fact-- if you look at the scientific facts and follow what we need to do as these cases are coming down, the thing we don't want is for them to do this and start plateauing at a level that'll give us a lot of trouble. Go back and look historically at what happened when we tried to open up the economy and open up the country. And we saw a variable degree of adherence to the public health measures by different governors and different mayors. And what did happen? It went like this and then went right back up when we had yet again another surge. We just don't want to see that. We don't want to continue to prevent people from doing what they want to do. But let's get down to a good level. Let's get many, many more people vaccinated. And then you could pull back on those types of public health measures. But right now, as we're going down and plateauing is not the time to declare victory because we're not victorious yet. We will be, Margaret, I can assure you, but we're not there yet, particularly with the variants that are circulating in various parts of the country, such as in California and in New York.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Doctor Fauci, thank you for your time this morning.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back with the governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem. She's attending the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida. Good morning to you, Governor.\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM (R-South Dakota/@govkristinoem): Good morning, Margaret. Thank you for having me.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We just heard from Doctor Fauci, who said it is too early to peel back health restrictions and do things like not have mask mandates. And I know you don't have one in your state. How do you want to respond to him?\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: Well, I'd like to respond to something that you said. You indicated that I ignored medical advice, I didn't listen to my health experts and I most certainly did. In South Dakota, we took this virus very seriously. What I did, though, was tell my people the truth. I gave them personal responsibility over decisions for their families' public health, but also gave them the flexibility they needed to keep their businesses open, take care of their employees and their customers. So, you know, I really do believe that as this virus has spread throughout the country, that people needed that flexibility and South Dakota's doing well. We've had some tragic situations, but I know that-- that respecting them in my role, in the authority that I have as governor, has been incredibly helpful to get our state get through this challenging time.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we played that clip from your speech. And in that speech, you also said you never instituted a mask order, shut any churches or businesses or even defined what an essential business is. As of today, the CDC says your state has the eighth highest death rate per capita in the U.S. That's a rate of deaths per a hundred thousand residents. Don't you think your decisions as an executive contributed?\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: You know, South Dakota's infection rate peaked earlier than a lot of other places in the country, so we're definitely on the downward trend and earlier-- and peaked earlier than what you're seeing happen across the country as well. You know, you can talk about masks. We can talk about mitigation measures, all of that. What I'm against is--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: These were CDC numbers as of today. And it was the death rate.\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: --mandates. What I'm against is mandates that would tell people that-- what they have to do. I want people to make those decisions for themselves. And we've seen the CDC change recommendations over and over and over again. In fact, we've seen them do it just based on political pressure. We follow the science, the data and the facts in South Dakota to make our decisions. And it's been incredibly helpful to make sure that we're taking care of people who need it when they get sick.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I was asking you about the death rate as of today, according to the CDC, not the infection rate, which you're talking about. But one of your fellow Republicans, West Virginia's Governor Jim Justice, held up your state as an example of what not to do when it comes to his decision to institute a mask mandate. He said, I don't want to be South Dakota. Why do you think your state got hit so hard?\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: Our state peaked earlier than other states, than his state, than New York, than California. They certainly are seeing much higher infection rates, much higher hospitalization rates and much higher deaths today than-- than we are. And that's really how we've seen this virus spread across the country. What I'd like to know, Margaret, is why are-- are you asking Cuomo these questions? Are you talking to Newsom about these questions, and how their mitigation measures--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When both of those governors accept an invitation to come on this program--\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: --of shutting down businesses-- how did--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --and I hope they do, Madam. I really hope they say yes. And I really appreciate that you did to our invitation.\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: Absolutely.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So that's why I'm asking about your state. They have not said yes. So for your state, you have, if you look at starting in July, which was after that spring peak, you have the highest death rate in cumulative COVID deaths per million in the country. The CDC says you have the eighth highest death rate per capita now. I'm not talking about infection rates. I know you're a conservative and you care about the sanctity of life. So how can you justify making decisions that put the health of your constituents at risk?\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: And those are questions that you should be asking every other governor in this country as well. The region that--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking you today, Madam. You're our--\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: --South Dakota's in--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --you're facing the nation.\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: I'm answering you, Margaret. I'm answering you. Regionally, we have seen the virus hit the country very differently and it hit the Midwest earlier than it did the South and now the East Coast and the West Coast. So we are still dealing with this virus in this country. South Dakota went through our highest rate of infections and im-- implications earlier. The rest of the country is dealing with a-- much higher numbers today. And that's really what this means. What we should be looking at is did the mitigation measures help. Did mandating different actions in each of these states make a difference? Because what we're seeing is that the mandates aren't necessarily what's working. It's that people have the ability, the flexibility to not just look at this virus and then how it hits their health, but also how does it impact their well-being--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: --their-- their economic well-being, their ability to keep their kids in school, their ability to keep their businesses open--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's talk about that.\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: --pay their bills. That's been incredibly challenging.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk about that, because there is a twelve-billion-dollar price tag that has been pegged to the impact of and fallout from that Sturgis Motorcycle Rally that you hosted in your state in August. It is blamed for seeding the entire Midwest outbreak that hit on that late summer through the fall. Do you take personal responsibility for that?\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: Well, that is completely false information. That is not true--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a San Diego State University study.\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: --and we need to tell the-- and it is not based on facts. We tracked the people that came to the rally, had states report back to us cases that came from that rally. It was less than one hundred cases that we could track to that. And we did testing in that community and throughout the area for weeks after. Listen, what we did was allow people to make decisions for themselves. We gave them all the information on this virus, how to protect their health, and then we allowed them to make decisions on what they would do. My question is, if we had mandated that people had to stay home, if we had mandated that businesses had to be closed, would that have made a difference? And I would argue that it wouldn't have, that we allowed people to make these decisions that would best--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump's COVID czar, Doctor Birx, said if those people who had attended Sturgis-- if they'd gone home wearing masks, that it would have actually saved lives. She said that on this program. But how do you justify the death of-- of your constituents, though? And when you talk about personal responsibility, which I know is a value you talk a lot about, when your personal choices put others at risk, isn't that the opposite of responsible?\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: It's been an incredibly challenging year for so many people and-- and everyone across this country has-- knows someone who we have lost to this virus. I think we need to examine the actions that we've taken and see if it has allowed people to make decisions and honored our rights and our freedoms in this country in a way that respects what makes America special. Making decisions in one state, Doctor Fauci just said, might be very different than what another state should be doing. That's how I looked at my state. I have one community that may need to make a different decision on what they'd like to do than another community that may be of a different size, be in a different area or at a different infection rate or hospitalization rate. So that's why I gave them that flexibility. We took this virus very seriously, but I also let them look locally at what was the best actions to take to protect their health, but also keep their businesses open and protect the economy that they were dealing with.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Ronna McDaniel's coming up on this program shortly. She's the chairwoman of your party. She said the former President did not meet the moment with his words on January 6th, the siege of the Capitol. Do you agree with her?\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: You know, I think that we were all just heartbroken at what happened on January 6th, and it was a tragic situation. Going forward, I'm hoping that we can focus on facts, ways to unify this country and bring us together and really make sure that we're pursuing--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Was it avoidable if the President had met the moment?\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: --opening up new opportunities for our kids and grandkids. You know, I think there's always times that-- that we don't like different words that have been chosen. But I worked with this President when he was in office to do some big things for the American people, and he did some things that I certainly appreciated that were beneficial for my state.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you see him as your party's nominee for president in 2024? Will you support him?\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: You know, I think that as we go into the coming years that we certainly will see who decides to jump into that race. But I'm focused on South Dakota, what's best for our state, and letting our people make the best decisions for their future.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for coming on the program today and taking questions.\u00a0GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Appreciate it.\u00a0We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with the Head of the Republican Party, RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel. She's in Northville, Michigan. Good morning to you.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL (Chairwoman, Republican National Committee/@GOPChairwoman): Good morning, Margaret. Great to be with you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. We know there's a lot of eyes on what's going to happen when President Trump takes that main stage later today. Republicans are in the minority in the House. They're in the minority in the Senate. You lost the White House. Why are you doubling down on Donald Trump as the future of the party?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, it's up to the voters, and the voters are saying overwhelmingly they agree with what President Trump did in office. As you see Joe Biden strip away energy independence and cancel the Keystone pipeline, as you see Joe Biden say, I'm going to prioritize opening our borders over opening our schools, opening our economies, when you see the vaccine rollout that started under Operation Warp Speed in less than a year. These are the types of things that voters are saying they saw happen in the Trump administration and now they're seeing the Biden administration strip those things away.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you think the unity is in the opposition rather than within the party. I mean, if I look at what's happening inside your party, state parties in Arizona and Wyoming and Illinois, they're censuring other Republicans for insufficient loyalty to President Trump. I mean, it looks like your party is getting cut into thinner and thinner strips here.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: You know, we can have division within our party, and you can have state parties say, I disagree with that vote and I disagree with what you did there. But overwhelmingly our party agrees with each other on more than we disagree with each other on. And we want to see our schools open. You know, you hear Democrats use this mantra over and over again, follow the science. Well, mental health rates are skyrocketing-- skyrocketing with young kids that are concerned. You're seeing suicide rates up. Schools need to be open. And Republican governors that are leading across the country are following the science, keeping the kids safe and healthy, but getting them back into school. These are the things that our party stands for, opening up our economy, opening up our schools.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We have a-- a Democratic governor ahead who's going to talk about how he's opening schools this week. And we'll dig into that more in depth later on in the program. But we do need to take a short break here and continue our conversation with Ronna McDaniel in just a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel and a lot more, coming up on FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to pick up where we left off with RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.\u00a0Chairwoman, you met with the former President this week in Florida. Do you think he's going to run again in 2024?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: You know, I don't know. That's going to be a decision he's going to have to make down the road. I do know he's committed to helping us win back majorities in 2022, which is, of course, what I'm focused on right now. We are a handful of seats away from taking back the House, we picked up fifteen this last election, and one seat away from taking back the Senate. And as I said, as we're seeing the Trump administration and their legacy being stripped away by Joe Biden, who said he was going to run in a-- in a bipartisan way, work with Republicans, he hasn't done that on anything, including this recent boondoggle of a stimulus bill of two mill-- two trillion dollars of grab bags for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. You're seeing more and more Republicans recognize we need to unite around how do we win back these majorities and stop Biden in his tracks.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: How damaging were the events of January 6th to your party?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: They were damaging to our country. I think it was horrific what happened January 6th. There is no American, Republican or Democrat, who looks at that and sees our Capitol attacked and feels good. And I think there's a lot of self-reflection that has to go on across the whole country. We are--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Has the President done some self-reflection?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: I'm going to talk about me because I'm not going to speak for somebody else. But I will say as a party we have been--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you said he didn't make the moment previously.\u00a0MCDANIEL: Well, what I will say from an RNC perspective is we've been more vocal in denouncing groups like QAnon. We know that anarchists came to Washington that day. There was a bomb placed outside of my building, outside of the Republican National Committee. We have a deeply divided nation. I will do that. I will denounce extreme elements that pretend to be Republican and say we do not want you in our party. I would like Democrats to do the same with antifa and groups that are anti-Semitic that masquerade as Democrats and say you are not welcome in our party--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: --as they burned down cities this past summer. I would ask the media to be more fair and how you report things. Don't report-- suppress reports on Hunter Biden and on Democrats like what's happening with Andrew Cuomo and the immense failures that he had as governor, and then highlight things like you just did with Governor Noem. Andrew Cuomo, what he has done, his policies killed people--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When he agrees to come on this program, trust me, I-- he won't like some of my questions--\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: He deserves that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --like many of our guests don't like my questions. I want to ask you--\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: I hope so, but the media as a whole has ignored Andrew Cuomo.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --I want to ask you about, Congresswoman, to your point you were just raising, though, about being more vocal in speaking out. Congresswoman Liz Cheney said this week that the Trump-- the Trump supporters who violently sieged the Capitol on January 6th, she raised this particular issue.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY (Zoom Video/Reagan Institute): It's very important, especially for us as Republicans, to make clear that we-- we aren't the party of-- of white supremacy.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you make that clear now?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: A hundred percent. We passed a resolution unanimously from the RNC members three years ago saying we condemn white supremacy, anti-Semitism, KKK, and I'm going to add QAnon to that. They are not welcome in our party. I have not seen Democrats do that with Louis Farrakhan, who calls the Jewish people termites. I have not seen them do that with antifa, who last night committed violence again in Portland.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The people who sieged the Capitol were carrying Trump flags. That is why Liz Cheney was talking about it. It is why she voted to impeach the President.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: But it's--- but you know what, the Democrats have created a safe haven for antifa. They have not denounced them. Nancy Pelosi said as cities were being ripped apart, people will do what they do. You can't hold Republicans to one standard-- standard and not Democrats, and that creates unrest as well.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when it comes to Republicans, I know you have focused on recruiting women back to the party. Is Marjorie Taylor Green, who was a QAnon supporter, who was described by Mitch McConnell cancer on the Republican Party, is she representative of the kind of Republican woman you want?\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: Well, you know, I was-- I've been very vocal about her comments. She apologized for them. I'm glad to see that she did and her district will decide that. But we have increased women. We're now thirty-eight women in Congress in the Republican Party. That's the highest we've ever had. And here's the other thing. Women are suffering--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: --under the Biden administration. 2.4 million women have lost their jobs because of daycare issues.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: A hundred and forty thousand last month. Women are going through a she-cession. Women are struggling because our kids are not back at school. I'm not saying this as a Republican. I'm saying this is a mother with two kids in public school watching this rip apart my community as kids are suffering. So get it done. Get our kids back in school. And that's what the Republican stands-- Republican Party stands for. It's Florida versus New York.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right.\u00a0RONNA MCDANIEL: Our kids can go back to school safely. Our businesses can be open. And that's how we'll get women back in our party when they see us fighting for their kids and for them and not standing up for unions.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Ronna McDaniel, thank you for your time today.\u00a0Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger broke with his party and voted to impeach President Trump back in January, and he joins us this morning from Capitol Hill. Good morning to you, Congressman.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER (R-Illinois/@RepKinzinger): Yeah, good morning. Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So we just-- we're-- we're spending a lot of time talking about your party today, which I know you're spending a lot of time thinking about the future. When the former President takes the stage at-- at CPAC, he is expected to say, according to excerpts of the speech that's been released, that the Republican Party is united. Is the Republican Party united?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: No, I think there's-- I mean, we may be united in some areas. You know, we don't have to agree with everything the Biden administration is doing. So there will be opposition. So unity in some of that. But I think in terms of what is our vision for the future, certainly not united. I think we are a party that's been for too long pedaling in fear, using fear as a compelling way to get votes. And fear does motivate. But after a while, fear can destroy a country, can destroy narratives, and it can destroy a democracy. And we have to quit peddling that. And I think what you're going to hear from the President at CPAC today is self-congratulations. Not-- no ability to recognize the fact that we have lost the House, the Senate and the presidency because of Donald Trump. And you're going to see a lot of fear.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard the chairwoman of your party, though, say that she met with the former President to-- with the intention of having him help win back the House and the Senate. So she's believing that he's a force to bring people to the Republican Party.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Well, I think he is. I mean, I think certainly he's got, you know, a number of people that follow him and are motivated by him and compelled by him because there's been no competing alternative vision. You know, to win a narrative in a party, you have to present a con-- competing alternative narrative. When you only hear from Donald Trump and when people walk around in fear of his tweets or his comments or they use his fear to peddle-- win reelection, of course, he's going to motivate people. But that's where, when I launched Country1st.com with a \"1st,\" that's all about fighting for the narrative in the Republican Party for an optimistic, brighter future again, one we can be proud of--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: --and one, where when we talk about things, we actually teach young people how to do politics in a way that we used to remember and appreciate.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking there about the political action committee that you have founded. So that's part of what I was talking about earlier with-- with some infighting. I mean, how are you going to pick candidates? Is there anyone you see, for instance, in the Senate right now? We know-- we know leader-- Minority Leader McConnell said there are at least four senators he has that are going to run for President. Any of them have the kind of vision you're calling for?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Not that I've seen. I don't know who these senators are that are going to run. There are a few that I really do appreciate in the Senate. You think of like Ben Sasse, of course, Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, those that voted to remove the President, particularly because I think they did it at great personal cost. That shows leadership. There are people in the House, of course, Liz Cheney, you know, with her strength and ability to stand up in front of a tough crowd and tell the truth. That's what America needs more of. They need more of truth-telling. They need more of-- out of fear and-- and presenting light into darkness. And we have to start with our own party. We can point fingers at the Democrats, sure. But it's not going to do any good. Every party, but now, especially the Republican Party, has to look inside after January 6th and say, what have we become? What's our great history and how do we go forward from here? And I'll tell you, reaching out to Donald Trump and more of the same is not going to do that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You spend some time thinking about foreign policy, so I want to ask you as well, are you disappointed that just like President Trump, President Biden did not take direct action against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for his role in approving the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: So I don't want to say I'm disappointed he didn't take direct action. I think, you know, he needs to be held accountable. I think publicly talking about this is very important because the-- the Saudi Crown Prince responds to public shaming. And I think there has to be some behind-the-scenes accountability. But keep in mind, once we start basically pushing and picking sides and all this, it's a very complicated area. We have to show deep moral clarity, but be very careful in how we go forward because especially in the Middle East, things are really complicated.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: They are. But, you know, this is a person who was a U.S. resident. Should you expect more from a U.S. President in forcing consequences for murder and dis-- dismemberment?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Yeah. And, look, I don't think that this chapter's done. I think, you know, public accountability is important. And I think there will be some things that we might find out later. It's not going to be like military action or anything, but other areas, whether it's economics or targeted sanctions, stuff like that, that will come out either publicly or behind the scenes in the future. I don't think this chapter is written yet.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Like the halt on-- that's being considered on offensive weapon sales. You would support that?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: Yeah, I think I'd have to look at all the details of it, but I think certainly there has to be accountability for this.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congressman Kinzinger, thank you for your time today.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE ADAM KINZINGER: You bet.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look now at one state's efforts to get teachers vaccinated and get children back to in-person learning. Kentucky Democratic Governor Andy Beshear joins us this morning from Frankfurt. Good morning to you.\u00a0GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR (D-Kentucky/@AndyBeshearKY): Good morning. Thanks for having me.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you set March 1st as the recommended deadline for schools to reopen. And those teachers who haven't gotten their second dose might be able to wait a little longer. But you have pushed them to the front of the line ahead of other essential workers so that they could get those shots. How politically difficult was it to do that?\u00a0GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, in Kentucky, we determined that we needed to prioritize both our present-- those that were suffering the most and most likely to die from COVID as well as our future, getting our children back in school. Now, I'm not just a governor. I'm also a dad of a middle schooler and an elementary school student. And so I've-- I've seen the impact that this had. So we pushed our teachers to the front of the line, moving them up faster than the CDC or other states had. And we're about to be the first state to fully vaccinate all of our educators. We have all but about seven school districts already back in some form of in-person. Those districts are going to expand. And now we have a commitment from all our remaining districts to get that done too. It's important we do it in a safe way that also builds confidence within our educators themselves.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you how politically difficult it was because I often hear from governors that they can't prioritize teachers over other essential workers. The allegation often is having to do with fear of unions. Did the fact that you are a right to work state, one where union membership is not compulsory-- compulsory, did that make a difference?\u00a0GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: No, I don't think so. We have strong associations for our teachers, but the way we look at this is everything's difficult in COVID, even the concept of what's an essential worker, is one person more essential than another. For us, this was a workforce issue. It was development for our children scholastically, emotionally and-- and socially. And it was about getting back to some form of normal while we are still very careful. We made this call early on.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: We stuck to it. And no matter what you decide during COVID, some are-- are going to oppose it. But it's about trying to do the right thing, the best thing for your people, and then to let the consequences be what they'll be.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Kentucky ranks twenty-ninth among states on vaccine rollout, according to the CDC. That's for your general population. Why are you lagging? And will the Johnson & Johnson supply make a difference?\u00a0GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, we don't think that we're lagging. There are different--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: This is the CDC.\u00a0GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: --ways that people look-- I understand. There are different ways that-- that you judge the numbers. That's first and second dose together. We believe that we have to be as fast as possible with the first dose to get people some level of immunity. And as of last week, we had to used 98.5 percent of all the first doses provided. But we think differently on the second dose. That is meant for a very specific person. And so we made the decision that if it takes a little longer to get it to them, then we were going to make sure it gets to them. But what I can say is that all around the country we see capacity and efficiency picking up every day. Johnson & Johnson is going to be a game changer. The fact that we can fully vaccinate everyone in just one shot--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: --that it basically eliminates death and serious illness, and that we're going to get tens of thousands of additional vaccines per week per state, it's just going to get us to the finish line that much faster. We're really excited about it here in Kentucky. The more vaccine you can send us, the better.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You are a Democrat. And since we've heard from a number of Republicans about the infighting within their party, I need to ask you about the infighting within yours. West Virginia's Senator Joe Manchin, who is a Democratic-- a Democrat in a red state, told us after the election that, quote, \"The radical part of the Democratic Party scared the bejesus out of rural voters in 2020.\" Do you believe that the progressive wing of your party is out of touch?\u00a0ANDY BESHEAR: Oh, I believe our party, like-- like others, have lots of different people with lots of different views, but-- but the ability to discuss those in a way where we don't make enemies out of one another is what's so important inside our party or for our country at large. And people are passionate-- are passionate about the views they have. But we also have to be respectful of one another--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0ANDY BESHEAR: --to make sure that what brings us together isn't who we dislike, but it's what we stand for. And so when those debates are occurring, if they're actually on issues, then we're moving in the right direction even if there is disagreement on those issues. I'm highly concerned that what is bringing too many people together in our country is who they dislike and not what they actually stand for.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, from your state criticized this COVID relief bill that President Biden is putting together and which just passed the House. He's called it deliberately partisan, actively harmful to America's recovery. How much do you need this money, and is it a mistake for President Biden to muscle this through with only Democratic support?\u00a0ANDY BESHEAR: I can tell you that every county judge executive and every mayor across Kentucky, whether Democrat, Republican or Independent, they'll tell you they desperately need this assistance, that COVID has hit especially our localities in-- in deeply impactful ways, and that this gives us the ability to make up for some of that harm. On the state level, this gives us an opportunity to stimulate our economy while not having to borrow and go into debt. It's what every economist, at least on the state level, would tell you is exactly where we should be. Let's use the dollars to create jobs, to provide relief and to shorten this recession. And right now, we've got a decision to make.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0ANDY BESHEAR: Are we going to be FDR or are we going to be Herbert Hoover? Do we want to make the decisions to get us out of this recession more quickly, which benefits every family, Democrat or Republican?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0ANDY BESHEAR: But you've got to be bold to do that. And you can't worry about credit whether it happens--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\u00a0ANDY BESHEAR: --under a Democratic president or a Republican president.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right.\u00a0ANDY BESHEAR: In the midst of a pandemic, can't we put that aside for just a little bit--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well--\u00a0ANDY BESHEAR: --and help all our families out there? I hope so.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- yeah. Well, the last few were bipartisan. That's kind of the argument this time around. But, governor, we have to leave it there. Thank you for joining us. For more of the challenges teaching during this pandemic, listen to our latest edition of Facing Forward. I spoke with Khan Academy founder Sal-- Sal Khan. You can listen and subscribe on Apple podcast or your favorite podcast platform.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who's on the board of Pfizer, as well as Illumina, and he joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning. Doctor Gottlieb, you heard--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --Doctor Fauci say a few million doses of this new J&J vaccine should be available. Would you take it?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I would. I think this is a good vaccine. They'll ship about four million doses this week. The vaccine was very effective at preventing severe disease, eighty-five percent effective at preventing severe and critical disease. Also, interestingly, if you look at the clinical data, it was seventy-four percent effective at prevent-- preventing asymptomatic infection, which is a suggestion that is preventing transmission as well, which is really what all the vaccines are starting to demonstrate in the data that's being accrued. There is more and more evidence that these vaccines are preventing transmission of infection, which makes them an even more important public health tool. But the data was quite strong with the J&J vaccine. I think people should be confident about taking it. It will be in the market this week.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Fauci said there are worrisome variants in New York and California and said that may be partly why they're seeing some stalling happening with this trajectory that had otherwise been headed downward. What do you think? Are we being set back?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think the stalling could be explained by just increased mobility. If you look at Google mobility data, people are moving around more. I don't think that the New York variant, which is called 1.526, is really having much of an impact yet. It represents about nine percent of the infections in New York City. So it's still small. It's going to increase. This strain actually started to become prevalent as early as this summer. It was first introduced into the summer. So it really probably didn't explain the surge that we've seen. There's two different lineages of this variant. So two different forms of the variant. One of them has the same mutation that's in the South African variant. That's the one we're more concerned about. That represents about five percent of infections in New York. So we're more worried about the New York strain because it may pierce prior immunity and vaccines may be less effective against that and still very speculative. With respect to the Los Angeles variant, people are a little less concerned about that. It may be more transmissible, but it doesn't seem to have that 484K mutation, that mutation that we found in the South African variant that seems to make vaccines a little less effective and seems to allow people who've been infected before to get reinfected. So we're more concerned about the New York variant. But again, I don't think these variants are explaining what we're seeing right now, with the exception maybe of South Florida and Southern California, where 1.1.7 is becoming prevalent. And that may be causing a backup in Florida and Southern California right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When should we expect booster shots?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think we're going to get boosters in the fall and, you know, there's studies right now underway by Moderna and Pfizer, the company I'm on the board of, looking at a third booster of the existing vaccines. And they'll also be looking at new variant vaccines that they're going to put into development and see which are more effective. I think the reality is that we have time to get a better toolbox for the fall to take care of these--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --variants that we're seeing emerge and develop vaccines that can cover them. But, you know, you will probably get-- be getting boosters in the fall for people who are getting vaccinated right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Governor Noem who spoke on this program saying she never focused-- she told CPAC she never focused on case numbers, she focused on hospital capacity. And she rejected the premise that the motorcycle rally that she held in her state in August was responsible for seeding the Midwest outbreak. What do you make of-- of her defense?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think it is important to look at the vulnerable population and hospital capacity and how many people are being hospitalized and dying from the infection as an important metric. But you also have to look at prevalence. Certainly back when we were having the first and the second and even the third wave of infection, prevalence was an important predictor of overall morbidity from the infection before we had a vaccine. If you look at post-July 1st, and the reason why I picked July 1st is because July-- before July 1st, we really didn't know how to treat COVID. We were treating it literally with Pepcid and hydroxychloroquine. But after July 1st, we had the data from the U.K. study, the recovery trial that told us that dexamethasone, the steroid, was very effective at cutting mortality. We started to use blood thinners on patients. We were intubating less aggressively. So practice of medicine dramatically improved after or around that time period. If you look at post July 1st in terms of deaths per capita by state, South Dakota is the last, Arizona is second to last, Mississippi, Alabama and North Dakota. Those are the states that come in last in the nation in terms of deaths per capita. So, you know, I think that the states that didn't implement as stringent measures, they did pay a price for it. And I don't think that you can-- you can explain that away. I think it's just a fact. And, you know, they-- they will argue that they maybe didn't take the same economic hit--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --as states that imposed restrictions, but they did pay a price for it in terms of--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --higher death rates.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Gottlieb, thank you for your perspective, as always.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0\u00a0",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, the second impeachment of former President Donald Trump is now headed for the history books. And President Biden steps up efforts on securing vaccines and getting America's schools reopened. Last week America relived and learned some terrifying new details about the January 6th attack on the Capitol. But in the end, the result of the attempt to convict former President Trump was predictable and political. There were some plot twists, like Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's condemnation of Mister Trump immediately after he voted to acquit him.\u00a0SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: \u2026disgraceful, disgraceful dereliction of duty.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Leader McConnell's defense for his vote, the Senate was not the right court for conviction.\u00a0SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former Presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Asked about censuring to punish the former President, instead Speaker Pelosi called it a cowardly way out for Republican senators.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: We censure people for using stationery for the wrong purpose. We don't censure people for inciting insurrection that kills people in the Capitol.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Democrats warn that without accountability violence like that seen on January 6th could happen again.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: I fear, like many of you do, that the violence we saw on that terrible day may be just the beginning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with one of the prosecutors, Colorado Congressman Joe Neguse. Plus, an exclusive conversation with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He, too, weighed in on the Senate verdict.\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: After all the toings and froings and all the kerfuffle, American democracy is strong.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll also talk to the head of the Centers for Disease Control, Doctor Rochelle Walensky, about President Biden's back to school plan, and those new virus variants. The CEO of Rite Aid drugstores Heyward Donigan will be with us to tell us how her company plans to help with getting Americans vaccinated. Plus, we'll check in with Doctor Scott Gottlieb.\u00a0It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. The headlines this morning are similar to what they were almost exactly a day, a week, and a year ago. After being acquitted in the foreign interference impeachment case now former President Donald Trump has been acquitted again, this time for incitement of insurrection following the events of January 6th. But this time, seven Republican senators broke with their party but was still ten votes short of conviction.\u00a0We want to begin this morning with one of the impeachment managers, Colorado Democratic Congressman Joe Neguse. He's in Washington. Good morning, Congressman.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE (D-Colorado/@RepJoeNeguse/House Impeachment Manager): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You closed your argument yesterday by saying extremist groups may be emboldened and the violence on the 6th may just be the beginning. Are you saying Republicans are complicit in that? And if so, how do you work across the aisle with them now?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: Well, look I-- what I was saying, Margaret, and it's very heartfelt on my behalf and on behalf of all the managers, is a real fear that I think many Americans have after witnessing the terrible violence that happened on January 6th and the insurrection that took place on our nation's account-- our nation's Capitol that without accountability, that many of these groups could very well become more emboldened and-- and perhaps engage in-- in more violence. I had hoped that more senators would ultimately honor their oath by convicting the President. But make no mistake, I mean the big difference between this year and the-- the-- the headline that you referenced last year is just how historic this vote was. It was the most bipartisan impeachment vote in the history of our republic. Fifty-seven senators, including seven Republicans that you mentioned, chose country over party, looked at our facts objectively that we presented to them, considered the evidence and reached the same conclusion we did, which was that the President incited insurrection and we shouldn't lose sight of that. I want to salute and commend those seven Republicans, people like Ben Sasse--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: --and Mitt Romney, really a profile in courage, in my view, in terms of the vote that they took.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Why did you back off the request for witnesses?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: That's a fair question. I don't know that I would characterize it that way. Look, I know a lot of folks who are wondering--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you asked for them. Se-- the senators said yes, and then the House managers said they didn't require them. That's backing off.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: Sure. Well, no. So here's what I would say, and I'm happy to answer the question. So Lead Manager Raskin touched on this yesterday. He proceeded with a request for one witness, not multiple witnesses. The request was for that video testimony-- a deposition testimony, which is how that's been done in prior impeachments, for example, during the Clinton impeachment in 1999, of Congresswoman Herrera Beutler, given what we had learned about her statements just the night before and the full extent of her remarks, rather the conversation she had with Minority Leader McCarthy that he had with President Trump, and clearly that conversation went directly to the President's state of mind, in-- in our view and in the view of clearly fifty-seven senators supported our theory of the case. So we proceeded, and Lead Manager Raskin, rather, proceeded with that request. It became very clear to us the President's counsel was willing to stipulate to allow that statement to come into evidence and be considered by the Senate. And that was an important stipulation. Ultimately, Lead Manager Raskin read out that statement--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: --both to the United States Senate and to the broader American public. But I will just also say, Margaret, look, I think it's pretty clear and Lead Manager Raskin touched on this, whether it was five more witnesses or five thousand witnesses, it is very clear that the senators who voted to acquit on a technicality, which was the jurisdictional argument, that we had successfully defended early in the trial and actually had convinced a majority of the Senate, including Republicans--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: How--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: --that the Senate did have presidential jurisdiction to move forward. It would not have made a difference to those senators. And you heard that from Mitch McConnell himself--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: --who conceded that the President was morally responsible for provoking the events of January 6th.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there do seem to have been some key items that came up at the last minute or were, frankly, you know, overlooked until the last minute. You mentioned Congresswoman Herrera Beutler's comments, but she said she first made those public back in January. I also want to play for you these comments from Republican Leader McCarthy that were on CBS coverage during the siege.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0NORAH O' DONNELL (January 6): I'm giving you the opportunity right now that your precious and beloved United States Capitol and our democracy is witnessing this. Call the spade a spade.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-House Minority Leader/on phone/January 6): I was very clear with the President when I called him. This has to stop and he has to-- he's got to go to the American public and tell them to stop this. This is not who we are. This is not who his supporters are. This is more than politics. This is the foundation of this nation. This is the democracy that we are supposed to be the torch for the rest of the world. This is not the view we should see and nobody should encourage it and nobody should be a part of it.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the Republican leader saying on live television he personally asked the President multiple times to call off his mob. Why leave key moments like that on the table?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: I-- I disagree with the premise of that-- that question, Margaret, that, yes, that statement that you just mentioned, certainly we're aware of. I think, and again, I defer to Lead Manager Raskin on this evidentiary point, but the full extent of the conversation that Leader McCarthy had with the President is what we and the country learned about just in the last forty-eight hours. The President's response to Leader McCarthy that those rioters, those insurrectionists cared more about the election results than he did, that was new information. And so it was important for the Senate to consider that. But, again, the leader of--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But wouldn't you wanted to have to ask McCarthy your-- yourself these questions, I mean, there are-- as I'm sure you've seen reports and comments from Democratic senators like Chris Coons that, you know, this-- this just would have taken too long. If the stakes were as high as you're saying, why not hear from these witnesses?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: I'd-- I'd say a couple of things. First, it was very clear, and again, I defer this to Lead Manager Raskin, but my understanding that witnesses that were not friendly to the prosecution were not going to comply voluntarily, which meant--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: --that we would be litigating subpoenas for months or potentially years. And I know you know this, Margaret. You covered this extensively during the first impeachment. We are still litigating the subpoena--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: --for Don McGahn that the Judiciary Committee issued two years ago. So look, at the end of the day, Leader McConnell himself--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: --yesterday acknowledged the President's disgraceful dereliction of duty. It is very--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you think that--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: And then nonetheless--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You looked-- you looked--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: --and nonetheless voted to acquit.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, though, you looked right at Leader McConnell in part of your remarks. Did you ever think you were going to persuade him to convict?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: I was hopeful. You know, I-- look, I care a great deal about this country. As the son of immigrants and someone who's, you know, been given so many freedoms and opportunities here in the United States, I was hopeful that every senator would ultimately vote to do the right thing. And I'm glad-- I'm grateful that seven--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: --of them on the Republican side did that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: Obviously, history will be the judge of the rest.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time this morning.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE JOE NEGUSE: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning, a special interview with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He, like President Biden, is struggling with the pandemic. The U.K. death rate by percentage of population has now surpassed the U.S. rate and is one of the highest in the world. Good morning to you, Mister Prime Minister.\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON (United Kingdom Prime Minister/@BorisJohnson): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for joining us. I-- I wanted to ask you a little bit of your reflection on what just happened overnight. You strongly condemned the attack on the U.S. Capitol and said it was completely wrong for then President Trump to have consistently cast doubt on the outcome of a free election. In terms of America's global standing what signal did his acquittal make?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: I think the clear message that we get from the proceedings in America is that after all the toings and froings and all the kerfuffle, American democracy is strong and the American Constitution is strong and-- and robust. And we're delighted now, I'm very delighted, to have a good relationship with the-- the White House, which is an important part of any U.K. prime minister's mission. And I've had some good conversations already with-- with President Biden, fantastic conversations about the way he sees things. And, you know, Margaret, there's been some important developments in the way the U.K., U.S. thinking has been coming together in the last few weeks, and particularly on issues like climate change, on NATO, on Iran, but above all, on the ways that the U.S. and the U.K. are going to work together to deal with the environmental challenge that faces our-- our planet. And there, I think some of the stuff we're now hearing from the new American administration and from the new White House is incredibly encouraging. And we want to work with the-- with the President on that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And I understand you will be hosting President Biden for his first foreign minister's-- foreign meeting on the 19th, although it'll be virtual because of COVID. The Trump administration has already pledged about four billion dollars in December to the Global Vaccine Alliance in this fight against COVID. And I understand that's the focus of your upcoming meeting with President Biden. What are you asking him to do?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: The United States and the U.K. both have an incredibly proud record of supporting the COVAX Global Vaccine Alliance. So together we contribute huge sums to ensuring that countries around the world that are less fortunate than ours have access to-- to vaccines. And we'll be working to-- to make sure that that happens. What I also want to see is the-- the U.S and the U.K. working together to learn the lessons from the-- the pandemic and to build back better together. I'm thrilled that President Biden has also got a slogan, Build Back Better. I think-- I think I claim that we used it first. And to be truthful, I think we-- we nicked it from someone else before I started using it. But it's the right slogan, Margaret. We've got to learn from this pandemic. We've got to learn about how to-- to share information, how to-- how to share drugs properly, how to make sure we don't hoard things like personal protective equipment, as you saw earlier on in the pandemic. We've got to make sure that we-- we are distributing vaccines. In the-- in the U.K, we now have one of the fastest vaccine rollouts anywhere in the world. As-- as your viewers may perhaps know that we've-- I think we've done almost fifteen million vaccinations in our country and was-- I think more than one in four adults has now had a vaccination. That's-- that's tremendously fast progress. But we want to make sure that we work with countries like-- like the United States so that everybody gets vaccination. There's no point in-- in great countries like the United States, the U.K., vaccinating our own populations if we don't ensure that everybody gets a vaccine. This is a pandemic.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're asking the U.S. for more money towards that?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: The U.S. has already been extremely generous, as you said yourself, and the U.K. is the second biggest contributor to-- to COVAX and to the global anti-virus--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: --the-- the Vaccination Alliance that-- the Gavi organization. And we'll continue to do that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what the World Health Organization report actually constituted because the Biden administration was clear--\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --they have deep concerns about the investigation, about Chinese interference, and they are demanding that China hand over data about the early outbreak. Are you joining them in that call? Is China obscuring what happened?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: One of the things we'll be calling for in the-- the G7, which President Biden is going to be joining, I'm glad to say, is the-- is global coordination in getting to the bottom of what happens with these diseases. So when you have a zoonotic plague like coronavirus, we need to know exactly how it happened. Indeed, if it's-- if it's zoonotic, if it really originated from human contact with the animal kingdom, that's what is asserted. But we need to know exactly what happened. Was it in a-- in a wet market? Did it come from the bats? Were the bats associated with the-- the pangolins? All these questions are now matters of speculation. We need to see the data. We need to see all the evidence. So I-- I thoroughly support what President Biden has said about that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: British government scientists revealed on Friday that that particular strain, B.1.1.7, which was first detected in your country, is likely increased to a greater rate of hospitalization and death, perhaps as much as forty to sixty percent more. You're under a lot of political pressure to open your schools. Are you certain you can do that next month?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: We're proceeding in a cautious way, and what you've got at the moment in the U.K. is the virus coming down. You're perfectly correct in what you say about the-- the B.1.1.7 variant, though bear in mind that the reason we've been able to isolate this and other variants is that the U.K. conducts far more genomic analysis than any other country. Of all the genomic testing that's going on in the world, we do like forty-seven percent here in the U.K. So we're pretty good at spotting these mutations of these viruses and-- and tracking their movement through our populations. It's absolutely true that it-- that this one spreads faster. But what you're now seeing is, thanks to the efforts of the British people, the-- the lockdown, plus possibly the-- the effects of the vaccine, we're going to start seeing the-- the rates coming down more sharply. And they're--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But--\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: --they're falling at the moment. We want to be in a position where-- where we can begin to open up. So what I've said, Margaret, is that on March the 8th, we want schools to go back if we possibly can. I'm not saying that we're announcing that today because we're going to be seeing a lot more on the 22nd of this month. We'll be making clear our roadmap. And I think what people want to see, and this may be the same in the U.S. as well, is clarity about the way forward and taking steps to unlock that you don't then have to reverse because that I think--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly, and that's what I want to--\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: --is what is so difficult for businesses and for people.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's what I want to press you on, though, Mister Prime Minister, because when you announced you were shutting schools in January and you would really prioritized for a long time keeping open schools, when you said they've got to shut down in January, you said they were because they might be vectors of transmission for the community. If you've got this strain circulating and you believe schools are vectors of transmission, how can you reopen them?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: The answer to-- to that is that you need to see what the effect of the vaccination program is in removing likely victims-- victims in the-- in the sense of people who suffer either death or serious disease, what the success of the vaccination program has in removing those people from the path of the-- of the disease and, also, what's happening with the-- the rate of infection. It's now coming down, Margaret, very considerably in our country. What we don't know is quite how fast it's going to be coming down in the next couple of weeks.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the vaccines that you are using is from U.K. pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. And there are questions now about how effective it can be against some of the mutant strains, particularly the one first detected in South Africa. Are you concerned you're putting a flawed vaccine into the arms of your constituents, and what's your backup plan?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: We have great confidence in all the vaccinations that we're using and we have no reason to think that they are ineffective against any variation of the-- any-- any variant, any new variant of the-- of the virus in protecting people, Margaret, against a serious illness and death. And that's-- that's a very important consideration for us. One of the features of Oxford AstraZeneca that has been recently confirmed by the scientists is that it-- it reduces transmission between people as well. There's a sixty-seven percent reduction in transmission as a result of the use of these vaccinations.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Mister Prime minister.\u00a0We're going to take a quick break. FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.\u00a0Back in April you were hospitalized with COVID. You were quite ill. You were in the ICU. Did you ever think you wouldn't make it?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: I think in common with many people in my country, I'm very grateful to the fantastic work of the-- of the NHS and they did an outstanding job and they continue to do an outstanding job. I think one of the-- one of the-- one of the features of this-- of this illness is that you don't as-- as you undergo it, it's possible you don't realize quite what-- what state you're in. I think that is one of the features of it, because your oxygen levels go down in a way that perhaps the patient doesn't necessarily detect themselves.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's why it's so serious. I want to ask you about U.S.-U.K. relations. You have not yet met President Biden, though you're about to have this virtual meeting. You did have a phone call. Back in 2019, he referred to you, as I'm sure you know, as \"the physical and emotional clone of Donald Trump.\" Are you concerned you're going to start off on the wrong foot?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: I've had, I think, already two long and very good conversations with the President and we had a really good exchange, particularly about climate change and what he wants to do. We want to build back better together, particularly in the run up to the COP summit in November in Glasgow this year, which we hoped will be a-- a physical incarnation of the-- of the leaders of the world to agree with what we hope will be a fantastic thing, which is everybody to get to a net zero carbon emissions by 2050, but also making pledges on the way what they're going to do to get there by 2030.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: On the issue of Ireland, you may have some difference here. President Biden doesn't want you to put that peace agreement in Northern Ireland at risk at all, has made clear that border needs to stay open and you need to adhere to that E.U.-U.K. agreement from December. Can you commit and reassure the U.S. Congress and the U.S. President that you will do so in all circumstances, stick to that agreement?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: You bet. This is fundamental for us, the-- the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Peace Agreement, the Good Friday process, the Belfast Agreement, these-- these agreements are absolutely crucial--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Northern Ireland Protocol?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: --for our continued stability-- our continued stability and-- and-- and success as a-- as a U.K.-- and I have a great relationship with-- with-- with-- with Dublin, with Miche\u00e1l Martin, the Irish Taoiseach. And we're going to work together to do some great things and-- and, Margaret, be in no doubt we don't want to do anything to jeopardize the achievements of the-- the Northern Irish peace process. That's absolutely vital.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Northern Ireland Protocol specifically? You will adhere to that open border?\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: We want to make sure that there's free movement, north south, free movement east-- east west, and-- and that we guarantee the rights of the-- of the people of Northern Ireland, of course.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Mister Prime Minister, I'm told we are at time. Thank you very much for your time today.\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: No. Margaret, thank you so much. Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: FACE THE NATION has a podcast now. A new episode drops every Friday. On our latest edition, I spoke with the president of the American Federation of Teachers.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We turn now to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, Doctor Rochelle Walensky. She joins us from Boston this morning.\u00a0You heard the British Prime Minister give himself a little bit of wiggle room there on committing to reopening schools in his country next month, particularly given this new research on B.1.1.7, that highly contagious strain that now is found to have higher hospitalization and death risk associated with it. Should areas of this country where there is B.1.1.7 still have in-person classes?\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY, M.D., M.P.H. (CDC Director/@CDCDirector): There are over a thousand B.1.1.7 cases that we have documented in this country in over thirty-- in thirty-nine states. We know now that-- or we estimate now that about four percent of disease in this country is related to B.1.1.7. And we have projections that it may be the dominant strain by the end of March. That said, the amount of disease in school is very much related to the amount of disease that's in the community. So the work that we do to decrease the amount of disease in our community is-- is that much more benefit to getting our schools reopened.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But you said on Friday at a press conference that ninety percent of the country's schools are in areas with high levels of transmission. Don't those schools risk becoming vectors of transmission?\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: So what we know from the-- from the literature-- from the scientific literature, is that most disease transmission does not happen in the walls of the school. It comes in from the community. There's very limited transmission between students, between students and staff, really, mostly between staff to staff when there are breaches in mask wearing. So what we're really advocating for now is working to get our-- in-- especially in the-- in the high areas of transmission, the red zones you just talked about, getting our K-5 kids back in a hybrid mode with universal mask wearing and six feet of distancing.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So those protocols still apply with these new variants in places like South Florida or California, where there is a high degree of these mutant strains?\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Indeed, you know, it is the same disease. We-- we prevent it in the same ways. Our mitigation strategies work, whether it's a B.1.1.7 variant versus a wild type variant. The B.1.1.7 variant may be less forgiving when we have breaches in these mitigation strategies, but the mitigation strategies are indeed the same.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC data that we looked at from last year shows that the proportion of mental health-related visits for children has increased nearly twenty-four percent over the year prior. But mental health isn't mentioned in those guidelines that you released this week.\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: We are absolutely worried about all of the collateral damage that we are going to see, not just mental health, of course, mental health, but not just mental health. Loss of educational milestones, food insecurity that has happened with our schools being closed, which is why we were really prescriptive with this guidance to-- to provide states and localities with the information that they need so that they can open safely.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the mental health portion of it, are you going to issue new guidelines on how to deal with that?\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Well, we will-- we will be certainly watching that space and-- and we'll be looking to our mental health colleagues and-- and looking to where and when guidelines are required-- necessary.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were last with us, it was just right before the inauguration. And at that time, you predicted the country would be at close to half a million deaths by mid-February. That's almost exactly where we are right now. What do you think the trajectory is from this point?\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: You know, I think so much depends on how we as a country behave. We still have hundred thousand cases a day. We still have somewhere between fifteen hundred and thirty-five hundred deaths per day. And yet we see-- see some communities relaxing some of their mitigation strategies. We are nowhere out of the woods. And as you note, if-- if we relax these mitigation strategies with increasing transmissible variants out there, we could be in a much more difficult spot. So, what I would say is now is the time to not let up our guard. Now is the time to double down, still with a hundred thousand cases a day, still with over two and a half times the cases we had over the summer.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were talking about places like Montana and Iowa where they have lifted masking requirements. You say that's a mistake?\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Indeed. Indeed, I-- I think we're not out of the woods yet. We need to get our kids back to school. We need to get our communities back to some normal functioning before we can start thinking about letting up our mitigation strategies.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask what you've changed since you've taken the job at the CDC because when you were with us last you talked about the need to scale up surveillance and sequencing to basically figure out where these new variants are and to do it quickly.\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: I-- I think that there's a lot of change that's happened at the CDC, I'd invite my colleagues there to-- to comment as well. What I will tell you is, first of all, we've released the school guidance, which has been long and coming. We've really wanted to get that out, and now we have done so. In terms of the variant, specifically, we have much more sequencing happening. We have collaborated with departments of public health. Each state is now giving us strains for-- for sequencing. We get over seven hundred-- seven hundred fifty of those per week. We have collaborated with-- with commercial labs with the intent of sequencing over six thousand vir-- viruses per week, as well as collaborations with universities, with the intent of really, really scaling up our sequencing so we can have a really good sense of how many variants are out there and where they're located.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But how much are we actually getting a glimpse of right now? Where are we? Five percent? Ten percent?\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: We are-- in the beginning of-- of January, early January, we were sequencing about two hundred fifty a week. We're now over four thousand a week with the intent-- and-- and we're doing more and more every week.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you think there's still work to do to figure out where virus is spreading in this country.\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Absolutely. We have the intent to do more and more sequences every week. We need resources in order to do so. But-- but the scale up has been over tenfold just in the three weeks we've been there.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When do you think the pharmaceutical companies that have developed the vaccine we have now need to switch over production to deal with these new variants?\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: What we know now is the-- the major variant that's circulating here in the United States is B.1.1.7. That's the one that came from the U.K. We know in lab-- in the lab that the current vaccines actually work quite well against B.1.1.7. That's according to laboratory data. We don't have any data here yet to demonstrate otherwise, although we're watching it extraordinarily carefully. In the meantime, the pharmaceutical companies are adjusting their manufacturing, their-- their science to-- to directly neutralize the B.1.1.7. variant. And so we were both watching what's happening on the epidemiology with those who have been vaccinated. But we're not waiting for that. We're doing the science to scale up different vaccines in case we either need bivalent vaccines, that is a vaccine that has two different strains, or booster vaccines. Both are happening.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Both are happening. Doctor, thank you for your time.\u00a0ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Thanks so much.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to the president and CEO of pharmacy chain Rite Aid, that's Hayward Donigan. She joins us from Tampa, Florida, this morning. Good morning to you.\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN (Rite Aid President and CEO): Good morning, how are you?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm well. As of this week, your stores and other pharmacy chains are now receiving directly from the federal government doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. According to your press release, you'll get a hundred doses initially for stores in California, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Philly, and New York City. What difference does it make to get the vaccine directly?\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN: Well, it's long awaited. We're super excited to be getting these doses directly so that we just have the ability to protect more people in a meaningful way. So, we have been doing over a hundred and forty thousand shots so far with state governments and local municipalities. So we were in the whole process much earlier than we ever expected, even with the states. But it's just exciting to be picked in these states as one of two pharmacies that will be distributing the federally allocated doses.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So with those newly allocated doses, I mean, how many vaccinations do you think you'll be able to conduct each week? And did-- how many did you do this week for example?\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN: Yeah. So we're doing-- we-- we got a hundred and sixteen thousand doses last week. And so those are already in process. We are administering, as you said, a hundred doses per store per week. There's eleven hundred and sixty stores and we anticipate and are hopeful that that volume will go up. So we're doing, you know, essentially, twenty shots a day per store.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So, can you explain what the registration system will look like? Because I'm sure you know, I know plenty of people, particularly older people, who really struggle trying to figure out which website to go to at the state, at the county level, which store to go to. How are you going to streamline that part of the process?\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN: Well, at this point, it's all still being handled by the state and local jurisdictions, and if you go to riteaid.com/covid-19 and then you go into the vaccine eligibility section, we have a daily update by state-- by jurisdiction that shows you exactly which link to click on to register for a vaccine and-- and updates you on the status of Rite Aid's participation. We do not currently schedule in the store, so you have to go through the state or local jurisdictions, websites, and that's who will point you to. And then you can pick a Rite Aid or you can pick a Walmart or you can pick up Publix or whoever's been named and allocated doses to register with. And, of course, the supply continues to be not able to meet up the demand.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN: So we still have very long waiting lists, but we're hoping that in the April, May timeframe, when you hear about all these new doses becoming available, at some point we're hoping that you can go directly to us and register on our scheduling system. But for now, you need to go through that link. And-- and we feel as if this is a great source of information for people who are very confused.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you said back in January-- you said it yourself at an investor conference, that all of this is pretty confusing because of how states are breaking this down. How would you advise the Biden administration to-- to change it? Should the private sector be taking more of a role in every part of this?\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN: I think the private sector is more experienced with these scheduling tools and registration tools, which are very much stressed right now. And so, you know, I always think that the private sector who build these tools and-- and scale these tools in the Cloud from a technology perspective would be the best people to help--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN: --in this regard, as well as with the call centers. And I know that the governors are doing a wonderful job as best they can. For example, the-- the governor of New Jersey putting their call-- own call centers together and trying to do as much of this as they can. But the demand is so high that I do think the private sector can play a role here.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN: We ourselves have built our own scheduling tool.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Marcella Nunez-Smith, who leads the Health Equity Task Force for the Biden White House, has talked about trying to get vaccines into socially vulnerable areas. On this program, back in November, CVS' CEO said they could put mobile trucks and vans into underserved communities. Do you have plans to do things like that?\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN: We can really do anything, and we are prepared to do anything and everything. We are staffing clinics today. I think the federal government has done a really good job, in the prior administration and the current administration, with the testing sites really focusing on socially vulnerable areas and making sure that we provide as much coverage there as we can. They're doing the same thing right now in terms of making sure that where they pick our stores, for example, is-- is ensuring adequate coverage for both geography and socially vulnerable communities. So there's an ongoing dialogue on-- daily about this. And as we roll both testing and vaccines out there, very focused, as are we, on making sure that we cover those communities.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you seen a drop off in testing? Because the COVID Tracking Project says there's been a twenty-percent drop in testing since President Biden was inaugurated.\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN: There has been. Our assumption is that it's because the holidays are over and we are assuming that there might be a pickup after the Super Bowl, but right now we think it's just a-- people are a bit weary. They're probably taking a little break after Christmas and Thanksgiving or the holidays. And so we also have seen those tests drop off, but we have just rolled out to twelve hundred stores free testing because we anticipate that--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN: --testing will continue to be a very important tool in the arsenal of Americans.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you very much for your time today.\u00a0HEYWARD DONIGAN: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to former FDA commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He sits on the board of Pfizer as well as Illumina, and he joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you agree with the-- the CEO of Rite Aid there that the private sector should take a-- a more direct role in more of this process. Do you see the Biden administration eventually getting there?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think they're doing it right now, the Biden administration. I think they're taking an all-of-the-above approach in terms of trying to push this out and create more access sites. You know, the one recommendation I would make is that I wouldn't-- I wouldn't devote as much federal resources to developing these mass vaccination sites. I think people who can go online, register, drive to Dodger Stadium, wait in line, take a half a day off from work to get vaccinated, those are people who could be serviced by Walmart, CVS, Rite Aid. I would be taking the federal resources and the state resources and creating more bespoke solutions that can be used in some of the hard-to-reach environments, some of the underserved communities where you can move mobile vans into those communities, try to work through community groups, local providers, church groups, community health centers to try to get harder-to-reach populations vaccinated. That's a very difficult effort. It's expensive. It's a bespoke effort. It's a hands-on effort. I'd be marshaling the federal resources towards that kind of a mission and letting Walmart work off the easy demand and Rite Aid.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The Biden administration purchased two hundred million more doses. That gives them a stockpile of about six hundred eventually once it comes off the production line. You heard me talk with the-- the CDC director and I asked her when production should shift to those treatments of new variants. She said that is happening now. What can you tell us about where we stand in terms of being ready to protect against those new variants?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think we have plenty of time to get this right for the fall and have vaccine boosters that could cover these new variants. The development work is going on right now. So all the companies are developing new variant vaccines, including Pfizer, the company I'm on the board of. The question is, when do you start shifting over your manufacturing? And I think you're going to need to probably make that decision at some point in July, August at the latest. And you might not shift over all your manufacturing. You might shift some of your-- your manufacturing towards those new variant vaccines, because remember, they won't be fully through clinical trials yet. So you don't want to throw all your eggs into that basket, but you do want to create some supply that you'll have it on-hand come the fall if you need those vaccines. So I think that's about the point where you're going to make that decision. The time to starting manu-- the manufacturing process and actually getting finished vaccine off the line is about two months. So if you start manufacturing in July, you'll start getting vaccine off the line in time for the fall.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the British prime minister stand by his decision to continue vaccinating his populace with AstraZeneca's vaccine, even though it has shown itself to not be as effective in early trials against the South African variant. The WHO is sticking with it, too. Is that a mistake?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think if we're going to do that, we need a plan B. I understand why they want to do this. They've manufactured a lot of this vaccine. It's cheap. It's accessible. It can be put into low- and middle-income countries because of the handling requirements. It doesn't require complicated cold chain storage. But if you're putting a vaccine into those markets that we know does not cover B.1.351, the South African variant, very well, if at all, you have the risk that you could select for that variant in those markets. And so you need a plan B on what vaccine you're going to deploy to those regions if in fact B-- B.1.351 becomes prevalent in those regions after you vaccinate with the AstraZeneca vaccine. And the problem is you may foreclose the one vaccine that's the most likely candidate in those markets, which is the J&J vaccine because it has very similar storage requirements. You would want to use that vaccine. But in fact, the AstraZeneca vaccine is very immunogenic against the vaccine vector. So what they're using to deliver the COVID gene sequence is a chimpanzee adenovirus. And it turns out that that adenovirus that they're using is very immunogenic. It creates antibodies that can attack other adenoviruses, including perhaps, and we don't know this for sure, but perhaps the J&J vaccine. So you might foreclose the opportunity to use that vaccine in these markets, which means you need another plan B, which might be the mRNA vaccines, like the vaccine that Pfizer produces, the company I'm on the board of. But those vaccines are harder to handle in those markets because they require more complicated cold chain storage. So we need to work this out right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a pretty big warning that you're making right now. I-- I want--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think they-- I think they need to have a plan for that, yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I also want to ask you about these comments. They were pretty sharp, I thought, from the-- from the Biden administration's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. He said yesterday that the Biden administration has deep concern about the World Health Organization's investigation, Chinese interference in it. He demanded handing over data. That's exactly what the Trump administration demanded as well. What is it that China still has here that we need to know?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: A lot of data. Well, first of all, they have antibody testing on the people who worked in that Wuhan lab. They didn't make that available. So you'd want to know if they have antibodies to the coronavirus. That would be an indication that maybe they-- they got infected. Now, those antibodies will-- will wane over time. But you at least want to look at that data. We want to see sequencing data on retained samples from people who were admitted to the hospital in October and November with viral syndromes that looked like COVID to see if this infection was spreading earlier and try--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --to get closer to the source of the initial outbreak. That data is certainly available, the Chinese have that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: So there's a lot of data that was not made available.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Gottlieb, thank you, as always, for your time.\u00a0We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The Senate impeachment trial put on display some harrowing new sights and sounds from January 6th, as protesters stormed the Capitol and made their way into the Senate chamber. We asked our senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann to take a look at those images.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0(Crowd protesting)\u00a0MAN #1: We need units outside on the terrace ASAP. We need units. We're surrounded.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: January 6th, American democracy's day of infamy.\u00a0MAN #2: They are behind our lines.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Watching this montage of mayhem--\u00a0CROWD (in unison): USA. USA. USA.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: --its spasms of menace and malice.\u00a0CROWD (in unison): Stop the steal. Stop the steal.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: This is America?\u00a0MAN #3: We were normal, good, law-abiding citizens, and you guys did this to us.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: We learned a lot this week about how appalling many moments were. Pro-Trump rioters bludgeoned police, dragged them down flights of stairs.\u00a0OFFICER MICHAEL FANONE (D.C. Metropolitan Police/January 6, 2021): It looked like a medieval battle scene. At one point I got tased. People were yelling out, you know, we got one. We got one.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: More clear than ever the mob of hunters almost got elected leaders.\u00a0MAN #4 (January 6, 2021): Nancy. Where are you, Nancy?\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Here you see Senator Mitt Romney abruptly reversing course away from rioters, now inside the Capitol.\u00a0CROWD (in unison/January 6, 2021): Hang Mike Pence. Hang Mike Pence.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: With gallows set up outside, the Secret Service whisked away Vice President Mike Pence and his family. An aide carried what appeared to be one of the three nuclear footballs. Rioters came within one hundred feet of them.\u00a0MAN #5 (January 6, 2021): Take your pins off.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Representatives and staff cowered and cried. Video showed Chuck Schumer and other senators evacuate the Senate floor. The newly complete narrative laid out this week its ark of thuggish behavior, seditious acts, and close calls, was a gut punch to our sense of self. And to senators, watching the presentation.\u00a0SENATOR TINA SMITH (D-Minnesota): I mean, I had tears in my eyes. You heard every single breath, every single sigh.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: But after an acquittal on the impeachment charge, there's worry about a lingering threat.

            "article_content": "Canada announced Monday that it will begin letting fully vaccinated U.S. citizens into Canada on August 9, and those from the rest of the world on September 7. Officials said the 14-day quarantine requirement will be waived as of August 9 for eligible travelers who are currently residing in the U.S. and have received a full course of a COVID-19 vaccine approved for use in Canada. Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, who said he spoke with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Friday, said the U.S. has not yet indicated any plan to change current restrictions at the land border. Canadians are able to fly into the U.S. with a negative COVID-19 test. Asked in Washington if the U.S. would reciprocate, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, \"We are continuing to review our travel restrictions. Any decisions about resuming travel will be guided by our public health and medical experts. ... I wouldn't look at it through a reciprocal intention.\" U.S. Democratic Congressman Brian Higgins, whose district includes Buffalo and Niagara Falls, said the U.S. has \"neglected to give reopening the northern border the serious attention it deserves, and there is no excuse.\" Canadian officials also announced that children who aren't vaccinated, but are travelling with vaccinated parents, won't have to quarantine, but will have to avoid group activities including schools and daycare centers. Transport Minister Omar Alghabra also said a ban on direct flights from India will be extended to August 21 because of the Delta variant. \"The situation in India is still very serious,\" he said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said last week that Canada could start allowing fully vaccinated Americans into the country as of mid-August for nonessential travel and should be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travelers from all countries by early September. Canada leads G20 countries in vaccination rates, with approximately 80% of eligible Canadians vaccinated with their first dose and over 50% of those eligible fully vaccinated. \"This weekend, we even passed the U,S. in terms of fully vaccinated people,\" Trudeau said. \"Thanks to the rising vaccination rates and declining COVID-19 cases, we are able to move forward with adjusted border measures.\" Reopening to the U.S first is a \"recognition of our unique bond, especially between border communities,\" Trudeau said. In the early days of the pandemic, the U.S. and Canadian governments closed the more than 5,500-mile border to nonessential traffic. With increasing vaccination rates and dropping infection rates, some were annoyed the two governments hadn't laid out plans to fully reopen the border. Canada began easing its restrictions earlier this month, allowing fully vaccinated Canadians or permanent legal residents to return to Canada without quarantining. But among the requirements are a negative test for the virus before returning, and another once they get back. Pressure has been mounting on Canada to continue to ease the restrictions at the border, which have been in effect since March 2020. Providing exemptions for travel into Canada amid the pandemic is politically sensitive and Trudeau is expected to call a federal election next month. Canadian officials have said they would like 75% of eligible Canadian residents to be fully vaccinated before loosening border restrictions for tourists and business travelers. The Canadian government expects to have enough vaccine delivered for 80% of eligible Canadians to be fully vaccinated by the end of July. The U.S. only allowed for exports of vaccines into Canada in early May. Commercial traffic has gone back and forth normally between the two countries since the start of the pandemic. The U.S. Travel Association estimates that each month the border is closed costs $1.5 billion. Canadian officials say Canada had about 22 million foreign visitors in 2019 \u2014 about 15 million of them from the U.S.",

            "article_content": "Moscow\u00a0\u2014 Russia's government internet censors have threatened to hit Apple and Google with fines if they don't delete an app developed by jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny's team. The app urges Russian voters to defeat President Vladimir Putin's ruling party in the upcoming parliamentary elections. Navalny's movement was formally labelled an \"extremist\" organization by Russian authorities over the summer, putting him and his supporters in the same ranks as al Qaeda and the Taliban in the eyes of Russian law. In February, Navalny was immediately arrested upon return to Russia from Germany, where he spent months recovering from a poisoning attack that he and U.S. officials accuse Putin himself of ordering.  His jailing prompted mass protests across the country, resulting in thousands of arrests. The censor, Roskomnadzor, told Apple and Google that the \"Smart Voting\" app must be deleted from its app stores, citing the Navalny group behind it having been designated an extremist organization, Interfax news agency reported on Thursday.  If the companies fail to comply, Moscow \"may also consider [it] as interference of the U.S. companies in Russian elections,\" the article stated. As of Friday, neither platform had deleted the app.  The demands are just the latest test for Western tech giants as authorities in Moscow continue to demand compliance with controversial legislation that has given the Kremlin ever-growing control over the internet, and everything on it, within Russia's borders. Fines against Western internet companies have already piled up as many refuse to comply with new laws, including the requirement that all Russian users' data be stored domestically on Russian servers, and that service providers share decryption keys if Russia's special services ask for them, so they can scrutinize encrypted user data. Facebook has already been slapped with nearly $600,000 in fines, followed by Google, which owes about $383,000 dollars thus far, according to a report on internet freedoms in Russia done by the advocacy group Reporters Without Borders. The report says that in the run-up to the September parliamentary elections, from which most opposition candidates have already been disqualified, Russian authorities have significantly increased pressure on international online platforms. Reporters Without Borders notes that the bulk of penalties against internet services for \"involving minors in protest activity\" targeted Western technology platforms, while other services, such as China's TikTok and Russia's version of Facebook, VKontakte, were affected to a much lesser extent. Roskomsvoboda, an internet freedom advocacy group, said that over the past two years Russian authorities have increasingly used internet restrictions as, \"a tool to combat opposition-minded information or socio-political sources\" and a means of surveillance.\u00a0 In July, Roskomnadzor banned over 40 websites and services associated with Navalny's movement. In March, the internet censor issued a warning to popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) services, which allow Russians to access banned content, to filter their traffic or risk being banned in the country. An overwhelming majority of services, including NordVPN, ProtonVPN, TorGuard and others have refused, citing privacy concerns.  On Friday, as President Putin addressed a business panel in Vladivostok, with many foreign investors present via video link, the censor announced that six popular VPNs would be blocked in Russia. Some services are equipped to bypass the bans, however, and it wasn't immediately clear how effective the restrictions would be.  Russia's internet regulators tried for two years, without much luck, to block the popular messaging app Telegram, but ended up restoring full access. The authorities have also threatened in the past to ban Twitter, but they seem to have opted to just slow down traffic on the site in what many see as a warning to platforms with far more users in the country, like Google and Facebook.\u00a0 Putin has made \"digitalization\" one of the priorities of the Russia's economy. But the former spy also famously dislikes the internet, has no presence on social networks himself, and doesn't even own a cell phone.\u00a0 During a visit to an elementary school in the city of Vladivostok on Wednesday, a boy asked Putin to sign up for his YouTube channel about ecology, leaving the president confused.\u00a0 \"What do I have to sign?\" Putin asked. \"I didn't understand \u2014 what must I sign?\"  His response prompted chuckles from the kids in the audience, and the 10-year-old went on to explain that YouTube is a social media platform. (You can watch the exchange, here, on YouTube.) \"Ah, okay,\" Putin replied. \"To your channel? Okay, I'll think about it.\" The Kremlin commented on the exchange, explaining that President Putin \"has no time to post on social media,\" and doesn't want anyone to do it for him either.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence was met with scattered heckling on Friday, at a speech he was delivering in the home state of the president he served. As he addressed a general session at the Faith and Freedom Coalition in Orlando, there were some jeers, with some yelling \"traitor\" at him.\u00a0 Undeterred, Pence declared himself \"a Christian, a conservative and a Republican \u2014 in that order\" and went on to say, as he often does, that serving as vice president alongside President Trump \"was the greatest honor of my life.\" He laid out what he called a \"winning agenda\" to take back Republican majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives in the midterm elections next year, framing opponents of the GOP as anti-Christian and anti-military. \"Our movement will reject every effort to marginalize Christians and conservatives wherever it arises. We will expose religious persecution masquerading as a quest for equal rights, and we will demand that government agencies, our military, and our public schools reject critical race theory in all its forms,\" Pence said. The former vice president tried to make the case that President Biden's administration is in thrall to the those who are furthest left in the Democratic Party, telling conference attendees\u00a0 that \"one of the most troubling developments\" during the first few months of the Biden administration has been its \"wholehearted embrace of the radical left's all-encompassing assault on American culture and values.\" Pence claimed \"patriotic education\" has been replaced by \"political indoctrination\" and said critical race theory, which posits that racism is a social construct embedded in the country's legal, economic and political systems, teaches kids to be ashamed of their skin color.\u00a0 \"Critical race theory is racism, pure and simple,\" Pence said.\u00a0 \"And it should be rejected by every American of every race,\" Pence said. He added that it's time for America to \"discard left-wing reflex to see systematic racism across the nation,\" and invoked Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican senator, who says \"America is not a racist country.\" Pence also attacked the Biden administration's handling of the U.S.-Mexico border and claimed President Biden has turned the \"most secure\" border in the world into the worst border crisis in American history. He also called on Vice President Kamala Harris to visit the southern border. \"It is long past time for our current vice president to go to the border, put our policies back into effect and end the Biden border crisis today,\" Pence said. \u00a0\u00a0 The former vice president also offered a critique of President Biden's handling of last week's G-7 summit and accused Mr. Biden of showing weak leadership abroad. \"President Biden has been so busy accommodating the sensibilities of European leaders that this week at the G-7, President Macron said how great it was to have a U.S. president back as part of the club. Well, the only club I want a U.S. president part of is labeled 'USA,'\" Pence said, putting his own spin on Mr. Trump's \"America first\" credo. He claimed Mr. Biden has abandoned Israel \"and set off the worst outbreak of violence in the Middle East in seven years.\" Pence also attacked the current administration for rejoining the Paris Climate accord and announcing plans to reopen negotiations with Iran: \"President Biden replaced strength with weakness, moral clarity with confusion, and loyalty with betrayal.\" CBS News reporter covering the intersection between politics and tech.",

            "article_content": "A California man wanted by the FBI for taking part in the January 6 Capitol riot is seeking asylum in Belarus, a former Soviet country ruled by an authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, according to a state TV report. Evan Neumann, 48, was placed on the FBI's Most Wanted List in March and is being charged with six crimes related to the insurrection, including violent entry on Capitol grounds and assault on law enforcement officials. In court files, the FBI said that Neumann spent around four hours at the Capitol and verbally and physically abused police officers, including \"forcefully shoving [a] metal barricade\" into a line of officers before breaking into the building. In a one-on-one with a Belarusian reporter, Neumann maintained his innocence and said he was being politically persecuted. A Belarus 1 TV channel presenter introduced him as an American who \"sought justice and asked uncomfortable questions\" after former U.S. President Donald Trump challenged the results of the 2020 election, adding that Neumann \"lost almost everything and is being persecuted by the U.S. government.\" \"California native, high school educated, married, two children, a business owner. One among millions of Americans just like him,\" a Belarusian reporter said in the segment called \"Goodbye, America.\" \"Of course, he is politically active \u2014 not like Edward Snowden, he didn't have access to state secrets \u2014 but something forced him to flee the land of fabulous freedoms and opportunities, as we used to think of it.\" Neumann said he left the U.S. in March following the advice of his lawyer. His escape from the U.S. authorities amounted to an elaborate scheme: Neumann said he first flew to Italy, then took a train to Switzerland, rented a car to travel via Germany to Poland before finally arriving in Ukraine, where he settled in a rented apartment. After four months of living in central Zhytomyr, Neumann claimed he noticed surveillance by SBU, Ukraine's security service, and fled the country, crossing the border with Belarus on foot through swamps near the Chernobyl exclusion zone. \"It was very difficult to cross it, I started around noon and was only able to get out by half-past two in the morning,\" Neumann said in the TV report. I've seen wild boars, bumped into snakes, vipers there just go crazy in August, they are very aggressive.\" He was arrested by Belarusian border guards on August 15, according to the report. Belarusian migration authorities declined to comment on the matter, citing confidentiality of personal information, the Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported earlier this week. At least three U.S. citizens have applied for asylum in Belarus in 2021, the agency said. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has repeatedly used the January 6 event as a talking point for his domestic audience, casting the West as plunging into chaos and the U.S. as \"undemocratic\" in the way it treated the rioters. Last August, Lukashenko launched a brutal monthslong crackdown on mass protests that erupted since he claimed victory in a presidential election many in Belarus and abroad saw as blatantly rigged. Lukashenko has ruled the country since 1994 with an iron fist and has been repeatedly accused of killing and jailing his political opponents. His treatment of Belarusian demonstrators, many of whom have been beaten and tortured in detention centers, provoked a wave of sanctions and condemnation, including from the Biden administration. Lukashenko's closest ally, Russian leader Vladimir Putin, accused the U.S. of \"double standards\" for its treatment of the Capitol rioters, saying that it is wrong for the U.S. to criticize crackdowns on anti-government protests overseas while prosecuting Americans who took part in the insurrection. \"They weren't just a crowd of robbers and rioters,\" Putin said in June of the Trump supporters who stormed Congress. \"Those people had come with political demands.\"",

            "article_content": "The international community must draw \"clear red lines\" with Russia, French President Emmanuel Macron said, including implementing sanctions after any \"unacceptable behavior\" by Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said, however, that sanctions alone are not sufficient. In an interview with \"Face The Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan, Macron said he \"fully\" shares Mr. Biden's desire to open dialogue with Russia. However, he said it was important to be clear with Putin \"when we are not aligned.\" \"This is the only way to be credible. I think that sanctions are not sufficient in itself, in themselves, but sanctions are part of the package. I do prefer constructive dialogue, but to have a constructive and efficient dialogue, you need credibility,\" Macron said. Over 30,000 Russian soldiers\u00a0are amassed on the border of Ukraine, raising concerns that Russia may invade. This is the highest number of Russian troops gathered on the border since 2014. Macron is aligned with President Biden's view that this is an unacceptable level of tension. \"I think we have to define clear red lines with Russia,\" in order to be credible, Macron said. He acknowledged that the international community has had what he called a \"naive approach\" with Russia. \"I think what happened a few years ago when Ukraine was invaded, it's not a failure of diplomacy, it's a failure of our collective credibility vis-\u00e0-vis Russia,\" Macron said in reference to the international community's failure to enforce the Obama-Biden administration's \"red line\" on the use of chemical weapons by Syrian dictator Bashar al Assad in 2013. That inaction, in Macron's view, emboldened Mr. Putin. Months later, Russia\u00a0annexed Crimea, a peninsula jutting out into the Black Sea, away from Ukraine in 2014. The annexation was widely condemned by the international community, and the U.S. sanctioned Russia in response. On Thursday, Mr. Biden announced more sanctions against Russia this week in retaliation for espionage and political interference, citing both the SolarWinds cyber hacking and Moscow's\u00a0interference in the 2020 US presidential election. \"We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,\" Mr. Biden said in remarks announcing the sanctions on Thursday, although he added that \"now is the time to de-escalate.\" According to a White House readout of their Tuesday phone call, President Biden also called on Vladimir Putin to \"de-escalate tensions\" surrounding the Russian military buildup in \"occupied Crimea and on Ukraine's borders.\" The full interview with Macron will air during \"Face The Nation\" on Sunday at 10:30 a.m. ET.

            "article_content": "Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has fired dozens of members of the Homeland Security Advisory Council as part of the effort to \"reconstitute\" the panel, according to a letter obtained by CBS News. The letter,\u00a0first reported by Politico, tells members that he has \"ended the term of current HSAC members effective March 26, 2021,\" in order to facilitate \"an orderly transition to a new model\" for the panel. \"I am considering how the HSAC can bring the greatest value to the Department and how the expertise, judgment, and counsel of its members can be harnessed most effectively to advance the Department's mission,\" Mayorkas wrote. \"I expect to work closely with the HSAC and to rely on its Members to help guide the Department through a period of change.\" He thanked the members of the council for their service, and said he would \"reconstitute the HSAC in the next few weeks, once the new model has been developed.\" Some members, however, will remain. William Bratton, the former New York City police commissioner, and Karen Tandy, former administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will keep their current positions as chair and vice chair of HSAC. Additionally, William Webster, former FBI and CIA director who Mayorkas says he was \"privileged\" to work in his letter, will continue in his position as chair emeritus. More than 30 unpaid members previously sat on the council, made up of leaders appointed by both Democrat and Republican DHS secretaries of old who served in an advisory capacity. But now, the\u00a0HSAC website\u00a0has been updated accordingly and currently displays only three biographies on its page.\u00a0 Former members of the council included former acting DHS Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, former NSA director Keith Alexander, former D.C. police chief Cathy Lanier, former high-profile FBI agent Ali Soufan and former ICE acting director Tom Homan.\u00a0 Former HSAC members told CBS News that the advisory council been temporarily \"dormant\" since the election and waiting on further instructions from the secretary. Members were not given a \"heads up\" regarding the disbandment of the council, and it took several of them off-guard. The last project members were working on was an evaluation of Chinese influence on American universities. \"I thought it was the best board we'd ever had,\" said James Carafano, a foreign policy expert for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. \"It had a lot of strong expertise across the department's portfolios and competencies. So I'm disappointed.\" Carafano argued that \"the biggest threat to Homeland Security today is politicization of the department and of the enterprise, in general.\" \"It has always been a non-partisan board. All of the boards deliberations \u2014 everybody left their politics at the door. Every day, they just came in and worked on behalf of the department. That's what I loved so much about it. It was this safe little garden where experts could just focus on the mission,\" Carafano said. A spokesperson for DHS said that Mayorkas will conduct a review of HSAC, and then a bipartisan \"redesigned or reconstituted HSAC will be launched with diverse membership representative of America and the communities DHS serves.\" The spokesperson added that Mayorkas made this decision in consultation with HSAC leadership. \"The Secretary intends to work with the HSAC intensely, engaging regularly with esteemed leaders who are recognized experts in the Department's varied missions and who reflect the diversity of the country the Department serves,\" the spokesperson said. On Thursday, former Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf criticized the move by Mayorkas,\u00a0tweeting, \"While I respect the right for a DHS Secretary to alter the HSAC to address their needs, dismissing the entire council outright and stopping a lot of important work (that was underway) is not the right approach.\" Congressman John Katko, the ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee, also criticized the decision, calling the HSAC \"a critical body of expert, bipartisan thought-leaders, with the significant responsibility of providing strategic and actionable counsel to top DHS leaders on a range of homeland security issues.\" \"While these members serve at the pleasure of the Secretary, today's action sends the message that this Administration has no intention of upholding a bipartisan, unifying approach to securing our homeland,\" Katko said in a statement. \"It's an absolute shame that Secretary Mayorkas has removed these well-respected homeland security leaders who have dedicated their careers to strengthening our homeland security posture.\" Mayorkas' decision comes as the Biden administration has come under scrutiny for its handling of the influx of unaccompanied minors crossing the southern border. While President Biden has said all migrant families should be rapidly expelled from U.S. soil under a Trump-era public health order, the policy is currently being enforced inconsistently across the southern border, frustrating both immigrant advocates and government officials. There were approximately 18,000 unaccompanied migrant children in U.S. federal custody as of Friday morning, according to government figures. Nearly 5,500 were being held in Border Patrol facilities, some of which are overcrowded, and 12,500 were being housed in Health and Human Services shelters and influx sites.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence said he will always be \"proud\" that Congress reconvened on January 6 to complete the certification of the electoral votes after the attack at the U.S Capitol interrupted the process. Pence, who was recently heckled as a \"traitor\" at a Republican event \u2014 likely for failing to overturn the 2020 election results and declare on January 6 that President Trump had won the election \u2014 defended the action he took to help affirm President Biden's victory. \"There are those in my party who believe that in my position as presiding officer over the joint session, that I possess the authority to reject or return electoral votes certified by the states,\" Pence said. \"But the Constitution provides the vice president with no such authority before the joint session of Congress.\"\u00a0 \"And the truth is, there's almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president,\" he added.\u00a0 Pence's speech Thursday night was part of The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation & Institute's series on the future of the Republican Party.\u00a0 This wasn't the first time that Pence has publicly addressed the January 6 attack on the Capitol. At a fundraiser in New Hampshire earlier this month, Pence said he and former President Trump had spoken \"many times\" since they'd left office, but he didn't know if they would \"ever see eye-to-eye\" about that day. Congress isn't finished examining what happened on January 6 yet \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Thursday that a select committee will examine the January 6 attack. Her decision came weeks after Senate Republicans blocked a bill to create an independent commission to investigate the assault.\u00a0 Pence also offered his vision for the future of the Republican Party, one that he said would be \"informed by the success of the last four years.\" He called for a \"new American agenda\" to focus on key GOP issues such as border security, free and fair trade, being tough on China, and \"patriotic education\" at American schools.\u00a0 And Pence disparaged critical race theory, which has been attacked by conservatives across the country. He claimed that it teaches children as young as kindergartners that they should be ashamed of their skin color.\u00a0 \"It represents a full-throated assault aimed at the heart of the American experiment and it is nothing short of state-sponsored and state-sanctioned racism,\" Pence said. \"Our party must ensure that critical race theory is expelled from our schools, our military, and our public institutions.\"\u00a0 Pence has started to ramp up his public appearances, amid speculation that he might run for president in 2024. He is scheduled to speak at the Republican National Committee's summer donor retreat this weekend.\u00a0 He also plans to be active in the 2022 midterm elections. He's already visited the early primary states of South Carolina and New Hampshire and will be traveling to Iowa next month.\u00a0 But other potential 2024 presidential contenders are also emerging. Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley was in Iowa on Thursday night speaking at the Iowa Republican Party's Lincoln Dinner. She has a busy schedule in the Hawkeye state, including events with female elected leaders, young Republicans and fundraisers for top Iowa GOP elected officials.\u00a0 In a slight directed at Vice President Harris, Haley quipped, \"thank goodness for Donald Trump, or we never would have gotten Kamala Harris to the border.\" She praised his foreign policy, as she has in the past, but her warmer remarks about the former president were a departure from her public criticism of him. At the RNC winter meeting, she said Mr. Trump's actions after the election \"will be judged harshly by history.\" Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton will be in Iowa next week, and South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are going to the Hawkeye State next month to address a Christian conservative group. Pence is also slated to attend that event.\u00a0 CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Moscow \u2014\u00a0A court in Belarus handed a 11-year jail sentence to Maria Kolesnikova, an opposition leader who inspired massive protests against dictatorial rule of Alexander Lukashenko last year, state media reported. Kolesnikova's lawyer Maxim Znak was also sentenced to 10 years in prison. In a closed trial they were found guilty of threatening the \"national security\" of Belarus, founding an extremist group and conspiring to \"seize power in an unconstitutional way.\" Tens of thousands of people protested across Belarus following last year's presidential election in which Lukashenko, who has ruled the country with an iron fist since 1994, declared victory. Many local and international observers criticized the election as fraudulent and the ballot-counting process as non-transparent. Kolesnikova was a campaign manager for president hopeful Viktor Babaryko, who was put into a KGB prison ahead of the vote in a move seen as a way to remove tough competition for Lukashenko. Kolesnikova then stepped into the spotlight, protesting alongside Veronika Tsepkalo and Svetlana Tikhonovskaya, the wife of another jailed candidate and popular blogger Sergey Tikhanovsky The three women campaigned across the country, with Tikhonovskaya running in her husband's place and subsequently contesting Lukashenko's claim to victory. Both Tikhonovskaya and Tsepkalo have since fled the country, and Kolesnikova is the only major protest leader remaining in Belarus. She was detained by KGB agents last September, who put a sack over her head and drove the politician to the Ukrainian border in an attempt to deport her. But Kolesnikova refused to leave Belarus and tore up her passport. \"She was screaming that she would not go anywhere,\" Kolesnikova's colleague Anton Rodnenkov, who was also detained and deported to Ukraine, told Radio Liberty at the time. \"As soon as she was in the car and saw her passport, she immediately tore it into many small pieces and threw out the window.\" \"After that, she climbed out of a window and walked towards the Belarusian border,\" Rodnenkov added. In video clips from inside the courtroom, posted on Monday, Kolesnikova appeared defiant \u2014 smiling and wearing her signature red lipstick. Both Kolesnikova and Znak pleaded not guilty and called the process unlawful, MediaZona reported, citing their lawyer Vadym Pylchenko. The U.S. and EU imposed tough economic sanctions on the Lukashenko regime after he launched a brutal crackdown on protests last year, resulting in thousands of detentions. Human rights groups issued multiple reports shedding light on torture and persecution of jailed dissidents in Belarus. \u00a0\"The persecution and imprisonment of Maria Kolesnikova and Maxim Znak is intended to destroy the hopes of millions of people on whose behalf they spoke up - a whole generation of Belarusians who strive to ensure that peaceful changes take place in their country and that human rights are respected,\" Bruce Miller, Amnesty International's Deputy Director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, said in a statement to CBS. \u00a0\"We demand that Maria Kolesnikova, Maxim Znak and hundreds of other people jailed in Belarus solely for exercising their human rights are released immediately.\" Despite international pressure, Lukashenko has continued to push his country towards a path of isolation. In May, he faced intense international criticism when authorities diverted a passenger plane and forced it to land in Minsk, detaining two dissidents onboard. With protests coming to a halt under pressure from special services, the Belarusian president found a strong backer in Russian leader Vladimir Putin and has so far shown no signs of backing down.

The international community's concerns about a possible invasion stem from Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea, which is viewed as a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and not recognized by the international community.\u00a0 Putin opposes NATO expansion eastward into his sphere of influence, and he does not want\u00a0 Ukraine to obtain NATO membership. Ukraine has embraced Europe and very much wants to join the NATO alliance. There is currently a level 4 State Department \"do not travel\" travel advisory in place for Ukraine. The reason not to travel given in an earlier advisory was COVID-19, but the newest advisory, issued Monday, cites the military threat posed by Russia.\u00a0 \"U.S. citizens should be aware of reports that Russia is planning for significant military action against Ukraine,\" the advisory reads. This is the department's highest advisory, which warns of a \"greater likelihood of life-threatening risks\" and an environment that could make it extremely difficult for the U.S. government to aid any traveler in distress during an emergency. The Biden administration sanctioned Russia in April for a different reason \u2013 to retaliate for incursions including the SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign and Moscow's interference in the 2020 presidential election.",

            "article_content": "As Californians express widespread concern about the Delta variant, they overwhelmingly say the state's recent rise in cases was preventable,\u00a0had more people gotten vaccinated and taken more precautions. California's vaccinated voice a lot of judgment toward the unvaccinated: \"They're putting people like me at risk\" is a top way the fully vaccinated pick to describe those who won't get the shot, with many others outright \"upset or angry\" with those unwilling to get it. From a policy standpoint, there's strong support for vaccine mandates, too. Meanwhile, as the effort to recall Governor Gavin Newsom heads into its final month, Newsom faces what looks like a turnout challenge: while voters would marginally prefer to keep him in office at the moment, it looks like that will heavily depend on whether Democrats in his party get more motivated about it. When California's vaccinated describe people unwilling to get the vaccine, another phrase they select is that \"they're being misled by false information,\" in addition to the emotional response of being upset. Far fewer of the fully vaccinated say they respect the decision of those who won't.\u00a0 Behind some of those sentiments, we also see that while unvaccinated Californians tend to describe the decision to get the shot as a \"personal health choice,\" the vaccinated are more likely to call it both a personal choice and public health responsibility. Californians' list of what may have prevented rising cases is dominated by more vaccinations and taking masking precautions, while far fewer point to other measures like more travel and border restrictions. Nor do they cast any blame on scientists and medical professionals for the recent rise in infections. (Though on this, we do see more partisan differences: Republicans are notable for singling out limiting of border crossings as one top way to have prevented it, more so than more vaccinations or policy measures.) So, given all that, vaccine mandates find wide support across California. A large majority support allowing employers to mandate vaccines for employees. And it's not all that partisan: 4 in 10 Republicans are OK with this idea, too. There is strong support for making vaccines mandatory for health care workers, and a lot of support for letting businesses that draw crowds also mandate that their customers be vaccinated. Moreover, many people would be more willing to use or visit such a business. Support for mandates is even more prevalent among those fully vaccinated in California (which is on the higher end of state vaccination rates) and among them, support rises to the 80-plus percent range. The far fewer who say they won't get vaccinated are not supportive. While some Californians are expressing anger toward the unvaccinated, Newsom does get net positive marks among all Californians for his handling of the outbreak \u2014 though more calling it \"somewhat\" good than \"very\" good \u2014 and they tend to think his management has made things better than they might have otherwise have been. But that does not necessarily translate into an easy time against the recall effort. Newsom's political fate would clearly be in better shape if all registered voters turned out next month. But as of now, they don't all plan to vote. In fact, it's members of his own Democratic Party who are currently less motivated than Republicans to vote, setting up a high-stakes turnout and motivation contest for Newsom and the Democrats over the next month. Here's how it stands right now: In the preferences of all registered voters, \"no\" to the recall effort is eight points higher than \"yes\" to recall Newsom. But among the relatively smaller group of likely voters \u2014 which includes those who say they'll definitely vote and express the most motivation to actually do so \u2014 the contest shrinks to a four-point \"no\" edge for Newsom. Even looking at it by 2020 presidential vote, those who voted for former President Donald Trump are more apt to say they're \"very motivated\" to vote in this recall \u2014 by almost 20 points \u2014 than are those who backed President Biden. For those looking to oust Newsom, there's a mix of rationales: First is, unsurprisingly, a desire to oppose him, which is even higher than the partisan push to \"try to get a Republican into office.\" And about half of them are just \"trying to shake things up,\" which is not an uncommon political sentiment. For those who'd vote to keep him, it's support for Newsom personally, plus the overwhelming sentiment that there shouldn't be a recall in the first place. And most are also \"trying to stop a Republican from becoming governor.\" Nor is \"no\" doing overly well with many key constituencies that Democrats count on in California, for instance, white voters with college degrees aren't as definite about turning out as non-college, and Hispanic likely voters are split. If Newsom is in fact recalled, his replacement looks quite uncertain: a quarter (25%) of voters say they aren't sure, and another 20% pick \"no one\" to replace him. Together, these two groups comprise nearly half of likely voters. The \"no one\" group is boosted by a lot of Democrats who don't want Newsom recalled in the first place. Of the candidates who are selected, Republican Larry Elder (23%) is the leading choice, boosted by being the current top choice among Republicans, and 2020 Trump voters. Among all Californians, not just those voting in the recall, Newsom gets net positive marks for handling the wildfires and the economy, as well as race relations and climate change, and is lower on crime and homelessness, which are among Californians' top concerns. One reason they are top concerns, of course, is that the state is suffering through another wildfire season, and Californians more generally report feeling the impact of climate change in the state. Over a quarter of Californians (and more in rural areas) feel they, themselves, are at very high risk for fire, and over half feel at least some risk. That's not the only risk they feel. There's a lot of concern about drought: Two-thirds are feeling at least somewhat high risk. And most say they have felt the effects of extreme weather in their area, too. Given all of this, a large majority of Californians say they support state efforts that in recent years have tried to slow the effects of climate change, a view that cuts through party lines. This CBS News survey was fielded by YouGov with a representative sample of 1,856 California adult residents interviewed between August 6-12, 2021. This sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey, and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as 2020 Presidential vote.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Amid calls for his ouster and rumblings of invoking the 25th Amendment over the assault on the U.S. Capitol, President Trump plans to resume some official duties this week, including diplomatic outreach, transition activities and a planned trip to the U.S.-Mexico border, a senior administration official confirms to CBS News. As of Saturday, the plan remained for the administration to \"ride out\" the remaining 10 days left of Mr. Trump's tumultuous presidency. Three administration sources tell CBS News that Mr. Trump does not plan to resign, nor does he feel any pressure to do so. No plan to invoke the 25th Amendment has been formally presented to Vice President Mike Pence by the Cabinet, and removal through impeachment is not considered a viable option. However, the prospect of a second impeachment is frustrating to the president who, according to sources, has been talking to allies outside the White House about it in recent days. In the wake of the attack, Mr. Trump has given the silent treatment to his most deferential of allies: Pence. It has been nearly four days since Pence fled to a bunker Wednesday inside the Capitol to protect him from a pro-Trump mob, some of whom chanted \"hang Mike Pence.\" While Pence was sheltering in that bunker, the president did not call the vice president to check on his or his family's safety, according to a source close to the vice president. The two have not spoken since Wednesday. The president has said nothing in public to take the target off of Pence's back, a silence that is stinging to even the most loyal of Trump allies. The president's last public remark about his long-deferential vice president was a hate-tweet posted during the assault on Wednesday, in which Mr. Trump continued to propagate the false idea that Pence could overturn the election results instead of certifying them. Sources tell CBS News that Mr. Trump has privately acknowledged that the vice president got a \"bad deal.\" Yet the president still does not accept any responsibility for the violence on January 6, nor the underlying fact that the election was legitimate, the certification was inevitable and Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Peter Navarro and others were flat out wrong to tell him that Pence could take a different course of action. A number of close Trump advisers are lobbying the president to make some public remarks in the days ahead. The substance of what he might say is unclear.\u00a0 The public will see the president for the first time since the insurrection on Monday with remarks on big tech \"cancelling\" him after being permanently banned on Twitter and various other social media platforms. Mr. Trump will then appear at the border in Texas on Tuesday, a senior administration official confirmed, and he will resume some contact with Cabinet secretaries. The plan is for him to work with the Pentagon and Acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller on unspecified \"transition issues.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump is also scheduled to complete some final \"follow-up on the Abraham Accords,\" the September agreement formalizing diplomatic relations between Israel and two Gulf states. That diplomatic initiative is likely to involve son-in-law Jared Kushner, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who just returned from Israel, and potentially some foreign leaders. The contact with Mnuchin is notable, particularly since he openly discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment earlier this week with staff, as CBS News has reported.\u00a0 While Trump administration officials have largely remained silent this weekend, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the vice president are expected to make public remarks as soon as Monday. White House officials are keenly aware that foreign adversaries are exploiting the violence in the U.S. for use in their propaganda, and the national security team is monitoring potential threats. As CBS News reported on Thursday, no high-level national security officials are expected to resign. CNN has reported that White House Counsel Pat Cipollone was considering resigning. As of Saturday, he remained on the job.

            "article_content": "Former Georgia Republican Senator David Perdue launched his bid for governor of Georgia on Monday, setting up a high-stakes primary challenge against incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp.\u00a0 Perdue's decision comes just days after Democrat\u00a0Stacey Abrams announced her campaign\u00a0for governor, her second effort, after she lost to Kemp in 2018. Perdue's website went live late Sunday night and encouraged supporters to \"join our team to stop Stacey Abrams.\" In his announcement video on Monday, Perdue attacked Abrams and accused Kemp and Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of dividing the GOP in Georgia.\u00a0 \"To fight back we simply have to be united,\" Perdue said. \"Look, I like Brian. This isn't personal. It's simple. He has failed all of us and cannot win in November. Instead of protecting our elections, he caved to Abrams and cost us the Senate majority and gave Joe Biden free reign.\" The GOP gubernatorial primary is likely to be incredibly divisive in the key swing state. Former President Donald Trump railed against Kemp after Joe Biden won Georgia in the 2020 presidential election. Trump called for a strong primary challenger to enter the race and floated Perdue's name at a Georgia rally in September.\u00a0 \"Are you going to run for governor David Perdue?\" Trump said at the rally. \"He's a great guy and he loves this state.\" Trump said Monday in a statement that Kemp can't win the election, unless it \"is rigged, of course.\"\u00a0 \"I can't imagine that Brian Kemp, who has hurt election integrity in Georgia so badly, can do well at the ballot box,\" Trump said. \"He cost us two Senate seats and a Presidential victory in the Great State of Georgia.\" Later Monday, Trump issued an official endorsement of Perdue, saying it was \"great to see\" that Perdue had entered the race. Trump called Kemp a \"very weak governor\" and said \"he can't win because the MAGA base \u2014 which is enormous \u2014 will never vote for him.\" Kemp was widely praised by Republicans for signing a law that made sweeping changes to Georgia's election system earlier this year.\u00a0 Perdue is a wealthy businessman and a close ally of Trump. Perdue won his 2014 Senate race by pitching himself as an outsider, but lost his bid for reelection against Democrat Jon Ossoff in a runoff in January. He decided against making another run for the Senate earlier this year. \"I'm concerned about the state of our state,\" Perdue told a talk radio show in Georgia last month. \"We have a divided party in Georgia right now. Forget about me. It's divided. And a lot of people feel like the people in power haven't fought for them and caved in to a lot of things back in 2020 that didn't have to be done.\" The primary campaign will likely divide many Georgia Republicans ahead of the high-profile gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races in the state next year. Republicans are hoping for big wins in 2022 after Biden's victory in 2020 and Democrats flipped two U.S. Senate seats to gain control of the chamber.\u00a0 Former Georgia state representative Vernon Jones, who used to be a Democrat but switched parties, and educator Kandiss Taylor are also challenging Kemp.\u00a0 Kemp last week addressed the reports that Perdue was considering challenging him after initially planning to support the governor's reelection bid. \"All I know is what Senator Perdue has told me. I hope he'll be a man of his word, but again that's not anything I can control,\" Kemp said. In a statement on Sunday, Kemp campaign communications director Cody Hall said, \"Perdue's only reason for running is to soothe his own bruised ego.\" \"The man who lost Republicans the United States Senate and brought the last year of skyrocketing inflation, open borders, runaway government spending, and woke cancel culture upon the American people now wants to lose the Georgia governor's office to the national face of the radical left movement,\" Hall said. \"Governor Kemp has a proven track record of fighting the radical left to put hardworking Georgians first, while Perdue is best known for ducking debates, padding his stock portfolio during a pandemic, and losing winnable races.\"\u00a0 At a conference in Arizona last month, Republican Governors Association Chair Doug Ducey was asked about the potential Perdue primary challenge and said, \"the RGA is in the business, of course, of supporting our incumbents and ultimately electing Republican governors.\" Ducey added that decisions will be made \"race by race\" for how to use resources, but said that the RGA won't attack other Republicans.\u00a0 \"We don't fund losers. We don't fund landslides,\" Ducey said. \"The RGA follows the 11th commandment. We do not speak ill of another Republican.\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Kryvyi Rih, Ukraine \u2014 When the President of Ukraine invited CBS News to visit the front line in his country's war against Russian-backed separatists, we expected a quick trip in an armored motorcade to the muddy trenches that cut a bloody scar through the wheat fields of eastern Ukraine. We did not anticipate an informal breakfast \u2014 lard on rye bread, salmon sashimi, homemade cookies and shots of brandy \u2014 with President Volodymyr Zelensky and his elderly parents in their tiny, Soviet-era kitchen. The war in Ukraine has raged since 2014, when protests in the capital, Kyiv, toppled a government friendly to Moscow. Russia retaliated by sending troops across the border to seize control of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, and by backing a separatist insurgency in the east. The United Nations puts the death toll after seven years of war at more than 13,000. The U.S. has supported Zelenskyy's government with money, weapons and training. But the president told us what he really wants is America to back his country's bid to join NATO \u2014 a move that the U.S. fears could exacerbate tensions with Moscow. Just days before President Biden's summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, during which Ukraine will figure near the top of the agenda, we asked Zelensky why ordinary Americans should care about the conflict in his country, which is thousands of miles from their own. \"It can be tomorrow in their houses\" he told us.  That may sound far-fetched, but experts say Russian hackers are using Ukraine as a testing ground \u2014 including attacking its power grid \u2014 before employing similar tactics in the U.S. When tens of thousands of Russian troops massed at Ukraine's border earlier this year, some saw it as a move intended not only to scare an American ally, but as a threat to the United States and its allies. President Zelenskyy grew up in an era when Ukraine was part of the USSR, and he was raised in a Russian-speaking household. Part of his early years were spent in the Mongolian city of Erdenet which, at the time, was within the outer reaches of the Soviet empire. His father Oleksandr, a professor of computing, had been sent there to teach.  Like many Ukrainians, Zelenskyy believes that Vladimir Putin has neo-imperial ambitions for Russia, to control its neighbors once again.  \"They don't want to make us free\", he told CBS News. Zelenskyy started down his surprising path to the presidency as a comedian with his own production company. He played a fictional President of Ukraine, contending with corrupt oligarchs, in the wildly popular television series \"Servant of the People.\" It served as a springboard for his own, very real political career. One of Zelenskyy's top priorities in office has been combating widespread corruption. Over breakfast, Zelenskyy, an only child, told us that his parents were \"always\" worried about him since his election to Ukraine's top job.  In a country where corruption is endemic and Enemy No. 1 is the massive nuclear power next door, I asked the president's parents whether they preferred comedy or politics as a career path for their son.  \"Maybe comedy is more to my liking,\" replied his father, with a wry smile.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Republican Congressman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania said Tuesday that he will not comply with an information and meeting request from the House select committee investigating the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol.\u00a0 Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, sent Perry a letter on Monday asking him to voluntarily turn over information he has that would advance its investigation into the events of January 6 and former President Donald Trump's efforts to challenge the outcome of the 2020 presidential election in part by installing Jeffrey Clark, a Justice Department official, as acting attorney general. The committee also requested Perry provide any communications with Trump, his legal team and others involved in planning the events of January 6 and asked him to meet with panel investigators in the coming days. \"The select committee has tremendous respect for the prerogatives of Congress and the privacy of its members,\" the Mississippi Democrat said in his letter to Perry. \"At the same time, we have a solemn responsibility to investigate fully all of these facts and circumstances.\" But Perry, the incoming chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, indicated in a pair of tweets that he will not be cooperating with the select committee, which he said is \"illegitimate\" and \"not duly constituted\" under the rules of the House. \"I decline this entity's request and will continue to fight the failures of the radical Left who desperately seek distraction from their abject failures of crushing inflation, a humiliating surrender in Afghanistan, and the horrendous crisis they created at our border,\" the Pennsylvania Republican tweeted.\u00a0 (1/2) I stand with immense respect for our Constitution, the Rule of Law, and the Americans I represent who know that this entity is illegitimate, and not duly constituted under the rules of the US House of Representatives. (2//2) I decline this entity\u2019s request and will continue to fight the failures of the radical Left who desperately seek distraction from their abject failures of crushing inflation, a humiliating surrender in Afghanistan, and the horrendous crisis they created at our border. A spokesperson for the House select committee said in a statement that Perry has information that is \"directly relevant\" to its probe. \"While he says that he respects the Constitution and rule of law, he fails to note that multiple federal courts, acting pursuant to Article 3 of our Constitution, have already rejected the former president's claims that the committee lacks an appropriate legislative purpose,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Select Committee prefers to gather relevant evidence from members cooperatively, but if members with directly relevant information decline to cooperate and instead endeavor to cover up, the Select Committee will consider seeking such information using other tools.\" Perry, who led the objection to the counting of Pennsylvania's electoral votes, emerged as a figure in an investigation from the Senate Judiciary Committee that examined Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the presidential election.\u00a0 According to a report issued by the Senate committee in October, Perry introduced Clark to Trump and the three met in the Oval Office on December 23. The committee also found Perry called Richard Donoghue, a senior Justice Department official, at Trump's behest on December 27 to discuss baseless claims of voter fraud in Pennsylvania, and referenced Clark during the call. The Senate Judiciary panel found Clark urged Justice Department leaders to intervene in Georgia's elections and drafted a letter calling for the Georgia legislature to consider appointing a new slate of presidential electors, though top department officials rejected Clark's proposal. Thompson said in his letter to Perry that the January 6 select committee received evidence from \"multiple witnesses\" that he played an \"important role in efforts to install\" Clark as acting attorney general. The panel found Perry also communicated with Mark Meadows, former White House chief of staff, about Clark through text and Signal, an encrypted messaging app, Thompson wrote. Clark himself has been a target of the select committee's investigation and received a subpoena from the panel for records and testimony in September. House investigators believe Clark used his position as a high-level Justice Department official to support Trump's efforts to challenge the outcome of the presidential election. The select committee in December voted to recommend Clark be held in contempt of Congress for defying the subpoena, though Clark told the panel he plans to invoke his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination in anticipation of a deposition before he committee. It's unclear whether the January 6 panel will move to subpoena Perry following his decision not to cooperate with their probe voluntarily. Investigators have so far issued at least 50 subpoenas for documents and testimony from a slew of individuals and groups tied to the January 6 assault, including top White House and Trump campaign aides. The full House has voted to hold two people \u2014 Meadows and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon \u2014 in contempt of Congress for defying subpoenas from the select committee. Bannon was charged with two counts of criminal contempt of Congress last month. Nikole Killion contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced suddenly on Friday that his government would repeal three controversial farm laws that have seen hundreds of thousands of farmers stage year-long protests in the country. The government had refused to budge for months, insisting the\u00a0three laws\u00a0passed by the parliament in September last year would help deregulate the country's agriculture sector by allowing farmers to sell their produce directly to private players at a market price.\u00a0 The farmers argued that the new laws would only benefit large corporations, however, and expose the millions of small-share farmers to a much greater risk of exploitation. Several rounds of talks between the government and farmers failed to resolve the crisis, which has been among the most serious challenges to Modi's administration. The premier announced the change in tack during a live TV address to the nation, which was announced at the last minute on Friday morning.  He insisted the laws were meant to benefit the farmers and blamed the backlash on his government's failure to explain how the deregulation would work.\u00a0 \"While apologizing to the nation, I want to say with a sincere and pure heart that maybe something was lacking in our dedication that we could not explain the truth,\" Modi said. \"But despite several attempts to explain the benefits to the farmers, we have failed\u2026 The government has decided to repeal the three farm laws.\" Farmers and advocacy groups backing them celebrated the government's U-turn as a huge victory after a long standoff, but opposition politicians said important elections looming in the heavily-agricultural provinces of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, where most of the protesting farmers came from, were really behind Modi's about-face.  What cannot be achieved by democratic protests can be achieved by the fear of impending elections! PM\u2019s announcement on the withdrawal of the three farm laws is not inspired by a change of policy or a change of heart. It is impelled by fear of elections! \"What cannot be achieved by democratic protests can be achieved by the fear of impending elections!\" said Palaniappan Chidambaram, a senior member of the opposition Indian National Congress party and a former finance minister of India, in a tweet. Modi's announcement, he said, was \"not inspired by a change of policy or a change of heart. It is impelled by fear of elections!\" \"The country's farmers have defeated arrogance with their struggle,\" said Rahul Gandhi, the Congress party leader. Leaders of the farmers' groups vowed that the protests would continue until the government completely repeals the laws during the upcoming winter session of parliament, but the jubilation wouldn't wait. Indian TV channels showed farmers celebrating across the country.\u00a0 Thousands of farmers have camped around the borders of the capital city of New Delhi since last November, and major protests have been held in other states, too, including Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh \u2013 all major agricultural regions.\u00a0 The protests continued through a deadly second wave of coronavirus infections in the country over the summer.  Over the course of the year, dozens of farmers died at the makeshift camps due to exposure to the summer heat, the winter cold, and COVID-19.  While the protests remained largely peaceful, hundreds of people were injured in a few\u00a0violent clashes\u00a0between the farmers and police.\u00a0Celebrities, including singer Rihanna and climate activist Greta Thunberg, spoke out in support of the farmers over the year. India's agriculture sector makes up almost 15% of its $2.9 trillion economy, but it has suffered a downturn in recent years amid outdated laws and climate change-fueled droughts and flooding. The circumstances have pushed thousands of\u00a0debt-ridden farmers to suicide. More than 10,000 Indian farmers died by suicide in 2019 alone, according to government\u00a0data.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Gunmen on motorcycles attacked a group of civilians returning from market day in a volatile corner of Niger, leaving at least 58 people dead and then burning granaries to the ground, the government said Tuesday. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's massacres, though extremists belonging to the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara group are known to be active in the Tillaberi region where the villages were attacked. The victims were returning home from a large livestock market in Banibangou, near Niger's troubled border with Mali. The suspected extremists also destroyed nearby granaries that held valuable food stores. The announcement was read on Niger state television Tuesday evening by government spokesman Abdourahmane Zakaria, who declared three days of national mourning for the victims. Monday's attacks underscore the enormous security challenges facing Niger's new president, Mohamed Bazoum, who won the election in late February to succeed outgoing leader Mahamadou Issoufou. Not only are jihadis active in the Tillaberi region, but the counterterrorism offensives against those extremists have helped give rise to ethnic militias, analysts say. Intercommunal tensions have been exacerbated as a result, particularly near the border between Mali and Niger. Monday's attack echoed a January massacre that left 100 people dead in two villages also in the Tillaberi region that hadn't been claimed by any extremist group or militia. Extremists staged mass attacks on Niger's military in the Tillaberi region, killing more than 70 in December 2019 and more than 89 in January 2020. It's near the area where four U.S. Special Forces soldiers were killed along with five Nigerien colleagues in 2017.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump told the Republican Party's top donors on Saturday night that he's optimistic about the GOP's chances for success in the 2022 midterms and to recapture the White House in 2024, according to prepared remarks obtained by CBS News. Mr. Trump did not say whether he would be on the ticket in that election, but he twice teased a potential candidacy, according to an attendee at his speech.\u00a0 \"I stand before you this evening filled with confidence that in 2022, we are going to take back the House and we are going to reclaim the Senate \u2014 and then in 2024, a Republican candidate is going to win the White House,\" Mr. Trump's prepared remarks said.\u00a0 The former president, though, often deviated from the script during his nearly hour-long speech, according to an attendee at the event. Mr. Trump again took aim at Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who blasted Mr. Trump following his acquittal in his second impeachment trial, calling McConnell a \"total stone cold loser.\" Mr. Trump also brought up McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, who was transportation secretary during the Trump administration, saying, \"I hired his wife, did he ever say thank you?\" And Mr. Trump painted the Republican Party as weak under McConnell's leadership on the issue of election certification. \"If that were Schumer instead of this dumb son of a b**** Mitch McConnell they would never allow it to happen. They would have fought it,\" Mr. Trump said, according to a source. Mr. Trump again complained about fraud in the 2020 election during his speech, according to a source.\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reported that the former president said he was \"disappointed\" in former Vice President Mike Pence for confirming the results of the 2020 election. Mr. Trump and his allies lost more than 60 court cases after the November election and his own\u00a0attorney general\u00a0said there was no evidence of fraud at a level that \"could have affected a different outcome in the election.\" The former president's speech was the keynote address of the Republican National Committee's spring donor retreat. The event brought the GOP's top donors to South Florida over the weekend to discuss the party's future and plot a path toward recapturing Congress in 2022 and the White House in 2024.\u00a0 The key to that success, according to Mr. Trump's prepared remarks, is to \"build on the gains our amazing movement has made over the past four years.\" He highlighted the new voters that he brought into the GOP and stressed that his populist \"America First\" message will help the party continue to grow. The former president also took shots at President Biden over various policies the current administration has implemented that Mr. Trump feels have unwound his work in areas such as energy policy and border security.\u00a0 The closed-press weekend retreat also featured appearances from potential 2024 candidates, including Senators Tom Cotton and Rick Scott and Governors Ron DeSantis and Kristi Noem. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senators Lindsey Graham, Ron Johnson and Marco Rubio and former counselor to President Trump Kellyanne Conway also spoke or were featured on panels. Some of the panels during the retreat focused on issues such as party unity, growing the GOP and big tech censorship.\u00a0 Mr. Trump and other speakers at the retreat skewered corporations over recent political activism, particularly those that spoke against Georgia's new voting bill. During a reception on Friday night, Cotton took aim at companies who spoke out against the bill while still maintaining ties to China, according to a source familiar with his remarks.\u00a0 \"Major League Baseball and massive corporations like Delta and Coca-Cola are boycotting an entire state for passing voter ID laws,\" Cotton told donors. \"To those corporations, I say this: if you're silent about the Chinese Communist Party's genocide while begging for their business, don't start lecturing Americans about voter ID.\" The donor conference came as the GOP continues to navigate its next steps with the 2022 midterm elections inching closer. While some party leaders distanced themselves a bit from Mr. Trump following the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, the former president's prime speaking spot during this retreat, and bringing the event partly to his Mar-a-Lago golf club, indicates many in the GOP believe he needs to play a role in the party's future. \"Palm Beach is the new political power center, and President Trump is the Republican Party's best messenger,\" said senior Trump aide Jason Miller.\u00a0 The former president had a strained relationship with the party's fundraising apparatus in late February and early March, but that appears to be resolved. During his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, Mr. Trump encouraged activists to give to his political action committee, Save America.\u00a0 In March, he clashed with the RNC and other GOP committees over using his name and likeness for fundraising. In a statement issued on March 9, Mr. Trump indicated he fully supported \"the Republican Party and important GOP Committees, but I do not support RINOs,\" an acronym for \"Republican in name only.\" Mar-a-Lago has been a frequent destination for Republicans to fundraise or meet with the former president. Former White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is running for governor in Arkansas, was among the latest to hold an event at the club this weekend. McCarthy and other top Republicans have visited the former president at his club.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has been rolling out some endorsements, mostly to incumbents, but this week weighed in on his first open Senate primary when he endorsed Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks, who was an early advocate of objecting to the Electoral College results. In his statement endorsing Brooks, Mr. Trump wrote that Brooks \"is fighting for voter integrity (like few others).\" The former president has also endorsed Sanders in her gubernatorial bid and former aide Max Miller, who is running against Ohio GOP Representative Anthony Gonzalez \u2014 one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach the former president.\u00a0 CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Naypyitaw, Myanmar \u2014 Myanmar's military-run television network announced on Monday that the military had taken control of the country for one year, confirming that days of mounting concern over a looming coup were well founded. Many of the country's senior politicians, including Aung San Suu Kyi, were detained.\u00a0 The takeover was quickly condemned and labelled a coup by European leaders, while the newly sworn-in administration of President Joe Biden in Washington expressed \"grave concern\" and called on the military to restore the democratically elected leaders \"immediately.\" CBS News Asia correspondent Ramy Inocencio managed to get in touch with a friend in the country's biggest city of Yangon despite most lines of communication being cut by the military. The friend told Inocencio that people were panic buying food and rushing to ATMs to try to get their money out as the military rulers halted all flights in the country and closed banks.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 A presenter on Myanmar's military-owned Myawaddy TV announced the takeover and cited a section of the military-drafted constitution that allows the military to take control in times of national emergency. He said the takeover was in part due to the government's failure to act on the military's claims of voter fraud in last November's election and its failure to postpone the election because of the coronavirus crisis. The military said it would hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency and hand power to the winner. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party won a landslide victory in last November's general election, humiliating the military-backed opposition Union Solidarity and Development Party. The military TV report said Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing would be in charge of the country, while Vice President Myint Swe would be elevated to acting president. Myint Swe is a former general best known for leading a brutal crackdown on Buddhist monks in 2007. He is a close ally of former junta leader Than Shwe.\u00a0 Very disturbing news that what many have feared is indeed unfolding in Myanmar. Communications lines are down so, by design, communication is difficult. But apparently the State Counselor and many others have been detained by the military. Outrageous. Later Monday the military-run TV network said the generals in charge of the country had removed a total of 24 government ministers and deputy ministers and replaced them with 11 hand-picked replacements. The new appointees included ministers for finance, health, information, foreign affairs, defense, border control and internal affairs.\u00a0 The announcements and declaration of the state of emergency followed days of concern about the threat of a military coup \u2014 and military denials that it would stage one \u2014 and came on the morning the country's new Parliament session was to begin. Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy urged Myanmar's people to oppose Monday's \"coup\" and any return to \"military dictatorship.\" The statement posted to Suu Kyi's Facebook page said the military's actions were unjustified and went against the constitution and the will of voters.  The takeover was a sharp reversal of the partial yet significant progress toward democracy Myanmar made in recent years following five decades of military rule and international isolation that began in 1962. It would also be shocking fall from power for Suu Kyi, who led the democracy struggle despite years under house arrest and won a Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts. NEW: Myanmar military declares *one year state of emergency,* alleges election fraud in November's parliamentary elex -- where Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy pummeled Tatmadaw (army) party in landslide. Election commission rejects army claim. @CBSNews is here.\ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddf2 The military's actions brought rapid and widespread international condemnation.   New U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken issued a statement expressing \"grave concern and alarm\" over the reported detentions.  \"We call on Burmese military leaders to release all government officials and civil society leaders and respect the will of the people of Burma as expressed in democratic elections,\" he wrote, using Myanmar's former name. \"The United States stands with the people of Burma in their aspirations for democracy, freedom, peace, and development. The military must reverse these actions immediately.\"\u00a0 The office of the U.N. Secretary-General was among those to issue a statement condemning the developments as a \"serious blow to democratic reforms.\" I strongly condemn the coup in #Myanmar and call on the military to release all who have been unlawfully detained in raids across the country. The outcome of the elections has to be respected and democratic process needs to be restored. United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet issued a statement saying she was \"gravely concerned about the situation in Myanmar following the removal of the civilian Government and the arbitrary detention of dozens of political leaders, human rights defenders, journalists, activists and others by the military today,\" and echoing the U.N. chief's call for the military commanders to respect the outcome of the elections. In Brussels, the President of the European Union's European Council, Charles Michel, issued a statement strongly condemning \"the coup in Myanmar,\" and calling on the military to \"release all who have been unlawfully detained in raids across the country.\" \"The outcome of the elections has to be respected and democratic process needs to be restored,\" he said. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen echoed the condemnation and insisted on Twitter that \"the legitimate civilian government must be restored.\"\u00a0 I condemn the coup and unlawful imprisonment of civilians, including Aung San Suu Kyi, in Myanmar. The vote of the people must be respected and civilian leaders released. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also condemned \"the coup and unlawful imprisonment of civilians, including Aung San Suu Kyi,\" by Myanmar's military. The detention of the politicians and cuts in television signals and communication services on Monday were the first signs that plans to seize power were in motion. Phone and internet access to Naypyitaw were lost. Phone service in other parts of the country was also reported down, though people were still able to use the internet in many areas.  The Irrawaddy, an established online news service, reported that Suu Kyi, who as state counsellor is the nation's top leader, and the country's president, Win Myint, were both detained in the pre-dawn hours. The news service cited Myo Nyunt, a spokesman for the NLD.   Its report said that the party's Central Executive Committee members, lawmakers and regional Cabinet members had also been taken into custody. A list of other people believed to have been detained, compiled by political activists who asked not to be named for security reasons, included filmmaker Min Htin Ko Ko Gyi, writer Maung Thar Cho, and prominent veterans of the country's 1988 student protest movement such as Ko Ko Gyi and Min Ko Naing. Their detention could not immediately be confirmed. As word of the military's actions spread in Yangon, the country's biggest city, there was a growing sense of unease among residents who earlier in the day had still been packed into cafes for breakfast and had been doing their morning shopping. People were removing the bright red flags of Suu Kyi's party that once adorned their homes and businesses. Lines formed at ATMs as people waited to take out cash, efforts that were being complicated by internet disruptions. Workers at some businesses decided to go home. NEW: From Yangon, reaction on #Myanmar coup reports. Fast chat w/ old friend before he rushed off: 1/ \u201cPhone lines are down. I think internet will be down soon.\u201d People nervous? \u201cVery. Panic buying. All prominent figures are being seized one after another.\u201d @CBSNews is here. \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddf2 Monday's parliamentary session was to be the first since last year's election, as tension lingered over recent comments by the military that were widely seen as threatening a coup. The 2008 constitution, drafted and implemented during military rule, has a clause that says in case there is a national emergency, the president in coordination with the military-dominated National Defense and Security Council can issue an emergency decree to hand over the government's executive, legislative and judicial powers to the military's commander-in-chief.  The clause had been described by New York-based Human Rights Watch as a \"coup mechanism in waiting.\"  It is just one of many parts of the charter that ensured the military could maintain ultimate control over the country at the expense of elected politicians. The military also was guaranteed 25% of seats in Parliament and control of several key ministries, especially those involved in security and defense.  The 75-year-old Suu Kyi is by far the country's most popular politician, and became the country's de facto leader after her party won 2015 elections, though the constitution barred her from being president. She had been a fierce antagonist of the army during her time under house arrest. Nevertheless, once in power, Suu Kyi had to balance her relationship with the country's generals and even went on the international stage to defend their crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in the country's west, a campaign the U.S. and others have labeled genocide. That has left her international reputation in tatters.  She remains wildly popular at home, where most supported the campaign against the Rohingya. Suu Kyi's party captured 396 out of 476 seats in the combined lower and upper houses of Parliament in last November's polls.  The military, known as the Tatmadaw, has charged that there was massive voting fraud in the election, though it has failed to provide proof. The state Union Election Commission last week rejected its allegations.",

            "article_content": "Texas Republicans advanced a slate of proposed new voting restrictions Thursday that would reduce options to cast ballots, limit polling hours and hand more power to partisan poll watchers. All those efforts are rolled into a single bill that cleared the GOP-controlled state Senate \u2014 a key marker in a campaign by Republicans, including Gov. Greg Abbott, to impose new restrictive measures over elections in America's biggest red state. A first vote on the Senate bill was slowed by hours of questioning by Democrats that spilled overnight into early Thursday morning. The measure eventually passed 18-13 in a vote along party lines. It comes after an elections overhaul was signed into law last week in Georgia, where opponents have already filed lawsuits and are calling for boycotts of corporations that are silent on restrictive voting measures. Critics of the Texas legislation say the efforts particularly target expanded access put into place during last year's election in Harris County, which is home to more than 2 million voters, controlled by Democrats and a key Texas battleground that includes Houston. One measure would eliminate drive-thru voting, which more than 127,000 people around Houston used during early voting last year. More than half of those voters were Black, Latino or Asian, said Democratic state Sen. Carol Alvarado. \"Hearing all of that, who are you really targeting when you're trying to get rid of drive-thru voting?\" she said. Republicans rejected accusations that the bill was designed to suppress turnout. \"None of what we've discussed is voter suppression. And none of what we've discussed is Jim Crow,\" Republican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt said. A similar measure in the House chamber could advance toward a full vote as soon as Thursday. The bill is one of two major voting packages in Texas that mirrors a nationwide campaign by Republicans after former President Donald Trump made false claims about election fraud. Voting rights groups say the measures would disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minority voters. In Texas, which already has some of the strictest voting laws in the U.S., the proposed legislation grants more power to partisan poll watchers and eliminates the option to cast a ballot via drive-thru. The bill also includes a provision requiring a doctor's note for people with disabilities who want to vote by mail, although Republicans signaled during the debate that language could change. Trump won Texas but by fewer than 6 points. It was the closest victory by any GOP presidential nominee in Texas since 1996, underscoring Republicans' loosening iron grip on the state. The Senate bill cleared a committee last week following hours of testimony by voters. Some said the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is forcing them to choose between their health and their right to be heard by their government after weighing the risk of testifying on the bill in-person at the Texas capitol, where masks are not enforced. Ofelia Alonso, 25, a volunteer with civil rights advocacy group Texas Rising and volunteer deputy registrar, said Friday she drove hundreds of miles from Cameron County along the U.S.-Mexico border, which has been hit extremely hard by COVID-19, to testify in Austin for the members of her community who couldn't afford the health risk. \"Honestly, because we all work doing voter registration, we know how nonsensical this bill is,\" Alonso said. \"It makes absolutely no sense to criminalize people for wanting to participate in democracy, which should be our goal. It is almost like Texans get punished for coming out and voting in large numbers.\"",

            "article_content": "Conakry, Guinea\u00a0\u2014 Mutinous soldiers in the West African nation of Guinea detained President Alpha Conde on Sunday after hours of heavy gunfire rang out near the presidential palace in the capital, then announced on state television that the government had been dissolved in an apparent coup d'etat. The country's borders were closed and its constitution was declared invalid in the announcement read aloud on state television by army Col. Mamadi Doumbouya, who told Guineans: \"The duty of a soldier is to save the country.\" \"We will no longer entrust politics to one man. We will entrust it to the people,\" said Doumbouya, draped in a Guinean flag with about a half dozen other soldiers flanked at his side.\u00a0 It was not immediately known, though, how much support Doumbouya had within the military or whether other soldiers loyal to the president of more than a decade might attempt to wrest back control. The junta later announced plans to replace Guinea's governors with regional commanders at an event Monday and warned: \"Any refusal to appear will be considered rebellion\" against the country's new military leaders. The West African regional bloc known as ECOWAS quickly condemned the developments, threatening sanctions if Conde was not immediately released. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tweeted that he strongly condemned \"any takeover of the government by force of the gun.\" The U.S. State Department warned against violence and urged authorities in Guinea to avoid \"extra-constitutional\" actions that \"will only erode Guinea's prospects for peace, stability, and prosperity.\" Spokesman Ned Price added in a statement that the junta's \"actions could limit the ability of the United States and Guinea's other international partners to support the country.\" Conde's whereabouts had been unknown for hours after the intense fighting Sunday in downtown Conakry until a video emerged showing the 83-year-old leader tired and disheveled in military custody.\u00a0 The junta later released a statement saying Conde was in contact with his doctors. But they gave no timeline for releasing him other than to do say: \"Everything will be fine. When the time comes, we will issue a statement.\" Conde, in power for more than a decade, had seen his popularity plummet since he sought a third term last year, saying that term limits did not apply to him. Sunday's dramatic developments underscored how dissent had mounted within the military as well.\u00a0 Doumbouya, who had been the commander of the army's special forces unit, called on other soldiers \"to put themselves on the side of the people\" and stay in their barracks. The army colonel said he was acting in the best interests of the nation, citing a lack of economic progress by leaders since the country gained independence from France in 1958. \"If you see the state of our roads, if you see the state of our hospitals, you realize that after 72 years, it's time to wake up,\" he said. \"We have to wake up.\" Observers, though say the tensions between Guinea's president and the army colonel stemmed from a recent proposal to cut some military salaries. On Sunday morning, heavy gunfire broke out near the presidential palace and went on for hours, sparking fears in a nation that already has seen multiple coups and presidential assassination attempts. The Defense Ministry initially claimed that the attack had been repelled by security forces, but uncertainty grew when there was no subsequent sign of Conde on state television or radio. The developments that followed closely mirrored other military coup d'etats in West Africa: The army colonel and his colleagues seized control of the airwaves, professing their commitment to democratic values and announcing their name: The National Committee for Rally and Development. It was a dramatic setback for Guinea, where many had hoped the country had turned the page on military power grabs. Conde's 2010 election victory \u2014 the country's first democratic vote ever \u2014 was supposed to be a fresh start for a country that had been mired by decades of corrupt, authoritarian rule and political turmoil. In the years since, though, opponents said Conde too failed to improve the lives of Guineans, most of whom live in poverty despite the country's vast mineral riches of bauxite and gold. The year after his first election he narrowly survived an assassination attempt after gunmen surrounded his home overnight and pounded his bedroom with rockets. Rocket-propelled grenades landed inside the compound and one of his bodyguards was killed. Violent street demonstrations broke out last year after Conde organized a referendum to modify the constitution. The unrest intensified after he won the October election, and the opposition said dozens were killed during the crisis. In neighboring Senegal, which has a large diaspora of Guineans who opposed Conde, news of his political demise was met with relief. \"President Alpha Conde deserves to be deposed. He stubbornly tried to run for a third term when he had no right to do so,\" said Malick Diallo, a young Guinean shopkeeper in the suburbs of Dakar. \"We know that a coup d'etat is not good,\" said Mamadou Saliou Diallo, another Guinean living in Senegal. \"A president must be elected by democratic vote. But we have no choice. We have a president who is too old, who no longer makes Guineans dream and who does not want to leave power.\" Guinea has had a long history of political instability. In 1984, Lansana Conte took control of the country after the first post-independence leader died. He remained in power for a quarter century until his death in 2008, accused of siphoning off state coffers to enrich his family and friends. The country's second coup soon followed, putting army Capt. Moussa \"Dadis\" Camara in charge. During his rule, security forces opened fire on demonstrators at a stadium in Conakry who were protesting his plans to run for president. Human rights groups have said more than 150 people were killed and at least 100 women were raped. Camara later went into exile after surviving an assassination attempt, and a transitional government organized the landmark 2010 election won by Conde.",

            "article_content": "A month after Democrats\u00a0lost the Virginia governor's race and just squeaked out a victory in New Jersey, they're trying to retool their message on \"kitchen table\" issues and working to tout the benefits voters will reap from President Biden's agenda, as they prepare for 36 governor's races in 2022. They're shying away from the topic of former President Donald Trump, after years relying on him to motivate Democratic voters to get to the polls. That approach flopped with swing voters in Virginia, who helped elect Republican Glenn Youngkin to be the state's next governor. \"We've got to find our way into more kitchen tables. We have to get into the conversations at night that families are having about what government does, what it means to them, to make it less abstract and more real,\" said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, who won his reelection in New Jersey by 3.3%, a figure he admitted was tighter than he expected it would be. Democrats have been battered by the political headwinds from Mr. Biden's falling approval ratings, an uncertain economy with high inflation and the threat posed by constantly new COVID-19 variants. But they're still optimistic that progress on his agenda, particularly the infrastructure bill, could yield tangible results incumbent governors and Democratic candidates will be able to point to when the campaign season heats up. \"The policies that the Biden administration has been able to help implement, are really going to be hitting the streets here in the next few months and years,\" said North Carolina Governor and chair of the Democratic Governors Association Roy Cooper. \"And the president, his administration and other Democrats will benefit significantly because of that.\" Cooper, who was speaking at the group's annual policy and fundraising meeting in New Orleans, said incumbents and candidates need to focus on the direct impact they can have on voters' lives through childcare, healthcare or education, and point to what they've done to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats are defending 16 governor's seats in 2022. They're anticipating incumbents in Kansas, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine, Minnesota and New Mexico will face the most competitive races. In these seven states, Mr. Biden had a similar or smaller margin of victory than he did in Virginia. Trump won Kansas by about 15 points in 2020, by slightly less than in 2016. \"The Biden agenda consists of unpopular, job-killing government mandates, a self-created humanitarian and security crisis at the border, and nearly 40-year high inflation that's causing real American wages to go down,\" said Republican Governors Association spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez. \"If that's the agenda Democrat governors are confident leaning into, we're all for it. It'll make our win in Virginia look like child's play.\" In Virginia Democratic candidate and former governor Terry McAuliffe's race for a second term this year, he tied his GOP opponent Glenn Youngkin to Trump\u00a0at every opportunity, trying to motivate the base in a state Trump lost by 10 points. Cooper didn't rule out using Trump as a voting issue, but said it would depend on the political makeup of the state, and on whether Trump is involved in a GOP primary. In any case, he would not be the main\u00a0 focus. There are 11 Republican incumbent governors facing primary challenges. No incumbent Democrat faces a notable challenger. In states Democrats are targeting, Trump is backing challengers or candidates more aligned with his brand, rather than any in the mold of a Youngkin. In fact, in a couple of states Trump is creating headaches for his party because he's backing challengers to Republican incumbents or preferred mainstream GOP candidates.\u00a0 Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is facing a primary challenge from former Senator David Perdue, who was encouraged to run by the former president. In Arizona's open race, Trump has backed former news anchor Kari Lake, who called his backing \"the most powerful endorsement in the history of politics.\" In Massachusetts, Trump is backing former Republican state representative Geoff Diehl against popular Republican Governor Charlie Baker, before he announced he wouldn't seek a third term. Democrats now see the heavily Democratic state as their most likely pickup.\u00a0 \"They're at war with themselves and they're doing it very well,\" Cooper said of Republican incumbents facing challengers. \"If one of Trump's candidates is nominated or beats an incumbent Republican governor, I think that's news. I just don't think it needs to be the central focus. I don't mean to say you would ignore [Trump], because you can't. But what you can do is continue to focus on your issues.\" He added that Trump's continued focus on the 2020 election, as well as the movement of Republican state legislators pushing for further restrictions on voting, is \"deeply concerning\" but that it falls into a bucket of \"political process\" issues that aren't top of mind for voters. \"We cannot ignore Trump because he's obviously trying to support people who will believe what he wants them to believe,\" he added.\u00a0 After McAuliffe's loss in Virginia, Democrats are also adjusting their approach to education. Cooper said his party has to acknowledge the frustration of parents who have dealt with the difficulties and stress of a year of virtual learning for their children at home, often while they were also working remotely. He pointed to more investments in schools to address learning loss, such as summer school. Cooper thinks that shortcomings in Democrats' handling of that issue also\u00a0fueled Youngkin's win.\u00a0 \"Parents obviously do, and should, have input in what their children do in school,\" he said.\u00a0 Abortion may also emerge as an issue, too, since the Supreme Court's blockbuster decision on Mississippi's abortion case is expected to be issued in June or July, in the middle of the campaign. Several Democratic governors call themselves the \"last line of defense\" for abortion rights and are preparing for the possibility that the landmark case giving women the right to have an abortion, Roe v. Wade, could be overturned.\u00a0 Should that happen, the right to have an abortion would be decided individually by each state. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has called for the repeal of an old state law that criminalizes abortion, and Wisconsin's Tony Evers has vetoed multiple bills that would place limits on abortions.\u00a0 But the best way for Democrats to motivate their voters to show up is still an open question for the party. The DGA attributed the high Republican turnout to an \"ecosystem of disinformation\" with right-wing news outlets inflaming Republican partisans and noted that Democrats don't have an equivalent method to drive their voters to the polls.\u00a0 For now, Cooper believes Biden's agenda is popular enough for Democratic governors to run on, and wants Democrats in Washington to continue \"getting things done and worry about messaging later.\" \"It's that old adage of you got to tell people what you're going to do, tell them that you're doing it and then tell them that you did it. We've got to do all three pieces of that,\" added DGA political director Marshall Cohen. \"If people don't know what you've actually done then you can't really blame the other side for not being involved.\" Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Biden administration issued a wide range of sanctions against Russia on Thursday in retaliation for recent incursions including the SolarWinds cyber espionage campaign and Moscow's interference in the 2020 presidential election. \"We cannot allow a foreign power to interfere in our democratic process with impunity,\" President Biden said in remarks announcing the sanctions on Thursday. He said he \"was clear with President Putin that we could have gone further,\" and that wanted a \"stable, predictable relationship\" with Russia. \"Now is the time to de-escalate,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Where there's an interest for the United States to work with Russia, we should and we will.\" However, Mr. Biden was clear that any acts of aggression by Russia would be met with a proportional response. The president said that U.S. officials were working with Russian officials to possibly set up a summit with Mr. Biden and Putin in a third location. The sanctions target more than 30 Russian entities and include the expulsion of at least 10 Russian individuals from the U.S., including intelligence officials and diplomats. The administration also issued an executive order barring U.S. financial institutions from purchasing ruble-denominated bonds beginning in June of 2021, according to a White House fact sheet. \"The Biden administration has been clear that the United States desires a relationship with Russia that is stable and predictable,\" the White House said. \"We do not think that we need to continue on a negative trajectory. However, we have also been clear \u2014 publicly and privately \u2014 that we will defend our national interests and impose costs for Russian Government actions that seek to harm us.\" Administration officials have vowed for weeks to exact costs from Moscow. In a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, President Biden said the U.S. would \"act firmly\" in defense of its national interests while proposing a summit with the Russian leader to discuss a \"full range of issues.\" The White House also said it was responding to reports that Russia encouraged Taliban fighters to injure or kill coalition forces in Afghanistan. \"Given the sensitivity of this matter, which involves the safety and well-being of our forces, it is being handled through diplomatic, military and intelligence channels,\" the White House statement said. Reports of the alleged bounties on U.S. troops prompted many questions and criticisms of the last administration about what former President Donald Trump knew and how he would respond. But the White House last year said that Mr. Trump wasn't briefed on the reported intelligence because it had not been verified. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday the intelligence community assessed with \"low to moderate confidence\" that Russian intelligence officers sought to encourage attacks on U.S. and coalition forces by the Taliban in Afghanistan, in part because the intelligence relied on detainee reporting and due to the \"challenging operating environment in Afghanistan.\" \"We felt the reports were enough of a cause of concern that we wanted the intelligence community to look into those reports as a part of this overall assessment,\" she said. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday that during their call, Mr. Biden informed Putin the U.S. was about to respond to cyber intrusions and election interference by Russia. Sullivan summarized Mr. Biden's comments to Putin as, \"He said, 'I told you that I was going to look into this, I made a determination that Russia has, in fact, conducted these actions. And I'm a man of my word, I am going to respond. But I'm not looking to escalate, I'm looking to provide proportionate responses. And I believe that it is in our interest to find a stable and predictable way forward in this relationship.'\" According to an unclassified report from the U.S. intelligence community, Putin authorized influence campaigns aimed at hurting Mr. Biden's candidacy during the 2020 election and boost former President Donald Trump. \"A key element of Moscow's strategy this election cycle was its use of proxies linked to Russian intelligence to push influence narratives \u2014 including misleading or unsubstantiated allegations against President Biden \u2014 to U.S. media organizations, U.S. officials, and prominent U.S. individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration,\" the declassified report released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence   stated.\u00a0 Last year, cybersecurity researchers identified a hack of a piece of software called SolarWinds \u2014 an intrusion that initially gave cyber criminals access to 18,000 government and private computer networks, though a much smaller number were the actual targets of espionage, according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Hackers gained access to digital files of several U.S. government agencies, including the Treasury, Justice and State Departments. The National Security Agency, FBI and CISA formally attributed the attack to Russia on Thursday, saying the country's Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, directed the intrusions. A joint advisory from the agencies identified five vulnerabilities that the SVR exploited to carry out the attack. Microsoft President Brad Smith in February told \"60 Minutes\" that the SolarWinds hack was \"the largest and most sophisticated attack the world has ever seen.\" The U.S. has also publicly warned Russia against aggressive actions in Ukraine. Russia has amassed more than 40,000 troops on Ukraine's eastern border, and more than 40,000 in Crimea, the region that Putin annexed away from Ukraine and declared Russian in 2014. \u00a0  On Wednesday, at a meeting in Brussels with NATO allies, Secretary  of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. is \"deeply concerned about what we're  seeing, about Russia's ongoing aggressive actions, rhetoric directed at  Ukraine.\"\u00a0 Top intelligence officials on Wednesday told a Senate panel that Russia would continue to employ \"a variety of tactics\" to undermine the U.S., including mercenary operations, assassinations, arms sales, cyber capabilities and malign influence campaigns \u2014   but that Moscow did not seek military conflict.

            "article_content": "Fresh off a big win in Virginia and better-than-expected performance in New Jersey, Republican governors are confident about their 2022 midterm prospects against Democrats, but they'll have an added wrinkle before next year's general election: challenges within their own party.\u00a0 \"We intend to protect our incumbents and keep our red states red, but we've also shown that we can win in any state in the country,\" Republican Governors Association chair Doug Ducey told reporters. \"I think we saw the roadmap in the commonwealth of Virginia.\" As head of the RGA, Ducey will have to navigate a slew of races in top battleground states, including the race to replace him in Arizona, while trying to expand the map of Republican-controlled governor's mansions. When the calendar flips to 2022, his organization will be sitting on more cash than it has in any other midterm election cycle. While Republicans feel good about their prospects against Democrats next year, and the cash has been flowing, the RGA has a new challenge to navigate in 2022: several GOP incumbents are facing primary opponents. \"We've never been in a situation where our incumbent governors have faced primaries. Even through the height of the Tea Party primaries when the House and Senate guys were being primaried, governors never really had that experience because you only run for reelection one time,\" RGA executive director Dave Rexrode said. \"We're going to, where appropriate and where necessary, be financially supporting our incumbent governors in primaries. That's something we're new to.\"\u00a0 Texas Governor Greg Abbott has primary challengers to his right, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine is facing former Representative Jim Renacci and Georgia Governor Brian Kemp will be trying to fend off against former Georgia state representative Vernon Jones, who used to be a Democrat but switched parties. But Kemp's bigger challenge may come from former Senator David Perdue, who is also reportedly considering running against Kemp. Perdue broke a nine-month Twitter silence on Wednesday to take a shot at Georgia Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan and told a talk radio show in Georgia that he and his wife \"have been praying about our state.\" \"I'm concerned about the state of our state,\" Perdue said. \"We have a divided party in Georgia right now. Forget about me. It's divided. And a lot of people feel like the people in power haven't fought for them and caved in to a lot of things back in 2020 that didn't have to be done.\" Ducey was quick to point out that the Perdue challenge is still \"hypothetical,\" but said if it does materialize, \"the RGA is in the business, of course, of supporting our incumbents and ultimately electing Republican governors.\" He said the RGA will make decisions \"race by race\" in terms of how to use its resources, including how it supports incumbents.\u00a0 \"We don't fund losers. We don't fund landslides,\" Ducey said. \"We go into competitive races, we get that nominee over the finish line. It's always been our posture that we protect incumbents.\" Ducey said Kansas, Maine, Michigan, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin will be among the top targets for Republicans to flip next year. Republicans are eyeing more than 10 Democratic-held seats, including bluer states such as Connecticut and Minnesota, for potential pickups, depending on the national mood. Democrats have 16 seats to defend next year, a mixture of incumbents and open seats, and believe they'll remain in Democratic hands. They say their incumbents will have strong records to run on when it comes to education, infrastructure and voting rights. \"The DGA is ready for the fight \u2014 we have not lost an incumbent since 2014 while the RGA has lost McCrory, Walker, Bevin and others,\" Democratic Governors Association communications director David Turner said in a statement. \"Democratic Governors have stood in the breach for the last three years, and their records resonate with the issues voters care about.\" GOP governors at the RGA's annual conference praised Virginia governor-elect Glenn Youngkin for his win earlier this month and said his victory demonstrated that candidates need to focus on state-based issues in 2022 and can win in a variety of states. \"Glenn Youngkin won in Virginia because he did something that is very fundamental in politics: he showed voters a contrast between the Republican running for governor versus the leftist, progressive agenda of his opponent,\" Abbott said. Panels of Republican governors previewed the issues that they'll attack Democrats on, including the southern border, rising energy prices, vaccine requirements for businesses, COVID response, education and the cost of living.\u00a0 Youngkin said he won by \"looking forward and not looking backward.\" The governor-elect said candidates will have to decide based on their own race whether it's best to keep Mr. Trump at arm's length. He noted that his campaign \"built a coalition in Virginia of all voters\" and said that \"President Trump was helpful to me.\"\u00a0 His advice to Republicans is to keep hammering away at issues like education. \u00a0 \"Through this entire campaign season, the polls kept telling us that education was the seventh, eighth or ninth most important issue,\" Youngkin said. \"Let me tell you, it is the top issue right now and Republicans across the country can own this topic.\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "Next week, a country with a long, complicated history with the U.S. will hold its presidential election. Its president is seeking a fourth consecutive term and has made sure nothing stands in his way. He's changed the country's laws, silenced the media, and locked up candidates who planned to run against him. Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega is not the fatigue-wearing revolutionary that you may remember. He's now 75 and rarely seen. Still, many Nicaraguans fear he is more dangerous than he's ever been. And tonight, you will hear from two women whose husbands were planning to challenge Ortega for the presidency. Both men were arrested by the regime in June and their wives haven't seen or spoken to them since. Now, the women are fighting to bring back their husbands and a democracy lost.\u00a0 \"If you're seeing this\u2026 I've been captured.\" Those were the chilling words of Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Chamorro - hours before he was taken from his home by masked police officers in June. Victoria C\u00e1rdenas: Eight police patrols were coming. There was a lot of cars, a lot of noise, a lot of people jumping in our wall. \u00a0 Victoria C\u00e1rdenas is Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Chamorro's wife. Chamorro was planning to run for president against Daniel Ortega and was considered a leading candidate.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Because of that, C\u00e1rdenas says police had been harassing him outside of their home for months, but on June 8 they came in.\u00a0 Victoria C\u00e1rdenas: He was on the floor with his hands up saying, \"I am here. Please don't do anything to my wife.\" We are unarmed. And they jumped the walls. They broke in. And they took him violently.\u00a0 C\u00e1rdenas hasn't seen or spoken to him since. Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Chamorro, a Georgetown-educated economist, is part of a prominent political family in Nicaragua. \u00a0\u00a0 Days earlier, his cousin, Cristiana Chamorro, who coincidentally was also running for president, was about to hold a press conference outside her home when police in riot gear showed up. You can see police push the crowd back. Chamorro was placed under house arrest. Over the next two months, Nicaragua's police force detained dozens of critics of the regime, journalists and ultimately, seven of the leading candidates who planned to run for president against Ortega. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco is a director of Human Rights Watch, a non-profit advocacy group that's been reporting from inside Nicaragua for decades.\u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi: A lot of dictators will at least go through the motions of pretending there's a legitimate election. He's not. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: Ortega's deliberate and flagrant crackdown against peaceful opposition leaders is something without any precedent in Latin America since the '70s and '80s, when most of the region was under military dictatorship. Sharyn Alfonsi: What makes it unprecedented?\u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: Since Ortega controls Congress, he managed to pass legislation at the end of last year that sanctioned as treason, essentially, any criticism of the government. Sharyn Alfonsi: So if you criticize the government, you can be thrown in jail right now. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: The language that they use is, any damage to the superior interests of the nation. Sharyn Alfonsi: It sounds Orwellian. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: Orwellian. It's completely Orwellian. In June, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for President Ortega to immediately release the candidates and announced sanctions against members of Ortega's family and inner circle. Until a few years ago, it might have looked like Daniel Ortega had mellowed out with age. A far-cry from the revolutionary President Carter invited to the White House in 1979. Ortega's Sandinista Guerillas were credited with bringing down the Somoza family dictatorship in Nicaragua. Later they fought off the U.S.-sponsored Contras. In 1984, Daniel Ortega was elected president and later sat down with our Mike Wallace. Ortega was voted out of office in 1990, but returned to power in 2006 promising to fight corruption. Instead, he tightened his grip on the country. First, changing the constitution so he could serve more terms, then, making his wife, Rosario Murillo - an eccentric, new-age poet - his vice president.\u00a0 Their children also hold key positions in Nicaragua. Eight of the couple's nine children were made presidential advisers. They oversee a lucrative oil distribution business and most of the country's TV channels. But even as the Ortega family's wealth has exploded, Nicaragua remains the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. In 2018, Nicaraguans revolted. Thousands took to\u00a0 the streets to protest Ortega's proposed cuts to social security for senior citizens. Soon, protestors were calling for Ortega and his wife to step down. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco says it was a turning point for the country. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco:\u00a0 That demonstration was confronted with brutal force by Ortega. Thousands of people were injured. More than 700 were arrested and at least 350 people were killed by police or paramilitary groups supported by the Nicaraguan government. \u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: All of those crimes, all of those atrocities committed by Ortega and his security forces just a couple of years ago, he was able to get away with those crimes. But Vivanco says Ortega also realized that if he lost power he might be imprisoned for what Nicaraguan journalists called a \"massacre\" of protestors. \u00a0 F\u00e9lix Maradiaga at Geneva Summit: Very few people around the world doubt that Nicaragua is a dictatorship.\u00a0 F\u00e9lix Maradiaga, a former cabinet member, was one of Ortega's most outspoken critics. A graduate of Harvard, he addressed world leaders at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy in 2019. F\u00e9lix Maradiaga at Geneva Summit: I come here with the conviction and hope that the world will continue to support the struggle of my people to build a free and open society. F\u00e9lix Maradiaga was teaching non-violent activism to Nicaraguan students when witnesses say he was beaten by Ortega's henchmen in 2018. After the attack, Maradiaga was hospitalized. For the next few years, he was under constant surveillance by the police, according to his wife, Berta Valle. Berta Valle: They watch him, they put patrols in front of his house. The police would tell him that he was not able to go out of the house. Berta Valle: And from December 2020 to February '21, he was under house arrest. Sharyn Alfonsi: So no warrant, but he's not allowed to leave the house? Berta Valle: Exactly. Even so, F\u00e9lix Maradiaga decided he would run for president. One of a group of opposition candidates who, for the first time, had decided to band together to try to defeat Daniel Ortega.\u00a0 Berta Valle: They signed a document saying that they were willing to support the one that could represent the Nicaraguan people. But the opposition never got the chance to put their candidate forward. Most were arrested or fled the country before they could file the paperwork to officially put them on the ballot. On June 8, F\u00e9lix Maradiaga was summoned to meet with government prosecutors. His family feared he would be arrested during the meeting.\u00a0 Berta Valle: So he went with a lawyer, a friend. And he was interviewed for four hours. Sharyn Alfonsi: So Felix came out, he talked to the independent press. Berta Valle: Exactly. Berta Valle: We were watching this live and we said, \"Oh, thanks, God, he came out, he's okay, he's going to take the car and he's gonna leave.\" His attorney says they were driving away when Maradiaga was dragged out of the car and beaten by police. His wife hasn't seen him since that morning in June.\u00a0 It turns out Maradiaga knew he was in danger. Hours before his arrest, he left his daughter Alejandra a series of videos so she would hear his voice in case he wasn't there for her 8th birthday. \"I'm thinking of you on your birthday,\" he says and tells her, \"I love you.\" She and her mother have been living in the United States for three years because of threats at home and are now applying for asylum. We concealed Alejandra's identity for her safety. In August, we met Berta Valle and Victoria C\u00e1rdenas in Washington where they'd been petitioning U.S. lawmakers to help free their husbands and about 150 other political prisoners in Nicaragua. At that point, the men had disappeared. No one had heard from them or seen them in two months. Sharyn Alfonsi: Do you believe that he's still alive? Berta Valle: That's what I want to believe, you know? We-- we have the hope that-- that he is okay, but we don't know. And that's why we are asking for a proof of life to this point. And this is why we are doing all this effort to come out and to-- to go to the international community. Because there's nothing we can do in Nicaragua.\u00a0 Last month, 87 days after their arrests, attorneys for F\u00e9lix Maradiaga and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Chamorro were allowed to briefly see them at El Chipote, the Nicaraguan prison that's been described by human rights workers as a \"dungeon.\" \u00a0\u00a0 Both men were charged with \"conspiracy to undermine the national integrity\" at a closed hearing in the jail. Attorneys say both Chamorro and Maradiaga have lost significant weight and been subjected to months of interrogations and psychological torture. Victoria C\u00e1rdenas: It's a violation of the basic human rights. It's not only my family who is suffering, it's more than 140 families who have political prisoners who are innocent and are living this awful situation. Victoria C\u00e1rdenas and Berta Valle can not go back to Nicaragua. Because of their appeals for help to Washington and the international community. The women have been charged in absentia with being \"traitors to the homeland\". \u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi: So what would happen if you went back to Nicaragua now? Would you be arrested? Berta Valle: Definitely, yes. Not only arrested, but if they condemn me, that would be life-- life prison. The violence in Nicaragua is fueling an exodus. Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans have fled to Costa Rica and U.S. Customs and Border Protection says about 38,000 Nicaraguans have reached the U.S. border since June compared to less than 800 people over the same time last year.\u00a0 In August, the State Department announced more sanctions against members of the Ortega regime. But at the same time, the International Monetary Fund approved sending more than $350 million to Nicaragua that's supposed to help fight hunger and COVID.\u00a0 Last month, members of Congress from both parties demanded the IMF reconsider sending more money to Nicaragua and called for stronger sanctions against Ortega. The Pentagon has also warned Congress that Russia has been supplying Nicaragua with millions of dollars in military equipment and training and that Ortega has allowed Russia to build a listening station so close to the U.S. Sharyn Alfonsi: Haven't we heard this story before? This all sounds very familiar. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: It-- it is. Going back 35 years to the-- to the middle of the Cold War, that is unfortunately the scenario we are operating, we're living now. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco says with Russia's continued military and financial support, U.S. sanctions will not be enough to convince Daniel Ortega to change course. \u00a0 Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco: Ortega has decided to stay in power for the rest of his life.

            "article_content": "At least six people were arrested in Washington, D.C. Tuesday evening and night as thousands of people geared up for larger protests in support of President Trump Wednesday, CBS D.C. affiliate WUSA-TV reported, citing local and U.S. Park Police. Among the charges were gun counts, illegal possession of fireworks and assault on a police officer. Videos on social media showed some clashes between protesters and police. Mr. Trump's supporters descended on the nation's capital to cheer his baseless claims of election fraud ahead of what will be a highly contentious Wednesday congressional vote to affirm Joe Biden's election victory. The president is expected to personally address his backers Wednesday morning during a rally on the Ellipse, just south of the White House. Organizers said that rally would continue all day. An afternoon march was also planned to the U.S. Capitol, where Congress will be voting to affirm the election results. A number of prominent Trump supporters were expected to attend, including Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.  Just blocks from the White House, protesters - many without masks - gathered in Freedom Plaza on Tuesday to decry the congressional vote. As temperatures dropped to the low 40s and a steady rain swept onto the streets, hundreds remained in the plaza into nightfall.  The president tweeted his support for the protesters: \"Washington is being inundated with people who don't want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats. Our Country has had enough, they won't take it anymore! We hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"  Speakers included former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was pardoned by the president pardoned after he was twice convicted of lying to the FBI in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.  \"We stand at a crucible moment in United States history,\" Flynn told the mostly maskless crowd. \"This country is awake now.\" 7:30PM \u201cStop the Steal\u201d Rally \u2014\u2022 We\u2019ve heard General Mike Flynn give a salute / shout-out to QAnon soldiers...\u2022 George Papadopoulos praise the president for his pardon...\u2022 Attendees pray for the Proud Boys.That\u2019s where we\u2019re at.@WUSA9 @CBSNews pic.twitter.com/QtxvtsZbYl Also addressing the crowd was longtime Trump ally Roger Stone, another recipient of a pardon from the president. The protests coincide with Wednesday's congressional vote expected to certify the Electoral College results, which Mr. Trump continues to dispute. The rallies had local officials and law enforcement bracing for potential violent street clashes. Many businesses in downtown Washington boarded up their windows, fearful that the protest could devolve into the unrest seen in May and June, when dozens of businesses were vandalized.  District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser called in National Guard troops to help bolster the city's police force. She urged residents to stay away from downtown Washington and to avoid confrontations with anyone who is \"looking for a fight.\" But, she warned, \"We will not allow people to incite violence, intimidate our residents or cause destruction in our city.\" In addition to the National Guard, federal agents were on standby, in case they were quickly needed in the city this week.  The federal Bureau of Prisons said about 100 \"specially trained officers\" were sent to the Justice Department headquarters to assist other security personnel but would remain \"in a reserve capacity unless needed.\" The Department of Homeland Security, meanwhile, said that unlike during the unrest in May and June in Washington, it didn't plan to deploy agents from Customs and Border Protection to the demonstration Wednesday. Election officials from both political parties, governors in key battleground states and Mr. Trump's former attorney general, William Barr, have said there was no widespread fraud in the election. Nearly all the legal challenges from Trump and his allies have been dismissed by judges, including two rejected by the Supreme Court.  A pro-Trump rally Dec. 12 ended in violence as hundreds of Trump supporters, wearing the signature black and yellow of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, sought out confrontations with a collective of local activists attempting to bar them from Black Lives Matter Plaza, an area near the White House. At least two local Black churches had Black Lives Matter banners torn down and set ablaze. On Monday, police arrested the leader of the Proud Boys, Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, 36, after he arrived in Washington ahead of the protests. Tarrio was accused of burning one of the Black Lives Matter banners in December and was found with two high-capacity firearm magazines, police said. A judge signed an order Tuesday banning Tarrio from entering the District of Columbia, with very limited exceptions related to his criminal case.",

            "article_content": "Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, executive producer and series creator of the hit show \"Riverdale,\" is pleading for the release of his father, Francisco, a 77-year-old political pundit and former Nicaraguan foreign minister. He has been sitting for more than 60 days in Nicaragua's notorious \"Nuevo Chipote\" prison, where critics of President Daniel Ortega's government are being subject to mistreatment and torture, activists and family members say.\u00a0 \"The biggest fear is that I'm not gonna get a chance to see him again, and that one day, we're going to get a call that says he died in jail,\" Roberto told CBS News in an interview.\u00a0 Francisco is one of 37 people that include presidential candidates, journalists, students and others that have been detained in Nicaragua since late May, according to Human Rights Watch.\u00a0 Roberto detailed his family's ordeal in Time magazine. Francisco and his wife, Maria, who live in Nicaragua, were driving to Costa Rica in late July to hop on a flight to Washington, D.C. for his hip replacement surgery. While not an uncommon method of traveling to the U.S., said Roberto, the couple was stopped at the Nicaraguan border and had to turn back to Managua. During their return trip, authorities arrested him and let Maria go.\u00a0 Days later, Nicaragua's national police said he was being investigated on a series of charges related to allegedly asking for and accepting foreign funding to engage in anti-government activities, and calling on foreign countries to intervene in Nicaragua's affairs and \u00a0invade the country. While Francisco regularly wrote opinion columns in a Nicaraguan newspaper, Roberto told CBS News he has no idea what prompted authorities to detain him, except that it \"came out of the blue.\"\u00a0 \"The only thing I can say is ... the closer that we've gotten to the Nicaraguan election, the more paranoid and ruthless the regime has gotten,\" he said.\u00a0 Ortega, who has been accused of human rights violations in the past, is seeking his fourth consecutive term on November 7 and in recent months, efforts to silence his critics have ramped up. According to\u00a0Human Rights Watch, police have cited provisions in a\u00a0recently passed law\u00a0to arrest Francisco and others, who are considered \"traitors\" under the legislation. Tamara Taraciuk Broner, acting Americas deputy director at Human Rights Watch, told CBS News on Monday that the country's judicial system has been used to prosecute opponents and it has \"no judicial independence.\"\u00a0 \"This is part of a much broader attempt of concentration of power in a country without any checks and balances,\" she said, adding that Ortega and his wife and vice president Rosario Murillo have trying to seize more power within the government after the massive 2018 anti-government protests. Since Francisco's arrest, Maria tries to deliver food, water and medicine at the prison, but gets denied. However, she saw him once for only 10 minutes, in a meeting that was being recorded, Roberto wrote in Time. Francisco had lost weight, appeared confused and told his wife to stop trying to send him anything since he wasn't receiving anything, Roberto said. Roberto's family isn't the only one decrying the conditions at Nuevo Chipote. In a joint statement by families of the political prisoners in September, they described the conditions: Physical deterioration of inmates, freezing cells, lights remain on for 24 hours, lack of regularity in the administration of medications, cells that don't meet international standards and lack of access to reading material. Some of the imprisoned family members, they say, have been kept in solitary confinement for two months.\u00a0 \"All these extreme conditions to which our unjustly imprisoned family members are being subjected constitute as acts of torture,\" they said. \"We are deeply concerned that these conditions may cause irreversible damage, both physically and psychologically.\"\u00a0 Broner said the U.S., European Union and the United Nations need to push for accountability from Nicaragua.\u00a0 \"Concerted international pressure is essential to send a clear cut message that this is not tolerated by democracies around the world,\" Broner said.\u00a0 In a\u00a0bipartisan letter addressed to secretary of state Anthony Blinken on Friday, 14 senators called on increased efforts to release at least 150 political prisoners in Nicaragua and urging the Biden administration to expand the use of sanctions. The lawmakers also called on UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and other UN entities to \"encourage sustained international scrutiny and condemnation.\" The EU imposed\u00a0sanctions on several individuals\u00a0\"responsible for serious human rights violations\" in Nicaragua, including Murillo, in August.\u00a0 A post shared by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa (@writerras) Roberto is very close with his father and told CBS News it's \"harrowing\" to not know how he's doing \u2013 or if he'll see him alive ever again.\u00a0 \"We have no idea how this ends,\" he said, fearing he may be kept indefinitely. \"The election will happen in November. I suspect Ortega will win because there's no credible candidate running against him, and then what will happen?\" \"If I have a moment to breathe, I'm thinking about what my dad's doing at that moment,\" he added.\u00a0 Still, Roberto and his family try to remain optimistic. He remembered the last series of conversations he had with his father: He was finally moving 15 giant boxes of comic books he left in his parents' Virginia home. \"It's been kind of a family joke for 25 years that my comic book collection is there,\" he said. \"I look forward to his thoughts on that when I see him again.\" Christopher Brito is a social media manager and trending content writer for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Representative Alcee Hastings, the fiercely liberal longtime Florida congressman who was dogged throughout his tenure by an impeachment that ended his fast-rising judicial career, died Tuesday. He was 84. Hastings' family confirmed his death in a statement issued by his congressional office. Hastings, a Democrat, announced two years ago that he had pancreatic cancer. \"He lived a full life with an indelible fighting spirit dedicated to equal justice. He believed that progress and change can only be achieved through recognizing and respecting the humanity of all mankind. He was never afraid to speak his mind and truly loved serving hls constituents and his family,\" the family said. \"He will be dearly missed but his legacy and fighting spirit will forever live on.\" Hastings was known as an advocate for minorities, a defender of Israel and a voice for gays, immigrants, women and the elderly. He held senior posts on the House Rules Committee and the Helsinki Commission, which works with other countries on a variety of multinational issues. But his impeachment remained a nagging footnote. It was repeatedly invoked in news accounts and seen as derailing his ambitions for a greater leadership role. \"That seems to be the only thing of significance to people who write,\" Hastings told The Associated Press in 2013, predicting that the impeachment would be in the lead paragraph of his obituary. Despite his seniority, Hastings was passed over for chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee when the Democrats took control of Congress in 2006. But as he did time and again throughout his life, he insisted his fight wasn't over and that he wouldn't be discouraged. \"Sorry, haters,\" he said when not chosen for the intelligence posting, \"God is not finished with me yet.\" Under Florida law, Governor Ron DeSantis will call a special election in the coming months to fill the vacancy. Hastings' district is overwhelmingly Democratic \u2014 he received 80% of the vote in November. Hastings' death, meanwhile, lowers the Democrats' majority to a scant 218-211 in the House. Their narrow margin is forcing the party to muster nearly unanimous votes to push legislation through the chamber, and is bolstering Republican hopes for capturing House control in the 2022 elections. There are six vacancies \u2014 four from seats that were held by Democrats, two by Republicans. The seat won by Representative-elect Luke Letlow, a Republican of Louisiana who died from COVID-19 before being sworn into office, will go to his widow, Julia Letlow, who won a special election. The rest are expected to be retained by the same parties that had held them. Born September 5, 1936, in Altamonte Springs, Florida, a largely black Orlando suburb, Hastings was the son of a maid and a butler. He attended Fisk University and Florida A&M. After earning his law degree he went into private practice, frequently taking on civil rights cases pro bono. He made an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 1970, then earned a state judgeship. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter named him to the federal bench. He was the first Black person to hold a federal judgeship in Florida since Reconstruction. From the start, his career was marked by controversy. His harsh criticism of President Ronald Reagan, his appearance at a rally in 1984 for then-presidential candidate Jesse Jackson and other moves considered unusual for a sitting federal judge raised questions about his impartiality. But Hastings insisted he was doing nothing wrong. \"Outside the courtroom, I speak out because I'm a citizen and I have the interests of a great number people of this country at heart,\" he said. \"I think it's better to have public officials express themselves. I don't think being a judge means I'm neutered.\" It wasn't long, though, before his judicial career was derailed. He became the first sitting U.S. judge tried on criminal charges. Along with Washington lawyer William Borders Jr., Hastings was accused of soliciting a $150,000 bribe from two convicted racketeers seeking to shorten their sentences. Hastings contended Borders acted without his knowledge in soliciting the bribe. Borders was convicted and sentenced to five years. Hastings was acquitted, but it didn't put an end to questions about his ethics, and a judicial panel accused him of fabricating his defense. Though Hastings contended Congress' actions amounted to double jeopardy, the House impeached him in 1988 and the Senate convicted him in 1989. A federal judge later reversed the impeachment, saying Hastings was improperly tried by a 12-member panel instead of the full Senate, but his exoneration was short-lived. Ruling later in the case of another ousted judge, the Supreme Court decided 7-2 that courts could not second-guess the Senate's power to remove federal officials from office. By then, Hastings had already won a seat in Congress in 1992, taking his oath before the same body that had impeached him. Like so many other moves in Hastings' life, his path to Congress had been a high-profile fight. He won the seat after two bitter runoffs fueled by accusations of racism in the largely Black district. At one point, in his heated race against Lois Frankel, he snapped to a reporter for The Palm Beach Post, \"The bitch is a racist.\" He went on to win, though, and was easily re-elected time after time. Frankel earned her own ticket to Congress 20 years later as a Democratic colleague of Hastings. Hastings remained no stranger to controversy, even in recent years. In 2011, a former aide filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him, claiming he constantly hugged her against her will, pressed his cheek against hers and suggested they go to his hotel room. Hastings called them \"ridiculous, bizarre, frivolous\" accusations. The House Ethics Committee cleared Hastings in 2014, finding no \"substantial reason to believe\" the allegations and \"a significant amount of evidence\" casting doubt on them. \"I've enjoyed some of the fights, and even the process of being indicted and removed from the bench,\" he told the AP in 2013. \"All of those are extraordinary types of circumstances that would cause lesser people to buckle. I did not and I have not.\"",

            "article_content": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced Thursday the next special session of the Legislature will begin on Saturday, and it will have the state's controversial voting bill on the agenda. The Democrats walked out of the regular session in May and then fled the state in July to prevent a vote on that bill.\u00a0 \"I will continue to call special session after special session to reform our broken bail system, uphold election integrity, and pass other important items that Texans demand and deserve,\" Abbott said in a statement on Thursday. \"Passing these Special Session agenda items will chart a course towards a stronger and brighter future for the Lone Star State.\" \u00a0 The current special session is expected to end on Thursday night. Since Republicans hold a majority in the Legislature, more than 50 Democratic state lawmakers decamped to Washington, D.C., on July 12 to deny Abbott a quorum. Without a sufficient number of legislators present, a vote on the bill could not take place. \u00a0 On a press call about voting rights legislation, Texas state Representative Gina Hinojosa would not go further into the Democrats' plans, saying \"the thing about fighting as a minority party in Texas is frequently our strategy must be kept secret.\" \"I will say this, we will fight this suppression session and the republican effort to voter suppression,\" Hinojosa continued. \"We will see in the coming days as events unfold.\" She added in an interview with CBS News that the Texas Democrats were convening when the news about another special session came in, and they \"intend to fight this second suppression session with as much vigor and determination as we did the first.\" \"But let me say this, desperation is growing. We need the President, the Senate to prioritize the freedom to vote, over and above everything else,\" she said. \"If the U.S. Senate does not prioritize this above all other matters and rules, including the filibuster, we will lose our democracy. And what they did not accomplish on January 6, they will accomplish state by state.\" Hinojosa said she hasn't heard of a firm commitment yet from Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer about bringing up a voting rights bill for a vote before the August recess. Texas state Representative Trey Martinez Fischer also didn't expand on next steps, but said \"as long as Congress is working, I will be in Washington pushing for voting rights reform by the passage of the 'For the People' Act.\"\u00a0 He added that all options, whether it's staying in Washington, D.C., or going back to Texas, are \"back on the table.\" \"We know how to use them. We have been effective using them. And I think Republicans know by now that we mean what we say,\" he told CBS News. \"We will approach every suppression session the same way we have in the past.\" The lawmakers who broke quorum are set to hold a press conference Friday at the U.S. Capitol with organizers and Senator Jeff Merkeley of Oregon.\u00a0 Abbott announced there would be 17 items on the agenda for the special session. In addition to the voting legislation, state lawmakers will be addressing bail reform, a bill ensuring COVID-19 vaccines and masks are voluntary for K-12 education, as well as a measure that would ban students from competing in University Interscholastic League athletic competitions designated for the sex opposite to the student's sex at birth. Also on the agenda is legislation to modify dates for filing periods and elections in 2022, a response to delays in the redistricting process. The legislature is expected to hold another special session dedicated to redistricting sometime in the fall. Texas Republican party chair Matt Rinaldi said Thursday that \"Republicans are wasting no time in getting the Texas Legislature back to work and will continue special sessions until Democrats return.\" \"There is no endgame for Texas House Democrats. They need to say goodbye to D.C., Portugal and the Caribbean, wherever they may be, come back to Texas, and do their jobs,\" he wrote in a statement, referencing two lawmakers who a reporter for Texas Monthly said were vacationing in Portugal.\u00a0 On the agenda is also an item \"relating to legislative quorum requirements.\" Fischer called potential quorum rule changes \"tantamount to the Governor having a temper tantrum.\" \"Looking at this newly called suppression session, it's no different than the first one... When you read in between the lines you still see voter suppression. You still see attacks on the LGBTQ community,\" Fischer said. He added that Abbott could handle his COVID-19 related items with his disaster and emergency powers, not a special session.\u00a0 After Texas Democrats broke quorum the first time, Abbott called the sergeant-at-arms and his officers to find any members who are absent without an excuse \"for the purpose of securing and maintaining their attendance under warrant of arrest if necessary.\" Their jurisdiction stops at the Texas state border line, meaning they can't arrest the lawmakers if they're in Washington D.C.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014\u00a0Congresswoman Liz Cheney, on the eve of a vote among Republicans to remove her from her leadership post, vowed on the House floor on Tuesday night that she would not remain silent as a faction of the GOP continues to side with former President Trump. \"This is not about policy, this is not about partisanship, this is about our duty as Americans,\" Cheney said. \"Remaining silent and ignoring the lie emboldens the liar. I will not participate in that. I will not sit back and watch in silence while others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law and joins the former president's crusade to undermine our democracy.\"\u00a0 A source familiar with the GOP's plans confirms that, should Cheney be removed, there will be a candidate forum for potential replacements for the conference chair position on Thursday with an election on Friday. At present, the only candidate to replace Cheney is Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who has the backing of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\u00a0 But in a sign of the simmering tension among House Republicans over the future of the party, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus cautioned against electing Stefanik to replace Cheney as GOP conference chair.\u00a0 In a memo to fellow House Republicans, Congressman Chip Roy of Texas said that the party was \"falling prey to the high drama of swamp politics\" with the high-profile fight to oust Cheney. The Wyoming congresswoman has drawn the ire of Republicans for her repeated criticism of former President Donald Trump, as well as her insistence that GOP members should not downplay the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6 by a mob of Trump supporters. Cheney survived an effort to oust her after she voted to impeach Mr. Trump in January. \"This is actually why Liz Cheney will lose her job as Chair this week: she forfeited her ability to be our spokesperson by pulling us into distraction,\" Roy argued in his memo, which was first reported by Politico. \"From a position specifically designed to speak for all of us, she has been looking backwards while repeatedly and unhelpfully engaging in personal attacks and finger-wagging towards President Trump rather than leading the conference forward with a unifying message both on elections and more broadly.\" Roy, who\u00a0initially backed Cheney\u00a0during her first leadership challenge, said that he believed Republicans needed a conference chair who reflected conservative values. He criticized Stefanik's voting record, such as her vote against Mr. Trump's $1.9 trillion tax measure and her previous support for ending Mr. Trump's emergency declaration to fund a wall on the southern border. Stefanik also voted for the Equality Act, which would enshrine legal protections for LGBTQ Americans, in 2020, but not in 2021. \"We must avoid putting in charge Republicans who campaign as Republicans but then vote for and advance the Democrats' agenda once sworn in,\" Roy said. \"Therefore, with all due respect to my friend, Elise Stefanik, let us contemplate the message Republican leadership is about to send by rushing to coronate a spokesperson whose voting record embodies much of what led to the 2018 ass-kicking we received by Democrats.\" Although Stefanik has occasionally sided with Democrats, she has become a staunch ally of the former president in recent years, and voted to overturn Electoral College results in several states. Mr. Trump has endorsed her to replace Cheney, as has Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. But Roy argued that \"we should either choose someone who reflects our conservative values, or perhaps leave the position vacant.\" \"The future of our republic is at stake, and the message 'better than radical Democrats' will neither guarantee victory in 2022 nor win the minds and hearts of Americans to rally them to the cause of securing the blessings of liberty,\" Roy said. Roy is the first conservative House Republican to publicly come out against Stefanik, although others have reportedly privately complained about her voting record. But it's unclear whether the opposition of Roy and perhaps other Freedom Caucus members will be enough to halt Stefanik's momentum. \"We have a great deal of support from the Freedom Caucus and others,\" Stefanik told reporters on Tuesday.

In his phone call with Putin on Tuesday \u2014 his first with the Russian president since taking office \u2014 Mr. Biden \"made clear that the United States will act firmly in defense of its national interests in response to Russia's actions.\" \"President Biden reaffirmed his goal of building a stable and predictable relationship with Russia consistent with U.S. interests, and proposed a summit meeting in a third country in the coming months to discuss the full range of issues facing the United States and Russia,\" the White House readout of the call said. The readout went on to say that the two leaders \"discussed a number of regional and global issues, including the intent of the United States and Russia to pursue a strategic stability dialogue on a range of arms control and emerging security issues, building on the extension of the New START Treaty.\" But Mr. Biden also raised Russia's \"cyber intrusions and election interference.\" U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and that the country was behind recent cyber attacks on American companies and software systems. Last year, Russian spies sabotaged a tiny piece of computer code buried in a popular piece of software called\u00a0\"SolarWinds,\" which spread to 18,000 government and private computer networks. The hackers accessed the digital files of the U.S. departments of Justice, State, Treasury, Energy, and Commerce, and were able to pry into top-level communications, court documents and nuclear information. Russia has denied any election interference or cyber intrusions. \"President Biden emphasized the United States' unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The President voiced our concerns over the sudden Russian military build-up in occupied Crimea and on Ukraine's borders, and called on Russia to de-escalate tensions,\" the readout of the conversation also said. In 2014,\u00a0Russia unilaterally annexed Crimea, a peninsula in the Black Sea that is home to a Russian navy base, resulting in international condemnation and sanctions. Russia on Tuesday warned the United States against sending warships to the Black Sea, urging American forces to stay away \"for their own good.\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, meeting with Ukrainian and NATO officials in Brussels, made it clear that the Biden administration, along with its allies in Europe, considers\u00a0Russia's ongoing military buildup\u00a0in the region \"very provocative.\" Mr. Biden has not hesitated to criticize Putin, saying in an interview in March that he believes the Russian president is \"a killer.\" Moscow pulled its envoy from Washington after Mr. Biden's remarks, and Russian officials demanded an apology.

            "article_content": "cIllinois' Democratic governor JB Pritzker on Tuesday signed off on a new congressional map that could result in the loss of two GOP seats, but the state is an outlier in a trend giving Republicans the advantage in redistricting\u00a0ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.\u00a0 Republicans control the process for redrawing the districts for 187 U.S. House seats, compared to the 75 seats determined by Democrats. The remainder are handled by independent or bipartisan commissions.\u00a0 Only 19 states have passed their congressional maps so far, and it's already evident that Republicans are using their legislative majorities to gerrymander, or draw lines in their favor, in Texas, Ohio and North Carolina. The results so far are five new likely Republican seats, and a slew of Republicans in competitive seats with more politically friendly lines for their 2022 races. Democrats have backed lawsuits that allege partisan and racial gerrymandering in these Republican maps, but they're trying to even the score with their own gerrymandering in Oregon and Illinois, and they may still cut into any GOP gains in New York, New Jersey and California (which is drawn by a commission). \"What Republicans are doing is doubling down on the gerrymandering of the last decade,\" said National Democratic Redistricting Committee president Kelly Ward Burton \u2014 noting the increasingly narrowing field of competitive seats. \"There is a jump to want to assess the battlefield right now, and I caution against that because we're at a point in the calendar where a lot of the Republican states are done, and not a lot of Democratic states.\" \"Both parties are executing their strategies. We've been saying all along, we're just taking seats off the board and going on offense where possible. And they've been doing the same,\" said Adam Kincaid, executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust. Here's where the most aggressive redistricting across the country is taking place. Projections are based on data from the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. In Texas' reapportionment, the Census awarded the state two new congressional seats. The state's\u00a0growth, 87% of which was non-White, changed the demographics of its metro-suburban areas and resulted in more competitive races for incumbent Republicans in the last decade.\u00a0 But the new map passed by Republican legislators and signed by Governor Greg Abbott takes up to eight competitive seats off the map and protects those GOP incumbents by increasing the number of Republican voters in those districts. Only three seats are considered competitive, according to the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. The expected result is 24 Republican seats, 13 Democratic seats and one \"toss up\" seat in Texas' 15th. The map also splits up the two new congressional seats, ceding one seat centered in Austin to Democrats while drawing a solid Republican seat northwest of Houston. The border district of Texas' 15th, currently represented by Democratic Congressman Vicente Gonzalez, is now open after Gonzalez announced he would run in the more Democrat-friendly Texas' 34th District, left open by retiring Democratic Congressman Filemon Vela. At least five lawsuits against the map accuse the GOP-led Texas Legislature of racial gerrymandering and assert that the maps don't represent the state's Hispanic population, which drove nearly half of Texas' population growth. The map decreases the number of districts with a majority of Hispanic voters from eight to seven.\u00a0 \"Throughout the history of Texas, our communities have suffered from lack of representation. All we're asking is give us a chance. Give us a chance to have the representatives in our state mirror our communities,\" said Lydia Ozuna, a plaintiff in one lawsuit against Abbott led by the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. But since the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Texas hasn't gone a decade without being sued over its redistricting maps. \"Those suits were drawn up before we even started the process,\" claimed freshman Republican Congressman Troy Nehls.\u00a0 \"I know we had some issues in the past in 2010 and others. But as long as [the maps] comply with the Voting Rights Act, I'm good with it.\" After a panel of federal judges found that Republicans in the North Carolina Legislature had engaged in illegal extreme partisan gerrymandering of the state's congressional map \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" a court-ordered redrawing of the map by GOP legislators was put in place in 2019 which created two more Democratic seats and gave Republicans an 8 - 5 advantage.\u00a0 This year, the Republican Assembly passed a map that could potentially take two seats away from Democrats and create a split of 10 Republican-leaning seats, 3 Democratic-leaning seats and one competitive seat.\u00a0 Freshman Democratic Congresswoman Kathy Manning will be drawn into a more Republican district. Two Democratic congressmen have announced their retirements, David Price and G.K. Butterfield, who saw his northeastern seat extended to include more rural Republican counties further west.\u00a0 \"It's racially gerrymandered,\" Butterfield said about the map in his retirement announcement. I am disappointed, terribly disappointed with the Republican-majority legislature for again gerrymandering our state.\" Republican Congressman Dan Bishop, who was a state legislator during the redistricting process last decade, told CBS News he believes the map will remain in place throughout the decade. In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court decided political gerrymandering cases are to be decided in state court. Democratic lawyer Marc Elias, who is taking the lead on legal cases for the NDRC, filed a lawsuit with voters 24 hours after the map passed. A ballot measure passed in 2018 means that Ohio's new congressional lines will only last four years. But Republicans passed lines that could result in 13 Republican seats and 2 Democratic seats in a state where Democrats won 43% of the House votes and won four seats in 2020. \"It's insane,\" said Democratic Congressman Tim Ryan, who is running for Senate in 2022. His district was made more Republican in the new map, though he denies that Republican control of the process played a role in his Senate run. \"You take a state like Ohio and you draw a 13-2 map. [Democratic Senator] Sherrod Brown won, we've got four Supreme Court justices, Obama won twice. It's clearly political.\" Ohio lost a Congressional seat during reapportionment. Republican Governor Mike DeWine said the map \"significantly increases the number of competitive districts.\" According to the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, five seats are considered competitive, though they lean Republican. The League of Women Voters of Ohio, who is already suing over Ohio's state legislative maps, says a lawsuit is possible. The NDRC is also backing a lawsuit over the lines that claims it violates Ohio's constitution. Democratic Governor Kate Brown was the first in the country to sign off on new congressional lines, after a busy special session that included a walkout by Republican legislators and delays caused by COVID-19 cases in the state capitol. The map maintains the four Democratic-leaning seats by shoring up the districts of vulnerable incumbents, while adding a pick-up opportunity for Democrats in the state's new 6th Congressional District.\u00a0 State Republicans are arguing in an ongoing lawsuit that the map ought to be redrawn , though one retired state judge acting as a \"special master\" for the case suggested the map will be upheld. Oregon is one of several states where Democrats are in control and are expected to press their advantage and gerrymander lines to gain House seats, in an attempt to offset potential gains in Republican states.\u00a0 \"Democrats are not fighting gerrymandering anymore. You got Eric Holder and Marc Elias blessing the Oregon map and saying how great the Illinois map is. If they're fighting gerrymandering, they've got a funny way of showing it,\" said Kincaid. Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed a congressional map that could result in a loss of two Republican seats and a net gain of one Democratic seat, despite the fact that the state lost a congressional seat through reapportionment. The map pits incumbent Republicans against each other in southern Illinois, as well as Democrats Sean Casten and freshman Marie Newman in the new 6th District. Republican Adam Kinzinger was drawn into the same district as Republican Darin LaHood, though he announced his retirement shortly after a draft map was released in late October. The map also has a new designated majority Hispanic district in northern Chicago and its suburbs. This is Colorado's first year with a non-partisan commission in charge of redistricting. The result is a map with three safe Democratic seats, three safe Republican seats and two competitive seats including the state's new 8th Congressional district from reapportionment in the northern Denver suburbs. Groups representing Latino communities have challenged the map, claiming it dilutes the power of Latino voters. In Wisconsin, Democratic Governor Tony Evers vetoed the map passed by the GOP assembly last Friday, ensuring the court will have a say in how the maps are drawn. Courts are already handling the redrawing process in Virginia and Washington, where the bipartisan commissions missed their respective deadlines.\u00a0 Georgia Republican Governor Brian Kemp is expected to sign a map this week that draws Democratic Congresswoman Lucy McBath right out of her seat in the northern Atlanta suburbs, and creates a projected congressional split in the state of nine Republicans to five Democrats . McBath said Monday she'll run in Georgia's new 7th District against incumbent Democrat Congresswoman Carolyn Bourdeaux. California and Florida revealed their draft maps earlier this month, while the commission in New York has until mid-January 2022 to send a map to the Democratic-controlled legislature.

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Ronna McDaniel, chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, said Sunday that Republicans \"overwhelmingly\" agree with the actions former President Donald Trump's took while in office, even as the party appears deeply fractured in the wake of his presidency. In an interview with \"Face the Nation,\" McDaniel was pressed on the continued embrace of Mr. Trump by some wings of the GOP, even as the party grapples with losing the White House and both chambers of Congress in 2020. Mr. Trump's position as the future of the party, she said, will be decided by Republican voters. \"The voters are saying overwhelmingly they agree with what President Trump did in office,\" McDaniel told \"Face the Nation. \"As you see Joe Biden strip away energy independence and cancel the Keystone pipeline, as you see Joe Biden say, I'm going to prioritize opening our borders over opening our schools, opening our economies, when you see the vaccine rollout that started under Operation Warp Speed in less than a year \u2014 these are the types of things that voters are saying they saw happen in the Trump administration and now they're seeing the Biden administration strip those things away.\" Mr. Trump is set to make his first public appearance since leaving office at the Conservative Political Action Conference, a gathering of Republicans, in Florida later on Sunday. During his remarks, the former president is expected to reaffirm his position as the leader of the Republican Party and criticize his successor, President Biden, as well as members of his own party who have denounced the former president in the wake of the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol. While Mr. Trump continues to boast a large political following and loyal base of support, the GOP in the wake of the Trump presidency is divided, as some Republicans believe the party should move on without him. Ten House Republicans voted to impeach Mr. Trump for \"incitement of insurrection\" due to his conduct January 6, and seven Senate Republicans voted to\u00a0convict him of the impeachment charge. Some state Republican parties have\u00a0moved to censure their GOP home-state senators and lawmakers for the votes. Of the intra-party rebukes from state Republican leaders, McDaniel said, \"We can have division within our party, and you can have state parties say, 'I disagree with that vote and I disagree with what you did there.' But overwhelmingly our party agrees with each other on more than we disagree with each other on.\" Hanging over the party, meanwhile, is whether Mr. Trump will seek the presidency again in 2024, though McDaniel said she doesn't know if he will run. The former president is, however, expected to be active in the next election cycle, helping Republicans to win back majorities in the House and Senate in 2022. \"We are a handful of seats away from taking back the House, we picked up 15 this last election, and one seat away from taking back the Senate,\" McDaniel said, adding that a growing number of Republicans \"recognize we need to unite around, how do we win back these majorities and stop Biden in his tracks?\" Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois who has been vocal of the need for the GOP to publicly split from Mr. Trump, agreed there is unity among Republicans in opposing aspects of Mr. Biden's agenda. But he believes the party is divided in its vision for the future. \"I think we are a party that's been for too long pedaling in fear, using fear as a compelling way to get votes. And fear does motivate. But after a while, fear can destroy a country, can destroy narratives, and it can destroy a democracy. And we have to quit peddling that,\" Kinzinger, who was one of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump, told \"Face the Nation.\"\u00a0 Kinzinger predicted the former president's forthcoming remarks will be self-congratulatory. \"No ability to recognize the fact that we have lost the House, the Senate and the presidency because of Donald Trump,\" he said. \"And you're going to see a lot of fear.\" Kinzinger acknowledged Mr. Trump continues to cultivate a political following, but said the Republican Party needs a counter-narrative that paints an optimistic future. \"I think certainly he's got, you know, a number of people that follow him and are motivated by him and compelled by him because there's been no competing alternative vision,\" he said. \"You know, to win a narrative in a party, you have to present a competing alternative narrative. When you only hear from Donald Trump and when people walk around in fear of his tweets or his comments or they use his fear to win reelection, of course, he's going to motivate people.\" Kinzinger has launched his own group, Country 1st PAC, to push back on Mr. Trump's wing of the party, and said the GOP needs to look inward to determine how to move the country past its divisions. \"Every party, but now, especially the Republican Party, has to look inside after January 6 and say, what have we become? What's our great history and how do we go forward from here?\" he said. \"And I'll tell you, reaching out to Donald Trump and more of the same is not going to do that.\"",

            "article_content": "Arizona Representative Paul Gosar was facing criticism after he tweeted a video that included altered animation showing him striking Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. The video also shows him apparently set to attack President Biden with a weapon that appears to be a club or a sword.  In a tweet Monday night, Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, referred to Gosar as \"a creepy member I work with\" and said he \"shared a fantasy video of him killing me.\" She added that Gosar would face no consequences because Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy \"cheers him on with excuses.\" She also said institutions \"don't protect\" women of color.  A fellow House Democrat, Ted Lieu of California, referred to Gosar's tweet as \"sick behavior\" and said in a tweet of his own: \"In any workplace in America, if a coworker made an anime video killing another coworker, that person would be fired.\" Another House Democrat from California, Eric Swalwell tweeted, \"Happy Monday in America, where @GOPLeader McCarthy's colleague just posted a video of himself swinging two swords at President Biden. These blood thirsty losers are more comfortable with violence than voting. Keep exposing them.\" In a statement to The Washington Post, Gosar's digital director, Jessica Lycos, tossed aside assertions that the video glorifies violence, saying, \"Everyone needs to relax.\" Gosar, a Republican, posted the video Sunday with a note saying: \"Any anime fans out there?\"  The roughly 90-second video is an altered version of a Japanese anime series, interspersed with shots of border patrol officers and migrants at the southern U.S. border.  During one roughly 10-second section of the video, animated characters whose faces have been replaced with Gosar and fellow Republican Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado are seen fighting other animated characters.  In one scene, Gosar's character is seen striking the one made to look like Ocasio-Cortez in the back of the neck with a sword.  Twitter later attached a warning to the tweet saying it \"violated the Twitter Rules about hateful conduct. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public's interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\"  Gosar is known as an ardent ally of former President Donald Trump.

            "article_content": "CIA Director William Burns met with a top Russian security official on Tuesday, a spokesperson from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow confirmed. At President Biden's request, Burns was leading a delegation of senior American officials on a two-day trip to Moscow. \"They are meeting with members of the Russian government to discuss a range of issues in the bilateral relationship,\" the spokesperson said. \u00a0 The interaction comes amid simmering tensions with the Kremlin, although at the same time, the Biden administration is trying\u00a0to foster a more stable and predictable relationship after issuing a raft of\u00a0sanctions\u00a0for past offenses in April. \u00a0 Mr. Biden met in June with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva to\u00a0discuss\u00a0areas of potential cooperation, including arms control and cybersecurity, among other topics. \u00a0\u00a0 But U.S.-Russia relations have continued to be turbulent; Kremlin-linked hackers are still launching ransomware\u00a0attacks\u00a0on U.S. companies, and Moscow persists\u00a0in its efforts to meddle in U.S. elections. \u00a0 And earlier this week, satellite imagery\u00a0showed\u00a0Russian armored units, soldiers and artillery nearing Ukraine's border, renewing concerns about a potential military incursion.\u00a0 Moscow's diplomatic engagements with the West have been souring on several fronts. Last month, NATO\u00a0announced\u00a0it was expelling eight Russian diplomats it alleged were undeclared Russian intelligence officers and reduced Russia's delegation to the alliance, prompting Moscow to shut down NATO's outpost there. \u00a0 The Kremlin has also banned the American embassy from employing local Russian staff, virtually eliminating its ability to issue visas or provide other consular services, U.S. officials said last week. \u00a0\u00a0 On Tuesday, Russia's Security Council posted a\u00a0photograph\u00a0of Burns meeting with its Secretary, Nikolai Patrushev, a former director of Russia's domestic intelligence service and close associate of President Vladimir Putin. \u00a0 \"The parties discussed Russian-American relations,\" its one-sentence caption said. \u00a0 The CIA declined to comment on Burns' travel, and a spokesperson for the National Security Council declined to elaborate on the agenda for the American delegation in Moscow or why Burns was tapped to lead it. \u00a0 Since he became CIA director, Burns has spoken publicly about\u00a0health incidents\u00a0known as \"Havana Syndrome\" that have befallen more than 200 American officials \u2014 including 100 intelligence officers. He has\u00a0said\u00a0Russia \"could be\" behind the incidents, which can cause dizziness, nausea and debilitating headaches, but he and other senior intelligence officials have stressed that agencies have not determined their cause. \u00a0 It was not clear whether Burns would address the health incidents while he's in Moscow \u2014 they were raised briefly by the president during his June summit with Putin, a senior administration official said. \u00a0 A former deputy secretary of state who, over a three-decade career in diplomacy, served as U.S. ambassador to Russia and Jordan, Burns has engaged numerous times in recent months with counterparts in fraught diplomatic and security situations. \u00a0 In August, he\u00a0met\u00a0with leading Taliban officials in Kabul as the U.S. scrambled to complete its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. Before that, Burns\u00a0met\u00a0with then-president Ashraf Ghani at CIA headquarters, where the two discussed the embattled leader's handling of a potential political transition.\u00a0 At a recent appearance at Stanford University, Burns discussed making the transition from career diplomat to director of the country's leading spy agency, which, he said, had required him to present an \"oftentimes\u2026grim intelligence landscape.\" \u00a0\u00a0 \"I'd like to think \u2013 at least I hope \u2013 that my experience as an ambassador, as a policymaker, will make me a better director of CIA,\" Burns said, \"In other words, better able to connect the work that we do at CIA to what matters most to policymakers.\" \u00a0 \"I think part of the obligation for CIA, for an intelligence agency, is to be very mindful of the ways in which policymakers are going to have to wrestle with choices,\" he said. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "On his way out the door, President Trump pardoned 74 people, including his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, and commuted the sentences of 70 others. The White House announced the last-minute flurry of pardons and commutations early on Wednesday, Mr. Trump's last day in office. No members of the president's family \u2014 including Mr. Trump himself \u2014 were on the list. There was considerable speculation in the waning days of his term over whether he would issue pre-emptive pardons for himself, any of his children or son-in-law Jared Kushner. Also missing from the list \u2014 Rudy Giuliani \u2014 Mr. Trump's personal attorney, who led legal efforts to prove false claims that Mr. Trump won the presidential election over Joe Biden. Among others getting pardons were former top GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and rapper Lil Wayne. Bannon was indicted in August for allegedly defrauding donors out of hundreds of thousands of dollars with a fundraising campaign to build a wall along the southern border, known as the \"We build the wall\" campaign. The scheme raised $25 million, and Bannon was accused of taking $1 million to cover personal expenses and pay another person accused in the scheme. In announcing his pardon, the White House said Bannon \"has been an important leader in the conservative movement and is known for his political acumen.\" But Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, took to Twitter to swipe at the move, saying, \"Steve Bannon is getting a pardon from Trump after defrauding Trump's own supporters into paying for a wall that Trump promised Mexico would pay for. And if that all sounds crazy, that's because it is. Thank God we have only 12 more hours of this den of thieves.\" Broidy, the RNC's former deputy finance chair, was charged in October for his alleged role in a covert scheme to lobby the Justice Department and Trump administration on behalf of undisclosed foreign entities. Broidy resigned as the GOP's top fundraiser in 2018 after admitting to paying off a Playboy Playmate. Mr. Trump also pardoned rapper Dwayne Michael Carter Jr, also known as Lil Wayne. Carter pleaded guilty in December to a federal gun charge.\u00a0 In the final hour of his presidency, the president also granted a full pardon to Albert J. Pirro, Jr., the ex-husband of Trump-friendly Fox News host Jeanine Pirro. He was convicted on conspiracy and tax evasion charges.\u00a0 The president commuted the sentence of Kwame Kilpatrick, the former Detroit mayor who has served approximately 7 years of a 28 year sentence for racketeering and bribery. \"This commutation is strongly supported by prominent members of the Detroit community, Alveda King, Alice Johnson, Diamond and Silk, Pastor Paula White, Peter Karmanos, Representative Sherry Gay-Dagnogo of the Michigan House of Representatives, Representative Karen Whitsett of the Michigan House of Representatives, and more than 30 faith leaders,\" the White House said. Kilpatrick, once seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, received one of the longest sentences for corruption ever given to a major U.S. politician. New York Attorney General Letitia James issued a statement blasting Mr. Trump's actions, saying in part, \"The 143 pardons and commutations, issued in the twilight hours of the Trump Administration, perfectly sum up what this lame-duck president has always been about: favoritism towards those who show absolute loyalty to Donald Trump.\" Prior to the late blitz, Mr. Trump had granted 70 pardons, the majority of them in December, according to Justice Department records.\u00a0 He waited until after the November election to issue some of his most controversial pardons, including for former campaign manager Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner's convict father Charles Kushner, and longtime Trump ally Roger Stone.\u00a0 By the time President Obama had left office, he had pardoned 212 people; 189 were pardoned by President George W. Bush; and 396 received a pardon from President Clinton, according to the Justice Department.\u00a0 Mr. Trump isn't the first president to issue highly controversial pardons. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon, and Mr. Clinton granted clemency to friends and supporters.\u00a0 The president's pardon powers are virtually unlimited when it comes to federal crimes. The presidential pardon power allows the president to pardon anyone charged with or convicted of a federal crime \u2014 it does not apply to state crimes. Article II of the Constitution states that the president \"shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Facebook researchers in 2019 created three dummy accounts to study the platform's technology for recommending content in the News Feed. The first was for a user in India, its biggest market. Then it created two more test accounts to represent a conservative American user and a liberal one. All three accounts engaged exclusively with content recommended by Facebook's algorithms. Within days, the liberal account, dubbed \"Karen Jones,\" started seeing \"Moscow Mitch\" memes, which referred to a nickname by critics of\u00a0 Republican Senator Mitch McConnell\u00a0 after he blocked bills to protect American elections from foreign interference.\u00a0 The conservative account, \"Carol Smith,\" was guided toward QAnon conspiracy theories. Meanwhile, the test user's News Feed in India was filled with inflammatory material containing violent and graphic images related to India's border skirmishes with Pakistan. The Facebook researcher running the Indian test user's account wrote in a report that year: \"I've seen more images of dead people in the past 3 weeks than I've seen in my entire life total,\" adding that, \"the graphic content was recommended by [Facebook] via recommended groups, pages, videos, and posts.\" The internal Facebook memos analyzing the progression of these test accounts were part of thousands of pages of leaked documents provided to Congress by lawyers for Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen. A consortium of 17 U.S news organizations, including CBS News, has reviewed the redacted version of the documents received by Congress. The three projects illustrate how Facebook's algorithms for the News Feed can steer users to content that sow divisions. And they reveal that the company was aware its algorithms, which predict what posts users want to see and how likely they are to engage with it, can lead users \"down the path to conspiracy theories.\" In a statement to CBS News, a Facebook spokesperson said the project involving the conservative test user is \"a perfect example of research the company does to improve our systems and helped inform our decision to remove QAnon from the platform.\" In 2018, Facebook altered the algorithms that populate users' news feeds to focus on what it calls \"Meaningful Social Interactions\" in an attempt to increase engagement. But internal research found that engagement with posts \"doesn't necessarily mean that a user actually wants to see more of something.\" \"A state[d] goal of the move toward meaningful social interactions was to increase well-being by connecting people. However, we know that many things that generate engagement on our platform leave users divided and depressed,\" a Facebook researcher wrote in a December 2019 report. The document, titled \"We are Responsible for Viral Content,\" noted that users had indicated the kind of content they wanted to see more of, but the company ignored those requests for \"business reasons.\" According to the report, internal Facebook data showed that users are twice as likely to see content that is reshared by others as opposed to content from pages they choose to like and follow. Users who comment on posts to express their dissatisfaction are unaware that the algorithm interprets that as a meaningful engagement and serves them similar content in the future, the report said. There are several metrics that the News Feed algorithm considers, according to Facebook's internal documents. Each carries a different weight and content goes viral depending on how users interact with the post. When Facebook first moved toward meaningful social interactions in 2018, using the \"Like\" button awarded the post one point, according to one document. Signaling engagement using one of the reaction buttons with the emoticons that stand for \"Love,\" \"Care,\" \"Haha,\" \"Wow,\" \"Sad,\" and \"Angry\" were worth five points. A post that was reshared was also worth five points. Comments on posts, messages in Groups, and RSVPs to public events awarded the content 15 points. Comments, messages, and reshares that included photos, videos, and links were awarded 30 points. Facebook researchers quickly uncovered that bad actors were gaming the system. Users were \"posting ever more outrageous things to get comments and reactions that our algorithms interpret as signs we should let things go viral,\" according to a December 2019 memo by a Facebook researcher.\u00a0 In one internal memo from November 2019, a Facebook researcher noted that \"Angry,\" \"Haha,\" and \"Wow\" reactions are heavily tied to toxic and divisive content.\u00a0 \"We consistently find that shares, angrys, and hahas are much more frequent on civic low-quality news, civic misinfo, civic toxicity, health misinfo, and health antivax content,\" the Facebook researcher wrote. In April 2019, political parties in Europe complained to Facebook that the News Feed change was forcing them to post provocative content and take up extreme policy positions. One political party in Poland told Facebook that the platform's algorithm changes forced its social media team to shift from half positive posts and half negative posts to 80% negative and 20% positive. In a memo titled \"Political Party Response to '18 Algorithm Change,\" a Facebook staffer wrote that \"many parties, including those that have shifted strongly to the negative, worry about the long-term effects on democracy.\" In a statement to CBS News, a Facebook spokesperson said, \"the goal of Meaningful Social Interactions ranking change is in the name: improve people's experience by prioritizing posts that inspire interactions, particularly conversations between family and friends.\" The Facebook spokesperson also argued that the ranking change isn't \"the source of the world's divisions,\" adding that \"research shows certain partisan divisions in our society have been growing for many decades, long before platforms like Facebook ever existed.\" Facebook said its researchers constantly run experiments to study and improve the algorithm's rankings, adding that thousands of metrics are considered before content is shown to users. Anna Stepanov, Facebook's head of app integrity, told CBS News the rankings powering the News Feed evolve based on new data from direct user surveys. The documents indicate that Facebook did change some of the rankings behind the News Feed algorithm after feedback from researchers. One internal memo from January of last year shows Facebook lowered the weight of \"Angry\" reactions from five points to 1.5. That was then lowered to zero in September of 2020. In February, Facebook announced that it is beginning tests to reduce the distribution of political content in the News Feed for a small percentage of users in the U.S. and Canada. The program was expanded earlier this month to include other countries. CBS News reporter covering the intersection between politics and tech.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, Washington is still reeling from Wednesday's deadly siege at the Capitol, and America is on edge, as the clock ticks down on the last days of the Trump administration. The scenes of violence and destruction are still horrifying, made even more disturbing by where and when the rioters waged their war last week.\u00a0PRESIDENT-ELECT JOE BIDEN: An unprecedented assault on our democracy, an assault literally on the citadel of liberty, in the United States Capitol itself.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Five lives, including a Capitol police officer, were lost as a result of this national disgrace. Questions about poor preparation for an event advertised by President Trump as wild, and the disastrous response from law enforcement continue to grow. A mob of Mister Trump's followers were incited by the President himself to try and overturn the election by disrupting the certification of electoral votes.\u00a0PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to the Capitol. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: They failed; democracy succeeded. Another challenge: Punishment or at least accountability for actions. Across the country law enforcement is working to round up the extremists. Nearly one hundred have been charged so far. As for Mister Trump, congressional Democrats and some Republicans say his actions are reprehensible.\u00a0SENATOR PAT TOOMEY: Well, I think the best way for our country, Chuck, is for the President to resign and go away as soon as possible.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll cover it all with two key senators, Missouri Republican Roy Blunt, and Delaware Democrat Chris Coons. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and former head of cybersecurity for the Trump administration, Chris Krebs. Then, a look at the devastating surge of COVID-19, and more on that new strain of the virus. Former FDA commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb will be with us. And, finally, it wouldn't be a major Washington political story without the legendary Bob Schieffer. He and John Dickerson will both be with us today.\u00a0It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It's a quiet Sunday here in the nation's Capitol, but the next ten days promise to be anything but as we get closer to inauguration day. One reason it's quiet: The President's Twitter account has been silenced forever. President Trump remains at the White House, and there is apprehension about what he might do next. He has not spoken to Vice President Pence, who is still being given the silent treatment following Mister Trump's attacks on him for not sabotaging the electoral vote process. That stinging rebuke of his loyal follower has upset even close allies of the President. We are told the President himself has privately acknowledged that Mister Pence got a bad deal, but he has not publicly condemned those who stormed the Capitol chanting \"Hang Mike Pence.\"\u00a0CROWD (in unison): Hang Mike Pence. Hang Mike Pence.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: High ranking officials discussed invoking the Twenty-Fifth Amendment, where the President would be removed by a vote from his cabinet. That option still exists. But as of now, no proposal has been submitted to the vice president. The President refuses to resign, and he plans to travel this week to highlight his work at the border. An article of impeachment will be introduced in the House tomorrow, and speaker Nancy Pelosi has asked Congress to prepare to return to Washington. 60 MINUTES correspondent Lesley Stahl sat down with the speaker Friday. We begin with a preview from tonight's broadcast.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0LESLEY STAHL (60 MINUTES): What if he pardons himself?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (60 MINUTES): What if he pardons these people who are terrorists on the Capitol?\u00a0LESLEY STAHL (60 MINUTES): Or pardons himself.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (60 MINUTES): What if he does that? He can only pardon himself from federal offenses. He cannot pardon himself from state offenses, and that's where he's being investigated in the state of New York.\u00a0LESLEY STAHL (60 MINUTES): There is a possibility that after all of this, there's no punishment, no consequence, and he could run again for President?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (60 MINUTES): And that's one of the motivations that people have for advocating for impeachment.\u00a0LESLEY STAHL (60 MINUTES): Won't that take more than the ten days? I mean does it actually make sense?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (60 MINUTES): Well, I like the Twenty-Fifth Amendment because it gets rid of him, he's out of office. But there is strong support in the Congress for impeaching the President a second time.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: More of Lesley Stahl's interview will air tonight on 60 MINUTES.\u00a0We want to go now to Missouri Republican Senator Roy Blunt. He is the head of the congressional committee overseeing the inauguration and the outgoing chairman of one of the two committees investigating what went wrong with security last Wednesday. Good morning to you, Senator.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT (R-Missouri/@RoyBlunt): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, we have received sad news this morning from Capitol Hill Police that another officer has died. It's described as an off-duty death. Do you know if there's any connection to the events of this week?\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: You know, I don't know. I-- Officer Sicknick, now Officer Liebengood, both the-- their lives were end-- ended this week. I'll be interested in finding out if there was a connection with Officer Liebengood. But, mostly, I'm interested in reaching out to both of these families. These are people we saw every day, particularly Officer Liebengood, who was very much assigned to the Senate side of the building. And, you know, you have that loss. You have four other deaths of people who got involved in something that they absolutely should not have gotten involved in. And it was a tragedy even if it had been limited just to that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: But then when you see this all over the world, you-- citizens of the United States storming the Capitol of the United States, certainly something I thought I would never see. And I'm glad we got back into the Capitol and got our work done that day where we were supposed to get it done to send that signal. But the signal around the world couldn't have been more helpful to our adversaries--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --than it was. It was a sad and terrible day in the history of the country.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I think we agree with you on that, Sir. I appreciate your kind words about these particular officers. I have to ask you, though, about some of the images that have been projected around the world as well, which are of some of those officers appearing to remove barriers for rioters to allow them in. There are reports that some actually gave information on where to find certain congressional offices. Is there any indication of involvement or complicity from members of the Capitol Police?\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: No, no. And I resent any sense that the Capitol Police didn't push back, fight back valiantly get out there and stand between first the building and then the people in the building that they're there to protect. Now, Senator Klobuchar and I have announced we're going to look into this, both the planning and whether the support was imminent. Certainly, the support from the DC police was quick and incredibly helpful. I know the mayor's coming on later today. They were here.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: They were here almost immediately when asked to be. I think we have to think about why the National Guard didn't get here quicker, but the-- the Capitol Police fought back. You can do anything with looking at film, not knowing what you're talking about. I do know when you're overwhelmed in law enforcement, one of the things you do is try to step back and regroup--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT:\u00a0 --rather than get yours-- let yourself get surrounded. Senator Coons is on later. He and I formed the Law Enforcement Caucus when we came to the--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --Senate ten years ago. We-- we see these officers often. We reach out more than most members do to them. They are-- put their lives on the line every day--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --particularly last Wednesday. And I deeply resent any suggestion that these officers didn't do everything they could do.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Two Republican senators have now called for the President to resign. Should he?\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Well, it would be up to him, but my-- my view would be what the President should do is now finish the last ten days of his presidency.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So no?\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: No.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Your fellow Republicans have been quite critical, including Liz Cheney, including Mitt Romney, who called this an insurrection and said that the President was directly involved. Justice Department affidavits have individuals saying they came here because the President told him to-- them to. Is the President a danger to the country?\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Well, I think the President's decisions and his actions that day and leading up to that day on this topic were clearly reckless. I said that very early in the evening on Wednesday, that this was a tragic day for the-- the country and the President had some-- had involvement in that. But--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Are Republican leaders going to hold them accountable in any way for it?\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Well, I think the country is the-- the right way to hold Presidents accountable. The President should be very careful over the next ten days that his behavior is what you'd expect from the leader of the greatest country in the world. Now, my personal view is that the President touched the hot stove on Wednesday and is unlikely to touch it again. And if that's the case, I think-- we-- we get-- every day, we get closer to the last day of his presidency. We should be thinking more about the first day--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --of the next presidency than the last day of his presidency, in my view. And I'll be there on that day as the chairman of that event seeing the new President sworn in. The-- President Trump says he's not coming.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: I hope Vice President Pence does, and I was proud to see the vice president step up as I was standing there right with him as one of the four members of Congress that count those electoral ballots and do what the law required us to do.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but your fellow Missouri Senator Josh Hawley was on the other side of that. Do you think that he was complicit, along with the five other senators who continued to propagate this lie, that there could be a change to the outcome of the election on Wednesday?\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Well-- well, I only have one vote in the Senate, which is my vote. Now I did-- the day Senator Hawley announced he'd be contesting those electoral votes, announced that I would not be. When Senator Cruz said he had a plan to put in case-- put back in-- in place a commission like the one formed in 1877--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --I said that wouldn't happen. I'm not-- I wasn't interested then or now in spending a lot of time on things that can't happen--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So no sanction?\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --just like the impeachment-- just like the impeachment of the President, to remove him from office clearly is not going to happen between now and the last day he's in office. And that's another thing--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't support-- you don't believe he has committed an impeachable offense?\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: I don't think there's any-- that's not really the question. The question is--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNN: Well, it's my question.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --is there any-- is there any-- well, I'm giving you my answer. Is there any likelihood that he could possibly be removed between now and January the 20th? And if there's no additional ensuing event my-- my belief is there is no possibility of that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: And so, as Nancy Pelosi just said, and as Jim Clyburn said--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --earlier today, this is more of a long-term punishment of the President--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --than trying to remove him from office. That's when--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: That's right.\u00a0SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --the politics take over and the protecting the government is left behind.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We'll see if you have a different answer in the new Congress. Sir, thank you for your time this morning.\u00a0We turn now to the mayor of Washington, DC, Muriel Bowser. Madam Mayor, thank you for joining us this morning. I know you have put this city under public emergency until the day after inauguration. There are about six thousand National Guard troops who will be here. Those members, some of them will be armed. Do you think the city is prepared now for what's about to come?\u00a0MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER (D-District of Columbia/@MayorBowser): Well, I will tell you that given the events of last week, that this inauguration preparation has to be different than any other inauguration with only ten days to go. Today, I'm-- I'm requesting from the department of-- the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, that they take additional steps, including expanding the length of the time that this national special security event is in place, which is-- we're asking it to be extended from January 19th, back to January the 11th. Further, I am asking that they extend the perimeter of their coverage area for this national security special event, which is the inauguration, to include the Capitol. Later today I'm going to send a letter to the President of the United States asking to-- that he declare a pre-emergency declaration for the District of Columbia that will allow for further federal coordination.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: There were pipe bombs that were discovered in Washington at the Democratic National Committee and at the Republican National Committee. Who planted them? What do you know?\u00a0MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER: I know that the FBI is investigating that and we should take it very seriously. I think what we-- we have seen is real domestic terrorism in our nation's capital, and-- and that's what we need to call it. Who we saw charging the Capitol building were trained people in-- in many cases, former military, former law enforcement. I think we may find other-- other trained people, trained at marching and surging and sieging buildings. So we have to take it seriously. We too, have to take seriously how we're spreading our resources. That's why we're very focused on making sure that the federal government is providing enough coverage for federal facilities, including the-- the Capitol, but many federal buildings across the district so that other law enforcement, our-- our law enforcement can focus on other threats across the district's eight wards.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Madam Mayor, there's a lot of finger pointing, as you know, about exactly how this happened on Wednesday. Back on January 5th, you sent a letter to the Pentagon and the Justice Department saying the district is not requesting other federal law enforcement personnel and discourages any additional deployments without immediate notification and consultation with the police if such plans are underway. Do you think this letter played a role in the underreaction?\u00a0MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER: No. I-- I-- what I know is that the district prior to that had already requested federal support, and had been granted it in the form of the DC National Guard. And the DC National Guard had been deployed and received its assignment. What we called-- that letter calls attention to the federal government or other federal policing agencies and asks the federal government to coordinate with us if they were going to be on DC streets. That letter has nothing to do with the-- the Capitol or other federal facilities.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Did your police officers here expect the FBI and Homeland Security to warn them about this event? I mean, was there more federal warning that you expected to get that you did not?\u00a0MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER: I think that we always work hand in hand on these events, as we will on the inauguration, on gathering intelligence. Certainly we gather intelligence locally, but the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have vast resources and the ability to keep us posted each and every day. I have asked-- and the Department of Homeland Security and will further discuss with the FBI how they can enhance those intelligence-sharing activities with us directly.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Before this event happened Wednesday, the leader of the Proud Boys was arrested almost immediately after he arrived here in Washington. And he had high-capacity magazines on him. He landed here with weaponry. So was there no indication that there was something more than just a political rally being planned?\u00a0MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER: Well, certainly we were on the lookout for-- for weapons and we-- we saw him with this magazine that could carry bullets, but we're always on the lookout for weapons. And, in fact, the demonstration zone that we established prior to this event, we made clear to anyone in the public that--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. Okay.\u00a0MAYOR MURIEL BOWSER: --they cannot carry weapons in those zones.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Madam Mayor, good luck. Thank you for your time.\u00a0FACE THE NATION will be back in a minute. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who joins us from Wilmington. Good morning to you, Senator.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS (D-Delaware/@ChrisCoons): Good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the Capitol safe?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I pray and hope that it is. It is more urgent than ever that we flood the zone around the Capitol with federal resources to ensure the safe transfer of power to President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris in ten days when virtually the entire Congress will be assembled again and when these two next elected leaders of our nation will be inaugurated.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You're close to the president-elect who tweeted yesterday, \"Our president is not above the law. Justice serves the people--it doesn't protect the powerful.\" What does that supposed to mean? Does he support potentially prosecuting President Trump?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Well, Margaret, President-elect Biden is focused on the enormous challenges that will face him when he becomes president ten days from now. It is up to Congress in the next ten days, to work to ensure the safety and security of our country, to press successfully, hopefully, for President Trump to resign, or for Vice President Pence to enact what he can do under the 25th Amendment. President Trump, by his actions over the last two months since the election, has lost the right to be President and by the actions this past Wednesday and his failure to take any responsibility or show any remorse for it of significance--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: --I think he doesn't deserve to be President anymore.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he won't be in ten days, regardless of what happens. Should he be prosecuted after he leaves office? You sit on Senate Judiciary. Do you think that would be appropriate?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I think there needs to be accountability for his actions. Whether that comes through the New York attorney general or the U.S. Department of Justice we'll have to leave for now. But many of my Republican colleagues are now calling for healing and for us to come together.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I'll tell you that there can only be reconciliation with repentance. And I think the single most important thing that Republicans in Congress who helped facilitate this widespread conspiracy theory that somehow the election was stolen and the most important thing that President Trump can do in these remaining ten days is to stop those lies and to persuade their followers and supporters that President-elect Biden is the duly elected President of the United States. That's what Mike Pence certified on Wednesday night once we returned to the Capitol. That's what Senators Blunt and Klobuchar certified. That's an important next step if we are, in fact, going to have any healing.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard Senator Blunt, who is in Republican leadership, decline to say if there'd be any sanction for the senators who stood on the floor even after the siege and continued to protest the certification of the election. Should there be consequences for them?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: I've called for them to resign, and, Margaret, what I'll be looking for in the coming days and weeks is whether they take any accountability, whether they take any actions that will actually persuade some of their many voters and supporters and constituents that they know what they did was wrong. In the case of Missouri, Senator Blunt's home state and Senator Hawley's home state, the two major newspapers, former Senator Danforth, one of the major supporters of Senator Hawley, have all denounced him.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: The papers have called for him to resign.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: And I think that's the sort of public indication that he's done something profoundly wrong here that should be followed by action from those in Congress who helped instigate this tragic event on Wednesday.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you vote to convict the President if the House does impeach him?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Yes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And what would that serve, because, as you know, the argument against it from Republicans is that it would be furtherly-- further divisive to the country and that it would derail President-elect Biden's legislative agenda.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Look, I understand the concerns that just as President Biden takes over responsibility for leading our nation through this tragic pandemic that we might be distracted by weeks in the Senate by a Senate trial. That's why I have called for President Trump to do the right thing finally and resign--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: --or for Vice President Pence to secure the next ten days through the 25th Amendment. Margaret, we have two pandemics raging through this country right now. One of them is this COVID-19 pandemic and the other is the pandemic of division and distrust. The way to deal with them is by telling people the truth--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: --that vaccines work, that we need good role models in terms of masking and social distancing, and that this was a free and fair election where Joe Biden was elected. We need folks who are willing to stand up and tell the truth in Congress.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Domestic terrorism is not technically a federal crime. The president-elect has called these attackers domestic terrorists. Should this be a federal crime?\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: Yes, and I am encouraged that already a hundred individuals have been arrested and charged with both state and federal offenses. Look, we narrowly avoided what could have been an even more tragic night. When I saw the images of folks rioting through the Senate chamber with zip ties and with weapons, a crowd chanting \"Hang Mike Pence.\" That is truly chilling. This wasn't just a disruptive riot. This was an attempted coup, the most significant in the history of our republic, because the purpose of these rioters was to interrupt the--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0SENATOR CHRIS COONS: --certification of the vote that Joe Biden is the next President. This was an alarming and tragic event.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, we're glad you're safe. We thank you for joining us today.\u00a0And we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Just ahead, two of the best in the business will be with us, former FACE THE NATION moderators John Dickerson and Bob Schieffer. Both have some thoughts and analysis to share. We'll have that ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll take a look at the role of social media and cybersecurity, and we'll talk with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb ahead.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. For more context on some of the online discourse that fueled the assault on the Capito we want to go now to the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Chris Krebs. Good to have you back with us.\u00a0CHRIS KREBS (Former Director, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency): Hey, good morning, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The Wall Street Journal has reported that the FBI and Homeland Security never issued a threat assessment to local law enforcement here in DC about what happened on Wednesday ahead of time. Given that there were explicit online conversations about storming the Capitol, how is it possible that this was not a known threat?\u00a0CHRIS KREBS: So, you know, I'm sure that the ensuing investigation will get to the bottom of what happened. I-- I think to a certain extent we may have had some negative learning from the summer's protests and riots and maybe there was an overreaction in the wrong way that led to some of the-- some of the breakdowns here. But, again, there's an investigation. But to be clear, you know, we-- at least when I was there, we certainly anticipated physical violence as the ultimate manifestation of the President and the campaigns' and his attorneys' and his supporters' claims that the election was rigged or stolen. And, you know, those claims continue. The latest dog whistle is election irregularities.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0CHRIS KREBS: So, those that are promoting these-- this narrative, these conspiracies have to stop. They have to denounce these-- these claims.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, Homeland Security warned back in October that right-wing groups may use political rallies and they actually pose a direct threat in terms of action. But then during the Black Lives Matter protests this summer, you know, the homeland security secretary was on this program and others touting the fact that the federal government could put federal agents in cities, whether mayors or governors wanted them there or not, that they had the power to do more. So, you know, why not do more if within the agency there were the threats that you just highlighted? Whose fault is that?\u00a0CHRIS KREBS: Again, the investigations will get down to it. The-- and particularly in the District of Columbia, the federal authorities on federal land, like the National Mall, like the Capitol grounds, have even greater authorities than they would in-- in any American city. So, clearly, there was some sort of coordination and preplanning breakdown. You know, what I would be thinking about right now is what happens on the 20th--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0CHRIS KREBS: --what are the protections that are going to be in place. But-- but there is an opportunity here, I think, to-- to prevent further-- further bloodshed. And-- and I don't know if the President is capable of doing it, but he has to resign. He has to tell his supporters that he lied to them, that this was all his own fraud. He has to come out. We have to set an example for the rest of the free world that attempted coups, which is what this was, will not be tolerated. And there has to be an accountability. So whether it's the Twenty-Fifth Amendment push, whether it's an impeachment, the President needs to be held accountable for-- for supporting and really inciting the activity of this past week.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And our reporting shows that he has no intention to do that, to resign. We know, though, that he does plan, and our CBS News team is reporting, he does plan to speak tomorrow. But we're told it's going to be to blast big tech for decisions like what Twitter just did to ban him. We also know Apple, Amazon, Google, they have blocked the Parler app, which has also been used as a forum to plan these kind of events. What is the impact of that?\u00a0CHRIS KREBS: Well, look, I think at this point, particularly after Wednesday, the President's legacy is a heap of ashes. There's-- there's nothing redeemable at this point, given the fact that he incited this attempt to overturn democracy, a fair and free election. The-- there is an opportunity, though, for a redemption story. Again, he can resign. He can tell his supporters that it was all a long-- a big con and that he is sorry. I don't know if he's capable of doing it, but that's the best way to prevent further violence, to prevent further erosion of confidence in democracy--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0CHRIS KREBS: --over the next four years. And every single Republican on the Hill that continues to support these erection-- election irregularities has to do the same thing. They have to denounce it and they have to come back to the middle.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And, yet, on the issue of cyber and social media, which you've spent a lot of time thinking about, a lot of conservatives are speaking out not against the President and his use of it, but against the idea that Twitter is censoring somehow conservative thought. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is likely to run in 2024, is out there tweeting \"This is un-American and a tactic of the left.\" Is this a free speech issue?\u00a0CHRIS KREBS: No. The First Amendment doesn't apply to private sector organizations. That-- that's not how this works. That's government in-- impeding speech and the-- and the ability to hear. And that's not what's happening here. These are companies that have their-- their own ability to enforce their-- their standards and their policies. I think there was a legitimate public policy interest over the last four plus years in-- of maintaining the President and his voice on Twitter and-- and other platforms. But-- but, clearly, what is-- what he has done has-- has exceeded any reasonable public--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0CHRIS KREBS: --policy interest. Now, the-- the-- the hard part is in, you know, implementing these standards--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0CHRIS KREBS: --globally, consistently. Other foreign leaders, for instance, you know, they need to be consistent. They need to probably take similar action.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Chris Krebs, thank you for your time.\u00a0We asked senior national correspondent Bob Schieffer to take a look at reaction to the last week's-- sorry, Mark Strassmann to take a look at events around the country. Here is his report.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0(Crowd protesting)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Vengeance is ours, sayeth the mob. And they're still saying--\u00a0MAN #1: I'm really glad it needed to happen.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: --days after mega-mania rampaged through an American sanctuary. Was the moment heroic or horrific? Partisans got in each other's face.\u00a0MAN #2: You all (EXPLETIVE DELETED) bunch of terrorists.\u00a0MAN #3: No, we're not.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: But for some Trump loyalists, it's an inflection point.\u00a0GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS (R-Florida): You can be disappointed in whatever, but you can't just go in and ransack public places like that.\u00a0SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Count me out. Enough is enough.\u00a0MAN #4 (Oreo Express): You are a traitor, Lindsey Graham.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Trump die-hards turned on Senator Lindsey Graham after that.\u00a0MAN #4 (Oreo Express): Welcome to the new America, Lindsey.\u00a0MAN #5 (Oreo Express): (INDISTINCT).\u00a0MAN #6 (Oreo Express): This is the rest of your life.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: This video shows the first family Wednesday morning, right before the President's inflammatory speech.\u00a0DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR (@DonaldTrumpJR; internet video): I think we're (INDISTINCT) a couple of seconds here, guys.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: A couple hours later, the mob trampled the Constitution, and Rosanne Boyland of Kennesaw, Georgia.\u00a0JUSTIN CAVE (Victim's Brother-in-Law): The President's words incited a riot that killed four of his biggest fans.\u00a0(Crowd protesting)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Protesters also stormed the Washington State governor's mansion. More protests in Arizona, Florida, Minnesota,2 and the Kansas statehouse.\u00a0CROWD (in unison): Stop the steal. Stop the steal.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Talk of more violence now scuttles across social media. Our American ideal is still at risk. Democracy or ochlocracy, rule by the mob.\u00a0Mark Strassmann, CBS News, Atlanta.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by our resident presidential historian John Dickerson. Good morning, thank you for coming in.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON (CBS News 60 MINUTES Correspondent/@jdickerson): Good morning, Margaret. Great to be with you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it was just two weeks ago Gallup poll said that Donald Trump is the most popular man in America. And now we're talking about calls for his resignation inciting an insurrection. I mean, does all of this end when he leaves office?\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: You know, the President's son and son-in-law said that it's no longer the Republican Party, it's Donald Trump's party. So I think of your question in two ways: what happens to Donald Trump, and what happens to the political market he created that future Republican politicians are going to try to appeal to? After the election, the President said the-- the election was stolen. Republican lawmakers knew that was a lie. They knew there was a cost to that lie. But because of the political market Donald Trump had created, what Donald Trump said was true was true, and those lawmakers worried about blowback. So instead of a healthy political market, where facts, reason and tradition operate, this is a market where facts are whatever you want it to be. Persuasion didn't matter. Demonization mattered. So that fills up a rally crowd, right? Politically, it cost Republicans the presidency and the House and the Senate. Governing wise, the founders told us this was a terrible way to work where you have the-- the standard for the presidency to be just what the rally crowd likes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: The standard should be the one Mitt Romney said, which is sometimes you honor your voters by telling them the truth. So, what standard survives? Is-- is there reflection about the choices that were made? Does somebody stand up now against lies? Or does the market that Donald Trump created exist? And if that's the case, then this insurrection was just an inconvenience, and that market exists, and Donald Trump will have a big role in that in the future.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: There is still fear of that market?\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Absolute fear. Absolute even after-- I mean, perhaps even more, given what happened on the 6th of January.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, right. Because Republicans have seen the muscles that can be flexed.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Exactly.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to, I mean, some of the extraordinary things we-- we heard and we saw this week, you know, the President has, yes, he told people to go home. But then he said, we love you. You're patriots. He has not come out and said anything about the chance calling for his vice president to be executed, John?\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: You're-- you're exactly right, Margaret. This to me was there are a lot of ways in which the President contributed to what happened on the 6th. But the example of what he was willing to trample in order to get his way is clearest in-- in the grotesque treatment of his vice president. He-- he says loyalty is the most important thing. No one has been more loyal to this President than Mike Pence. He has wagered his entire repetition defending the President. How was he repaid? The President said he could stop the count in Congress. He knew that to be a lie. When Mike Pence didn't do that because he couldn't it, the President said he lacked courage. He put a target on the back of his vice president. And what happened? As sure as night follows day, those-- those rioters said hang Mike Pence. Hang Mike Pence. What gave them the idea that Mike Pence had done anything worthy of a hanging? Well, the President of the United States told them that, the person to whom Mike Pence was loyal. That's pretty low.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And he tweeted blasting Mike Pence while the siege was happening, and, yet, we haven't heard a-- a separation from the President. I mean, how do you put the genie back in the bottle at-- at this point?\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: You'd-- I don't think you do put the genie back in the bottle because that political market is still operating that I was--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: --talking about. People are still fearful. And, you know, we still have some number of days to go in which all-- a lot of this free-float-- floating anger is still out there. The President is still saying that the election was stolen.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And that gives energy to that free-floating anger.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, he doesn't have a social media platform on which to propagate that now, which is why there's going to be so much more focus on if and when he finally speaks to us. We know he is planning a speech tomorrow, and again Tuesday to make some public remarks. But, I mean, it's hard to find any kind of silver lining--\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --at the end of this week. But there are those who-- I mean, I-- I certainly noticed how diplomats that I follow are trying to explain this to the rest of the world as they watch--\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --beacon of democracy look pretty dim this week.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you found any hope here?\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Well, when the U.S. Capitol is a crime scene, it's pretty hard to find hope. But hope is the power to be optimistic when times look desperate. And there was already a test of democracy before January 6th. It was to hold an election in the middle of a pandemic.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: And what happened? The country, Republicans and Democrats turned out in record numbers. People stood in line, there was no violence and the states changed all their procedures to accommodate this. And it succeeded. And they did recounts and they were challenged. And those local officials did what is the central attributive character. They did what they were supposed to do. They didn't do the easy or political thing. Pressure, pressure, pressure, they did-- they kept the faith. Then, who else kept the faith? All the local officials in those states, then the courts. All of these challenges came, people with the political interests, nevertheless, did what their job told them to do, not what was politically expedient. The Department of Justice didn't go after the President's opponents as he would have liked them to do. The military kept their faith, not doing what the President would like them to do. And then Congress, after the grotesque experience on the 6th, nevertheless, got together--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: --held the vote. It took place. There is hope that can be accessed. What we need is a leader who can grab that hope. The stage is ready for them, somebody else to step up.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: John Dickerson, thank you--\u00a0JOHN DICKERSON: Thanks, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --for your thoughts. Good to have you here.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: In addition to the political turmoil in these final days of the Trump administration, vaccine distribution remains problematic. The CDC reports nearly seven million first doses of the vaccine have been received. That's only thirty percent of the total distributed across the country. Meanwhile, infections continue to soar. Thursday was the deadliest day yet. Almost forty-two hundred people died from COVID-19. There have now been over twenty-two million cases and more than three hundred and seventy-two thousand are dead.\u00a0We want to go now to former FDA commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He sits on the board of Pfizer and Illumina, a company that is working on sequencing some of the new virus variants. He joins us from Westport, Connecticut, this morning. Good morning to you.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: There are more people in this country hospitalized with COVID now than during the spring and summer combined. How much are these new strains from the U.K., from South Africa, contributing to this surge?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Probably not a lot right now. We're-- we don't know for sure because we're not doing sequencing at a-- at a big enough scale like the U.K. is to really detect these variants. We're looking for the U.K. variant right now, but the method that we're using to try to detect the U.K. variant wouldn't necessarily spot the South African variant. So, right now we think the prevalence of the U.K. variant is about 0.2 to maybe 0.3 percent of infections. And that's based on data that Illumina has helped develop. With the South Africa variant, we don't think it's very prevalent here in the United States, but we could be missing more of those infections. So we don't think that these new variants right now are contributing to the surge of infection that we're seeing. We think this is a post-holiday bounce, but the bottom line is that we need a better system for detecting these things so we can have an adequate public health response.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And how resistant are they to current treatments?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, they-- they appear more fit, meaning that they spread more easily, both of these variants. We've done some initial analysis with the U.K. variant, particularly with respect to the vaccines and the monoclonal antibodies, and the medical products that we have right now do appear to be effective against that U.K. variant. There's more concern around the South African variant because that variant has mutated the spike protein, the protein that's the target for our vaccines and our antibodies in a way that could defeat at least the antibodies and perhaps make the vaccines less effective. We're going to have data on the vaccines in the next couple of weeks. Pfizer, the company I'm on the board of, is working on developing some of that data. So, we'll have a better answer on that question. But it just goes to show you that these viruses are going to evolve. I mean this virus has been running through the world, around the world, racing around the world largely unchecked. It's been under some selective pressure with the widespread use, for example, of convalescent plasma. So it's inevitable that we're going to see these kinds of mutations in this virus. And this is probably going to be a constant struggle. We're going to have to update our vaccines and our antibody drugs and other therapeutics regularly to keep up with these new variants as they emerge.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: The White House task force told some state governors this week that there may be a new American variant of this virus. Then the CD-- said-- C said yesterday. Basically, they're still trying to figure it out and it could take weeks or months to identify. Is there something that is making this surge worse right now other than our own bad behavior?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I don't think so. And the people I've spoken to don't think so. There is a variant in the U.S. that has become the predominant variant right now that's different than the original infection. But that's inevitable that you're going to see evolution in the strains that are circulating. There's no evidence to suggest that it's more fit, more transmissible. And we don't think this South African variant and the U.K. variant are very prevalent here right now. But the game has changed on the vaccine, to go back to the discussion you were having at the top of this-- this hit. We really need to get this vaccine out more quickly because this is really our only tool, our only backstop against the spread of these new variants. If we can get a lot of people vaccinated quickly, we might be able to get enough protective immunity into the population that this stops spreading at the rate that it is. So, we need to acknowledge that it's not working. We need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy in trying to get out to patients.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean there's only ten days left to the Trump administration, but they started to acknowledge that the federal plan has some problems because they told states to maybe broaden out who they make the vaccine available to. The President-elect now says he's going to do what you've been talking about, which is release all available supply as soon as he takes office. But does releasing supply solve the problem here if it's really about uptake?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, it's a distribution issue right now. It will be a supply issue in two or three weeks, maybe if they can get the distribution right. Right now there's forty million doses sitting on a shelf somewhere. So the feds say it's with the states. The states say with-- it's with the feds. It really doesn't matter to the patient who is not getting access to the-- to the injection. You have forty million on the shelf. We have fifty million Americans above the age of sixty-five. So, we have supply to push it out to that population more aggressively. I think we need to take an all of the above approach and push it out through different channels, including the big box stores, including federal sites that the Biden administration is talking about standing up. We need to try everything right now to create multiple distribution points. A lot of senior citizens aren't going to want to go to a, you know, a stadium to get an inoculation. They're going to want to go to a pharmacy, a local pharmacy or a doctor's office. So, we need to provide more opportunity for people to get a vaccination where they're comfortable getting it.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: But we do need to get these out more aggressively. Right now, you're right, it's a distribution issue. It will become a supply issue once we get the-- the logistics down, right. And we don't have that right now. We aren't doing a good job getting this to patients.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Was the siege of the Capitol this week potentially a super-spreader event?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Of course. I mean there's going to be chains of transmission that come out of that kind of mass gathering and the crowd wasn't adhering to what we know are good practices in terms of mask wearing and other things. And I think-- I think they deliberately eschewed those things. So, yeah, we're going to see chains of transmission come out of that kind of a gathering, for sure.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be watching it. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you for your time this morning.\u00a0We'll be back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: During this administration there has been no shortage of historic yet excruciatingly painful events. But even the most seasoned Washington veteran journalists were shocked by the attack on the Capitol, incited by our own President. As we worked on putting this broadcast together, we knew there was one voice we had to hear from: Bob Schieffer. And he joins us to reflect on the end of a volatile four years. Bob.\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: Margaret, America has never experienced anything like the Trump presidency.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: It is ending as it began--in chaos, controversy, and confusion. He told us America was broken, and only he could fix it. His reign mirrored his own chaotic life. He lurched from one crisis to another, from financial windfalls to bankruptcies, from tabloid scandals to audacious lies. He introduced us to a bizarre cast of characters, from porn stars to the crackpots and clowns who inhabit the dark fringes of American politics. Some, like Rudy Giuliani seemed to melt before our eyes, as his hair dye trickled down his cheek during a news conference. Most he touched were diminished by the experience. Others, who sought power by riding the back of the tiger, wound up inside. He played down the pandemic and found kind words for Vladimir Putin put and Kim Jong-un, but seemed determined to drive a wedge between America and our traditional allies. Yes, the stock market went up, but the nation's deficit and national debt ballooned to record levels. As we saw in those awful scenes unfolding in the Capitol, we came to understand that the man who had a manic desire for power had no real understanding of the power he possessed, or what happens when it is misused. He will be gone soon, but he showed us America was not broken; he was.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob, thank you for sharing your thoughts. It's so good to have you here.\u00a0BOB SCHIEFFER: Thank you, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: At the end of a tough week, we want to say thank you to the journalists who covered the historic and horrific events, and thank you to the first responders who rushed to protect them, lawmakers, and everyone at the Capitol. Thank you all for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "NATO said Wednesday it would expel eight Russian diplomats that it alleges were operating as \"undeclared Russian intelligence officers,\" in a sign strained relations between Moscow and Western powers continue to worsen. \u00a0 The alliance will also reduce from 20 to 10 the size of Moscow's diplomatic representation in NATO's Brussels headquarters, according to a spokesperson. \u00a0 \"We can confirm we have withdrawn the accreditation of eight members of the Russian Mission to NATO, who were undeclared Russian intelligence officers,\" the spokesperson said. \"NATO's policy towards Russia remains consistent. We have strengthened our deterrence and defence in response to Russia's aggressive actions, while at the same time we remain open for a meaningful dialogue.\"\u00a0 The spokesperson did not elaborate on what actions by Russia had triggered the measure. NATO previously expelled seven diplomats and reduced Moscow's delegation from 30 to 20 in 2018, following the poisoning in the United Kingdom of former Russian military intelligence officer Sergei Skripal.\u00a0 Several Western countries, including the United States, have recently expelled Russian officers for a variety of reasons, including espionage, election interference, and cyber intrusions. The Biden administration imposed a raft of sanctions on Russia this spring, citing \"reckless and adversarial actions\" by the Kremlin. \u00a0 Relations between NATO and Moscow have steadily deteriorated since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. The massive buildup of Russian military forces on Ukraine's border in the spring \u2013 which Moscow claimed at the time were planned exercises \u2013 further exacerbated tensions. \u00a0 Senior Russian lawmaker Leonid Slutsky told the Interfax news agency that Russia would retaliate with unspecified \"asymmetric\" measures. \u00a0 Representatives from Russia and NATO met last month during the United Nations General Assembly, where, at the start of the session, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov quipped to reporters that \"Russia does not intend to join NATO.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Shakira says she was attacked by two wild boars while in Barcelona, Spain. The singer took to Instagram to explain the harrowing tale to her followers, saying the boars attacked her and stole her bag while she was in a park with her son, Milan. \"Look at how two wild boar which attacked me in the park have left my bag,\" Shakira said in the Instagram story, according to BBC News. She showed the bag, which appeared covered in dirt. \"They were taking my bag to the woods with my mobile phone in it,\" she said. \"They've destroyed everything.\" She then asked her 8-year-old son about the incident. \"Milan, tell the truth. Say how your mummy stood up to the wild boar,\" she said, according to the BBC. While the incident seems bizarre, Shakira is just one victim in a string of attacks by wild boars in Barcelona.\u00a0 In 2016, police in Spain received 1,187 calls about hogs attacking dogs, running into cars and holding up traffic. And the problem made headlines in 2013, when a police officer attempted to shoot a wild boar but missed and accidentally hit his partner, BBC News reports.\u00a0 The number of boars has exploded across Europe \u2013 not just in Spain \u2013 with more than 10 million across the continent. Not only can they be aggressive, but they can carry disease \u2014 and they can survive in almost any environment, including cities, where they can feed off garbage.\u00a0 In Italy last year, a police officer killed a family of wild boars in a playground with a tranquilizer dart and lethal injections, which sparked outrage, BBC News reports.\u00a0 Videos from Rome last week show groups of wild boars rampaging the city and eating garbage. The ongoing boar issue has even spilled over into Rome's mayoral race, with Mayor Virginia Raggi, who is seeking re-election, filing a legal suit earlier this month accusing the Lazio region of failing to keep the animals out of the capital, according to Reuters. The region denied her accusations, saying management of the animals around Rome is up to the city's councils. \"Even walking to school...has become dangerous here,\" Nunzia Cammino, who lives in Rome, told Reuters.\u00a0 And as wild boars wandering into Germany from Poland spread African swine fever, Germany last week asked the European Commission to help them put up a fence to counter the spread. The disease is harmless to humans but fatal for pigs, which can lead to a loss in pork exports.\u00a0 A fence helped Denmark decrease the number of boars crossing its borders from Germany in 2020. In 2019, European Union's executive approved Poland's plan to slaughter 200,000 wild boars to protect farm pigs from the disease, the Associated Press reports.

            "article_content": "Former President George W. Bush issued a dire warning on Saturday while commemorating the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks, saying international extremists are not the only threats to the country's safety. In the wake of stark political and social division in the U.S., Mr. Bush said that \"violence that gathers within\" is equally as dangerous as extremists abroad.\u00a0 \"We have seen growing evidence that the dangers to our country can come not only across borders, but in violence that gathers within,\" Mr. Bush, who was president on 9/11, said. \"There is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and those at home. But in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit, and it is our duty to confront them.\" Mr. Bush's remarks came eight months after hundreds of supporters of former President Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol building in an effort to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Of the more than 570 people arrested for their part in the attack, officials said at least 83 have ties to extremist groups, including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers and Three Percenters.\u00a0 Members of far-right extremist groups are also expected to attend a rally\u00a0at the U.S. Capitol on September 18 to demand \"justice\" for those who have been charged in the Capitol attack.\u00a0 Mr. Bush spoke Saturday from the site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in 2001. The hijacked plane was believed to be headed for Washington, D.C., when the passengers and crew chose to crash the plane into a field so that it would not reach its target. Mr. Bush said that those 33 passengers and seven crew members \"stood in for us all.\"\u00a0 \"Facing an impossible circumstance, they comforted their loved ones by phone, braced each other for action, and defeated the designs of evil,\" Mr. Bush said. \"These Americans were brave, strong and united in ways that shocked the terrorists, but should not surprise any of us.\"\u00a0 The passengers and crew members of United Flight 93 \u201cstood in for us all,\u201d former Pres.

More than half of people who were surveyed said that discrimination got worse following the attacks.\u00a0 One of the common memories of the September 11 attacks is how Americans came together in the aftermath. However, for many\u00a0Arab and Muslim Americans\u00a0who were around at that time, the weeks following the attacks were far more violent. Political rhetoric in the two decades since the attack has also fueled discrimination against Muslims and those who are from the Middle East.\u00a0 And now, the landscape shows an America even more divided \u2014 highlighted by the Capitol riot, deep political divisions and last year's protests sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police and the treatment of the AAPI community amid the coronavirus pandemic. President Biden also addressed division in the country in recorded remarks he tweeted on Friday.\u00a0 20 years after September 11, 2001, we commemorate the 2,977 lives we lost and honor those who risked and gave their lives. As we saw in the days that followed, unity is our greatest strength.

Unity doesn't mean we have to believe the same thing. We must have a fundamental respect and faith in each other and in this nation,\" Mr. Biden said. \"We are unique in the history of the world because we are the only nation based on an idea, an idea that everyone is created equal and should be treated equally throughout their lives.\"\u00a0 Li Cohen is a social media producer and trending content writer for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Ethiopia's government on Monday declared an immediate, unilateral cease-fire in its Tigray region after nearly eight months of appalling acts of sexual violence and as hundreds of thousands of people face the world's worst famine crisis in a decade.  The cease-fire could calm a war that has destabilized Africa's second most populous country and threatened to do the same in the wider Horn of Africa, where Ethiopia has been seen as a key security ally for the West. It comes as the country awaits the results of national elections that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed promoted as the centerpiece of reforms that won him the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize.  Abiy's transformation from making peace to waging war has appalled many observers since the fighting in Tigray erupted in November. Since then, the world has struggled to access much of the region and investigate growing allegations of atrocities including gang rapes and forced starvation.  Ethiopia's statement was carried by state media shortly after the Tigray interim administration, appointed by the federal government, fled the regional capital, Mekele, and called for a cease-fire on humanitarian grounds so that desperately needed aid can be delivered.\u00a0  U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that he had spoken with the prime minister and \"I am hopeful that an effective cessation of hostilities will take place.\"  A U.S. official at the United Nations confirmed to CBS News that the U.S., U.K. and Ireland called for a Security Council meeting on Ethiopia, which is likely to occur later in the week. #BREAKING @CBSNews Exclusive A @USUN official confirmed that the US UK and Ireland called for a Security Council meeting on Ethiopia \u2066@UKUN_NewYork\u2069 \u2066@irishmissionun\u2069 this week #TigrayCrisis #Ceasefire https://t.co/0bRoTPxRih Meanwhile, Mekele residents cheered the return of Tigray forces for the first time since Ethiopian forces took the city in late November and Abiy declared victory. The Tigray fighters, loyal to the former regional ruling party that for years dominated Ethiopia's government before being sidelined by the new prime minister, undermined the November declaration by waging a guerrilla war in the region's rough terrain.  As Tigray forces occupied the airport and other key positions in Mekele and broadcast a message telling residents to stop celebrating and go home, retreating Ethiopian soldiers shot at students at Mekele University, killing two and wounding three, said a nurse at Ayder hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. Ethnic Tigrayans, even those who didn't support the former ruling Tigray People's Liberation Front before the war, say they have been targeted harshly for suspected links with the Tigray fighters. Ethiopia has denied it. But Abiy in an interview aired last week alarmed observers by recalling that aid to Tigray during Ethiopia's devastating 1980s famine had bolstered the Tigray fighters who eventually overthrew the ruling regime. Such a thing will \"never happen\" now, he said.  Monday's cease-fire declaration signaled a new approach, at least for a while.  The cease-fire \"will enable farmers to till their land, aid groups to operate without any military movement around and engage with remnants (of Tigray's former ruling party) who seek peace,\" Ethiopia's statement said, adding that efforts to bring Tigray's former leaders to justice continue.  Ethiopia said the cease-fire will last until the end of the crucial planting season in Tigray. The season's end comes in September. The government ordered all federal and regional authorities to respect the cease-fire, which is crucial because authorities and fighters from the neighboring Amhara region have been accused of atrocities in western Tigray.  \"The government has the responsibility to find a political solution to the problem,\" the head of the interim administration, Abraham Belay, said in calling for the cease-fire, adding that some elements within Tigray's former ruling party are willing to engage with the federal government.  There was no immediate comment from the Tigray fighters, with whom Ethiopia had rejected talks. And there was no immediate comment from neighboring Eritrea, whose soldiers have been accused by Tigray residents of some of the worst atrocities in the war.  Thousands of people have been killed in the conflict as Ethiopian and allied forces pursue Tigray's former leaders and their supporters, and as humanitarian groups plead for more access to the region of 6 million people.\u00a0  Earlier this month, U.N. officials described grievous abuses against women and children in the region. \"Women and girls are still being subjected to\u00a0appalling acts of sexual violence,\" said Henrietta Fore, executive director of U.N. children's agency UNICEF. She added that \"adolescent boys speak of fear of recruitment and use by parties to the conflict.\" The U.N. recently estimated that 1.6 million people have been displaced from their homes by the violence. \"We have raised our grave concerns over the reports of human rights violations, the abuses, the atrocities that have taken place in Tigray, and we condemn them in the strongest terms,\" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said last month. Tigray in recent days has seen some of the fiercest fighting of the conflict. International pressure on Ethiopia spiked again last week after a military airstrike on a busy market killed more than 60 people, and after Doctors Without Borders said three staffers had been murdered in a separate incident. Amid the upheaval on Monday, the United Nations children's agency said Ethiopian soldiers entered its office in Mekele and dismantled satellite communications equipment, an act it said violated the world body's immunity. UNICEF last week warned that at least 33,000 severely malnourished children face \"imminent risk of death\" without more aid reaching Tigray's people. CBS News' Pamela Falk contributed reporting.",

            "article_content": "United Nations \u2014 In his harshest statement yet on the seven-month crisis in northern Ethiopia's Tigray region, U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator Mark Lowcock told Security Council members Tuesday \"there is now famine in Tigray.\" He put the blame squarely on forces from the neighboring nation of Eritrea. \"Eritrean soldiers are using starvation as a weapon of war,\" he said. Lowcock painted a brutal picture. \"Rape is being used systematically to terrorize and brutalize women and girls. Aid workers have been killed, interrogated, beaten, blocked from taking aid to the starving and suffering and told not to come back,\" he told diplomats in a closed briefing at an informal dialogue of the U.N. Security Council that was requested by the Mission of Ireland. Ireland's U.N. Ambassador, Geraldine Byrne Nason called the situation an \"unfolding humanitarian catastrophe.\" \u00a0\"Now, we are at a tipping point,\" she said. \"Ignorance is dangerous. Denial is unforgiveable.\" \"Despite all we have told you of the widespread and systematic scale of the rapes, we continue to receive horrific reports of widespread sexual violence,\" Lowcock said, clearly frustrated by the lack of action from the 15-nation council.\u00a0 Lowcock outlined three areas where progress is \"urgently\" needed: humanitarian access, funding, and a hastening of the pace of aid.\u00a0 \"Ignorance is dangerous. Denial is unforgiveable,\" he warned, saying there is a \"duty\" to \"do something.\"\u00a0 Fighting in Ethiopia broke out in November 2020\u00a0between government troops and Tigrayans. Eritrea sent forces across the border to help Ethiopian troops. \u00a0 The Biden administration has spoken out. Last month, citing continuing atrocities, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called on the \"governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia to take all necessary steps to ensure that their forces in Tigray cease and desist this reprehensible conduct.\"\u00a0 U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas Greenfield scolded the council last week, asking, \"Do African lives not matter?\" and taking issue with the lack of a single public meeting on the crisis.  U.S. AID Administrator Samantha Power called on the Security Council's three African members to put the issue on the agenda. Council members weigh in \u00a0 After Tuesday's U.N. meeting, those three nations - Niger, Tunisia, and Kenya - along with St. Vincent and the Grenadines, issued a statement saying they, \"share in the concern for the humanitarian needs faced by 17.1 million Ethiopians including people in the Tigray region.\" The four nations said they are concerned about \"reports of sexual violence against women and girls.\" \u00a0 They called on Ethiopia to \"conduct thorough investigations into these atrocities.\"\u00a0 Not mentioning famine in the statement, the nations cautioned, \"Any action by the Security Council must recognize and respond to the reality that Ethiopia is finalizing preparations for an election that is barely a week away.\" \u00a0 Ethiopia's U.N. ambassador, Taye Atske Selassie Amde, who was at the meeting, said Eritrean forces \"will definitely leave soon,\" a commitment that Eritrea also made in April \u2013 and one that hasn't happened. \u00a0 Later in the evening, Ireland's Byrne Nason told CBS News, \"Ireland has been on the Security Council for six months, and in those six months we have never looked away from this developing catastrophe in Tigray.\"\u00a0 She said, \"We need unhindered humanitarian access to the hundreds of thousands already in immediate danger of starvation, we need to ensure humanitarian workers and supplies are safe, and we need to end all violence.\"  \"Ultimately, a political solution is needed, and Ireland certainly called for that today, but while we work towards that, our number one priority is ensuring that no more lives are lost,\" Byrne Nason added. Russian Deputy Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva, who attended the meeting, told CBS News in a statement, \"We take the humanitarian challenges that Ethiopia faces very seriously.\" She said \"humanitarian agencies should scale up their assistance with full respect to and in close coordination with the sovereign authorities.\"\u00a0 \"We oppose any politicization of humanitarian situations, including in Tigray,\" Russia's envoy said. \u00a0 U.K. Ambassador to the U.N. Barbara Woodward spoke to reporters after the closed dialogue, saying she was disappointed that nations on the Council have not been able to agree to a meeting in public, saying that \"without a ceasefire, this could become a man-made famine.\"\u00a0 Pamela Falk is the CBS News correspondent covering the United Nations, and an international lawyer.",

The letter came shortly before the House approved a bill to create such a commission. Although some Republicans supported the bill, most opposed it. It also faces an uphill battle in the Senate, where Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will oppose it. The letter said that \"it is inconceivable that some of the Members we protect, would downplay the events of January 6th.\" \"On Jan 6th where some officers served their last day in US Capitol Police uniform, and not by choice, we would hope that Members whom we took an oath to protect, would at the very minimum support an investigation to get to the bottom of EVERYONE responsible and hold them 100 percent accountable no matter the title of position they hold or held,\" the letter said. The letter, which was not a formal statement from the U.S. Capitol Police Department, cited the \"trauma\" officers experienced, adding that \"with each passing week, a new revelation about Jan 6th reveals itself.\" \"With these constant reminders, it is unconscionable to even think anyone could suggest, we need to move forward and get over it,\" the officers said. Two officers have died by suicide since the attack. \u00a0 A violent mob of Trump supporters seeking to overturn the results of the presidential election overran the U.S. Capitol on January 6, resulting in five deaths and hundreds of injuries, as well as significant physical damage to the building itself.\u00a0 The letter was circulated by Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin's office to other chiefs of staff on Capitol Hill, as several of his constituents are officers. According to a spokesperson for Raskin, the officer who provided the letter said that it represents the sentiments of 40 to 50 officers.\u00a0 The U.S. Capitol Police Department said in a statement that the department does not take positions on legislation, and that they had no way to verify that the letter was sent by Capitol Police officers. Raskin represents the part of Maryland that borders Washington, D.C. from the north and east, so he has many officers that live in his district and commute in for work. \u00a0 In an interview with CBS News, Raskin said he has personally met with 15 or 20 officers since January 6 who were traumatized by the events of that day and are now \"very upset that there's dissension around a bipartisan commission to get to the bottom of the situation.\"\u00a0 \"I thought I thought it was something all of my colleagues should be aware of,\" Raskin said of the letter. \"People should think about this from the standpoint of the line officers who were involved in essentially medieval battle conditions for four or five hours. They were beaten with hockey sticks and pipes and Confederate battle flags and Donald Trump flags and American flags and they were punched, kicked, jostled, spat upon, sprayed in the face with mace. So the least we can do is try to hear them the best that we can.\"\u00a0 Raskin added that he understands the decision of the officers not to go public. \"They're not accustomed to being political and they're not supposed to be political, but this is something that affects them directly, that they feel very strongly about, so they have to express themselves anonymously,\" he said. \"I have no doubt that this is coming from real capitol officers and that they're speaking for huge numbers of officers who are very upset about the situation,\" Raskin said.\u00a0 Rebecca Kaplan covers Congress for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Queen Elizabeth II carried out her first major public engagement since her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, died last month. The queen attended the State Opening of Parliament on Tuesday, which was scaled back due to the pandemic, to give the Queen's Speech, a significant address that sets out what laws the government wants to pass.\u00a0 The Queen's Speech usually happens once a year, typically in the spring or after an election, as part of the State Opening of Parliament ceremony, according to BBC News. However, the last Queen's Speech took place in December 2019, two weeks after Boris Johnson was elected. The speech signified Johnson could set out his agenda for the next session of parliament, which\u00a0ended in April 2021. Tuesday's speech was the queen's first engagement outside Windsor Castle since the death of her husband. She usually arrives in a carriage with a long procession. This time, she arrived in a Bentley limousine with 74 people, including herself, in the chamber as she read her speech from the throne in the House of Lords. Face masks were worn and there was no military and or guard of honor due to pandemic restrictions. Usually, diplomatic or non-parliamentary guests are invited and the total attendance is typically 600 people. In her 10-minute speech, she highlighted 30 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year, including bills on infrastructure, the armed forces, borders and security, housing and the environment, according to BBC News. One would extend 5G mobile coverage, while another,\u00a0controversial\u00a0measure proposes new powers for police officers over protesters and new sentences for serious crimes. An education bill introduced a new \"flexible loan\" system for higher education in England and three bills on animal welfare will ban the export of live animals for fattening and slaughter, as well as make it mandatory to microchip cats.\u00a0 Following Prince Philip's death, the queen first hosted an event attended by her family at Windsor Castle, according to the\u00a0Court Circular. The monarch hosted a ceremony where the Earl Peel formally stood down as Lord Chamberlain, whose office organizes royal ceremonies. During the state opening, Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, were alongside the queen. Charles had attended the last three occasions with his mother \u2014 in December 2019, October 2019 and June 2017 \u2014 because Prince Philip was sick with an infection, two months before the consort retired from public duties. Former President Barack Obama, Sir Paul McCartney and a maid of honor to the queen at her coronation reflect on the extraordinary reign of Queen Elizabeth II in \"The Queen Carries On: A Gayle King Special.\" The special airs Friday, May 14 at 8 p.m. ET on CBS and is available to stream live and on demand on Paramount+  Caitlin O'Kane is a digital content producer covering trending stories for CBS News and its good news brand, The Uplift.",

            "article_content": "The Biden administration is launching a fresh cross-country blitz to mark their 100 days in office and to tout the president's proposed infrastructure spending. The day after President Biden makes his first address to a joint session of Congress, he and first lady Jill Biden are set to visit Atlanta on Thursday to mark 100 days since his inauguration. The visit will include appearances by Democratic senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, who won special elections in January cementing the Democratic Senate majority that made passage of Mr. Biden's American Rescue Plan possible, White House officials tell CBS News.\u00a0 Officials conceded the visit to the Atlanta area is essentially a makeup for his first visit to the Peach State in March, which had to be rearranged as it came just days after a series of shootings that left eight people dead at Atlanta-area spas. The Georgia visit is the official kickoff of \"The Getting America Back on Track Tour,\" roughly 10 days of travel that will take top members of the Biden administration to roughly a dozen states, officials said. On Friday, the president is set to visit Philadelphia to tout more details of the\u00a0American Jobs Plan and\u00a0American Families Plan, which combined would add about $4 trillion in federal spending, White House officials said. While in the city, the president is also set to mark the 50th anniversary of Amtrak, officials said. Mr. Biden is a longtime customer of the interstate rail service, having used trains to travel back and forth to Washington from Delaware during his 36 years in the Senate.\u00a0 Officials said other stops are expected next week and will be announced soon. The president is also set to host bipartisan talks with lawmakers again next week at the White House, officials said. Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to visit Baltimore on Thursday with a similar focus and is scheduled to visit Ohio on Friday. Second gentleman Douglas Emhoff is also scheduled to visit North Carolina on Friday as part of the administration's public push, the officials added.\u00a0 The White House's travel plans come amid a wave of 100-day-related polls by national news outlets showing the president with positive approval ratings; a majority of Americans backing his response to the COVID-19 pandemic and his decision to withdraw U.S. military forces from Afghanistan, but opposition to his response to the record wave of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. In Mr. Biden's address before the joint session of Congress, he is expected to acknowledge the events of January 6 and how they have transformed the U.S. Capitol, Congress and by extension, Washington. He is also expected to nod to a major first in American history: For the first time, a U.S. president will be flanked on the dais by two women, Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Drafts of the remarks began circulating late last week and copies of the latest draft, held together by black binder clips, were spotted in the West Wing on Monday.\u00a0 Vinay Reddy, the president's lead speechwriter, and White House senior adviser Mike Donilon, who has collaborated with Mr. Biden on most major addresses and helped develop the \"battle for the soul of the nation\" focus of his 2020 campaign, are leading the speechwriting process.\u00a0 Ed O'Keefe is a senior White House and political correspondent for CBS News based in Washington, D.C.",

James Woolsey, who served in the Clinton administration. \u00a0 Sergey Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, said at a press conference that Moscow would also place restrictions on the activities of U.S. non-governmental organizations on its territory, calling Washington's measures \"hostile\" and \"unprovoked.\" \u00a0\u00a0 The relatively measured response, however, suggested Russia was heeding President Biden's repeated appeals to forestall \"a cycle of escalation and conflict.\"\u00a0 In public remarks at the White House on Thursday, President Biden said he \"chose to be proportionate\" in an effort to forge a \"stable and predictable\" relationship with Moscow. Mr. Biden said he told the Russian president that their direct communication was \"essential,\" and proposed an in-person summit in a European country this summer. \u00a0 \"Our teams are discussing that possibility right now,\" Mr. Biden said. \u00a0 \u00a0 Rice responded to the impending Russia ban against her with a tweet Saturday. So much for taking my family on Spring Break to our favorite AirBnB in Siberia... pic.twitter.com/VA09hChtNC On Thursday the administration announced economic sanctions on 32 individuals and entities in response to Russian actions it said were \"against U.S. sovereignty and interests,\" including Moscow's interference in the 2020 presidential election. It expelled 10 Russian officials from Washington, D.C., formally attributed the SolarWinds espionage campaign to the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence service, and announced a bolstered cyber defense partnership with Western allies. \u00a0 In public testimony before the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday, U.S. intelligence officials said that Russia had likely been expecting a response. Haines testified that there would \"probably be a certain amount of tit for tat,\" but said the intelligence community had assessed that Moscow did not want direct conflict with the U.S.\u00a0 Lt. General Scott Berrier, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified that Russia's build-up of military troops along the Ukrainian border and in Crimea had given Moscow the ability to conduct a limited attack, though its intentions remained unclear. \u00a0 \"They have placed themselves in a posture where it's given them options,\" he said. \"If they choose to retaliate in any way, they have a number of different force arrays in Crimea and Ukraine where they could lash out and do something as a message to the Ukraine to the United States or to the NATO alliance.\" \u00a0",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson that aired Sunday, March 14, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Despite demand for the vaccine outstripping supply nationally, Arkansas is one state that's expanding eligibility in order to use their supply. Governor Asa Hutchinson joins us from Little Rock this morning. Good morning to you, Governor. Before I get to COVID, I want to quickly ask you about politics. Your partner, Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, Co-Head of the National Governors Association, should he resign from his position? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: I'm going to- first of all, it's very important to take any allegations by the women who've come forward seriously. They have credibility. They need to be heard. I understand there's an investigation by the attorney general that should proceed. Beyond that, you know, he's a- the chairman of the NGA right now, selected by the Democrats. And so that's within their bailiwick to deal with that issue and the people of New York. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Governor, let me ask you what's happening in your state. Our CBS polling, as you heard at the top of the show, is- is reflecting a real partisan divide in terms of willingness to get the vaccine. Young Republicans, in particular, are resistant to it. Are you seeing that problem and how are you combating it? GOV. HUTCHINSON: We are seeing that problem and the poll numbers are troubling because in Arkansas, it's a very pro-Trump state in terms of the last election. And- and so we see that resistance. Whenever we are opening up eligibility for the vaccine, we're moving through it very quickly because we're not having everybody sign up to take it. What we're doing to address it is having influencers who would need to broaden that to help shape the thinking. But as more and more people get the vaccine, they see it's a way to get back to more normal life. They're excited about it. They're optimistic. So, I see those numbers changing. Sometimes someone will not take the vaccine saying, \"I just want to wait a little bit longer to make sure everything's OK.\" We're encouraging them not to do that. When it's your turn, take the vaccine. But at the same time, we're going to move through the eligibility and then we're going to have to come back and catch up because we'll probably be at a 50% rate. We need to get up to 70 to 80% acceptance rate to increase the immuni- immunization of the vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Given that problem, why would you consider lifting the mask mandate at the end of the month? GOV. HUTCHINSON: Well, because we need to continue to wear a mask, socially distance until we get the vaccine widely accepted, but you can do that two ways. One is by a mandate or you can do it by public common sense. And so I didn't want to have a jump off the bridge in one moment, so we have a ramp in which we want to see what our testing, our- our cases look like, our hospitalizations, positivity rate look like toward the end of the month. And we'll make a decision whether we can lift the mask mandate and turn it into guidance and common sense as we said. I think the time in this pandemic for heavy-handed restrictions and mandates are going by the wayside so people can make good judgments. And we expect that to happen even after March 31st if the mask mandate is lifted. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your state's going to get 4 billion dollars from this American Rescue Plan. Many of your constituents are going to take home these $1400 checks and thousands of dollars in tax credit. Isn't this good for your state? GOV. HUTCHINSON: Well, there's many good parts of the bill, and that's important to remember. There's rental assistance there for people who need it. There's food assistance in there. There's also money in there for arts, humanities. Really across the board there's increase in spending. Some of the most important elements of it would be trying to recover the lost learning in our schools over this last pandemic year. I think we've done better because we didn't close our schools, but there's still lost learning we got to make up for. So there's great investments in there. I know your previous guests, you talked about why there's Republican opposition. Well, it's just simply too large. And for a state like Arkansas, we're going to be getting more money than we had in the last CARES Act funding. We have a balanced budget. We have a surplus. And the challenging thing is that while there's so many good things in this bill, they've given us a double whammy by saying, first of all, we're going to distribute the money to the states not based upon population, but based upon your unemployment rates. That cost us $390 million. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah GOV. HUTCHINSON: And then another one is that they've said that you cannot have tax cuts and take this money. Well, we were planning on giving- reducing the sales tax on used cars, that is low income and middle income. And now we're worried about whether that's going to be prohibited under this bill. The language seems to indicate it is. So, while there's many good things about it, it is too large-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah GOV. HUTCHINSON: --and we got to make sure the states have flexibility. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a former Homeland Security official in the Bush administration. At the US border, right now, there are thousands of unaccompanied children in U.S. custody. Does the U.S. need to send them back or keep them here as the Biden administration's doing? GOV. HUTCHINSON: Well, you've got to have a stricter border policy, or those- it's going to be a humanitarian crisis that will continue-- MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. GOV. HUTCHINSON: --throughout this year. Unaccompanied minors is a risk to themselves, their families. So you've got to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.\u00a0 GOV. HUTCHINSON: --have a tougher policy so we can repatriate them, but care-- MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. GOV. HUTCHINSON: --for them as they seek asylum or- or the help that they need. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. We've got to leave it there, sir, because I have to get to this break. Thank you very much, Governor.",

She's in Northville, Michigan. Good morning to you. REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE CHAIRWOMAN RONNA MCDANIEL: Good morning, MARGARET. Great to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here. We know there's a lot of eyes on what's going to happen when President Trump takes that main stage later today. Republicans are in the minority in the House. They're in the minority in the Senate. You lost the White House. Why are you doubling down on Donald Trump as the future of the party? MCDANIEL: Well, it's up to the voters, and the voters are saying overwhelmingly they agree with what President Trump did in office. As you see Joe Biden strip away energy independence and cancel the Keystone pipeline, as you see Joe Biden say, I'm going to prioritize opening our borders over opening our schools, opening our economies, when you see the vaccine rollout that started under Operation Warp Speed in less than a year. These are the types of things that voters are saying they saw happen in the Trump administration and now they're seeing the Biden administration strip those things away. MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you think the unity is in the opposition rather than within the party. I mean, if I look at what's happening inside your party, state parties in Arizona and Wyoming and Illinois, they're censuring other Republicans for insufficient loyalty to President Trump. I mean, it looks like your party is getting cut into thinner and thinner strips here. MCDANIEL: You know, we can have division within our party, and you can have state parties say, I disagree with that vote and I disagree with what you did there. But overwhelmingly our party agrees with each other on more than we disagree with each other on. And we want to see our schools open. You know, you hear Democrats use this mantra over and over again, follow the science. Well, mental health rates are skyrocketing- skyrocketing with young kids that are concerned. You're seeing suicide rates up. Schools need to be open. And Republican governors that are leading across the country are following the science, keeping the kids safe and healthy, but getting them back into school. These are the things that our party stands for, opening up our economy, opening up our schools. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have a- a Democratic governor ahead who's going to talk about how he's opening schools this week. And we'll dig into that more in depth later on in the program. But we do need to take a short break here and continue our conversation with Ronna McDaniel in just a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to pick up where we left off with RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel. Chairwoman, you met with the former president this week in Florida. Do you think he's going to run again in 2024? MCDANIEL: You know, I don't know. That's going to be a decision he's going to have to make down the road. I do know he's committed to helping us win back majorities in 2022, which is, of course, what I'm focused on right now. We are a handful of seats away from taking back the House, we picked up 15 this last election, and one seat away from taking back the Senate. And as I said, as we're seeing the Trump administration and their legacy being stripped away by Joe Biden, who said he was going to run in a- in a bipartisan way, work with Republicans, he hasn't done that on anything, including this recent boondoggle of a stimulus bill of 2 mill- 2 trillion dollars of grab bags for Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. You're seeing more and more Republicans recognize we need to unite around how do we win back these majorities and stop Biden in his tracks.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: How damaging were the events of January 6th to your party? MCDANIEL: They were damaging to our country. I think it was horrific what happened January 6th. There is no American, Republican or Democrat who looks at that and sees our Capitol attacked and feels good. And I think there's a lot of self-reflection that has to go on across the whole country. We are-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Has the president done some self-reflection? MCDANIEL: I'm going to talk about me because I'm not going to speak for somebody else. But I will say as a party we have been--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you said he didn't make the moment previously. MCDANIEL: Well, what I will say from an RNC perspective is we've been more vocal in denouncing groups like QAnon. We know that anarchists came to Washington that day. There was a bomb placed outside of my building, outside of the Republican National Committee. We have a deeply divided nation. I will do that. I will denounce extreme elements that pretend to be Republican and say we do not want you in our party. I would like Democrats to do the same with antifa and groups that are anti-Semitic that masquerade as Democrats and say you are not welcome in our party as they burned down cities this past summer. I would ask the media to be more fair and how you report things. Don't report- suppress reports on Hunter Biden and on Democrats like what's happening with Andrew Cuomo and the immense failures that he had as governor, and then highlight things like you just did with Governor Noem. Andrew Cuomo, what he has done, his policies killed people-- MARGARET BRENNAN: When he agrees to come on this program, trust me, I- he won't like some of my questions,-- MCDANIEL: He deserves that. MARGARET BRENNAN: --like many of our guests don't like my questions. I want to ask you-- \u00a0 MCDANIEL: I hope so, but the media as a whole has ignored Andrew Cuomo. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --I want to ask you about, Congresswoman, to your point you were just raising, though, about being more vocal in speaking out. Congresswoman Liz Cheney said this week that the Trump- the Trump supporters who violently sieged the Capitol on January 6th, she raised this particular issue. (ROLL CLIP) REP. LIZ CHENEY: It's very important, especially for us as Republicans, to make clear that we- we aren't the party of- of white supremacy. (END CLIP) MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you make that clear now? MCDANIEL: A hundred percent. We passed a resolution unanimously from the RNC members three years ago saying we condemn white supremacy, anti-Semitism, KKK, and I'm going to add QAnon to that. They are not welcome in our party. I have not seen Democrats do that with Louis Farrakhan, who calls the Jewish people termites. I have not seen them do that with antifa, who last night committed violence again in Portland. MARGARET BRENNAN: The people who sieged the Capitol were carrying Trump flags. That is why Liz Cheney was talking about it. It is why she voted to impeach the president.\u00a0 MCDANIEL: But it's- but you know what, the Democrats have created a safe haven for antifa. They have not denounced them. Nancy Pelosi said as cities were being ripped apart, people will do what they do. You can't hold Republicans to one standard- standard and not Democrats, and that creates unrest as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, when it comes to Republicans, I know you have focused on recruiting women back to the party. Is Marjorie Taylor Green, who was a QAnon supporter, who was described by Mitch McConnell as a \"cancer on the Republican Party,\" is she representative of the kind of Republican woman you want? MCDANIEL: Well, you know, I was- I've been very vocal about her comments. She apologized for them. I'm glad to see that she did and her district will decide that. But we have increased women. We're now at 38 women in Congress in the Republican Party. That's the highest we've ever had. And here's the other thing. Women are suffering under the Biden administration. 2.4 million women have lost their jobs because of daycare issues. One hundred and forty thousand last month. Women are going through a she-cession. Women are struggling because our kids are not back at school. I'm not saying this as a Republican. I'm saying this is a mother with two kids in public school watching this rip apart my community as kids are suffering. So get it done. Get our kids back in school. And that's what the Republican stands- Republican Party stands for. It's Florida versus New York. MARGARET BRENNAN: Alright. MCDANIEL: Our kids can go back to school safely. Our businesses can be open. And that's how we'll get women back in our party when they see us fighting for their kids and for them and not standing up for unions. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ronna McDaniel, thank you for your time today.",

            "article_content": "Yangon\u00a0\u2014 Martial law was declared in parts of Myanmar's second largest city Mandalay Monday, after hundreds of thousands rallied across the country against the coup and the military issued a stern warning against further protests. The orders cover seven townships in Mandalay, banning people from protesting or gathering in groups of more than five, and a curfew will run from 8 pm until 4 am, the general administration department said in a statement.  A similar declaration has been made in a township in Ayeyarwaddy further south and announcements concerning other localities are expected to trickle out tonight.  \"This order is applied until further notice,\" a Mandalay township statement said.  \"Some people... are behaving in a worrying way that can harm the safety of public and law enforcement. Such behaviors can affect stability, safety of people, law enforcement, and peaceful existence of villages and could create riots, that's why this order bans gathering, speaking in public, protest by using vehicles, rallies,\" the statement said. The junta has so far refrained from using deadly force against the demonstrations sweeping most of the country, but with pressure building riot police fired water cannon in an attempt to disperse thousands gathered in Naypyidaw, and there were threats of greater force. The military last week detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and dozens of other members of her National League for Democracy party, ending a decade of partial civilian rule and triggering international condemnation.  In the face of an increasingly bold wave of defiance, state broadcaster MRTV warned that opposition to the junta was unlawful and signaled a potential crackdown.  \"Action must be taken according to the law with effective steps against offenses which disturb, prevent and destroy the state's stability, public safety and the rule of law,\" said a statement read by an announcer on the channel. Tens of thousands of people overcame a nationwide internet blockade to rally over the weekend in the first major outpourings of opposition to the coup.\u00a0  The movement built on Monday, with thousands of protesters holding three fingers into the sky \u2014 a defiant gesture borrowed from The Hunger Games movie series \u2014 gathering across the country and the start of a nationwide strike. In Yangon, the nation's commercial capital, crowds spilled onto the city's main roads, immobilizing traffic and dwarfing the previous day's rally. \"Down with military dictatorship\" and \"release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and arrested people,\" protesters chanted, flashing the three-finger salute as car horns were honked in support.  Calls for a nationwide strike gathered momentum over the weekend, with textile workers, civil servants and railway employees walking out of work in the commercial hub.  \"This is a work day, but we aren't going to work even if our salary will be cut,\" one protester, 28-year-old garment factory worker Hnin Thazin, told AFP.  Construction worker Chit Min, 18, joined the Yangon rally, saying his loyalty to Suu Kyi outweighed concerns about his financial situation.  \"I am jobless now for a week because of the military coup, and I am worried for my survival,\" he told AFP.  Similarly large crowds marched in Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, many clutching photos of Suu Kyi and waving the red flags of her party. Police attempted to disperse thousands of people gathered on a highway in Naypyidaw, where the deposed leader is believed to be detained. Water cannon were fired into the crowd, injuring at least two demonstrators, according to a photographer on the scene. Police reportedly put a sign in a roadway warning that security forces could use live ammunition if protesters got past the third of three lines of officers in the city Naypyitaw.\u00a0 Huge rallies were reported across much of the country, from Muse on the Chinese border to the southern cities of Dawei and Hpa-an. Protesters started to disperse in the early evening. Myanmar's generals detained Suu Kyi, 75, and other top NLD leaders in pre-dawn raids last Monday, justifying the coup by claiming fraud in last November's elections, which the party won in a landslide.  The junta proclaimed a one-year state of emergency, promising to hold fresh elections after that without offering any precise timeframe.  U.S. President Joe Biden has led global calls for the generals to relinquish power. Pope Francis on Monday called for the prompt release of imprisoned political leaders.  \"The path to democracy undertaken in recent years was brusquely interrupted by last week's coup d'etat,\" he told a gathering of diplomats. \"This has led to the imprisonment of different political leaders, who I hope will be promptly released as a sign of encouragement for a sincere dialogue.\"  South East Asian lawmakers have also urged Myanmar's military to respect the people's rights to protest.  \"As peaceful demonstrations grow, the risk of violence is real. We all know what the Myanmar army is capable of: mass atrocities, killing of civilians, enforced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary arrests, among others,\" Tom Villarin from ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights said.",

She announced her campaign in a video posted to her Twitter account Monday. In the nearly eight-minute-long announcement, Sanders highlighted her tenure serving as White House press secretary under former President Trump and called for an end to violence and return to peaceful protest. \"With the radical left now in control of Washington, your governor is your last line of defense. In fact, your governor must be on the front line. So today I announce my candidacy for governor of Arkansas,\" Sanders said. \"As governor, I will defend our right to be free of socialism and tyranny, your Second Amendment right to keep your family safe and your freedom of speech and religious liberty. Our state needs a leader with the courage to do what's right, not what's political correct or convenient.\" I'm in \u2014> https://t.co/8bmfl3ZPgpWatch \u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/khDPEk0orU Mr. Trump endorsed Sanders on Monday night. In a statement through his Save America political action committee, Mr. Trump described Sanders a \"warrior.\"\u00a0 \"Sarah is strong on Borders, tough on Crime, and fully supports the Second Amendment and our great law enforcement officers,\" Mr. Trump said. \"She loves our Military and Veterans \u2014 and her home state of Arkansas. Sarah will be a GREAT Governor, and she has my Complete and Total Endorsement!\" The current Republican governor, Asa Hutchinson, cannot run again due to term limits.\u00a0 Sanders, the daughter of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, became a household name while working as part of the Trump White House communications team. She initially served as deputy White House press secretary before taking over as press secretary after Sean Spicer resigned. Known publicly for her adversarial relationship with the press, she privately had a good relationship with many reporters. When she left the administration in June 2019, she had not given a press briefing in over 100 days. She tweeted at the time that she was leaving with her \"head held high.\"\u00a0 Sanders served as press secretary for two years. Her successor, Stephanie Grisham,\u00a0left after 10 months\u00a0without holding a single press briefing. Sanders, one of original Trump White House staffers, called working for Mr. Trump\u00a0the \"opportunity of a lifetime.\"   Her bid for governor was widely expected \u2014 Mr. Trump tweeted when she left the press office that he hoped she would run.\u00a0 \"After 3 1/2 years, our wonderful Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be leaving the White House at the end of the month and going home to the Great State of Arkansas,\" Mr. Trump wrote in June 2019 on his now-deleted Twitter account. \"She is a very special person with extraordinary talents, who has done an incredible job! I hope she decides to run for Governor of Arkansas - she would be fantastic. Sarah, thank you for a job well done!\"\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Sanders was a favorite adviser of Mr. Trump's, and she was a frequent guest at his rallies during the campaign, even after she left the White House.\u00a0 Since leaving left the White House, Sanders has published a bestselling book, called \"Speaking for Myself: Faith, Freedom and the Fight for Our Lives Inside the Trump White House,\" that detailed her time as the first working mother to be White House press secretary. \"As a working mom, it's not lost on me what a great honor and privilege it is to stand here at the podium,\" she said memorably during a briefing.\u00a0 Sanders also likened her time as press secretary as being caught in between a \u00a0\"raging battle between the president and the media.\" \"I often felt like I was on the front lines in no-man's land,\" Sander wrote. Sanders will be jumping into a Republican primary race that already includes two state elected officials: Lieutenant Governor Tim Griffin and state Attorney General Leslie Rutledge.\u00a0 Weijia Jiang contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Russian opposition leader and Putin critic Alexey Navalny was detained Sunday after he returned to Moscow. It was the first time he returned to Moscow since he was poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent over the summer.\u00a0 \"I am perfectly happy that I arrived,\" said Navalny. \"This is my best day in five months. This is my home, I am not afraid and with an absolutely normal feeling I am going to the border control, I will walk out and go home because I know that I am right.\"   While the European Union has imposed sanctions of Russia for its alleged role in Nalvany's poisoning, the U.S. has not. President-elect Joe Biden's incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan tweeted Sunday that Navalny should be \"immediately released, and the perpetrators of the outrageous attack on his life must be held accountable.\" \"The Kremlin's attacks on Mr. Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard,\" Sullivan wrote.\u00a0 Navalny landed at Sheremetyevo Airport near Moscow around 8:45 p.m. local time. His flight from Berlin was diverted from its scheduled landing at another Moscow airport, where supporters and journalists were waiting. Dozens awaiting Navalny's arrival were arrested, according to local media.\u00a0 Moscow's prison service, FSIN, said last week that Navalny would be detained if he came back, citing his failure to return for a prison service appointment in December related to a 2014 embezzlement case that Navalny says was politically motivated. He told journalists upon his arrival that he was not afraid and that the criminal case against him was \"fabricated.\" Navalny was detained after he showed his passport upon arrival. His wife, Yulia, and others traveling with them were allowed to go through customs. FSIN told Reuters in a statement that Navalny had been detained due to the alleged violations of his suspended prison sentence. FSIN said he will be held in custody until a court hearing later this month determines whether to convert his suspended sentence into a prison sentence of 3.5 years. In August, Navalny collapsed while on a flight to Moscow from Siberia, where he had been campaigning against Putin's party in a local election. He later told \"60 Minutes\" he knew he was dying. \"Actually, every cell of your body just are telling you that, 'Body, we are done,'\" he said.\u00a0 The pilot, not knowing who he was and thinking he had suffered a drug overdose, diverted the plane to the city of Omsk as a passenger filmed Navalny writhing in pain. After his wife launched a public campaign to allow him to receive treatment, Navalny was allowed to fly to Germany, where he was put in a medically-induced coma.\u00a0 Doctors in Berlin sent a sample of his blood to a military lab, which found traces of Novichok, a highly toxic nerve agent said to be 10 times more potent than sarin gas. Other labs confirmed the presence of military-grade Novichok, although Russian authorities have said they destroyed those types of chemical agents.\u00a0 Navalny said he was \"sure\" that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the poisoning himself, an accusation the Kremlin has denied. Russian authorities have denied any role in the poisoning, despite international outrage that led to the European Union imposing sanctions.\u00a0 In December, Navalny said he impersonated an official in the Kremlin's Security Council and extracted an admission of guilt from a toxins expert with the FSB security service.   In a video of the conversation published by Navalny, the alleged FSB agent says agents placed poison in Navalny's underwear. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, described Navalny as a \"sick\" man who was suffering from \"delusions of persecution\" and also exhibited \"traits of megalomania.\"   \"They say he compares himself to Jesus,\" said Peskov. \u00a0 AFP contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As President Biden weighs executive action to cancel as much as $50,000 in student loans for each borrower, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal of Washington are introducing new legislation Wednesday they say would help address the soaring cost of higher education. If passed, the College for All Act would make community colleges and trade schools tuition-free for all students. It would also make public four-year colleges and universities as well as public nonprofit minority-serving institutions \u2014 such as historically Black colleges and universities \u2014 tuition-free for all students from families earning less than $125,000 a year. \"If we are going to have the kind of standard of living that the American people deserve, we need to have the best educated workforce in the world,\" said Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, in a statement. \"It is absolutely unacceptable that hundreds of thousands of bright young Americans do not get a higher education each year, not because they are unqualified, but because their family does not have enough money.\" The proposal comes as some Democratic lawmakers have urged the president, who had initially supported $10,000 in student loan relief, to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt. More than 44 million Americans are burdened by student loan debt and the total debt surpassed $1.7 trillion last year. Supporters argue the move would provide relief for millions of Americans saddled with debt and spur economic growth. Critics question the fairness of the move and claim it does not address the underlying high costs of college.\u00a0 The new proposal would double the maximum federal Pell grant to $12,990, up from the current $6,495, and allow students to use the money to cover other college-related costs like housing and books. The grant amount would also be tied to inflation and expanded to eligible Dreamers, people who were brought illegally to the U.S. as children.\u00a0 Their proposal also would triple federal funding for programs that help identify and provide services for students from disadvantaged backgrounds \u2014 low income, first-generation college students or are individuals with disabilities. It would double money for Gear UP, the grant program that helps prepare low-income students for college. To make such college tuition-free, the federal government would cover 75% of the costs for tuition and fees while states would pay the remaining 25%. The plan would also bump the federal government's share to 90% in the case of an economic downturn.\u00a0 In an effort to pay for the proposal, Sanders will also reintroduce legislation Wednesday that puts a tax on trades with stocks at .5%, bonds at .1% and derivatives at .005%. According to the senator, the plan would raise up to $2.4 trillion over 10 years. Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California is set to reintroduce the tax legislation in the House. The College for All Act has been endorsed by at least eight unions and more than two dozen national organizations including progressive organizations such as Justice Democrats and MoveOn.\u00a0 \"Successful transition into adulthood is an essential measure of well-being for children and youth,\" said Children's Defense Fund President and CEO the Reverend Starsky Wilson, in a statement supporting the initiative. \"With 6 in 10 American jobs requiring some education beyond high school, our children will not thrive without these doors being open wide.\" The legislation reflects some of Mr. Biden's education platform on the campaign trail. During the election, he called for two years of community college and other trade schools to be tuition-free as well as making public colleges and universities tuition-free for families making less than $125,000. His platform also included doubling Pell grants. But the plan still faces an uphill climb in Congress, including how it will be paid for as Democrats hold a slim majority in the House and the Senate is split 50-50.\u00a0 Meanwhile on Tuesday, Senators Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, and the Reverend Raphael Warnock, of Georgia, sent a letter to Secretary Miguel Cardona urging the Education Department to remove federal student loan borrowers from default after COVID relief measures halted payments and interest amid the pandemic.

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden will issue a memo on his first day in office to \"halt or delay\" last-minute actions by the Trump administration, Biden's transition team announced Thursday.\u00a0 The Biden-Harris White House plans to issue a regulatory freeze memo the afternoon of January 20 that will halt or delay so-called \"midnight regulations\" put into place by the Trump administration that won't take effect until after inauguration day, said incoming White House press secretary\u00a0Jen Psaki\u00a0during the last\u00a0transition team briefing\u00a0before the new year. Such last-minute actions are typical of lame-duck presidents, she said.\u00a0 According to George Washington University's Regulatory Studies Center, \"the final months of an outgoing presidential administration typically generate a significant amount of regulatory activity.\" \"The midnight period is typically defined as the period between the presidential election in November and Inauguration Day on January 20th of the following year,\" writes the center, and has been \"documented as early as the Carter administration's transition to Reagan, and has accompanied every presidential transition since, regardless of political party.\" The Biden administration will quickly address changes made during this period, as other administrations have done, Psaki said. The freeze will apply to both regulations and also guidance documents, which agencies issue to explain or clarify rules and policies.\u00a0 Psaki singled out as an example a rule proposed by the Trump administration's Department of Labor regarding companies' authority over classifying workers as independent contractors, rather than employees, under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Independent contractors give up most benefits that employees get, such as overtime or minimum-wage protections, paid sick time, family leave and the right to start or join a union. \u00a0 \"The Department of Labor is expected to publish a final rule before January 20 that would make it easier for companies to call their workers independent contractors to avoid minimum wage and overtime protections. If it takes effect, the rule will make it easier to misclassify employees as independent contractors, costing workers nearly $3.7 billion annually,\" she said. Biden's memo \"would potentially freeze this rule and not allow it to implement it,\" Psaki said.\u00a0 Asked what the Biden administration will do about potential forthcoming actions and executive orders that the freeze memo cannot stop \u2014 such as reports that the Trump administration will designate Cuba a sponsor of terrorism \u2014 Psaki acknowledged that there are \"additional actions that the Trump administration and members of the team can take in the coming weeks ahead that are damaging and destructive to our policies, whether they're national security policies or domestic policies.\" She and Yohannes Abraham, the Biden-Harris transition's executive director, said delays and obstruction in the transition process have made it difficult to assess certain issues. She said the Biden team had hoped for \"greater cooperation\" from pivotal agencies, \"including the Department of Defense.\"\u00a0 The transition has coincided with significant delays in vaccine distribution. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's\u00a0COVID Data Tracker, more than 2 million people have been vaccinated across the United States \u2014 far from the 20 million Trump administration officials promised by the end of the year.\u00a0 \"The pace is not what it needs to be,\" Psaki said, adding that the incoming administration will push for more vaccine distribution funding in the new year. \"The bill that's currently being discussed is not going to be enough.\" Biden will also rescind some of Trump's \"harmful\" executive orders, Psaki said, and some of the incoming administration's priorities will include \"reinstating protection for Dreamers, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, reversing President Trump's environmental rollbacks,\" and \"protecting and strengthening the Affordable Care Act.\"",

            "article_content": "St. Louis Treasurer Tishaura Jones, who's been outspoken in her criticism of the criminal justice system's \"arrest and incarcerate\" model, won election Tuesday and will take over as the first Black female mayor in a city beset by yet another wave of violent crime.  Jones defeated Alderwoman Cara Spencer in the general election with 51.7% to Spencer's 47.8%, based on unofficial results posted on the city's website. She'll be sworn in April 20.  \"St. Louis: This is an opportunity for us to rise,\" Jones said in her victory speech. \"I told you when I was running that we aren't done avoiding tough conversations. We are done ignoring the racism that has held our city and our region back.\"  Spencer, in her concession, noted the historic achievement of her opponent.  \"This is something we should all celebrate,\" Spencer said. \"Our city broke a glass ceiling tonight, a ceiling that shouldn't have been there.\" Jones, 49, is a former state representative who has been treasurer since 2013. She will replace incumbent Mayor Lyda Krewson, who announced in November that she wouldn't seek a second term. Krewson, 67, is the city's first woman mayor. Jones will become mayor four years after losing to Lyda Krewson by a mere 888 votes in the Democratic primary, CBS St. Louis affiliate KMOV-TV points out. The station notes that Jones, who's \"touted herself as a progressive,\" has said she'd restructure the police department and reallocate money to substance abuse and mental health.  In her new job, Jones faces many challenges. The population that peaked at 856,796 in 1950 is now just above 300,000, and people are still leaving for the suburbs. Businesses, including downtown restaurants and shops, are still struggling to recover from COVID-19 shutdowns.  But Jones and Spencer agreed that no crisis is as important as curbing violence, especially killings. Police statistics show that 262 people were killed in St. Louis last year - five fewer than the record of 267 set in 1993. But because the city's population has declined sharply since 1993, the per capita homicide rate was much higher in 2020.  Already, 2021 is shaping up to be even worse. The city has recorded 46 killings through Tuesday, about 10 ahead of last year's dangerously high pace.  Jones has pledged to bring in more social workers, mental health counselors and substance abuse counselors, rather than adding more uniformed officers.  Krewson, whose husband was fatally shot in a 1995 carjacking, ran in 2017 on a pledge to battle crime, but the city saw a staggering increase in killings during the coronavirus pandemic.  About 48% of St. Louis residents are white, 45% are Black. While both Jones and Spencer are Democrats, Jones, in a recent debate, questioned if another white mayor could adequately lead the city, noting that a \"white person doesn't have to worry about their children getting hit by a stray bullet when he's outside.\"  \"While I appreciate the role of white allies in this movement of progress, I don't believe that they have the lived experiences to lead a majority-minority city,\" Jones said in the debate.  Her victory speech focused largely on overcoming racism and bigotry.  \"I will not stay silent when I spot racism,\" Jones said. \"I will not stay silent when I spot homophobia or transphobia. I will not stay silent when I spot xenophobia. I will not stay silent when I spot religious intolerance. I will not stay silent when I spot any injustice.\"  Until this year, St. Louis hosted Democratic and Republican primary elections in March, with the winners competing in April.  But St. Louis is so heavily Democratic that the general election became an afterthought. City voters in November approved a nonpartisan format in which all candidates compete against each other in March, with the top two vote-getters advancing. Jones received the most votes in the primary, and Spencer edged out two other candidates for the other spot.",

            "article_content": "During one of the most politically divisive years in recent memory, the number of active hate groups in the U.S. actually declined as far-right extremists migrated further to online networks, reflecting a splintering of white nationalist and neo-Nazi groups that are more difficult to track. In its annual report, released Monday, the Southern Poverty Law Center said it identified 838 active hate groups operating across the U.S. in 2020. That's a decrease from the 940 documented in 2019 and the record-high of 1,020 in 2018, said the law center, which tracks racism, xenophobia and anti-government militias. \"It is important to understand that the number of hate groups is merely one metric for measuring the level of hate and racism in America, and that the decline in groups should not be interpreted as a reduction in bigoted beliefs and actions motivated by hate,\" said the report, first shared exclusively with The Associated Press. The Montgomery, Alabama-based law center said many hate groups have moved to social media platforms and use of encrypted apps, while others have been banned altogether from mainstream social media networks. Still, the law center said, online platforms allow individuals to interact with hate and anti-government groups without becoming members, maintain connections with likeminded people, and take part in real-world actions, such as last month's siege on the U.S. Capitol. White nationalist organizations, a subset of the hate groups listed in the report, declined last year by more than 100. Those groups had seen huge growth the previous two years after being energized by Donald Trump's campaign and presidency, the report said. The number of anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim and anti-LGBTQ hate groups remained largely stable, while their in-person organizing was hampered by the coronavirus pandemic. Bottom line, the levels of hate and bigotry in America have not diminished, said SPLC President and CEO Margaret Huang. \"What's important is that we start to reckon with all the reasons why those groups have persisted for so long and been able to get so much influence in the last White House, that they actually feel emboldened,\" Huang told the AP. Last month, as President Joe Biden's administration began settling in, the Department of Homeland Security issued an early national terrorism bulletin in response to a growing threat from home-grown extremists, including anti-government militias and white supremacists. The extremists are coalescing under a broader, more loosely affiliated movement of people who reject democratic institutions and multiculturalism, Huang said. The SPLC's report comes out nearly a month after a mostly white mob of Trump supporters and members of far-right groups violently breached the U.S. Capitol building. At least five deaths have been linked to the assault, including a Capitol police officer. Some in the mob waved Confederate battle flags and wore clothing with neo-Nazi symbolism. Federal authorities have charged at least 172 people   and are investigating hundreds more in relation to the deadly Jan. 6 assault. Authorities have also linked roughly 30 defendants to a group or movement, according to an AP review of court records. That includes seven defendants linked to QAnon, a once-fringe internet conspiracy movement that recently grew into a powerful force in mainstream conservative politics; six linked to the Proud Boys, a misogynistic, anti-immigrant and anti-Semitic group with ties to white supremacism; four linked to the Oath Keepers, a paramilitary organization that recruits current and former military, law enforcement and first-responder personnel; four linked to the Three Percenters, an anti-government militia movement; and two leaders of \"Super Happy Fun America,\" a group with ties to white nationalists known for organizing a so-called \"straight pride\" parade in downtown Boston in 2019. Bipartisan critics of Mr. Trump have blamed him for inciting the attack on the Capitol, which some far-right groups have declared a success and are using as a recruitment tool to grow membership, according to the SPLC. The final year of the Trump presidency, marked by a wide-ranging reckoning over systemic racism, also propelled racist conspiracy theories and white nationalist ideology into the political mainstream, the law center said. According to an SPLC survey conducted in August, 29% of respondents said they personally know someone who believes that white people are the superior race. The poll also found that 51% of Americans thought the looting and vandalism that occurred across the country around Black Lives Matter demonstrations was a bigger problem than excessive force by police. Protests over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd last May spurred a push to make the November election a referendum on white supremacy. Nestled in Mr. Trump's baseless claims of widespread voter fraud was a reality that turnout among Black and Hispanic voters played a significant role in handing victory to Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman and first person of Black and South Asian heritage to hold that office. During his inaugural address, Mr. Biden issued a strong repudiation of white supremacy and domestic terrorism, which is rare for such consequential speeches. The SPLC made several recommendations for the new administration in its latest report. It called for establishing offices within the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the FBI to monitor, investigate and prosecute cases of domestic terrorism. It also urged improving\u00a0federal hate crime data collection, training, and prevention; and for enacting federal legislation that shifts funding away from punishment models and toward preventing violent extremism. People who support or express hatred and bigotry are not always card-carrying members of far-right groups. But that doesn't mean they can't be activated into violence, said Christian Picciolini, a former far-right extremist and founder of the Free Radicals Project, a group that helps people disengage from hate organizations. It also doesn't mean that they can't be reached and deradicalized, he said. \"We have to have kind of a dual approach to stop what's happening now, but also to make sure that we are not creating a problem for us in the future, to understand how the propaganda is spread that is recruiting these people,\" Picciolini said. \"Right now, it's in a very self-service format online,\" he added. \"We're facing a really big problem.\"",
