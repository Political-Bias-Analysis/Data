            "article_content": "This past week, President Biden said 90% of U.S. adults will be eligible for the COVID vaccine by April 19 and will be able to get their shots within five miles of their home. That will be welcome news to many in Florida. For three months, we've been reporting around Palm Beach County, the third-largest in the state. It's home to old-monied millionaires but also some of the poorest day laborers and farm workers in America. During those months, we watched Florida's vaccine rollout deteriorate into a virtual free for all and watched as some wealthy and well-connected residents cut the line, leaving other Floridians without a fair shot. This is the town of Palm Beach. Privacy hedges hide beachfront mansions and a healthy share of billionaires. More than 80% of the town's seniors have been vaccinated. Bram Majtlis was one of the first. Bram Majtlis: I was the lucky one that had my phone in my hands, pushed the link to make the appointment, and had an appointment. On January 5, Majtlis, a retired businessman, got his first shot at a fire station just a block from his home. A few days earlier, the town had been given a thousand doses from the state. The vaccine was in short supply. Residents were thrilled. But neighboring towns were upset that Palm Beach was the only town in all of palm beach county to get the life-saving shots for their seniors. Bram Majtlis: I don't think that they got it for any other reason than being prepared. Sharyn Alfonsi: To be prepared you have to have resources. And so I think a lot of people look at Palm Beach and say, \"Well, they got the vaccine because they're a rich community.\" Bram Majtlis: I really think it has nothing to do with the resources. In this particular case. Absolutely not. \u00a0 The Palm Beach fire chief said they spent months training staff and setting up locations to administer the vaccine quickly.\u00a0 But a bridge away in West Palm Beach, they say they were just as prepared. Sharyn Alfonsi: You were ready in West Palm Beach for the vaccine? Keith James: Absolutely. And I even put my signature on the letter to let the governor and the county know that we were ready, willing and able. Keith James is the mayor of West Palm Beach, which is not on the beach at all, but the intercoastal waterway. The median income in West Palm Beach is about $28,000 a year, compared to $70,000 in the town of Palm Beach. \u00a0 \u00a0 James told us after he and other mayors complained about the town of Palm Beach getting the 1,000 doses, the county's health director took the blame, calling it a \"miscommunication.\" Keith James: Listen, the county health director has fallen on the sword on that and said it was her bad. Her organization's bad. They made a mistake. But isn't it funny that these mistakes only happen in communities that have that kind of wealth? They didn't make a mistake and send a thousand doses to the poorest communities in our county? Mayor James is among a number of community leaders who say the state's vaccination rollout has favored the wealthy.\u00a0 Florida's rollout started pretty typically. The first doses were given to health care workers and nursing home residents in early December. But then a few weeks later, Governor Ron DeSantis, breaking from CDC guidelines, announced he would not vaccinate teachers and essential workers next but instead put \"seniors first,\" making anyone 65 or over eligible for the vaccine. The first in the country to do that. DeSantis said seniors were at highest risk. Ron DeSantis at press conference: They will have priority over ordinary workers who are under 65. And I think that that's the appropriate way to do. Florida's four and a half million seniors started competing against each other for the vaccine. \u00a0 In the rush, public health department phone lines failed and computer sites crashed. Kara Macsuga, a teacher, tried to increase the odds of getting her mom an appointment.\u00a0 Kara Macsuga: So I have a school-issued Chromebook. I have my own personal laptop. I have my husband's iPad. I have my ancient iPad. And all four of those screens. It's very deflating, I missed it again today. In some places, seniors waited 17 hours for a shot, but not everyone was so patient. \u00a0Almost immediately, the line jumping started. Keith James: It was incredibly frustrating. In West Palm Beach, Mayor James says he was still trying to secure vaccines for his town's firefighters when he learned that at a nursing home in town, some board members and their wealthy pals got vaccinated. Even though those doses were only supposed to be given to elderly residents and staff. Then, the private jets started arriving. Hollywood moguls, New York socialites and tourists from overseas were getting vaccinated in Florida, posting on social media and sparking outrage. Early on, there were no residency requirements to get vaccinated in the state. Keith James: People were saying, \"Listen, this is a resource and I know it's out there and I'm gonna use whatever leverage I have to get that resource.\" There were no rules. Sharyn Alfonsi: It sounds like \"The Hunger Games.\" Keith James: That's a pretty good way of putting it. And those who had the fiscal resources were gonna use them in whatever way they could to get this vaccine. By February 1, casualties of the chaotic rollout became clear. State data revealed of the more than 160,000 residents in Palm Beach County who'd been vaccinated, only 2% were Black and 3% Hispanic. Even though minorities make up almost half the county. State representative Omari Hardy, a Democrat, says it's all about access. Omari Hardy: At the beginning of this pandemic Black people, Hispanics, people of color, we bore the full force of this pandemic. Overrepresented in the hospitalizations. Overrepresented in the deaths. And now on the back end of the pandemic we're bearing the full force of it as well. Because we don't have the same access to the vaccine. Sharyn Alfonsi: Some people have said that the minority community is distrusting of the vaccine and doesn't want the vaccine. What do you think of that narrative? Omari Hardy: That's an excuse for people who don't want to do the work required to ensure that the distribution of this vaccine is equitable.\u00a0 And nowhere was that more challenging than here. This is the Glades. It's 44 miles west of the town of Palm Beach, also in Palm Beach County. 31,000 people call the Glades \"home.\" Rivers of sugar cane line the roads and the air is thick with the smell of molasses. \u00a0 About 90% of residents are Black and Latino. Many live below the poverty line. By March, 11 weeks into the rollout, more than half the seniors in the Glades had still not been vaccinated. For months, Tammy Jackson-Moore, a community organizer, has been going door to door trying to fix that. We were with her when we met 91-year-old Annie-Pearl Cornelius on her porch. Sharyn Alfonsi: Do you drive? Annie-Pearl Cornelius: No, ma'am. Sharyn Alfonsi: Do you have a computer? Annie-Pearl Cornelius: No, ma'am. Annie-Pearl told us she wanted to get the vaccine for months, but couldn't make an appointment.\u00a0 Tammy Jackson-Moore: A lot of people still have flip phones. So there were a lot of challenges in our community as it relates to people trying to make appointments for vaccinations. But the biggest challenge for residents of the Glades wasn't just making appointments, it was getting to them. That's because back in January, the governor made another game-changing move. He announced he was partnering with Publix grocery stores across the state to distribute the vaccine in their pharmacies.\u00a0 But as part of the program in Palm Beach County, most seniors could no longer get vaccine appointments though their public health departments. They had to go to Publix instead. Tammy Jackson-Moore: I was shocked because I know that we don't have a Publix in our community. And then I got angry, because I personally knew three people that had passed from COVID. And I knew that this was not going to be good for this community.\u00a0 Omari Hardy: Belle Glade is one of the poorest communities, not just in Palm Beach County, but in the state of Florida. So you have lots of folks who don't have cars.\u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi: How far would someone from Belle Glade have to go to get to a Publix? Omari Hardy: The nearest Publix to Belle Glade is about 25 miles. Sharyn Alfonsi: That's pretty significant if you don't drive. You have to catch two buses to get to the nearest Publix from the Glades. It's 34 stops. More than two hours round trip. A daunting task in the middle of a pandemic, especially if you're elderly. So why did the governor choose Publix? Campaign finance reports obtained by 60 Minutes show that weeks before the governor's announcement, Publix donated $100,000 to his political action committee, Friends of Ron DeSantis. \u00a0 Julie Jenkins Fancelli, heiress to the Publix fortune, has given $55,000 to the governor's PAC in the past. And in November, Fancelli's brother-in-law, Hoyt R. Barnett, a retired Publix executive, donated $25,000.\u00a0 Publix did not respond to our request for comment about the donations.\u00a0 Governor DeSantis is up for re-election next year. \u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi: I imagine Governor DeSantis's office would say, \"Look, we privatized the rollout because it's more efficient and it works better.\"\u00a0 Omari Hardy: It hasn't worked better for people of color. Before, I could call the public health director. She would answer my calls. But now if I want to get my constituents information about how to get this vaccine I have to call a lobbyist from Publix? That makes no sense. They're not accountable to the public. Distributing vaccines is lucrative. Under federal guidelines, Publix, like any other private company, can charge medicare $40 a shot to administer the vaccine.\u00a0 We wanted to ask Governor DeSantis about the deal. But he declined our requests for an interview. We caught up with him south of Orlando. Sharyn Alfonsi: Publix, as you know, donated $100,000 to your campaign. And then you rewarded them with the exclusive rights to distribute the vaccination in Palm Beach County. Ron DeSantis: So, first of all, that-- what you're saying is wrong. That's-- Sharyn Alfonsi: How is that not pay to play? Ron DeSantis: --that-- that's a fake narrative. I met with the county mayor. I met with the administrator. I met with all the folks in Palm Beach County and I said, \"here's some of the options. We can do more drive-thru sites. We can give more to hospitals. We can do the Publix.\" And they said, \"We think that would be the easiest thing for our residents.\" But Melissa McKinlay, the county commissioner in the Glades, told us the governor never met with her about the Publix deal. Sharyn Alfonsi: The criticism is that it's pay-to-play, governor. Ron DeSantis: And it's wrong. It's wrong. It's a fake narrative. I just disabused you of the narrative. And you don't care about the facts. Because, obviously, I laid it out for you in a way that is irrefutable. Sharyn Alfonsi: Well, I-- I was just talk-- Ron DeSantis: And, so, it's clearly not. Sharyn Alfonsi: Isn't there the nearest Publix -- Ron DeSantis: No, no, no. You're wrong. Sharyn Alfonsi: --30 miles away. Ron DeSantis: You're wrong. You're wrong. Yes, sir? Sharyn Alfonsi: That's actually a fact. A federal complaint raises other questions about the governor's vaccine distribution decisions and alleges Governor DeSantis was discriminating when he hand-picked communities for pop-up sites across the state. One of those communities was Lakewood Ranch in Manatee County just south of Tampa. In February, the governor announced he was giving 3,000 doses to the community. Ron DeSantis: We saw a need, we want to get the numbers up for seniors. But what the governor didn't mention was that Lakewood Ranch developer Pat Neal has donated $135,000 to the Friends of Ron DeSantis PAC. \u00a0 Or that only residents from two ZIP codes would be allowed to get the shots and those two ZIP codes have some of highest income levels and lowest COVID infection rates in the county. \u00a0 \u00a0 When the governor was questioned about it, he threatened to take all the vaccine back. Ron DeSantis: I mean if Manatee County doesn't like us doing this, then we are totally fine with putting this in counties that want it.\u00a0 Annie-Pearl Cornelius got her first shot last month at a weekly vaccination site the state set up in the Glades. The local CVS and Walgreens have been given vaccine, too. There is no shortage of takers. State Democratic leaders are calling for the Justice Department to investigate whether Governor DeSantis was rewarding high-dollar donors with special access to the vaccine.\u00a0 Omari Hardy: This is a once-in-a-century pandemic. Someone shouldn't have a better chance to survive because they have money or because they can write a check to someone, or because they have access to powerful people. A spokesperson for Publix Super Markets provided the following statement to 60 Minutes: \"The irresponsible suggestion that there was a connection between campaign contributions made to Governor DeSantis and our willingness to join other pharmacies in support of the state's vaccine distribution efforts is absolutely false and offensive. We are proud of our pharmacy associates for administering more than 1.5 million doses of vaccine to date and for joining other retailers in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia to do our part to help our communities emerge from the pandemic.\" Produced by Oriana Zill de Granados.

And this week on FACE THE NATION, as the Delta variant marches through the U.S., tempers flash over whether or not to mandate vaccines and masks. The Delta's surge of Southern swing appears to be peaking, but as it moves north, it's hitting some states just as students are returning to school. America's anger is spreading, too. CROWD (in unison): We will not comply. We will not comply. JOHN DICKERSON: This time there's an alarming rise in cases among those who don't even have a choice when it comes to getting a vaccine: Kids. DR. PETER HOTEZ: I don't think the virus is target-- targeting kids necessarily, I just think there's a firestorm under way and kids are getting swept up in it. JOHN DICKERSON: President Biden singled out Republican governors who have openly disregarded federal mask guidance despite local spikes in cases, and is reportedly considering limiting federal money that goes to states unless they improve their vaccination rates. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I say to these governors, please help. But if you aren't going to help, at least get out of the way of the people who are trying to do the right thing. JOHN DICKERSON: Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis is threatening to withhold some funding to those school systems who do require masks. RON DESANTIS: If you're trying to deny kids a proper in-person education, I'm going to stand in your way. JOHN DICKERSON: We'll talk with the Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona about the COVID challenges facing America's education system. And we'll ask Alberto Carvalho, the superintendent in Florida's Miami-Dade County, how his district plans to handle the governor's threat. We'll also talk with Arkansas Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson, who says he now regrets signing a law banning state mask mandates, and is confronting vaccine hesitation among his constituents head on. And we'll check in with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Plus, we'll preview CBS THIS MORNING and the Albany Times Union's exclusive interview with Brittany Commisso. She's speaking for the first time about why she's filed a criminal sexual harassment complaint against embattled New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. BRITTANY COMMISSO (CBS THIS MORNING/Times Union, Exclusive): What he did to me was a crime. He broke the law. JOHN DICKERSON: Finally, we'll sit down with author Amanda Ripley. Her new book, \"High Conflict,\" examines how in this age of outrage we can find our way back to productive conversations. It's all coming up on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We thought we were done with that feeling in our fight against COVID-19 that one step forward could be followed by two steps back. But we're not done. The U.S. is now reporting an average of one hundred thousand new cases a day, up from fifteen thousand a day just a month ago. Public health officials expect that number to go a lot higher before it begins to drop. What is different, though, is that during this time of backslide, there is something that we could only hope for during previous ones--a vaccine. But one hundred million Americans who are eligible for the vaccine have not gotten it. We begin this morning with our senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann in Marietta, Georgia. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): Cajun country versus COVID, it's not a fair fight. Louisiana has one of America's lowest vaccination rates. COVID hospitalizations are eight times higher than they were five weeks ago. FELICIA CROFT (Willis-Knighton Medical Center): People are younger and sicker, and we're intubating and losing people that are my age and younger. MARK STRASSMANN: In two weeks, one percent of Louisiana's entire population has caught the virus. JOHN BEL EDWARDS: We have no reason to believe in our data that we've reached the peak or that we're coming down. We have more children sick with COVID-19 than at any other time during the pandemic. MARK STRASSMANN: Across America seventy-one thousand kids tested positive in the last week of July. One in five new cases as the Delta variant stalks the unvaccinated of all ages. WOMAN #1: The level of sick visits that we've seen this summer, June, July, and now August, I've never seen in twenty years of practice here in Houston. MARK STRASSMANN: Another negative: Surging positivity rates. Twenty states are over ten percent. More alarming, Idaho, Oklahoma, and Mississippi, over forty percent. Two states, Texas and Florida, make up nearly one-third of America's new COVID cases. Both governors oppose universal masking as schools open. GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS (R-Florida): We can either have a free society or we can have a biomedical security state. And I can tell you, Florida, we're a free state. MARK STRASSMANN: Free state, costly approach. WOMAN #2: So we have basically patient everywhere, in both sides of the-- the unit. MARK STRASSMANN: On Friday the state set a daily record--nearly twenty-four thousand new cases. Hospitalizations have quadrupled in a month. Deaths have doubled. (APPLAUSE) MARK STRASSMANN: Despite the run-away spread, COVID's culture war is unrelenting. More schools opened this week, more parents will square off about protecting kids. MAN #1: You can't mask the kids. It's unconstitutional. It's child abuse. And everybody knows it. MARK STRASSMANN: Anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers. GOVERNOR PHIL MURPHY (D-New Jersey): These folks back there have lost their minds; you've lost your minds. You are the ultimate knuckleheads. MAN #2: The only way to fight against it is we get the shot. MARK STRASSMANN: Urgency now drives vaccination campaigns, right behind the Delta variant lurks the Lambda variant. More employers have a new vaccine policy: get it or get gone, including Microsoft, Tyson Foods and United Airlines. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Here in Georgia, the number of new daily cases is at its highest level since late January before the vaccine was widely available. Hundreds of them in Metro Atlanta are kids. They tested positive during the first week of school. John. JOHN DICKERSON: Mark Strassmann in Atlanta. Thank you. We go now to the Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, who joins us from Little Rock. Good morning, Governor. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON (R-Arkansas/@AsaHutchinson): Good morning, John. Great to be with you this morning. JOHN DICKERSON: It's good to have you. I want to start with schools and masks before we move on to the bigger issue of vaccinations. But they're related because in schools, those under twelve can't get vaccinated. You signed a bill that was against mask mandates. You changed your position. Why? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, facts change and leaders have to adjust to the new facts that you have and the reality of what you have to deal with. Whenever I signed that law our cases were low. We were hoping that the whole thing was gone in terms of the virus, but it roared back with the Delta variant. And whenever, we-- you know, we're pushing the vaccines out, but those under twelve cannot get vaccinated in the schools. And so I realized that we needed to have more options for our local school districts to protect those children. And so I asked the legislature to redo the law that prohibited those requirements or those options for the school districts to protect the children. And so it was an error to sign that law. I admit that. Thank goodness if the legislature did not act this week, which they didn't, the court stepped in and held that as unconstitutional. And now we have that local flexibility for schools to make their decision to protect the children based upon the unique circumstances of their district. JOHN DICKERSON: When you say facts change, do you see something in the last few weeks, particularly with respect to those under twelve who are in hospitals who are getting COVID? Did you see and learn more about the way in which the Delta variant is affecting that specific part of your community? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: We have. And part of it is that the Delta variant is so transmissible that it affects every population. The higher age group populations have been vaccinated. So we're seeing forty-year-olds in the hospital and on vents and-- and then it goes down. And while the children are less susceptible to it and have less at risk, still a small number of children find themselves in the hospital. We've had over twenty-four in our children's hospital. We've had three adolescents die. They couldn't be vaccinated. And-- and so I look at that and I say that we've got to do everything we can to protect those children. Everybody else can be vaccinated. And I'm pushing those vaccinations. We don't need other stringent measures there because vaccine is their solution. But for those under twelve, we want them to go to school and we need to have that flexibility because they do have some risk. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get to the vaccine solution in a moment. But, quickly, about the Marion School District. I think there are about nine hundred students and teachers in quarantine. Do you feel like that wouldn't have happened if the school district had had the freedom of local control and the ability to have a mask mandate in that school district? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, if we would have had more vaccines out, those numbers would have been less. But it illustrates the point that if we're going to have a successful school year, school districts like Marion need to have that option to require masks for those lower grades or make the decision that's suitable for their community. But let me emphasize a point here that ordinarily you have about 2.5 contacts from one exposure that has to be quarantined. But in the school environment, it was more like eighteen to one. And so that's why we had so many that were quarantined. And you can't have a successful school year with that kind of exposure in the school. And so vaccines, as well as flexibility of the local school district would be the key, in my judgment. JOHN DICKERSON: Last time you were on the program, Arkansas was forty-sixth in the nation in terms of first vaccinations. It has now risen to thirty-eighth in the nation. So it has gotten better. Sixty percent of Arkansans are now gotten at least one shot. What accounts for that improvement? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, two things: we did start our community conversations, which are town halls that I've been to over twelve cities, and those honest conversations from skeptics to trusted advisers in the community has spurred action to increase vaccination rates. But even more significantly, the risk factor is at play. And people see the hospitalizations up. They see the cases. They see what happens to their neighbors. They're worried about it. They're going out and getting vaccinated. We want to continue to mount that campaign to engage our local communities. Hopefully, we can be successful and continue that increase our vaccination rate. That's the only way out of it. JOHN DICKERSON: Last time you were on you said if incentives don't work reality will. And it seems to have kicked in. When you have these conversations in the community--a new Kaiser Foundation poll found that half of those who are unvaccinated say that they're more worried about the vaccine than getting sick. When that comes up in your conversations, what do you say to people? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, first of all, it's not what the government says, and I recognize that's not going to be the answer that is needed or is persuasive. But I will call on a local physician that they know that they trust in their community and ask, what do you say about that? And that trusted adviser is more persuasive and fact oriented and helps to dispel the myths. The second thing that's important is the FDA has to act. We've had over-- well-over a hundred million Americans that are vaccinated. They're not going to come in now and say, well, that shouldn't have been approved. You know as, Doctor Fauci says, they're dotting the I's and crossing the T's. We need that final FDA approval. They need to act. JOHN DICKERSON: Do you think if the FDA approves, that there would be any vaccine mandates in school districts or that would kick in after that full approval happens? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Not in Arkansas. I don't support a vaccine mandate. We can do it through education, but I do expect that broader acceptance of the vaccine--I do expect that some employers in sensitive industries will require vaccines. But you have to have the FDA approval before that is more broadly accepted. JOHN DICKERSON: When you've been going around the state and-- and encountering your constituents, a lot of times in this pandemic, people have said we're all in this together. But you made a statement this week where you said some politicians are, you know, playing to people's fears and not being compassionate. Are we all in this together based on your experience? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, we're all in it in terms of trying to get through the pandemic, but we have to have leaders that will step up and say that's a myth that's not supported, and you all need to listen rationally to people. We can't just give in to the loudest voice, which is fifteen percent of people who's not going to take the vaccine regardless, that believes in the conspiracy theories that are totally irrational. And we have to have leaders that will be able to resist that loudest voice in the room and talk common sense, compassion, and logic to them. JOHN DICKERSON: Finally, Governor, as we go out the door here, you served as chairman on the National Governors Association. The Democratic co-chairman was Andrew Cuomo. When Margaret was here and asked you about it, you said you're going to wait for that investigation to take place in New York. Investigation has taken place. A lot of people think he should step down. Do you have a view? GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, the investigation was very thorough. The allegations could not be more serious. No woman should have to go to the workplace and have to choose between a paycheck and being assaulted, particularly when it's in a public environment. So he either needs to resign in the face of this. Certainly, if criminal charges are filed, he should resign. It's-- it's a sad circumstance, but that was a very credible review. And the allegations are very serious. And that should not be tolerated in a public environment for sure, much less a private environment. JOHN DICKERSON: Governor Hutchinson, thanks so much for being with us. GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: In an exclusive interview for CBS THIS MORNING and the Albany Times Union, national correspondent Jericka Duncan spoke to Brittany Commisso, who was going public for the first time since she was identified as executive assistant number one in the New York attorney general's devastating report of sexual harassment charges against Governor Andrew Cuomo. In that report Commisso said she was groped and sexually harassed by the governor, and on Friday filed a criminal complaint against him with the Albany sheriff's office. Commisso is one of eleven women accusing the governor of sexual misconduct. And the state assembly is expected to finish an impeachment inquiry later this week. Cuomo denies the allegations and says he will not step down. JERICKA DUNCAN (CBS THIS MORNING/Times Union): Why did you file that criminal complaint with the sheriff's office? BRITTANY COMMISSO (CBS THIS MORNING/Times Union): It was the right thing to do. The governor needs to be held accountable. JERICKA DUNCAN: And just so I'm clear again-- BRITTANY COMMISSO: Mm-Hm. JERICKA DUNCAN: --being held accountable to you-- BRITTANY COMMISSO: Mm-Hm. JERICKA DUNCAN: --means seeing the governor charged with a crime? BRITTANY COMMISSO: What he did to me was a crime. He broke the law. JOHN DICKERSON: You can see more of Jericka's interview tomorrow on CBS THIS MORNING. FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And it's back to school time across America, so we turn to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona. He joins us from Meriden, Connecticut. Good morning, Mister Secretary. I want to jump right in. The governors of Texas and Florida have enacted measure-- measures to forbid mask mandates. You said you were going to talk to them. Have you talked to them? Or if you haven't, when you do, what will you say? MIGUEL CARDONA (Secretary of Education/@SecCardona): Good morning, John. Yes, we are ready, fifty million students across the country are ready to return to school in person. We owe it to our students to safely reopen schools and make sure they have the best opportunity for learning, which we know as educators is in person. And, yes, it's in all hands on deck effort. I have calls out to many governors, including Governor Hutchinson, which we just heard from. And I did talk to Governor Abbott and I spoke to the commissioner in Florida. We need to work together to make sure our schools are safe for all students and for our staff. JOHN DICKERSON: You make any progress in those phone calls? MIGUEL CARDONA: You know I think what we're seeing across the country is we recognize the importance of vaccinations and the President put a charge on all of us. Let's get our vaccination pop-up clinics set up in our schools where students feel comfortable going to get it. And I think everyone across the country agrees on that. I believe strongly that we need to do everything, including our mitigation strategies, to make sure our students are safe. The data is showing us that in places where they're not following those mitigation strategies we're putting students at risk. We can't accept them. JOHN DICKERSON: You said in a briefing this week that governors in those states of Texas and Florida are putting politics-- they're letting politics interfere. Do you see no merit, though, to their argument that basically the school experience is-- is impinged by wearing a mask? MIGUEL CARDONA: Listen, I understand the fatigue of wearing masks. I don't like wearing masks. I know my own children don't want to wear masks. They are vaccinated, but we also understand that this is bigger than us. We're trying to keep infection rates low. And I think it's more dangerous for students to be home and have interrupt-- interrupted learning because of the decisions that we're making. We're clearly at a fork in the road in this country. You're either going to help students be in school in person and keep them safe or the decisions you make are going to hurt students. That's where we are right now. And while I understand the argument around not wanting to wear masks because we're fatigued, it-- it-- without question, student safety and staff safety come first. JOHN DICKERSON: And your-- your argument, as I take it, is that if you don't allow some flexibility or if you don't have masks in schools, you're going to see interruptions. I mean there's a quarter of the country in which there are these blockages on mask mandates. Do you expect in that quarter of the country you could have schooling actually fully interrupted? MIGUEL CARDONA: I do believe that. I mean the segment before eighteen students in a classroom had to be quarantined because masks weren't being used and, perhaps, they were in close contact. We've done this before. Last year we spent a whole year trying to safely reopen schools. This year we have the benefit of the return to school roadmap that provides tips for families and for schools, the benefit of the American Rescue Plan where resources are there to make sure our schools are safe and then the vaccination efforts that are underway. We know what works. We've seen it work. We just have to follow the guidance from CDC and let our educators and education leaders lead. They know what to do to keep our schools safe. Let's give them the opportunity to do what's right. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me get your insight on some-- on the cost of this pandemic, on schooling. The New York Times had an analysis they did with Stanford University that showed that in thirty-three states, ten thousand local public schools lost at least twenty percent of their kindergartners. First of all, can you assess the gravity of that figure? And, secondly, what are we going to do about it? MIGUEL CARDONA: Yeah. I saw that, and my experience last year in Connecticut, as we reopened schools, we-- we saw also that our kindergarten numbers were very low. Half of the number of students that didn't return to school were three-, four-, and five-year-olds; and what that tells us is that we must double down as educators to reach out to those families and share with them what we're doing to keep their children safe. You know, as I said before, as a parent, nothing is more important to me than the safety of my children. And I think our role now as educators is to communicate that schools are safe places. We know early childhood education is critically important to the success of our students. So having our students come into the classroom where they learn by doing, learning social and emotional skills by doing as three-, four- or five-year-olds is critically important. It's our job now to help parents feel comfortable with what we're doing to keep their children safe. JOHN DICKERSON: One of the ways that parents can feel comfortable is increasing the vaccination rates, as you mentioned, particularly with teachers. What is your position on teachers' mandatory vaccination among teachers in schools? MIGUEL CARDONA: Sure, well, we're promoting the week of action where we're really getting the message across the country to get vaccinated when you're eligible. We're having pop up clinics in schools. And just tomorrow, I'm going to be in Kansas with the Second Gentleman promoting some of the vaccine efforts underway there. And for the educators I feel strongly that if you're eligible to get vaccinated, get vaccinated, do your part to make sure that we're all safe and that we can reopen schools without interruptions. Again, our students have suffered enough. It's time for all of us to do our part to keep our students and staff safe. Students need to be in the classrooms. That's where they learn best. JOHN DICKERSON: Teachers union representative Randi Weingarten on NBC suggested that the teachers should get vaccinated. How helpful will that be in that cause? MIGUEL CARDONA: It's helpful and-- and, quite frankly, I think we recognize as educators across the country that we're going to get farther if we work together and that's what we're seeing across the country. Educators who have bent over backwards for our students this last year are coming together to say, let's do our part. We know they-- they are lining up to get vaccinated. Ninety percent of the teachers across the country have gotten vaccinated. We're proud of that. We want to keep the efforts going. We want our youth to get vaccinated. Listen, and-- and to those who are making policies that are preventing this, don't be the reason why schools are interrupted, why children can't go to extracurricular activities, why games are canceled. We need to do our part as leaders like Governor Hutchinson is doing, to make sure that they have access to the decision that they need to make to get their students safely back in school. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Secretary Cardona, thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate it. MIGUEL CARDONA: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: If you're not able to watch the full FACE THE NATION, you can set your DVR or we're available on demand. Plus, you can watch us through our CBS or Paramount+ app. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And we'll be right back with Miami-Dade County Public School Superintendent Alberto Carvalho, former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, and author Amanda Ripley. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. The Miami-Dade County public school system is the fourth largest in the country. School starts there in two weeks. Superintendent Alberto Carvalho joins us from Miami-- Miami. Mister Superintendent, let me start with the governor. He signed a-- an executive order banning mask mandates in schools. You have about three hundred and thirty-four thousand students. The governor threatened funding to your school system if there are-- is a mask mandate. How are you weighing the governor's order and the health of your students? ALBERTO CARVALHO (Superintendent of Miami-Dade County Public Schools/@MiamiSup): Good morning, John. Number one, we have been a school system that's been guided by science all along, We've navigated this awful pandemic with the expert advice of public health and medical experts, and we're not going to abdicate that position. We'll continue to be a district that's oriented by the expert advice of professionals. It is sad that currently in America we see this rhetorical narrative that's deeply influenced by politics rather than-- than medicine and the wise advice of those who know best what's in the best interests of our students and the professionals who teach them. But, look, we are in a privileged position in Miami-Dade as we have time in our hands. Most of the school systems in Florida open tomorrow. We have two additional weeks to continue to negotiate, as Secretary Cardona indicated, a practicable, reasonable solutions that achieve two things. Number one, the appropriate protocols for a safe reopening of schools without compromising the health insurances for our students and our teachers while simultaneously avoiding these punitive defunding strategies. That could be a consequence of a defiance of the executive order or the emergency rules that were followed after the publication of the executive order by the Department of Health and the Education. JOHN DICKERSON: When do you think you'll have to make the call? ALBERTO CARVALHO: We hope to make the call immediately after our last meeting with the health task force that was convened by the school system over a year ago, which include-- which includes individuals like-- like U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, Doctor Aileen Marty. These are experts in the field who have advised our school system and will continue to advise Miami-Dade County public schools. JOHN DICKERSON: The governor says that there is the science, but then there is also the mental health of the children, which he says will be significantly affected by wearing masks. How do you as someone who has been in education at the level you have, how do you evaluate that assessment about masks and-- and students? ALBERTO CARVALHO: I think it's a fair-- I think it's a fair comment that we should have a balanced set of protocols and safeguards that, number one, ensure the health and well-being from a protective and preventive perspective of our students and-- and employees side-by-side, obviously, with the psychological impacts that we hope to protect on the part of students. And I think we are-- we are poised to be able to do that with technologies that we have in place with much improved contact-tracing protocols, much-improved quarantine rules in place. We believe we can do this without, in a deleterious way, impacting the well-being, psychological, mental well-being of students, but also while protecting the health and well-being in the school environment. Look, I am one who is driven by parental choice. We have seventy-five percent of our students enrolled in nontraditional programs in Miami-Dade. We are one of the highest performing urban school systems in the country and we hope to be able to negotiate a reopening of schools with protocols that, number one, provide protection for our students with masks while simultaneously avoiding financial consequences-- JOHN DICKERSON: Let me-- ALBERTO CARVALHO: --perhaps allowing some degree of parental opt-out provisions. JOHN DICKERSON: You, as I understand it, were a part of a school-district-wide campaign to talk to households where they were reluctant about coming back to school. You, apparently, had a pretty good track record. You talked to thirty families, got twenty-three to agree to come back. Can you tell us what those conversations were like? ALBERTO CARVALHO: Absolutely, John. Look, I think across the country, we have been ex-- extremely concerned for a long time over the unfinished learning that we observed in every single state associated with the pandemic and social isolation. We were able to early on, based on early assessments, determined that there were communities of students, particularly, English language learners, fragile students who lived in poverty, and students with disabilities who were regressing in a very aggressive way. We identified those students. We called the parents, and the parents, quite frankly, were making decisions driven by two factors, one at work circumstances that put them in a position of keeping their kids at home, often older kids supervising younger kids, which was heartbreaking. Secondly, making decisions on the basis of underlying conditions faced by the parents themselves, a relative or the child. We provided assurance to the parents and we were able to return to the schoolhouse thousands of students who are absolutely better served in a physical environment with a caring professional in front of them rather than distance learning through virtual means. JOHN DICKERSON: You grew up in Portugal in what you described as pretty dramatic poverty. As you have these conversations and look at your community and what has been lost during the period of COVID, can you give me your assessment of those, the poorest, who have schooling as their route to possible opportunity in America, what the damage has been in that community? ALBERTO CARVALHO: We know, John, that the greatest equalizer in our democratic country is the power of public education, where ninety percent of our children are educated and, that is, you know, so true, particularly when you reference children in poverty who make up seventy-five percent of our student population in Miami-Dade. And we know that schools offer that ramp of opportunity, that ramp of hope for these kids. That is why all of our efforts are geared towards welcoming every one of our children back into a physical school in reality, come August 23rd, with acceleration towards full potential for all kids, with longer school days, with summer school opportunities that we built this year servicing-- serving in excess of seventy-five thousand students, providing additional coaches and interventionists, additional mental health professionals to, quite frankly, provide a holistic approach that will address the unfinished learning that thousands of kids across America have experienced. And that's why I tell you, John, we ought to pay less attention to the loud voices that are often disconnected from reason and focus our attention on students, teachers, and healthy protective environments while allowing at the same time the mental and social emotional protections for students and some degree, obviously, of qualified parental choice. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Superintendent Carvalho, thank you so much for being with us. Good luck with your decision. And we'll be right back with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who is on the board of Pfizer and is the author of an upcoming book, \"Uncontrolled Spread: Why COVID-19 Crushed Us and How We Can Defeat the Next Pandemic.\" Good morning, Doctor Gottlieb. I want to start with a Harris poll. It showed that for the first time in two months, Americans think that the pandemic is getting worse rather than getting better. What do you think? SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Well, look, it's certainly getting worse. I think you're going to start to see improvements, particularly in the South. There is evidence that the rate of growth in the cases in the South is starting to decline. I think that this week you may see some of the states that have been the outbreak states start to tip over in terms of showing less cases on a daily basis. The rate of expansion, the epidemic is clearly slowing in states like Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri. But, at the same time, we now see the virus spreading to northern states. So cases are building in states like Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina. So this is an epidemic that's going to sweep across the nation at different points in time. I think the northern states are more impervious to the kind of spread we saw in the South, but they're not completely impervious. They have higher vaccination rates, there's been more prior infection. But there's still people who are vulnerable in those states. And-- and the challenge right now is that the infection is going to start to collide with the opening of school. And we have seen that the schools can become sources of community transmission when you're dealing with more transmissible strains. We saw that with B.1.1.7 in states like Michigan and Massachusetts and Delta is far more transmissible than B.1.1.7. So that creates a lot of risk that the spread in the northern states is going to start to collide with the opening of school. JOHN DICKERSON: So let's update our thinking here about schools. Your argument is you saw it before even you saw a spread in schools. Now there's a more transmissible variant, so you're likely to see more. But Governor DeSantis in Florida said that schools were, quote, \"a low-risk environment,\" unquote. Is that wrong? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, schools aren't inherently safe. They can be made more safe if you take the proper steps, but we can't expect the same outcome that we saw earlier with respect to the schools where we were largely able to control large outbreaks in the schools with a different set of behaviors. If we're going to change what we do in terms of the mitigation in how we approach the schools, we're going to withdraw masks. We're not going to engage in testing. We're not going to be pod-ing students. We're not going to try to de-densify classes. We can expect a different result, especially with a more transmissible strain. I would enter the school year with a degree of caution and keep in place some of these measures and see how it goes, particularly in areas where there's higher prevalence. I wouldn't be withdrawing these things a priori before the school year gets underway, given the fact that we're dealing with a strain that we don't fully understand. This strain is clearly more transmissible. It's going to be harder to control in a school setting, and it may be more pathogenic. Kids are getting sick with it. We don't know if they're getting sick at a higher rate or we're just infecting a whole lot of kids right now. I can't think of a business right now that would put thirty unvaccinated people in a confined space without masks and keep them there for the whole day. No business would do that responsibly. And, yet, that's what we're going to be doing in some schools. So I think we need to enter the school year with a degree of humility and prudence. JOHN DICKERSON: In the-- in keeping that in mind, that humility and prudence, we've talked a great deal about masks. What else should schools be doing to stay on top of this new variant in this time when kids are coming back? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, with respect to masks, first of all, I'd still be looking at higher quality masks. The Utah governor recently announced that he's making available to every school KN95 masks. Now-- now, they're not mandating masks in Utah. And I think most governors will not be mandating masks, but they're leaving discretion to local officials to implement masks depending on what the local circumstances are. And I think that that's the prudent step that we should be doing. The other thing schools could be doing is operationalizing testing on a regular basis. There's a lot of money, federal money that's been flowing into states to support testing regimes. Now a lot of states have had a hard time standing that up, but some have done it quite well. California is going to be testing all students there. They're-- they've created their own lab. North Carolina, Maryland, ma-- Massachusetts have turned to private labs. The Broad is doing a lot of testing for New England states. In New York City they're doing saliva testing on all students with the help of Mount Sinai that-- University Medical Center that I'm affiliated with. So a lot of states are going to be doing testing, but there's still a lot of states that won't be. And I think that that's a very prudent step. The other thing that's very important is- is pod-ing, keeping kids in defined social pods so that if you do have a case, you don't have to quarantine the entire school. You can track exposure. Right now, the former surgeon general, my friend Jerome Adams, pointed out that many schools require parents to report if the kids have lice but don't require to report if the kids contract COVID. We need to turn that around. We need to still be vigilant heading into the school year. And I think from a standpoint of parents, what they can be doing is checking local prevalence, trying to get high quality masks, if prevalence is high, you know, sending kids to school with masks, even if it's not required and monitoring symptoms and maybe doing home testing, as well, and avoiding unnecessary congregate settings. So if you can avoid activities, after-school activities that are done indoors without masks for the time being, try to do that. This is going to be a short-lived wave of infection. It might be our last wave of infection. We have the means to protect ourselves. I think we ought to adhere to them. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you now for parents who are considering getting their kids vaccinated. So those would be over twelve years old, a lot of parents have expressed nervousness in this regard. What would your advice be to a parent who is weighing that decision about getting their-- their child vaccinated? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, talk to your pediatrician. Vaccination rates are still low among kids in-- in the twelve-to-fifteen age group, about thirty percent of children have been vaccinated. In the sixteen-to-seventeen age group, about forty percent. Now is the time if you're going to vaccinate your child in advance of the school year, to do it. I think for most parents you should talk to your doctor, because this isn't just a binary decision between do I vaccinate or don't I vaccinate? There's different strategies that doctors might recommend for different children in terms of how you vaccinate kids. Some doctors I know are telling parents, maybe go with one dose for now in lower-risk kids. Some doctors are spacing it apart. So pediatricians are making judgment calls in terms of how they approach this. So I think parents who are uncomfortable or reluctant to get their children vaccinated really should afford themselves the opportunity to talk to a physician and see if there's a way to tailor an approach that can address any concerns that they may have. JOHN DICKERSON: The FDA is now or-- or the administration is now moving to your position on boosters, which is that it should be-- there should be boosters for the immunocompromised. We also think about nursing homes in this context. Can you tell us, given that they're going to be boosters coming, are they going to come in time for Delta? What's your sense of when somebody who needs a booster might be able to actually get it? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, so the reporting is that the FDA is going to make a decision on immunocompromised patients within a week and maybe make a decision on older patients, patients over the age of sixty-five, maybe as early as September. I think, unfortunately, it's going to come-- come a little bit too late for this Delta wave, because by the time you actually make that decision, then CDC issues a recommendation, then you start operationalizing a booster campaign. You're talking about maybe late October at the earliest if the decision comes in September that you can start really getting a sizable number of people boosted. It takes time to get that stood up and get people into the doctor's office to get those injections. And it's going to take a couple of weeks for the immunity that the booster is offered to mature. So it's something that we should be considering, I think, right now, particularly with immunocompromised patients, not just people with pre-existing health conditions, but also people in congregate settings like nursing homes, long-term care facilities who are vulnerable. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you as always. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: From politics to policy, it seems a lot of debates these days have become filled with toxicity and outrage to the point where we are no longer listening to each other. Amanda Ripley is the author of \"High Conflict: Why We Get Trapped and How We Can Get Out,\" and has some ideas on how we can transform dissension in this country. It's a tall order, Amanda, but we're going to start with defining our terms. What does high conflict mean? AMANDA RIPLEY (Author, High Conflict: Why We Get Trapped and How We Get Out/@amandaripley): So high conflict can start small, but it becomes an all-consuming us-versus-them feud that sort of takes on a life of its own. So it doesn't operate according to the normal rules of conflict. Anything, any counter, any intuitive thing you do in high conflict usually will backfire. Right? So it's important to understand that in high conflict, we all make a lot of mistakes. We're making them right now, as you can see, in all kinds of ways, right? So in a high conflict, people behave differently. We sent-- we tend to get really certain of our own moral superiority and we make a lot of mistakes about the other side. So the-- the key thing to understand is that we have to do the counterintuitive thing and we have to do it with great care. JOHN DICKERSON: The counterintuitive thing being opening, basically being more empathetic about the other side, just as your high conflict instincts are telling you that you want to bury the other side in the deep shale? AMANDA RIPLEY: Exactly. I mean there's a few things you want to not do, right, that-- that your body wants to do. JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. AMANDA RIPLEY: So a few of those are sort of the tripwires that tend to lead to high conflict. It's important to understand. One of those is humiliation, don't humiliate your opponents. Whether you intend to or not humiliation is the nuclear bomb of the emotions, as the psychologist Evelin Lindner puts it. And you will do yourself a great disservice. Right? So calling names, that sort of thing. Nelson Mandela has a great quote where he says, \"There is no one more dangerous than one who has been humiliated, even when you do so rightly.\" So I love the end of that quote. Also, you want to distance yourself to the degree possible from conflict entrepreneurs. These are people or pundits or platforms that intentionally exploit conflict for their own ends. JOHN DICKERSON: So bad-faith actors essentially? AMANDA RIPLEY: Yeah, people who really delight in every twist and turn of the conflict. And right now we tend to amplify those voices--right?--on social media and other places. And if you can't distance yourself from the conflict entrepreneurs in your life, you want to try to redirect their energy to the degree possible on something more constructive. JOHN DICKERSON: And you actually studied the kind of structural nature of these high conflict. So anybody who's listening can think of mask debates, vaccine debates, debates over things that are done and settled, like who won the last election. We all know that President Biden did. And, yet, there are virulent debates about a fantasy world in which he didn't. So everything I just said probably infuriated some number of people. So you studied the structural parts of this. Give me a little bit more about how we unwind from that structural-- those structural forces. AMANDA RIPLEY: Yeah. So it turns out that how we behave in political high conflict is not different from how we behave in high-conflict divorces. Right? Or other kinds of high-- high conflict all over the world. You know I followed people who were really stuck in conflict, whether they were politicians or gang members or even guerrilla fighters in civil wars. And it is always the same behavior. It's not about the facts. It's not about the original cause of the dispute. What starts to happen in every high conflict is we have a lot of the wrong fights with the wrong people and we don't have the fights we most need to have, right? So every high conflict has the thing it seems to be about-vaccines, masks, et cetera, right? And then the thing it's really about, which is the understory of the conflict, which usually not always is about fear, humiliation, a need to belong and to matter, right? So those are the things you want to try to get to if you're going to make any progress so that you can have the right fight. Because the truth is we need good conflict in this country, right? JOHN DICKERSON: Sure. AMANDA RIPLEY: Like there are a lot of fights that we need to have, but we need to have them in a way that they don't destroy us, right? JOHN DICKERSON: Right. Founded the country on the idea of if we have good conflict, it will keep us from going into the streets and having actual fisticuffs. AMANDA RIPLEY: Right. You need to channel that. I mean people need to push each other and-- and-- and defend themselves and be pushed and be challenged, right? Like that's how we get growth. JOHN DICKERSON: So in the toolkit to try to avoid high conflict, and the reason you want to do that is to create collective solutions, the first thing to do is think about what is this high conflict really about? AMANDA RIPLEY: Exactly. JOHN DICKERSON: And, again, just to be clear, you're not talking about debate and argument. You're talking about a new level-- AMANDA RIPLEY: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: --which is just-- so in that new level you want to figure out what the debate is about and then what's-- what's next in the things I would try to practice? AMANDA RIPLEY: So another thing you would want to do is resist the binary, resist the urge to divide the world cleanly into two camps. That is not possible. It is very tempting, right? But don't do it. Just catch yourself doing it, because what happens is we make a lot of mistakes, we miss big opportunities when we do that, right? And so you cannot divide. You cannot put seventy-five million people in this country who-- who all call themselves Republicans or Democrats in one bucket. That's just madness, right? We are all many things. Try to speak to another identity outside of the conflict. Right? As a New Yorker or a Californian or a, you know, Floridian or a parent is a very good one because you see and we saw this on your show today, in every high conflict, it is always kids who suffer the worst of it, right? Everyone suffers in high conflict, but kids suffer the worst. So speaking to people's alternate identities outside of the conflict is a very powerful maneuver. JOHN DICKERSON: You-- you talk to academics who studied conflict and keying on your idea about binary decisions that complexity when people recognize the complexity of things, that helps them get out of their binary instincts. Is that right? AMANDA RIPLEY: Right. So in a time of high conflict, we all get oversimplified, right, in our perception of the world. So the more you can amplify and surface real complexity, right, like real complexity of humans, the more people become open to information they didn't want to hear. What you're trying to do is revive curiosity in a time of false simplicity, right? And once you do that, you start to see people's whole expression changes. They start to say more nuanced things. They admit to more internal doubt and-- and-- and uncertainty. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. Amanda Ripley, thank you so much. Hopefully, we'll get towards the solutions. And we'll be right back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: That's it for us today. And today also marks the end of my summer stint in Margaret's chair. Thanks to all of you viewers out there for your trust and to the extraordinary FACE THE NATION team who make this show what it is. Margaret will be back from maternity leave soon, and I'll be back soon enough, just in a different chair. For FACE THE NATION, I'm John Dickerson.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Biden senior adviser Cedric Richmond that aired Sunday, January 31, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to New Orleans and former Congressman Cedric Richmond, who is now senior adviser to the president. Good morning to you. WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISOR CEDRIC RICHMOND: \u00a0Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on COVID. This new strain that was first detected in the U.K., B117, led that country to shut down its schools. This week Dr. Fauci said opening US schools may not happen due to mitigating circumstances. Is President Biden still vowing to open American schools by April? RICHMOND: Well, yes. And the key to it is making sure that we pass the American rescue plan so that we provide the school systems and local municipalities the ability to open schools safely. And we think that if we invest in the resources to make it safe, schools should reopen. MARGARET BRENNAN: But that likely wouldn't even happen until March at the earliest. Tell me about the plans right now, what you can do now. Should the federal government make it a priority to vaccinate teachers or instruct governors to push them towards the head of the line as essential workers? RICHMOND: Look, I think you see us doing everything humanly possible to make sure we ramp up vaccinations. We're delivering another 1.6 million to the states every week. So we bumped up to order. We just purchased another 200 million vaccinations so that we can vaccinate the whole 300 million adults that we need to do. And so we're going to keep pushing. We're going to keep sending vaccines to the states and asking the states to hurry up and make sure that they get them all out. But our plan and why we need to pass the American Rescue Plan is to make sure that we give the school systems the ability to buy the masks, the ventilation systems, all of those things that's needed to open up. MARGARET BRENNAN: But as you know, I mean, that fight is happening right now in cities like Chicago. We'll be talking to their superintendent later on in the program. And Michael Bloomberg, former presidential rival to- to President Biden, argued in an op-ed this week that the president could be doing more. He could use his bully pul- pulpit, excuse me, to give political cover to fellow Democrats. He could tell the unions, yes, I understand how we need to prioritize teachers here and actually take measures to do it. Why isn't the president doing more to help out some of these fellow Democrats? RICHMOND: I think the president is doing a lot. He just introduced a $1.9 trillion plan to make sure that it is a whole community approach to fighting,-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But they need help right now. They're opening schools Monday. RICHMOND: --of vaccinations. Well, that's an issue in Chicago that both sides are dealing with. I know they're both at the table. Teachers are concerned about their health and making sure that they could teach in a safe environment. And if you look at the CDC study, the CDC study that just came out said with the proper investments, with the proper spacing and class sizes, schools could reopen safely. But another key aspect of that CDC study is that they didn't test all the students and teachers. They just tested people who were symptomatic. And the class sizes in that population was in between 10 and 20 students in a class. So, look, we are very serious about making sure that we pass a plan that gives us a comprehensive approach to COVID, which means small business with help, help to our citizens. And so, look, we want kids back in school. No doubt about it. But we want it to be safe for the students, the teachers and the families of both students and teachers. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think everyone wants that safety. I want to ask you about the aid package you're referencing there. This morning, as you know, a group of about 10 Republican senators sent a letter to the president and they say they just want a meeting. They have a proposal that they say mirrors many of the same things the president wants, including money for vaccine and health supplies, targeted stimulus checks, slightly different from what the president's proposing, enhanced unemployment. Is the president open to these ideas? And will he meet with them? RICHMOND: Look the bi- the president said in his inauguration speech that he wanted to work with both sides in order to help the American people. And what we know about President Biden is it's never about him. It's always about the people. So, yes, he is very willing to meet with anyone to advance the agenda. But look, this is about seriousness of purpose. This is about meeting the moment. And this crisis is enormous, and our response to it meets that challenge. And so when you start talking about $1,400 to individuals, another $160 million so we can safely open schools, a couple of hundred million dollars to make sure that we help small businesses that are struggling, that's what the American people want to see. Seventy percent of the American people support President Biden's plan and another 71% of the American people want to see Republicans work with the president to meet the enormous challenges that we have. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the president willing to compromise then and perhaps strip out something like this $15 minimum wage demand that many Republicans object to? Could he make that a separate vote? RICHMOND: Look, we're not going to negotiate on TV, but what I will say about the minimum wage is the minimum wage has been expanded or increased during times of crisis before. It's been increased under Republican presidents and Democratic presidents. And it's a great way to lift people out of poverty. And if you think of all the front line workers that are out there risking their lives every day, who probably have not been vaccinated yet. So, you're talking about grocery store clerks and everyone else. They shouldn't have to work two jobs just to make a living wage and live above the poverty line. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you could make that a separate vote. RICHMOND: Look, the- other people want to argue process. We want to argue purpose in moving this country forward. And President Biden is very clear and he said it in his inaugural, we face deep challenges and we're going to meet the moment and we're not going to leave anybody behind. That's the whole purpose of building back better. We're not going-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. RICHMOND: --to leave people behind. And especially the people who are on the front lines risking their lives to keep this economy afloat and make sure people have the goods and services that they need. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your time in Congress. You yourself were hunkered down on January 6th inside the Capitol when you were a sitting congressman during that siege. Speaker Pelosi said this week that the enemy is within the House of Representatives. Do you believe that some of your former colleagues, sitting lawmakers, pose a security risk? RICHMOND: Look, I- I can tell you one thing, and this is my time as a congressperson, I believe that we're in a different state than we've ever been before, members who do not want to face reality, members that are encouraging conspiracy theories and things like that. But the real- the enemy that's within is the dysfunction of the Republican Party, unwilling to face facts, unwilling to put the people of America first. And look, I have all the faith in the leadership ability of Nancy Pelosi. She's a great Speaker. But the challenge is bringing people together right now. And that means Republicans ditching the division that has defined them for the last couple of years under the former president and coming to the table. All we're asking is those people that are out there busting their backs to keep food on their table and a roof over their head and clothes on their kid's back, come join us in helping them. And let's leave the conspiracy theories. Let's stop arguing about election fraud that we know never existed. And so that's the enemy within is the inability of people to acknowledge facts and come together to help the American people. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you very much, Congressman Richmond, for your time.",

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - CHRIS JOHNSON PRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, welcome back to Intelligence Matters again. I've actually lost count how many times you've been on the show, but somebody actually said to me, 'Maybe we should rename the show \"Intelligence Matters with Chris Johnson,\" anyway.' It is really good to have you back. CHRIS JOHNSON: Great. Glad to be back. I think this might be number five. But who's counting? MICHAEL MORELL: That means that means you have the record. So, Chris, as you and I talked about when we talked about doing this, I really want to dig in on the Biden administration's approach so far to China and how the Chinese are reading that and how they're responding so far - or how you think they're likely to respond. So that's what I want to do. And if that's OK with you, we will plow ahead. And maybe the place to start, Chris, is if you can describe what the Biden administration has said about and what they've said to China so far, as well as what it's actually done with regard to China. What have they actually done and said so far? CHRIS JOHNSON: Right. I mean, I think in terms of what they've said so far, it's important to remember, one, we're just coming up on one hundred days for the administration. So they haven't had a whole lot of time to say too much. Obviously, there's other things going on, dealing with the COVID challenges here and so on.  But I think they have been very direct and putting out a couple of pretty clear articulations so far. The first was President Biden's comment, of course, that we are preparing for what he called 'extreme competition' with China, which I think is meant to probably both underscore the reality of the situation, given China's increasingly clear signals that it sees it as such, as an extreme competition for global leadership, as well as probably a more political - or some might call it crass effort - to show that they'll be just as tough as the Trump administration was on China so as to avoid domestic criticism for for being soft. For example, I think the second most authoritative statement that we've had was from Secretary of State Blinken in his speech in early March, kind of on U.S. foreign policy writ large, where he seemed to break the relationship into three buckets: where he noted that it will be competitive when it should be, I  think he said collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must be. So I think that's kind of a good summation of how they're talking about the relationship in terms of what they've said to China. I think the message has been pretty clear in that kind of bleeds into your question about what they've actually done. So in that space, I think we have seen them send a very clear signal with the use of sanctions, statements and other measures to show its very strong support for human rights globally. And as that relates to China, that obviously involves the situation of the Uyghur Muslim minority in Xinjiang. Hong Kong, of course. They have reaffirmed our commitment to Taiwan in ways that I think some people have thought was surprising and somewhat consistent with the Trump administration's effort to strengthen that relationship. And I think they've sought to regain the trust, I think you could put it, of allies and partners for collective action against China. And at home, I think they promised to build U.S. strength, the kind of notion of build back better at home to help prepare for what President Biden called this extreme competition. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, looking at both the administration's rhetoric and its conversations with the Chinese and its actions, how would you characterize the approach so far? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah, I think somewhat like Secretary Blinken, three buckets. They have kind of a three pronged approach so far. The first, I think, is that they are thinking about how to respond to China's actions across this full spectrum of of great power competition. And I think that includes economic components, security, obviously, and what we might call an ideational component, i.e. this notion of competition of systems between the U.S. of China. The Chinese are doing a lot in those spaces. So I think it makes sense for them to kind of step back and try to think about how to respond there. They are studying, I think, the Trump era policies. We've seen, you know, a lot of indications that on various executive orders and so on that the Trump administration put in place, the administration has said, 'Well, we're reviewing those,' to see what of them, I think, they believe they should maintain and if they decide they will maintain them, perhaps how those policies might be tweaked so that they might be more coordinated and strategic. I think one of the very fair criticisms of the last administration was that the general message in terms of, 'We need to change how we're interacting with China' was right. But the execution was pretty haphazard. And then, as I mentioned earlier, I think they're obviously consulting with allies and partners on how to cooperate again as we prepare for this sort of extreme competition. I think the problem with that, though, is that these are sort of passive approaches. You know, thinking and studying and consulting are sort of passive words. And the problem is President Xi Jinping, President Biden's counterpart in China, isn't sitting idly by while the administration conducts that kind of thought process or or navel gazing. MICHAEL MORELL: So what's motivating the Biden team at this point, do you think? Is it trying to get the policy just right or is there domestic politics seeping in here? What's your sense? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah, I mean, I think a primary motivation, obviously, is the desire to show that the U.S. is back in the game after four years of Trumpian scorched earth. And that policy is both necessary and noble, I think. But I think they're learning that it's not so easy. Trump's hostility toward even the allies stung and raised questions about our credibility and reliability. And I think our disastrous handling of COVID, obviously, and racial justice, tensions and other issues make the allies and others, non-allies, even, in the world, suspicious of both sort of our commitment and bandwidth. I mean, you raise a good question with regard to the politics. I think that's a second area that is much less helpful thus far. It seems to me the administration is somewhat afraid of its own shadow in terms of fear of domestic criticism, of being too soft on China. And I think that's causing itself in some ways to box itself in at home in terms of taking positions early on that reduce their flexibility and also might be sending some confusing signals to China about the approach. So just as an example, I thought that Secretary Blinken's comments to the Congress ahead of the Anchorage meeting between the Chinese and the U.S., that this was not a strategic dialogue like existed in the in the Biden - excuse me, in the Obama administration - seemed almost too defensive. In other words, the fear of saying, 'Why are you going back to that old policy?' caused them to move in that direction. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, what would you like to see the Biden administration do with regard to putting together its strategy, its long term strategy toward China with the right approach here? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, I think by a strategy, we need a coordinated policy that recognizes that we must deal directly with China in a bilateral context as part of our effort to win this extreme competition. I think one of the challenges we're facing is that we have what we might call surrogate strategies, where we're looking to other policy approaches to try to avoid dealing directly with China.\u00a0 And so that includes, I think, this notion of domestic strengthening. In other words, if we put the money into our infrastructure, building semiconductor capacity in the U.S., making sure we're leading technologically through some version of industrial policy, that almost that in and of itself will cause the Chinese to just run away because they'll be scared of U.S. strength. Or likewise, this notion of consulting and working with the allies and partners.  But we're seeing already that that has limitations. Just this last week we had the New Zealand foreign minister say that New Zealand would be uncomfortable having the Five Eyes intelligence cooperative relationship expand to cover additional issues. That's clearly directed at China. I think we saw some very uncomfortable moments last week in the summit between - in the lead up, anyway - to the summit between President Biden and Prime Minister Suga of Japan, where clearly the U.S. wanted the Japanese to have a sort of much more throaty statement about Taiwan in the joint statement. There was some passing reference to it. It was the first time since the 60s that had happened, but it wasn't as strong as the administration wanted. And I think a strategy also starts with, ultimately, where do we want to be at some kind of endpoint, right? And then work backwards to fill in the actions to get us there. As good as Secretary Blinken's speech was, this idea of the kind of three buckets can wind up being more of a to do list approach rather than a strategy. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. Where do you think the limitations on our ability to work with the allies, where does that come from? Where do those kinds of statements that New Zealand made come from? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah, well, I think in New Zealand's case and with a lot of the other allies and partners, it's very clear, and that is, China's their largest trading partner. And so that obviously the economic challenges that they face there are important. I think in the case of, say, Japan, the message that I take from the joint statement is that, understandably so, Japan is more than willing to continue the close security cooperation we have between our two countries. They're particularly keen to have us, for example, restate our Article Five commitment to the defense of of Japan as it relates to the Senkaku Diaoyu Islands. But what they're not willing to do is engage in too much related to, say, the Xinjiang, certainly anything with regard to the Olympics. You know, we've seen a lot of back and forth about a potential boycott for the Beijing Winter Olympics. It's very clear to me that Europe, Japan, pretty much everybody else in the allies and partners community would not support that kind of an action. MICHAEL MORELL: And is there a is there a Trump legacy here, too? CHRIS JOHNSON: Oh, definitely. Yeah, no, without question. I mean, it turns out that four years of scorched earth hurts, as I've as I mentioned a moment ago, they were stung by that. And it's not cause for, you know, the new administration can't just come in and say, 'Hey, we're back, and, you know, it's all good.' Again, I think countries are reluctant to not sort of to dive right back in with us as if that period hadn't existed. MICHAEL MORELL: And I guess if you're if you're one of those countries, you have to say to yourself, 'OK, President Biden says the U.S. is back and maybe that lasts for four years. But what's to stop what happened in 2016 from happening in 2024? 2028?' And you don't make, right, if you're a country, you don't make national security policy in four year chunks. CHRIS JOHNSON: No. And in fact, that's a critical point. So another part of a proper strategy, I think, is exactly that. You need almost ridiculous policy consistency over multiple administrations. You know, the Chinese are talking about 2035. Well, that's several more elections for us. You're going to need to have that kind of consistency, I think, for the allies to really feel, 'OK, this is serious.' MICHAEL MORELL: I had dinner one night with three Chinese intelligence officers and they were talking about good and bad millennia - a good thousand years and a bad thousand years. And we're focused on, you know, we're focused on the next quarter or, politically, the next two years. CHRIS JOHNSON: Right, exactly. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, how are Chinese officials reading the Biden administration thus far? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah, I think probably they're still getting used to the new administration and trying to draw some conclusions. I think, you know, as you know, I've watched this for a very long time. And what we often see with the senior leadership in China is if they come up against something where they're not sure what the right choice is, or it's a really big issue that they're somewhat concerned about tackling, they tend to default to this sort of wait and see approach, right. That would be their sort of official rhetoric and want to see where we're going to go. That said, I would just highlight two areas where I think they're drawing some really unhelpful conclusions. I think the first one is that they believe that the administration is signaling that it will be every bit as tough as the Trump administration was toward China. And I think in their mind then that causes them to say, 'Well, we don't really need to change policy.' And I think it validates the Politburo's ideological conclusion that the inevitable conflagration, if you will, between capitalism and socialism has arrived. And this is the time and, I think, it also validates all of the tightening measures that President Xi has put in place domestically and also the kind of aura around unifying around him as the leader. And I think he's taking huge advantage of that. The second is that I think there might be a risk that they will negatively mirror image the issue of civilian control of the military in the U.S.. I mean, I think with the decision to not sort of firmly restate the the principle of civilian control of the military in the U.S. by having another general come in as Secretary of Defense, I think that's led the Chinese, where, in their system, you know, Mao's famous phrase, 'Power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' They worry that this just will further inflame the fact that their a perception that the U.S. civilian leadership is under the control of the military industrial complex that wants war. I'm concerned that could lead to some destabilizing strategic consequences. MICHAEL MORELL: And there's a great transition. If you could put the current Taiwan tensions into the context of what we've been discussing - How do you how do you think about those? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah, I think we have to separate probably the activity that we're seeing vis a vis Taiwan from the policy, if you will, or the the plans and intentions, I guess you could put it, of the Chinese leadership.  There's no doubt in my mind that we're seeing a lot more military activity around Taiwan. And it's very concerning. Just recently, we had the largest ever sort of sortie in terms of numbers of aircraft in and complexity operating in an exercise around Taiwan that we've ever seen. As you know, I think in the U.S. there seems to be a growing sense of concern that maybe the Chinese see now is the time for them to retake Taiwan, that indeed they really do believe in this narrative that they've been talking about recently about the east is rising and the west is declining. And now's the time. I think I would just inject a couple of points of caution. I think the first one is that while indeed those challenges are happening on the military side, you know, when China decides to do things toward Taiwan, it's never really about what's happening on Taiwan. It's really more about their perception of where we're going. And as I mentioned earlier, in terms of this fear that the administration is kind of continuing on with the Trump policies, our approach toward Taiwan so far has made them nervous that we're moving ever closer to this idea of maybe abandoning the One China policy. So, for example, there's a pretty significant debate, it seems, within the administration about changing our policy of strategic ambiguity. China would see that as very unhelpful and a move toward breaking with the One China policy. So I think that's the message behind what they're doing. I would just highlight as well that while, of course, retaking Taiwan or ensuring that Taiwan independence doesn't take place - that's really their fundamental goal =is certainly very important, And I fully believe they would go to war to prevent that. They also have this other very important goal, which is they must break through the middle income trap by 2035 in their calculation. And I struggle to see how invading Taiwan would help them with that. In other words, you would fundamentally ensure that all other countries, in the same way they did after the Tiananmen crackdown, would then have to turn against China. And I don't see how that helps them from an economic development point of view. And that goal of breaking through the middle income trap is just as important to them in terms of existential for their survival, I think, they think, as the Taiwan issue. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, I just want to stick on Taiwan for a second here. Are you saying that to some extent, the Chinese actions that we've seen are in response to the debates in the U.S. about how we should handle Taiwan going forward? CHRIS JOHNSON: Absolutely, yes. MICHAEL MORELL: And they're trying to do what in doing that? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, I think they're trying to show us that, you know, you're approaching the red line, which is the One China policy. This has always been the be all and end all. This is what allowed us to reestablish relations, right, in the Cold War period. And they see these kinds of salami slicing tactics of, you know, greater clarity with regard to how we interact - U.S. officials interact with Taiwan diplomats, you know, frequent commentary inviting the Taiwan de facto representative in the U.S. to the inauguration formally, you know, all these little bits and pieces as edging ever closer. And the strategic ambiguity one is really, really big. If we were to change that policy, it's my opinion that it would actually force the Chinese to feel they must do something rather than provide additional clarity about our position. MICHAEL MORELL: And what would that something be in your mind? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, I think it would certainly be very strong rhetoric. I think we could see some form of military intervention or action under those circumstances. I mean, it was exactly that fear about a break with the One China policy when the Taiwan president, Lee Teng-hui, was allowed to visit the United States in the mid-90s. That prompted them to do the series of military exercises at that time that they did. And obviously, they have a far more sophisticated and diverse toolkit of areas of pressure they can bring to bear on Taiwan now. So this is a very delicate issue, absolutely fundamental. MICHAEL MORELL: OK, Chris, let me let me run through kind of a handful of maybe what will seem to some as disjointed questions, but I want to ask them. So I've heard you talk about the fact that you think we're at a significant inflection point with China. What do you mean by that? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, I think a couple of things. One, I think we're rapidly approaching a period where China's growing strength and capabilities are getting to a point where it's unclear to me how effective we can be and try to manage those and deal with them. You know, I think some would argue we've already let them get too big globally. And this goes into the whole debate in the last administration about, 'Was it a mistake to let them into WTO' and, you know, 'How can we make the trade piece, you know, sort of more complimentary?' I think the other issue is that - and clearly in this area of technology and as Eric Schmidt pointed out on your recent podcast - the battle for these platforms of technology going forward, whether that's semiconductors, A.I., quantum computing, biopharma, that will just generate trillions and trillions of dollars in wealth, you know, the Chinese are making a decided effort to come up on us. I was quite struck by Mr. Schmidt's comments that he feels they could be where we are on A.I. in a handful of years, not even five. So for all those reasons, I see it as an inflection point. And let's face it, for four years under Trump and arguably even before then, we've just been kind of drifting around. And this is what I mean with regard to it's finally time to have a proper China strategy. If we don't, then we're going to miss the boat and we could find ourselves in a very nasty fight with the Chinese. MICHAEL MORELL: And is there in your mind, this is a tough question, but is there in your mind a strategy, an effective strategy? You know, if we were in the administration and we were sitting around the Sit Room and we spent hours and hours and hours debating where we should go with China, and we had all the intelligence laid on the table and smartest policymakers. Is there a strategy that you can envision the United States undertaking vis a vis China that would fundamentally change the direction of where we're headed? CHRIS JOHNSON: Well, I think that's a tall order, obviously. And I have tremendous sympathy for the folks in any administration who are working on this problem. It's tremendously difficult to grapple with. I would say that the one thing that I have not seen done that I think would be the starting point for that kind of a strategy, and then we develop the pieces afterward, is there needs to be a dedicated effort where we just step back, rack and stack what we perceive, you know, using the intelligence, as you suggested, and our best understanding of it: What are China's global ambitions? And once we have completed that exercise in as objective a manner as we can, we need to look at which one of those ambitions can we accept, because I think - or accommodate might be a better word, because we will have to accommodate some. And I think that was the mistake of the previous administration, was the notion that we just wouldn't be willing to accommodate any of China's global ambitions. And in my mind, that's a recipe for conflict. And which ones can we not? And then I think we need to communicate that to the Chinese at the most senior levels, probably privately is better, than, as the Chinese like to call it, microphone diplomacy, where, on those areas where we can feel we can accommodate them, we make that clear; on those areas where we can't, we tell them that as well. And then we set out a series of red lines related to those areas where we don't feel we can accommodate their ambitions and then we operationalize those red lines with action. And that also is something where I think we've often fallen down. We've said, OK, this is a red line for us and then we don't follow through' Scarborough Shoal and the Chinese seizure thereof in 2013 as a prime example of that. MICHAEL MORELL: So it's a great transition, because the next question I was going to ask you was about Beijing's ambitions in the world, their objectives in the world. So what are those? And then to your point, which do you think we need to be able to live with and which should we push back on? CHRIS JOHNSON. Yeah. I think there are first and foremost objectives, if you're the CCP and they're the ones running the show and Xi Jinping as they want to stay in power, and that's a domestic objective. But for them, their foreign policy works around that. I mean, I think something that's very interesting is that - in some ways this is an overstatement, but you'll get the point - China doesn't really have foreign policy per se. A lot of their foreign policy is just extensions of domestic policy, and I actually think we're at risk of mirroring that too much with some of the statements the administration has made. But so therefore, that's number one, obviously, for them. And that drives a lot of what they do. I think in terms of their foreign outlook, their goal is pretty straightforward, which is that they want other countries, first, in the region, primarily in the region, in East Asia, but increasingly globally to, in the same manner, with the same speed with which they would think about how the US might think about something they're about to do, they want them to think about what China might think about what they're about to do. That's really the goal.  And that involves having a sort of hegemonic position in Asia. I think that's definitely true, being the sort of main power there. And I think fundamentally, as Xi Jinping told us last week in a major speech, they want the US to treat them as a great power, as an equal, and they feel that time has come and is now and stop lecturing them and so on. MICHAEL MORELL: So on international influence. Is it primarily about another country's economic policies and a country choosing a set of economic policies that further Chinese economic interest? Is that the primary focus of what they want? CHRIS JOHNSON: That's a big part of it. I think another big part of it is the security relationships. Obviously, you know, when China sees things like the new Quad structure with ourselves and Japan, Australia and India developing, they see that as something akin to a containment net. So obviously, they want to be able to influence that. I mean, I think the economic pressure campaign against Australia is really interesting in this context. You know, most people, including myself, when we look at that, we say, \"Gosh, that seems so terribly counterproductive. Why is China doing that?\" But then we look at a situation where we had this summit of the leaders and there was an op ed prepared in The Washington Post and the C word, China, was not mentioned at all. And one wonders if you're sitting in Beijing and your thought is this economic pressure campaign on Australia has worked in that manner, i.e. preventing some of that collective action. It's worth the reputational negative points we're getting internationally to prevent that strategic element from developing. MICHAEL MORELL: One more question about the Australia situation, Chris. Is the objective in Beijing's approach to this to send a message to other countries? 'This is what happens to you if you side too closely with the Americans' - is that the message they're sending? CHRIS JOHNSON: I think that's part of it and I think we've seen that in other contexts as well. But I think it's to them perhaps strategically more important. I think what they're hoping for - and again, this is an area where maybe that dialectical materialist mindset of their doesn't serve them very well. In other words, if you believe in things like historical materialism and the power of material forces and you're China with that market and the growing economic strength you have, your view is, 'If we can get the Australians to crumble, you know, basically with a sustained pressure, think of the huge not only economic but also geostrategic waves of benefit that that would redound to us.' So I think it's it's arguably a little more malicious or malevolent, you might say, than something that simple. MICHAEL MORELL: And then how important is it to them to spread their way of doing things, right, their authoritarianism, their managed capitalism. How important is it to them to spread that around the world or is that a secondary interest to them? CHRIS JOHNSON: I think it's very important. I mean, I think we've seen increasingly there's this new meme, right,  that's come through in the propaganda and in leadership speeches and so on. And in the interaction, frankly, between Secretary Blinken and Jake Sullivan and his Chinese counterparts in Anchorage, which is, 'Hey, not everybody in the world subscribes to this so-called U.S.-led, rules-based international order, or that the rules of the road internationally should be devised and supervised by a handful of countries. You know, this is a clear message. Another one is this notion they have of the global situations witnessing changes unseen in a century. You know, that's sort of code for, 'It's time that the power equation geopolitically is changing.' I think what the main goal there is obviously to kind of make the world safe for the Chinese Communist Party. In other words, if you can normalize its behavior and, you know, grapple with the Americans in terms of global narrative competition, I mean, I think one of the uncomfortable parts for us - and I think this is a reason why the last administration, the Trump administration, reacted so strongly to this kind of notion of ideational competition - is that we haven't had a global narrative competitor for 30 years. Right. So it's made us a little bit lazy, maybe. And now we see it's back and we see it as a particularly menacing and threatening, but maybe it's less so. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, I think there's a a view out there which I want you to react to, that China's aggressiveness and maybe even its objectives are all Xi Jinping. Right? And I want you to kind of react to that. And is it just one guy here or is the entire leadership, you know, bought into the the global ambitions and the the way to pursue them? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah, I my sense is -and it's foolish to say that this is all about Xi Jinping. I think there's no doubt that in the same way that President Trump acted as an accelerant for certain trend lines in that were leading toward trouble, if you will, or a deterioration in the U.S.-China relationship, Xi Jinping has acted as an accelerant on the Chinese side. There is discussion and debate, as there always is in any system with, you know, it's important for us to remember sometimes, you know, they have 1.4  billion people. It's a complex and messy place. And so obviously there are different views, but I think it's very dangerous. And we had this longer telegrammed piece that was written, I believe, earlier this year, you know, sort of suggesting if we could just get rid of Xi Jinping, we'd have a more rational grouping. I can assure you that on policies like Hong Kong, on policies like Xinjiang, these have wide support, certainly within the leadership. And surprisingly, sometimes I think for we Americans amongst the the nationalist, increasingly nationalistic, Chinese populist. MICHAEL MORELL: So, Chris, this kind of raises the point about Xi's political standing at home, right. And the other thing you read is Xi's in trouble; there's strong opposition. What's your thinking on that? Again, I find it kind of silly. I can't see any - and I don't think you need, you know, clandestine intelligence to tell you this. The positive observable fact makes pretty clear to me, and I think really most other observers, that his control is undisputed. He's clearly the most powerful leader since Mao, I would argue. A lot of people say Deng; I think it's Mao, and he's probably going to cap that off again next year at the next party Congress. But there are a couple of issues to highlight. And the first is, yeah, he's large and in charge. There's no question he's got control of, in my mind, and this has been his political genius, if you will: He knows that to succeed in a system that he sees as operating by very Hobbesian rules, that you must control the key levers of power. And that's the party apparatus, the propaganda system and the military and security services. And he has that.  But the reality is next year, he's going to be trying to do something that no recent leader has done, which is to try to serve this third and maybe fourth and who knows how many terms. And that will generate some bargaining and some opposition, I think, within sight within the system. So that's important. I think probably the more likely things that will cause problems for him, though, are not inside baseball politics stuff. One is China has a huge demographic problem that was just highlighted recently, that I believe it's by 2035, the number of sort of child bearing women is going to decline dramatically. You know, they have all these negative aspects of the long standing One Child policy. So what does that mean for the size of their consumer market, for their ability to fuel this giant military they're, building, you know, et cetera?  And then also a very important one is this whole issue of how they're handling this crackdown in China's domestic finance sector. You know, we have a lot of concerns out there about bond defaults, about, you know, will the government continue as it always has to maintain that implicit guarantee of all this debt that's circulating around in China? You know, when Xi gave his speech at the last party Congress, when he renewed his tenure, kind of set out these three tough battles that they wanted to accomplish. One was poverty alleviation, another was improving the environment. And the third was this kind of crackdown on financial risk, poverty alleviation check. They declared victory on that late last year. Obviously, the environment is getting better all the time. But on this financial risk, they seem to keep running into problems. And that includes the challenges of recent with Alibaba and Tencent and their so-called platform economy and the unfairness there and so on. So there's a risk that Xi's political imperative to tighten, tighten, tighten on this financial risk thing could cause them to make some mistakes that would have huge conflagration consequences for them, economically. MICHAEL MORELL: And then, Chris, where we're running out of time and I want to ask you one more question, and it's probably the most unfair question I've asked you. Where do you think we're going to be with China in five to ten years? CHRIS JOHNSON: Yeah, increasingly, my gut is not a good place. You know, I think we I've always been pretty optimistic. I think that there's a there's a baseline there. But in all aspects, it was interesting in talking to Chinese friends recently, you know, there's a real fear. And I think obviously some of that's drummed up by the propaganda of the party, you know, and so on. But, you know, there's real fear about safety. If you're a Chinese person coming here now with these sort of anti-Asian attacks that we've been having in the U.S. - and I think that has implications for not only the people, the people connective tissue that has sustained us through rough patches in the past - but also for the enthusiasm of young and very bright Chinese students who want to come to the U.S. and study here and often stayed and helped us build these great tech and other companies that we have. I think this issue of, you know, again, what Eric Schmidt said in your podcast, you know, it does look increasingly like we're moving toward a bifurcated Internet system where there are two camps. And I think that too, you know, just puts us in a very, very difficult situation. And I don't see the sort of rhetoric between the two sides getting better anytime soon. And I think, you know, it's it's very clear to me that to some degree, Xi Jinping and his leadership style has been part of the problem and I think our dysfunction has been as big a part of the problem. MICHAEL MORELL: Chris, thank you. Thank you so much for joining us again. Your your insights are always absolutely fascinating, and I know my listeners look forward to having you on. In fact, some people send a note saying, 'When is Chris coming back on?' CHRIS JOHNSON: It's always my pleasure.",

And this week on FACE THE NATION, police reformers press their case, has their mission found its moment? After almost a year of unprecedented protests, Derek Chauvin's conviction for the murder of George Floyd brought a sigh of relief and renewed purpose. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We can and we must do more to reduce the likelihood that a tragedy like this will ever happen or occur again. And this takes acknowledging and confronting head on systemic racism, and the racism disparities that exist in policing and in our criminal justice system more broadly. JOHN DICKERSON: Yet, even as President Biden spoke, a new tragedy and new protests. WOMAN: Say his name. JOHN DICKERSON: This time in Columbus, Ohio, after a police officer shot and killed sixteen-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant, who was armed with a knife during a fight with another teenager. MICHAEL WOODS: Regardless of the circumstances associated with this, a sixteen-year-old girl lost her life yesterday. I sure as hell wish it wouldn't have happened. JOHN DICKERSON: We'll get the latest on that case and more from Ohio Governor Mike DeWine. Plus, the House passed a sweeping police reform bill last month. Can supporters push it through the Senate? We'll ask a leading proponent, Florida congresswoman and former police Orlando police chief Val Demings. Troy Finner is the current chief of police in Houston. We'll hear from him as well. And we'll talk with the president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Sherrilyn Ifill. Then, a key COVID vaccine is back in circulation, with a warning about rare blood clots after a safety review. As cases decline but the number of vaccinations does, too, we'll check in with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We are at the point now where the supply of COVID-19 vaccines may soon outpace demand, in part, because some are hesitant to get vaccinated. And we have some new findings from a CBS poll on that issue. But we want to begin this morning on the topic of police reform. CBS News senior national correspondent Mark Strassmann is in Atlanta with this report. (Begin VT) MAN #1: Tell me what you need, what you really need. CROWD (in unison): Justice. MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): Again this weekend intertwined demands for racial justice-- MAN #2: Hands up. CROWD (in unison): Don't shoot. MARK STRASSMANN: --and police reform. An American movement sparked by an American moment. George Floyd dying face down on a Minneapolis street. NEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG (Civil Rights Attorney): There has been a systemic problem that has persisted for a long time, that has covered up murders at the hands of police in the Twin Cities and across the nation. MARK STRASSMANN: Catharsis this week. Former officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering Floyd. MAN #3: Justice, for the moment, was served. We have a long way to go. MARK STRASSMANN: But communities of color everywhere say they're tired of the knee on their neck. And week after week, outraged by police killing more people of color. Like sixteen-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant in Columbus, Ohio. MAN #4: No justice. CROWD (in unison): No peace. MARK STRASSMANN: Thirteen-year-old Adam Toledo in Chicago. LASHAWN LITTRICE: We are not playing games. Charge the officer now. MARK STRASSMANN: Daunte Wright, shot by a cop in a Minneapolis suburb. And Andrew Brown, Jr. in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. Deputies serving Brown a warrant last Wednesday shot him in the back. After protests every day since city officials announced Saturday they've started the process to release the body camera footage. BETTIE PARKER: Elizabeth City is a microcosm now of what is going on across the nation. MARK STRASSMANN: Since George Floyd's death, more than thirty states have passed new police oversight and reform laws. Those reforms will curb the use of police force, impose civilian oversight, and expose bad cops. WOMAN #1: Will use our voices. MARK STRASSMANN: But there's also backlash in red state America, fueled by episodic violence during protests over the last year, and a sense, the left has lost it. A handful of states have passed new laws intended to curb street protests. GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS (R-Florida): This bill actually prevents against local governments defunding law enforcement. MARK STRASSMANN: Governor Ron DeSantis called Florida's new law anti-riot. WOMAN #2: What do we want? CROWD (in unison): Justice. WOMAN #2: When do we want it? CROWD (in unison): Now. MARK STRASSMANN: But to critics, that reactions prove any progress feels precarious, and that Black Lives Matter remains a call for action instead of an American reality. DAVID BROWN (Chicago Police Superintendent): If we're going to change our culture, it's going to be because the community demands it. (End VT) JOHN DICKERSON: Mark Strassmann reporting in Atlanta. We go now to Governor Mike DeWine of Ohio. Good morning, Governor. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE (R-Ohio/@GovMikeDeWine): Morning, John. JOHN DICKERSON: Governor, you said after the verdict this week that, \"George Floyd's death laid bare some of our deepest divisions in our country. There is a lot for us to learn from this great tragedy.\" What is there for us to learn? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: John, I think there's a clear pathway in regard to police reform. I think there are things that we all can come together on, Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative. We have a bill in front of the state legislature that we presented, for example, that calls for a lot more police training, more uniform police training. We have nine hundred and some police departments in Ohio. Many states have a lot of small departments. Many times because of resources, they don't get the training that they need. Body cameras. You know, the tragedy of a sixteen-year-old child who was killed in Columbus. Mayor Ginther made the absolute correct decision. Within six hours they had that out to the news media. But not every police department in this country has body cameras because of-- of the cost. So, you know, we presented a bill to the legislature that would provide funding for body cameras for police departments. Another pathway clearly is there, and that is to treat police as professionals. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: What do I mean by that? Well, you know, we-- we have the state licensing boards for doctors, for lawyers, for nurses. We should do the same thing for police so that when there is a complaint against a police officer, a state licensing board can deal with that. These are common sense things that we can do, should not be controversial. We can all get behind. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get to some of those reforms in a minute. You mentioned the Ma'Khia Bryant case. You-- you support the release of the video. When you were attorney general, you called for an outside prosecutor in these kinds of instances. Should there be one in this case? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: Well, they already have an outside investigator, BCI, and-- and I think in most cases this is-- this is certainly called for. Somebody come in-- investigating-- JOHN DICKERSON: Should it be automatic in these cases, Governor? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: --in the front-- I'm sorry? JOHN DICKERSON: Should it be automatic in these cases, Governor? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: Yeah. I think it should be automatic, automatic outside, someone come in to do the investigation. You also have, you know, the prosecution. The prosecution itself. And it's not that the local prosecutor can't do it or the local police can't investigate themselves, particularly with the police investigating themselves. You know, there is the appearance. There's always the appearance that, you know, that was not a fair investigation. So I think getting rid of that feeling, getting rid of that appearance, making sure it's an outside agency that is doing the investigation. BCI in Ohio does a great, great job. They are the ones that are involved. It's a state agency. They're the ones that the mayor has asked to come in and do the investigation in Columbus. JOHN DICKERSON: You've talked about training. And I want to talk about the Ma'Khia Bryant case. There's been a lot of people looking at it because the video is out there, a lot of people making judgments. What a lot of people in the Black community see is they see a situation in which white assailants, young white men who've sometimes have just come from committing mayhem, are taken into custody. But when it's a young Black man or woman, there-- they are-- there's a shooting, there's a-- a use of force, and they see a wide disparity there. In terms of the discretion used by officers, do you understand that feeling? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: Well, I certainly understand the feeling. I also understand the feeling of the police officer. I-- I've not been a police officer, but I was a county prosecuting attorney. Look, they've got a tough job. You know, they have to make split-second decisions. And in this particular case, for example, you know, you're watching the same thing I'm watching, you know the same thing I'm-- I'm seeing. But that's what the police officer saw. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: So that's why one reason, frankly, to have the video cameras and get that out to the public so that everybody can-- you know, can take a look at that. JOHN DICKERSON: But-- GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: But, yes, I understand how they feel. It's one of the reasons why, you know, teaching them implicit bias, you know, more police training, how you defuse a situation, how you deal with someone, for example, who has a mental health problem, how you deal with someone who is autistic, all of these things, you know, we know how to do now. JOHN DICKERSON: So-- GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: It's just getting that training out to every police-- every police officer in the country. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about that question of implicit bias because what you see in the figures is that you're twice as likely, if you're Black, to get shot in one of these instances. And then also in Columbus, there was a study that showed even though Black residents are twenty-eight percent of the city, they're involved in half of the use of force cases. So it's not just a feeling. The numbers back it up. And I wonder if you can be very specific in this training about basically the implicit views of race that get embedded one way or another into police that cause these kinds of outcomes? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: Sure. This is-- this is state of the art training today, John. This is what professionals want, and, you know, I've never met a police officer yet who didn't want more training. This is part of that-- that kind of training. Absolutely. This is something that, you know, I did when I was attorney general. It's something that we want to spread out with more police training, continuous police training every single year, even the smallest department. That's what we should have. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about qualified immunity, a piece of jargon we hear about a lot. Some people say it shields police officers who-- who do wrongdoing. Others say it allows them to make a good faith effort in these split-second moments. It's being taken care of in states, New Mexico, Colorado. Will Ohio do anything to change qualified immunity? Do you think? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: Yes, John. John, we have not really had a discussion about it. I'm sure we will. I'll take a look at that. But I've really not looked at that to see what impact that does have. JOHN DICKERSON: And you don't have a view one way or the other whether it should or shouldn't? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: No. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me-- GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: I really don't. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you a quick COVID-19 question. There's a lot of vaccine hesitancy out there. A, how worried are you about that? And B, as a Republican, one of the things we found in our polling is that forty-six percent, excuse me, forty-nine percent of Republicans either aren't going to get it at all or are very hesitant. So how worried are you and what would you say to fellow Republicans? GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: Well, I'm worried, John. We've seen our vaccination rate go down about half of what it was three weeks ago, so that's a concern. But we've vaccinated about forty percent of, at least for the first shot, forty percent of our total population. We just need to continue to-- to move forward. If you look at those sixty-five and over, we're over seventy-- seventy-three, seventy-four percent. So we're doing pretty well. But we have to continue to go forward. The game is not over yet. So I'm-- I'm concerned about it. JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: You know, one of the things that we're doing is now we're reaching out to businesses and providing for vaccinations directly in businesses. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: We're doing the same thing in our colleges. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Governor, we're going-- GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: We're doing the same thing in our high school. We've got to be more aggressive. JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Governor. Thank you. GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE: And we're doing it. JOHN DICKERSON: Thank you so much. Sorry, I've got to be aggressive and move on. Thank you, Governor. We appreciate it. We go now to Congresswoman Val Demings of Florida, who is also the former police chief of Orlando. Good morning, Congresswoman. REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS (D-Florida/@RepValDemings): Good morning, John. Good to be with you. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, thank you so much for being here. George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, it has passed the House. The President wants it to move in the Senate. I read in the papers that there is progress. Is there any progress? REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: Well, I do believe that every day gives us an opportunity for progress, John, and, also, I am hopeful that the Senate will meet this moment. We know that informal discussions are going on. I think we're closer than a lot of people realize. I know one of the sticking points centers around qualified immunity, but I do believe that we can do just about anything that we have the political will to do. And I do believe that we can meet this moment. JOHN DICKERSON: You mentioned qualified immunity, it's an expression-- it's a word we hear-- or two words we hear a lot. Senator Scott, who's been running this issue for Republicans, says that he's trying to float a new idea on qualified immunity. And the idea would be that in civil suits, you wouldn't go after the individual police officers, but that the department would be on the hook for an incident. Do you think there's any chance that that might get some agreement among Democrats? REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: Well, you know, as I said, John, I think we're closer than a lot of people realize. One thing that we all need to remember is that everybody counts, but everybody's accountable. And we do have to look at the inappropriate behavior of some officers, how egregious it is, how inhumane it is. And I do think there are opportunities to sue those individuals-- individuals on a personal level. The department is always, or can always be held accountable. I am hoping that Senator Scott will lead his delegation, if you will, or the Republican members in the Senate to sit down at the table, finish the negotiations and let's get this done. George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is not perfect, but it is a major step in the right direction. Let's get this done. We need it. The American people need it. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about the-- the George Floyd Policing Act and this awful incident, Ma'Khia Bryant in-- in Ohio. So under-- as I understand it, under the legislation, federal officials, police officers, they would be restrained from using excessive force unless a third party was in danger and unless they couldn't deescalate. Those seems to be the facts of the case in the Bryant case, which means that under the standards set in the-- in the Floyd Policing Act, the officer in that case seems to have acted as they were trained and supposed to. REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: Well, you know, John, when I served as a police chief, what I prayed for daily was that my police officers would respond as they are trained to do. Now, after every incident we would have to go back and look at our policies and make sure that the policies met the moment. But, look, I worked as a social worker with foster care children. So it's a-- it's a sad moment for me. But I also was a patrol officer who was out there on the street having to make those split-second decisions. You know, now everybody has the benefit of slowing the video down and-- and seizing the perfect moment. The officer on the street does not have that ability. He or she has to make those split-second decisions and they're tough. But the limited information that I know in viewing the video, it appears that the officer responded as he was trained to do with the main thought of preventing a tragedy and-- and a loss of life of the person who was about to be assaulted. JOHN DICKERSON: You mentioned your experience. It's always nice in politics to have people who've done something that's being talked about on Capitol Hill. Do you have any advice for your colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, about how to think this through, given the fact that you have experience as a police officer? REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: Well, I think it-- it does help to talk to those members of Congress on both sides of the aisle who have actually been out there doing the job. But my main advice, John, would be let's don't make this a political issue. You-- when we look historically throughout our history, even though there's always been two strong political parties, they've always seem in most instances to be able to lay down their political difference and rise to meet that significant moment. This is such a time. And, so, I am hoping that we will put politics aside and come together because we need to get this done. Our communities around the nation need it. Our good police officers need it, and, quite frankly, the American people need it. We in Congress in both chambers can meet this moment as well if we have the political will to do so. JOHN DICKERSON: While I'm asking you about advice, Congresswoman. What would you say to your former colleagues, to police officers who feel like they're-- they're being-- they are getting scrutinized more than they deserve, that they are being all thrown into one barrel? How would you talk to them about the efforts to achieve accountability, given what you know about the work they do? REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: Well, John and I have talked to some of them. And what I remind them of is that they-- they wear the badge, and I used to do this as a chief, over their heart because they have to have the heart for the job. We want them to have the mind for the job so that they will make good decisions. But we want them to have the heart for the job as well. And I-- I also remind them, remember, you are well trained. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm. REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: Utilize the training that you have, but also remember that it's human beings that you're dealing with and always have compassion for the community in which you represent. And, you know, the overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers in this nation are good people who go to work every day to protect those, protect and serve our communities. I remind them of that. Always stand on the right side, speak up-- JOHN DICKERSON: All right. REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS: --and be professional and do the job that you're paid to do. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Congresswoman Demings, thank you so much for being with us. FACE THE NATION will be right back with some new poll finding-- new poll findings. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We turn now to our CBS elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto, who has some new findings in advance of President Biden's one-hundred-day mark and address to a joint session of Congress. He joins us from Westchester County, New York. Good morning, Anthony. ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Good morning, John. Good to talk to you. JOHN DICKERSON: It's good to be back with you. Let's-- before we get to President Biden, you asked some questions in the wake of the Derek Chauvin verdict. What did you find? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. Big majorities, John, seventy-five percent feel that the jury in the case reached the right verdict, based on what they, themselves heard. Now, I should point out that is true for big majorities of both white and black Americans, and look at that bipartisanship, like so many things today we find a little bit of difference. There are majorities, big ones of DEMs, of independents, who think it was the right verdict, the majority of Republicans, too, though a sizable portion of Republicans feeling like it was the wrong one. But, again, on balance, big majorities feeling like the jury reached the right verdict, John. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Let's pivot now and talk about the presidency and the President. Anthony, a hundred days is coming up, the President is going to speak to Congress. Where does President Biden's approval rating stand at this moment? ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, he is at fifty-eight percent. Now for context, you know, we go back twenty years, and that's about where George W. Bush was in his first hundred days. It's lower than where President Obama was during the economic crisis as he took over. And it's higher than where Donald Trump was. You know, for context, you want to really note that back ten, twenty years ago, there was actually a little more partisan crossover, at least initially for presidents, where partisans from the opposing party would give them a little bit of breathing room. A little bit better ratings at least initially. But that really started to change during the Obama administration, and Donald Trump almost never got any Democratic support. And that's where we find Joe Biden right now, where this is build primarily on getting a lot of Democrats and also independents, John. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. We used to have actual honeymoons, but the presidency now people basically approve or disapprove based on what team jersey the president wears. Having said that fifty-eight percent, not a bad number because of those independents that you mentioned. So why is President Biden getting relatively good approval ratings and-- and good approval ratings from independents, Anthony? ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, John, a big part of this is two-thirds of Americans think that Joe Biden is doing a good job handling the coronavirus outbreak. And even, more specifically, a lot of people feel like he's doing a good job on vaccine distribution. This is really important because his administration had set out success for that as a marker in the first one hundred days, and he's meeting it. It's kind of classic transactional politics. Set out a goal people feel like you've achieved it. On the personal front, majorities describe Joe Biden right now as presidential, as competent, as focused, all things people want from a leader in a crisis. This is something that's in your wheel-house as you've written about. These are all things that are also accruing to those overall approval numbers, John. JOHN DICKERSON: So, Anthony, that's how he's doing on the promises he made in the campaign. What about the ground he wants to plow going forward? What does the immediate future look like? ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yeah. Well, one of those promises, John, was to be bipartisan. Now, people do think on balance he's trying to work with congressional Republicans. But, of course, there are some hurdles there. One is that the rank and file Republicans in the country still will not say that Joe Biden is the legitimate winner of the 2020 election. That puts pressure, of course, on the Republican delegation there. And though on policy matters he's got some poplar policies. Notably as he heads into this speech, talking about infrastructure. In principle, when you ask people if we should spend more on things like roads and bridges, you get big majority support. On the politics side you attach Joe Biden's name to it, his infrastructure plan and he still gets majority support, fifty-eight percent right now. So, if you do popular things, your numbers can at least be decent. And that's where he is, heading into the speech this week, John. JOHN DICKERSON: Popular and principle. We'll see if the politics get in the way. Thanks so much, Anthony. And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: A quick programming note, on Wednesday, CBS News will carry President Biden's first address to Congress, followed by the Republican response. Coverage begins at 9:00 PM Eastern on your CBS station. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We'll be right back with Houston Police Chief Troy Finner, President and Director-Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Sherrilyn Ifill, and former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to continue our conversation on policing in America with Troy Finner, Houston's chief of police. Good morning. TROY FINNER (Houston Police Chief/@TroyFinner): Good morning, John. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to get your first sense, what was the reaction within the force about the verdict in the Derek Chauvin case? TROY FINNER: Well, John, let me just say this, it is a message to everyone that no one is above the law. If you raise your hand and you take an oath of office to protect and serve and uphold constitutional rights and you do what he did, it's a message that no one is above the law. And it's a message to everybody in our nation, including our citizens, that, you know what, everyone is going to be held accountable. So I-- I think that the-- the jury spoke. The judge spoke. And we need to move forward, but we also need to have deep, honest communications. JOHN DICKERSON: Minneapolis-- the precinct commander in Minneapolis, Charles Adams, told-- said this to The New York Times, he said, \"So much is being thrown at us as law enforcement officials. We're unsure how we're going to police in the future.\" I hear anxiety in that answer. Do you-- do you feel or get a sense of anxiety in your force? TROY FINNER: No, John. I do have concerns with-- with our troops on the front line, but you have to remind them, what did they sign up for? They signed up to protect and-- and serve. And you also have to remind them that the majority of citizens in Houston and around the nation respect and honor police officers. You have to remind them, look, don't get caught up in the negative noise. Understand what's going on. Understand that people of color, communities of color, are hurting. We have to be honest with them. We have to give value to their perceptions, to their life experiences, because their perception is their reality. Our perception is our reality. And it's not until you slow down and give value to that, start to communicate and talk about those tough things. And when you do that, you-- you build bridges. And-- and that's what we need to be doing in our nation. Get away from the negative and understand there is a problem and we have to address it and we're going to address it together as-- as a nation. JOHN DICKERSON: So what are you doing in your force to try to address those problems, to build those bridges, have those conversations? TROY FINNER: Well, I've-- I've been in my community for thirty-one years as a police officer, so I have deep-rooted respected relationships, so reaching out to everybody and non-traditional people. We got to reach out to former gang members. We got to reach out to hip-hop. Everybody needs to be in a fight. But what-- what do-- what do we do in-- in-- in terms of training and-- and-- and making sure that we are deescalating every chance that we can. Make sure that-- that the officers are slowing down. A lot of the officer-involved shooting scenes, you find out one thing, sometimes the officers rush in, okay? Slow them down, gang cover when you can. But also take a critical look at everything that led up to the shooting incident. Did we slow down? Did we do everything we could because-- and you got to put it into the officer's heart and in their minds, sanctity of life is the most important thing. And it's important for everybody to go home, not only our police officers, but our general public. So you-- you just got to drill that in every day and-- and people ask about training. Training is just not something that you do once a year. Training is every day. It-- it has to be psychological. We talk about touching the hearts and minds of citizens every day. What about our police officers? And then you have to reassure them, look, we got eight hundred thousand police officers, eighteen thousand police agencies in our nation. The majority of them do great work. JOHN DICKERSON: Do you ever worry, Chief, that-- you know, one of the-- one of the ways that we get change, one of the way-- ways there is reform is when there is a lot of public talk and-- and a lot of demonstration. That is necessary in the American story. On the other hand, what I wonder from you is if all of this talk about reform and the-- and the police officers who've done bad things changes the level of trust that is absolutely required for public safety and for what the members of your force have to do. TROY FINNER: If-- if you allow it to. It's a two-way street in this, you know, and let's-- let's be honest, I'm a-- a-- a man that speaks the truth. I'm-- I'm to the point. There are problems, okay? Too many unarmed African-American or males of color, young males are being shot in our nation. So we have to address that. But at the same time, let's talk about all the good work. And-- and when I go out to the community, because I'm from this community and-- and I can only speak in terms of Houston. People ask me, you know what, Chief, why we don't have more Black or why we don't have more Latino officers in this area? You know what, but I never want to discount the Caucasian officers who've been in our communities, the African-American and Latino communities, for twenty-five, thirty-five years, you know, and retired, never shot anyone, never had a complaint. So we have to speak the honest truth. But remember what I said, we also have to give value to a group of people when they're hurting, when they have lost a loved one, you know, in-- in-- in a police officer-involved shooting, that probably wasn't justified. So we have to just come together and really communicate. JOHN DICKERSON: What do you think, Chief-- and-- and I know you've paid attention to the Ma'Khia Bryant case in-- in Columbus in Ohio. They released the footage very quickly. Is that something you think is a good idea? TROY FINNER: You have to release that footage. Mayor Turner is getting ready to announce some of the reform that's coming because of the result of his task force on-- on policing. We're going to have a press conference next-- next week. And I don't want to get ahead of him, but you're going to see departments around the nation--it is a thing of transparency. You can't just talk transparency and not be transparent. The public needs to know. And the quicker you put those body-worn camera footage out the better off everybody is going to be. JOHN DICKERSON: And finally, just twenty seconds, Chief, what would you advise Americans watching this footage? Because we're going to see more of it, how they should process it? On any-- not just in the-- TROY FINNER: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: --in Ma'Khia Bryant case, but any case. TROY FINNER: Yeah. Look at every case on its own individual merit. Look at it. Don't paint a brush or put-- JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. TROY FINNER: --all police officers in one pot. Just as the same that officers shouldn't put a par-- particular community in one pot. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. TROY FINNER: Because when we do that, guess who wins? The criminals and-- and-- and the bad police officers. We need to have a laser focus-- JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. TROY FINNER: --on those officers who are violating people rights and also the suspects who are out there that's doing wrong. JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. TROY FINNER: So let's come together, let's have those difficult conversations-- JOHN DICKERSON: All right. TROY FINNER: --and let's love one another and our nation. JOHN DICKERSON: Chief, thank you so much for being with us-- with us. We appreciate it. We go now to the president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Sherrilyn Ifill. She joins us from Baltimore. Good morning. SHERRILYN IFILL (President and Director-Counsel of NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund/@Sifill_LDF): Good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: Sherrilyn, there is a long history that-- of protest and reform and struggle that has been in American life since the '60s, but something changed with George Floyd's murder. And I wonder, with the-- the conviction this week, what you think changed and what you think did not change? SHERRILYN IFILL: Well, I think what has changed since George Floyd was killed last summer is that people who have been in this fight for a long time and let's be clear, many have been in this fight for decades. The issue of police violence against unarmed African-Americans is an issue of the twentieth century. We can go all the way back to the beginning of the twentieth century and find these incidents and find this unrest as Black communities have resisted this. It was a signature issue of the unrest in cities across the country during the 1960s. And we emerged from that decade with three core civil rights statutes, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. But we emerged with nothing on the issue of policing and racism in policing. So I think where we are now, John, is that people are fed up and that's a good thing because it's time for a fundamental change. If you can recall, we've been in these conversations for the last seven years since Mike Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri. And there's been some tinkering around the edges. There's been some movement. The most powerful movement has been that the conversation has shifted away from talking about tinkering around the edges and modest reforms to radical changes and a radical envisioning of what public safety needs to become in this country. JOHN DICKERSON: Where should we put our focus when we-- what's an example of what you're talking about? In other words, not tinkering, but-- but real reform? SHERRILYN IFILL: Well, you look at places like the city of Berkeley that has decided that armed officers will no longer be involved in traffic stops or mental health calls. Or the experiment happening in Ithaca, where the entire police department is being set down for a new community solution and public safety core. It will include some armed law enforcement officers, but it's focusing on the root causes of crime. It's shifting resources to mental health, to homelessness services, to youth services. And then it's focusing on what is it that you actually need armed police officers to do to deal with the most violent of circumstances. But the truth is it's a re-envisioning of what public safety needs to be. Do we need an-- officers of an armed constabulary to come out to address the possibility that someone is passing a bad twenty-dollar check? Do we need armed officers to come out and address a homeless person who won't leave your front stoop? We have to actually get into thinking about what public safety is supposed to mean and not assuming that we have to continue the current structures. But being bold. What we've been doing, John, is something akin to \"all deliberate speed.\" You'll remember the admonition of the Supreme Court in the second Brown case, which actually slowed down desegregation. We've been moving at a snail's pace. And I think even for myself, I've been involved in this work for quite some time. There's-- there's just a fundamental shift and we realize that reform around the edges is not going to do it. We're looking at Elizabeth City today. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. SHERRILYN IFILL: We're looking at Spotsylvania County, where there have been additional killings. We need the killings to stop. And that means we're going to have to have fundamental change. JOHN DICKERSON: I wonder if you think there's also common cause that can be made with a lot of police officers who express this sentiment when I talk to them. They say, you know, we're in a system where these communities we work in have been failed by education, by the jobs system. There are guns everywhere. And we're being asked to be the-- go in there and-- and sort of face all of these problems on our backs. And that requires a broader lens to. Would you agree? SHERRILYN IFILL: I agree. I'm so glad you said that, John, because this is the place-- when people talk about making common cause with existing police officers, it's not about having a pancake breakfast or playing basketball. It's about some real, honest talk. Police officers need to begin to be honest about the fact that open carry laws and concealed carry laws actually make them nervous. It endangers them. They don't like people having guns on the street and having concealed carry and walking around with weapons. It makes them nervous. But you don't hear police or-- organizations or law enforcement or-- organizations telling the truth, the things that they will set-- say behind closed doors about how they feel about these gun laws. It is also true that rather than actually solve the problems of our community, problems of education, problems of poverty, prob-- problems of homelessness, we have shifted all of the resources to deal with those problems into our criminal justice system. JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. SHERRILYN IFILL: And we've used the criminal justice system as a holding pen for resolving the-- the core problems that any healthy democracy has to solve. And that's-- JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. SHERRILYN IFILL: --the conversation we need to be having now. We are now in a moment where we should be able to look squarely in the face, the issues that have to be addressed, that relate to our young people, that relate to jobs, that relate to homelessness, that relate to the mental health crisis happening across the country, and that COVID will only exacerbate. We need to be putting our resources and attention to those problems and not shunting them off to the criminal justice system and asking police officers, armed officers to address issues that we have been too cowardly to address as a democracy. JOHN DICKERSON: As-- we're running out of time here, I wanted to ask you about the Justice Department decision this week to open a pattern and practice investigation into Minneapolis. How do you think things will be different under the Biden administration in-- in dealing with these issues? SHERRILYN IFILL: Well, I don't-- I think it'll be night and day from Bill Barr, for sure, and I think, you know, Judge Garland, Attorney General Garland, that's an opening salvo. Barr was asked last summer whether he would open a pattern and practice investigation into Minneapolis, and he blankly said no. So it was important for Judge Garland to say that today. I don't think this will be the only one. I think this will be the first-- JOHN DICKERSON: Mm-Hm. SHERRILYN IFILL: --of many. And one of the things that needs to happen is the re-upping of those investigations into unconstitutional policing and bringing resources-- JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Sherrilyn-- SHERRILYN IFILL: --to bear to show that we are serious about it. So we were very encouraged. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Sherrilyn Ifill, thanks so much for being with-- with us. And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We go now to former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb. He sits on the board of Pfizer as well as Illumina, and he joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you. SCOTT GOTTLIEB, M.D. (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning. JOHN DICKERSON: Doctor Gottlieb, the CDC director this week said that there was a drop in cases that suggested a hopeful trend. Do you share that hope? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I think we are seeing a hopeful trend across the country. Cases are clearly declining. The positivity rate is about 3.3 percent right now. Hospitalizations are falling as well, which is a good indication. And even in hard-hit areas like Michigan, which had late epidemics, late surges, you're seeing cases start to come down. I think whereas the past trends when we saw cases start to decline, we were somewhat skeptical because we knew a lot of those declines were a result of behavioral changes, people pulling back more, taking more precautions. And then as soon as we sort of let our guard down, we saw cases surge again. Right now, the declines that we're seeing, we can take to the bank. I think we could feel more assured because they're being driven by vaccinations and greater levels of population-wide immunity, not just from vaccination, but also from prior infection. There's been a lot of Americans who've had this infection and have a level of immunity from their prior disease. JOHN DICKERSON: So when we hear numbers-- what you're suggesting is kind of a mindset change in the way we process these numbers when they come in. What other ways should we be thinking in the vaccine world when we still heal-- hear numbers of the kind we'd heard for the last year? How should our mindset change in the way we process these numbers? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think we need to think about the overall vulnerability of the population and not just the cases that we're accruing on a daily basis. The vulnerability of the population has been reduced substantially because of vaccination. A lot of older Americans and people who are most vulnerable to COVID, who are most likely to be hospitalized or succumb to the disease, have now been protected through vaccination and are going to be far less likely to have a bad outcome. So ten thousand cases right now is a lot different than ten thousand cases a year ago when the most vulnerable Americans had no protection from this disease. We might not get below a point this summer when we have much below ten thousand cases a day. If we sustain the current levels of testing, there's going to be outbreaks in summer camps. There's going to be sporadic infections. We'll have one to two hundred infections a day in most states, most large states in the country. But we need to look at those cases differently. They're going to probably represent much less disease, much less death, because most of-- most of the most vulnerable Americans will have been protected through vaccination. So we need to look at these things differently. I think we should focus more on hospitalizations as well. That's probably going to be the best measure of the overall impact of coronavirus on society. JOHN DICKERSON: So if we should change our mindset a little, should we change the policies and practices that have been put in place by the states and the federal government on-- on how we behave? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think a lot of the sacrifices we've made, and Americans have made substantial sacrifices over the last year, the things that we've asked people to do as public health officials were based on mutual consent, that people understood we were doing these things to try to protect the public. But as the situation improved, we were going to pull them back. And I think oftentimes a mistake we make is that we're quicker to implement these precautions than we are to lift them, because we're worried that once we lift them, we won't be able to reimplement them. I think we need to lean more aggressively forward and look at ways to try to relax some of the provisions that don't really make as much sense anymore. And probably the ones that we should be looking at the hardest are things done outside. I think we should be thinking about lifting mask-- mask ordinances outside. I think we should be thinking about lifting limits on gatherings outside and trying to encourage people to go outside now that the weather is warming, take more activities outside in the face of declining risk overall. Again, I think that these declines we're seeing are really locked in at this point. So I don't think we need to be as worried that as we take our foot off the brake, things are going to surge again. People by and large, are engaging in a lot of activity. B.1.1.7 is epidemic across the country and we're still not seeing big surges. And that's a good indication. JOHN DICKERSON: Can you give me your thoughts on vaccine hesitancy? There are concerns. How concerned are you about those who don't want to get the vaccine, including the second shot some people aren't doing? How concerned are you and what do you think can be done? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I need-- I think we need to break this down a little bit more. There are people who are clearly vaccine hesitant, people who, you know, are skeptical of vaccines, worry about the safety of vaccines. I think some portion of those people we can reach with better education in getting the vaccines into hands of people that they trust, like their local physicians, to try to encourage them to get vaccinated. But I think that there's also a large group of people for whom getting a vaccine still isn't convenient, people who work all day take care of families at night. For those individuals, we need to create more twenty-four-seven vaccination sites. We need to guarantee them they're not going to wait more than ten minutes when they go to get vaccinated. We need to encourage businesses to give people time off to get vaccinated. And then there is just softer demand. There's marginal customers like there are for any other product. There's people who say, you know, I'll get vaccinated, but they're not as anxious to get vaccinated as those sixty-five and seventy year olds who lined up back in January. And for those individuals, I think we need to market it more aggressively to them. We need to put vaccines in the hands of pharmacies that know how to market health care products to individuals, maybe pay pharmacies a little more over the next couple of months, give them an extra twenty dollar bonus to get people vaccinated, do things to try to create incentives in the market to get more information out to those marginal customers. We will get more people vaccinated, but the rate of vaccination is going to slow. That's not a bad thing. We just need to recognize it. JOHN DICKERSON: Twenty seconds left. Your view on stopping the pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccination. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, they-- they pa-- I think they should have stopped the pause in the Johnson & Johnson vaccination based on what we know. This is a safe and effective vaccine. It has a place in public health right now. They paused it to try to see if there was going to be more cases that surfaced. They surfaced some additional cases, but not a lot. I think the risk-benefit of this vaccine looks favorable. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Doctor Gottlieb, sorry to cut you off. We're out of time. Thanks so much. And we'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Walter Mondale died last week at ninety-three. Twelve years as senator, vice president of the United States, and the Democratic presidential nominee in 1984. It is an impressive resume. But it was not the resume that made people who never knew him weep in the middle of the day. Joe Trippi, the veteran Democratic strategist, posted a story on Twitter about working for Mondale in the '84 Democratic primary. During one of his early conversations with the candidate, Trippi mentioned he had been estranged from his father for five years. Trippi's dad, an Italian immigrant, wanted Trippi to go into the family flower business, but he'd gone into politics instead. He was good at it. He helped Mondale win Iowa. Months later, Trippi helped him win Pennsylvania, clinching the nomination. Before the victory celebration that night, Mondale called Trippi to his room. As the aide walked in, he saw the candidate talking to an old Italian man, telling him \"that his son was in an honorable profession. Fighting for people who were down and hurting. He's making a difference,\" Mondale said, \"I count on him and you need to know that.\" The response to this story from Republicans, Democrats, humans all, included words like character, mensch, integrity, decency, honorable, words we'd all like attached to us at the end of our lives. \"Well my time has come,\" Mondale wrote to his former staffers just before his death, he said he looks forward to rejoining his wife and late daughter. \"Before I go, I wanted to let you know how much you mean to me,\" he wrote, \"I always knew it would be okay if I arrived some and was greeted by one of you.\" Gratitude and thinking of others, both at moments of triumph and at the final moment, when your behavior writes your eulogy, you've gone out pretty well. WALTER MONDALE: But just trying to help others and be decent neighbor and friends. JOHN DICKERSON: Few us of will ever have a resume like Fritz Mondale, but to leave a mark with your heart, with gratitude and grace, that life is available to each of us. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: That's it for us today. Thanks so much for watching. Come join us next week. We'll be here at FACE THE NATION. For FACE THE NATION, I'm John Dickerson.",

            "article_content": "Georgia Governor Brian Kemp on Thursday signed into law a sweeping Republican-sponsored overhaul of state elections that includes new restrictions on voting by mail and gives the legislature greater control over how elections are run. Among other things, the law requires a photo ID in order to vote absentee by mail, after more than 1.3 million Georgia voters used that option during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also cuts the time people have to request an absentee ballot and limits where ballot drop boxes can be placed and when they can be accessed. Democrats and voting rights groups say the law will disproportionately disenfranchise voters of color. It is part of a wave of GOP-backed election bills\u00a0introduced in states around the nation after former President Trump stoked false claims that fraud led to his 2020 election defeat. President Joe Biden called such GOP efforts \"un-American\" and \"sick\" during a news conference Thursday. And a group of voter mobilization groups filed a lawsuit late Thursday in federal court in Atlanta challenging the new law. The Republican changes to voting law in Georgia follows record-breaking turnout that led to Democratic victories in the presidential contest and two U.S. Senate runoffs in the once reliably red state. \"After the November election last year, I knew, like so many of you, that significant reforms to our state elections were needed,\" said Kemp, who drew Trump's ire after certifying Biden's victory in Georgia. The bill, SB 202, passed the state House 100-75 earlier Thursday, then the state Senate quickly agreed to House changes by a vote of 34-20. Republicans in the legislature were in support, while Democrats were opposed. President Biden on Friday called the Georgia legislation \"outrageous\" and \"an atrocity,\" and urged Congress to move quickly to bolster voting rights across the nation in response. \"It's an atrocity,\" Biden told reporters. \"They passed a law saying you can't provide water for people standing in line while they're waiting to vote. You don't need anything else to know this is nothing but punitive, designed to keep people from voting.\" GEORGIA voting bill: Earlier plans to eliminate absentee voting, cut back Sunday voting did *not* make it into the final bill. Here's what's in it: ID for absentee ballots, limits use of drop boxes, state election board can take over county election boards https://t.co/Qn9r35S3IT Gerogia's Democratic state Senate Minority Leader Gloria Butler called the efforts by Republicans \"voter suppression tactics.\" \"We are witnessing right now a massive and unabashed assault on voting rights unlike anything we've seen since the\u00a0Jim Crow era,\" Butler said. Kemp delivered remarks on the bill during a livestream Thursday evening and was interrupted by Georgia State Representative Park Cannon,\u00a0according to CBS affiliate WGCL-TV. Cannon, who was among a group of protesters, knocked on Kemp's door and was subsequently arrested by police. She has been charged with felony obstruction of law enforcement and preventing or disrupting General Assembly sessions or other meetings of members, a misdemeanor. She was later released. More: Includes expansion of weekend voting, mandatory on two Saturdays, counties can offer two Sundays. But: for runoffs, early voting is a one week minimum compare to the previous three weeks. https://t.co/jf6GBB4lqm Conservative groups hailed the legislation's passage, while liberals voiced their concern.\u00a0 \"While some on the Left attempted to suppress Georgian voters by pushing policies that undermine trust in the state's elections, Gov. Kemp and Georgia legislators fought to restore voter trust and confidence,\" said the conservative Heritage Action. \"And today, they succeeded \u2014 this is a massive victory for every single Georgian voter and for our country. ... Thanks to them, Georgia is now leading the nation in free, fair, and safe elections \u2014 the rest of the nation should follow.\" The Southern Poverty Law Center said Georgia Republican leaders were \"cowering to extremists\" with the legislation.\u00a0 \"Thousands of voters have made it clear that the types of provisions in SB 202 are unacceptable and will disproportionately harm historically disenfranchised communities, young voters, and voters with disabilities,\" said Nancy Abudu, deputy legal director for the SPLC Action Fund. \"The speed and magnitude of today's shift in election policy in Georgia is unprecedented and unlike any other major policy shift in the state's recent history.\" President Biden, at his news conference, said he did not believe most Republican voters supported such efforts. \"The Republican voters I know find this despicable, Republican voters, the folks outside this White House. I'm not talking about the elected officials. I'm talking about voters,\" Mr. Biden said. He also expressed openness to amending the filibuster rule in the Senate on certain issues, including voting rights.\u00a0 \"Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote. So I strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are \u2014 are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote \u2014 like the basic right to vote. We've amended the filibuster in the past,\" he said.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "When New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's resignation becomes effective in two weeks, Lieutenant Governor Kathy Hochul will replace him as the state's first female governor. Cuomo, a Democrat,\u00a0announced his impending resignation Tuesday, with his eventual impeachment seeming all but certain in the wake of a New York attorney general report that found he sexually harassed 11 women. Cuomo denied acting inappropriately, but said he would step down to \"let government get back to governing.\"\u00a0 Under New York state law, in the event of a governor's resignation, the lieutenant governor becomes the person in charge. Hochul, also a Democrat, stayed out of the spotlight during the attorney general's investigation, and declared the governor's behavior as documented in the report \"repulsive\" and \"unlawful.\"\u00a0 \"Sexual harassment is unacceptable in any workplace, and certainly not in public service,\" Hochul tweeted last week. \"The AG's investigation has documented repulsive & unlawful behavior by the Governor towards multiple women. I believe these brave women & admire their courage coming forward. No one is above the law.\" Following Cuomo's announcement, Hochul said his stepping down was the \"right thing to do and in the best interest of New Yorkers.\" \"As someone who has served at all levels of government and is next in the line of succession, I am prepared to lead as New York State's 57th Governor,\" she tweeted. Hochul, 62, has been lieutenant governor since 2015. From 2011 to 2013, she represented New York's 26th District in Congress, where she served on the House Armed Services Committee and House Homeland Security Committee before losing reelection. She earned her undergraduate degree from Syracuse University, and her law degree from Catholic University. Early in her career, she worked as an aide on Capitol Hill before holding a series of local positions prior to her election to Congress.\u00a0 Hochul has long been an advocate for women facing domestic and sexual violence. She led the governor's \"Enough is Enough\" campaign to fight sexual assault on college campuses.\u00a0 The lieutenant governor\u00a0comes from a family of steelworkers. When her grandparents fled poverty in Ireland, they eventually settled in western New York, where her grandfather, dad and uncles worked in the steel industry.\u00a0 Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden outlined his COVID-19 relief proposal in Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday. The massive stimulus bill is expected to cost roughly $1.9 trillion to fund vaccinations and provide immediate, direct relief to working families and communities bearing the brunt of the crisis. \"A crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight, and there's no time to waste. We have to act and we have to act now,\" Mr. Biden said.\u00a0 The president-elect said his plan is two-pronged \u2014 a \"rescue\" plan, which he outlined Thursday night, and a \"recovery\" plan, which he will outline after he's in office. The vice president claims his rescue plan will lift millions of out poverty. Mr. Biden was expected to announce his vaccine rollout plan Thursday night too, but said he will do so soon.\u00a0 Included in Mr. Biden's relief plan are the following things:\u00a0 The relief push will also include $160 billion for a national vaccination program, funding to expand COVID-19 testing, $170 billion for schools, $15 billion for the hardest-hit 1 million small businesses and $20 billion for the hardest-hit public transit agencies, among other things.\u00a0 \"I know what I just described does not come cheaply,\" the president-elect said, adding that \"failure to do so will cost us dearly.\"\u00a0 Mr. Biden took no questions from reporters after his speech.\u00a0 The package is likely to pass Congress, as Democrats control the House and, once the Georgia Senate election results are certified, there will be a 50-50 party split in the Senate, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking any ties. Some elements of the legislation, like the $1,400 stimulus checks, already have bipartisan support, but lobbying from congressional members and special interests could affect the package's overall price tag. \u00a0 Mr. Biden is also taking steps to accelerate the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines once he takes office. The Trump administration pledged to\u00a0vaccinate 20 million Americans\u00a0by the end of 2020. However, two weeks into the new year, only over 10 million people have received their first dose of vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's\u00a0COVID Data Tracker.\u00a0 Last week, eight Democratic governors sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Army General Gustave Perna, who is in charge of overseeing vaccine distribution for Operation Warp Speed, requesting that they accelerate the distribution of vaccines and not hold back doses in reserves while awaiting further shipments. On Tuesday, Azar announced several major changes to the federal government's vaccine distribution plan, including its decision to release a large supply of doses it had been withholding to ensure that vaccinated Americans got their second dose. Azar said the change was made possible because manufacturing capabilities are now in place to meet demand. \"We now have a consistent pace of production, we can now ship all of the doses that had been held in physical reserve, with second doses being supplied by doses coming off of manufacturing lines with quality control,\" the secretary said. \"Going forward, each week, doses available will be released to first cover the second doses and then cover additional first vaccinations.\" Mr. Biden has set a goal to vaccinate 100 million people during his first 100 days as president. \"I'm absolutely convinced that in 100 days, we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better,\" the president-elect said last month. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and member of Biden's coronavirus advisory board,\u00a0told \"CBS This Morning\"\u00a0on Tuesday that he'd view it as an \"aspirational goal.\" \"I'd call it an aspirational goal and one I think we must strive for,\" Osterholm said. \"We know right now that every day we don't have vaccine in people's arms, people are getting sick and dying. And so, I think every effort must be made to do that, and the team is behind him in every way they can to help make it a reality.\"",

            "article_content": "Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes is jumping into a crowded Senate primary to be the Democratic nominee in 2022. His entrance heightens what is expected to be one of the marquee primaries during the midterm elections.\u00a0 Barnes joined seven other Democrats who have already launched their Senate bids. On Wednesday, Milwaukee Alderwoman Chantia Lewis became the ninth candidate to enter the contest. They're lining up to potentially face incumbent Republican Senator Ron Johnson, who has not yet announced if he will seek a third term. \"The U.S. Senate is broken,\" Barnes said Tuesday at a rally in Milwaukee. \"Senator Ron Johnosn is not delivering for the people of Wisconsin. He's doing like so many other cynical politicians who use false choices to divide us for their own political gain.\" \"Hard-working families deserve every opportunity, but politicians like Senator Ron Johnson aren't delivering,\" Barnes tweeted on Tuesday. Barnes is the first Black lieutenant governor elected in Wisconsin and only the second Black statewide elected official. Barnes easily won his 2018 primary for lieutenant governor before he and Governor Tony Evers narrowly defeated former Republican Governor Scott Walker in the general election. Barnes also served two terms in the State Assembly from 2013 to 2017.\u00a0 His announcement video focused on his family's working-class roots and said Wisconsin families need more opportunities. Barnes has been endorsed by the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee. At his campaign kickoff rally, Barnes said America can't go back to the\u00a0same policies of the\u00a0pre-pandemic days. He said leaders need to tackle the climate crisis, end gun violence and create more equal economic opportunities.\u00a0 \"I believe that we need to build a better America so that the opportunity I was able to find isn't so rare,\" Barnes said. \"I've taken on inequality and I've fought for equal opportunity. I can guarantee you that's the fight that I'll continue in the United States Senate.\"\u00a0 \"The system isn't working. You see so many people who are working longer hours and harder, oftentimes for much less,\" Barnes said in his announcement video. \"Let's be unabashedly unafraid to work together to change the game.\" Wisconsin will be one of the premiere battlegrounds during the midterm elections, with competitive races for governor and Senate. President Biden won Wisconsin by a razor-thin 20,000 votes last November, and Evers defeated Walker in 2018 by about 30,000 votes. Cook Political Report rates Wisconsin's Senate race as a tossup.\u00a0 The Democratic field has already attracted top-tier candidates. Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, who launched his campaign in February, has already raised $2 million and has $1 million cash on hand. Wisconsin State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, who jumped into the race in April, is backed by EMILY's List and raised more than $500,000 last quarter. Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson, who launched his campaign late last year, raised $240,000 last quarter and has $406,000 in the bank.\u00a0 Other candidates who have entered the race in recent months include Wisconsin State Senator Chris Larson, radiologist Gillian Battino, business consultant Adam Murphy and attorney Peter Peckarsky. Steven Olikara, the founder and former CEO of Millennial Action Project, announced in May that he was forming an exploratory committee for a potential Senate bid.\u00a0 Barnes' entry into the race comes about a month after he told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that he received his college diploma in May 2020 from Alabama A&M University. Barnes finished attending classes at the school in 2008 and said during his 2018 campaign that he received a degree from there, though he had not yet fulfilled all of the requirements to receive it.\u00a0 \"While Wisconsin Democrats trip over themselves to prove who's more liberal, Senator Ron Johnson continues to work hard to bring common sense to Washington and fight for the people of Wisconsin,\" Lizzie Litzow, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement.\u00a0 Although Johnson hasn't said if he'll seek another term, he raised more money than his potential Democratic challengers last quarter, bringing in nearly $1.1 million. He has $1.7 million in the bank.\u00a0 At a Milwaukee Press Club event last month, Johnson said he wasn't feeling pressure to make a decision soon and noted that he didn't jump into his race in 2010 until seven months before the election. Johnson added that his main goal is to keep the seat Republican.\u00a0 \"I'm going to do nothing to hamper our ability as the Republican Party to retain this U.S. Senate seat,\" Johnson said. Former President Trump encouraged Johnson to run in April when he endorsed the incumbent senator. \u00a0NRSC chair Rick Scott told the conservative \"Ruthless\" podcast that he bothers Johnson \"every day\" about running again.\u00a0 Barnes' decision to run for U.S. Senate means there will likely be an open competition to join Evers on the Democratic ticket in November 2022. Evers announced last month that he was going to run for re-election. Wisconsin holds primary elections for lieutenant governor and the candidate who wins that race is placed on the ballot with the party's gubernatorial nominee.\u00a0 In December, Evers told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, \"I'd prefer (Barnes) to be lieutenant governor\" but pledged to respect whatever political decision Barnes made. He thanked Barnes for his work, but did not offer an endorsement on Tuesday.\u00a0 \"Mandela Barnes is a good friend and has been a great partner working to address challenges facing our state, and I've always said I would support any decision Mandela made about how best to serve the people of Wisconsin,\" Evers said in a statement. \"We're lucky to have strong Democratic candidates who are running to send him packing, and I look forward to supporting Wisconsin Democrats' choice to take on Ron Johnson in 2022.\" CBS News political reporter.",

            "article_content": "New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is facing major questions Tuesday night after the city's Board of Elections acknowledged a \"discrepancy\" in unofficial ranked-choice voting results that had been released earlier in the day. The board said in a statement late Tuesday that it accidentally included thousands of test ballots in the results.\u00a0 The chaos started when the tabulations released Tuesday afternoon showed about 940,000 in-person votes were cast, a major jump from the 800,000 that were reported on June 22. The city's results from primary\u00a0 night suggested that 96% of the in-person votes had been counted.\u00a0 The unofficial and incomplete results that were released earlier Tuesday showed ranked-choice voting tabulations from votes cast on primary day and during early in-person voting. They did not include approximately 125,000 absentee ballots. The board said earlier on Tuesday that it was aware of \"a discrepancy in the unofficial (ranked-choice voting) round by round elimination report.\" In a statement released Tuesday night, the board said that test ballots were accidentally included in the results.\u00a0 \"It has been determined that ballot images used for testing were not cleared from the Election Management System,\" the board said. \"Board staff has removed all test ballot images from the system and will upload election night results, cross-referencing against election night reporting software for verification. The cast vote record will be regenerated and the (ranked-choice voting) rounds will be retabulated.\" The statement added the board has taken action to \"ensure the most accurate up to date results are reported.\" The results page on the board's website was updated late Tuesday to say that \"unofficial rank choice results\" would be available \"starting on June 30.\" The board's first statement about the discrepancies came after Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, who was leading after first-choice votes from in-person voting were released last week, highlighted the issue in a statement about the results.\u00a0 \"The vote total just released by the Board of Elections is 100,000-plus more than the total announced on election night, raising serious questions,\" Adams said in a statement. \"We have asked the Board of Elections to explain such a massive increase and other irregularities before we comment on the Ranked Choice Voting projection. We remain confident that Eric Adams will be the next mayor of New York because he put together a historic five-borough working class coalition of New Yorkers to make our city a safer, fairer, more affordable place.\" Later Tuesday, after the Board of Elections pulled the inaccurate results, Adams released a statement saying he looked forward to the release of an accurate simulation and \"the timely conclusion of this process.\"   This is the first citywide primary in New York City to use ranked-choice voting. Voters were able to rank up to five candidates on their ballots. In this system, the candidate who receives the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated and his or her supporters' votes are reallocated based on other selections. That process of elimination and redistribution is repeated until two candidates remain and the candidate with the most votes wins.\u00a0 The preliminary results released on Tuesday afternoon, which were later taken down by the Board of Elections, showed Adams with a 2-point edge over former Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia in the final round. Even before the issues with Tuesday's results, it was expected to take until July to know the winner because of New York's absentee ballot rules. The New York City Board of Elections was already planning to release updated ranked-choice voting results on July 6 to include absentee ballots.\u00a0 Veteran election lawyer Jerry Goldfeder said he's hopeful that the board can fix any glitches that may exist, but acknowledged that hand-counting the ballots is an option.\u00a0 \"If that's the only way to get an accurate result, as nineteenth-century as it sounds, we'll do it,\" Goldfeder said.\u00a0 In a statement released late Tuesday night, Garcia said the board's release of incorrect data was \"deeply troubling and requires a much more transparent and complete explanation.\" She added that she's confident that \"every candidate will accept the final results and support whomever the voters have elected.\" \"I believe that we will get an accurate count at the end of the day and we are definitely monitoring it as a campaign to make sure that that happens,\" Garcia told CBSN's Tanya Rivero on Wednesday. She noted that absentee ballots have not yet been counted and said she will \"absolutely support the Democratic nominee\" when the full results are in. Civil rights attorney Maya Wiley, who was in second place after first-choice in-person votes were released on primary night, said it is \"impossible to be surprised\" given the board's history with issues. \"The BOE must now count the remainder of the votes transparently and ensure the integrity of the process moving forward,\" she said. Former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who conceded on primary night, quipped in a tweet, \"ranked choice voting is awesome\" amid the chaos Tuesday night. According to exit polling released by Common Cause New York and Rank the Vote NYC, 83% of voters ranked at least two candidates on their ballots in the mayoral primary and 42% of voters ranked five candidates. Ninety-five percent of New Yorkers said they found the ballot easy to complete and 77% said they would like to use ranked-choice voting in future local elections.\u00a0 \"The BOE has now clarified that the discrepancy in the count was due to human error, not any problem with the technology or ranked choice voting. We are not at all happy that it happened, but it was a mistake that the BOE is moving to correct,\" Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, said in a statement. \"The long time opponents of RCV seizing this moment to attack a more democratic system of elections \u2014 that exit polling shows voters overwhelmingly support \u2014 are misguided, and misleading the public.\" New York City's Board of Elections has started processing absentee ballots. Ballots had to be postmarked by June 22, but Tuesday was the deadline for them to arrive. The city is expected to redo the ranked-choice voting tabulation with absentee results on July 6. Voters have until July 9 to cure any deficiencies with absentee ballots, meaning the final results may not come until July 12. As the Board of Elections works to solve the issue, Goldfeder said people need to remain patient and withhold judgement.\u00a0 \"Let the Board of Elections try to fix these issues and let the process go forward so that we get accurate results. I'm hopeful that they'll be able to do that,\" Goldfeder said. \"If they're able to do that, then I have confidence that we'll get an accurate result.\u00a0 CBS News political reporter.",

But he was\u00a0forced to recuse himself from that committee's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election amid an investigation by the Office of Congressional Ethics into whether he had leaked classified information. Nunes is the 12th House Republican to leave during the 2022 election cycle. He's the second to resign before his term ends. Ohio Congressman Steve Stivers was the first after he took a role with Ohio's Chamber of Commerce. Nunes represents California's 22nd Congressional District. According to the press release, Nunes will begin his new role in January 2022. \"The time has come to reopen the Internet and allow for the free flow of ideas and expression without censorship,\" Nunes said in a statement. \"I'm humbled and honored President Trump has asked me to lead the mission and the world class team that will deliver on this promise.\" California is in the process of redrawing their Congressional lines, and one draft map released in November suggested that Nunes' current district would switch from a district Trump won to one that Biden would've won. Due to population loss, California is losing a Congressional district for the first time in state history. Phil Arballo, the Democrat running in California's 22nd district, issued a statement on Nunes' departure saying \"good riddance.\"\u00a0 Mr. Trump praised Nunes in the statement.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Biden, that aired on Sunday, November 28, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Fauci, thank you very much for making time. DR. ANTHONY FAUCI: Thank you for having me. Good to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's been an incredible past two years. There's a lot to unpack and I want to kind of start off with where we are in this moment right now. We're seeing cases increase once again. Are we in a fifth wave? DR. FAUCI: Well, we certainly have the potential to go into a fifth wave. And the fifth wave, or the magnitude of any increase, if you want to call it that it will turn into a wave, will really be dependent upon what we do in the next few weeks to a couple of months. For example, we have now about 62 million people in the country who are eligible to be vaccinated, who have not yet gotten vaccinated. Superimpose upon that, the fact that, unquestionably, the people who got vaccinated six, seven, eight, nine, 10 months ago, we're starting to see an understandable diminution in the level of immunity. It's called waning immunity, and it was seen more emphatically in other countries before we saw it here. For example, Israel, which is usually about a month or a month and a half ahead of us temporally with regard to the dynamics of the outbreak, the administration of vaccines and most recently, boosters. So now we know that although the vaccines are very effective and the data that you look at are incontrovertible, that if you compare unvaccinated with vaccinated, infections, hospitalizations, deaths, dramatically multi multifold more in those who are unvaccinated. However, given the waning of immunity, right now boosters are going to be very important. A third shot for those who got the two mRNAs and another additional shot for those who got the J&J. If we have a combination of getting as many people as we can get vaccinated as possible who have not yet gotten vaccinated, add on to it the children who are now eligible, the five to 11, there's twenty eight million of those, and getting the many, many people now, 70% of the entire population of adults has been vaccinated- about 80% has been vaccinated. If we do that successfully in a very intensive way, we can mitigate any increase because if you look at what's happening right now, as you and I are speaking, we're starting to see an uptick that had plateaued at around 70, 75,000 a day. Now it's starting to go up--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --to 80,000--\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: --yeah, to 80. So if we now do what I'm talking about in an intense way, we may be able to blunt that. If we don't do it successfully, it is certainly conceivable and maybe likely that we will see another bit of a surge. How bad it gets is dependent upon us and how we mitigate. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said in the past that you would like to get under 10,000 infections a day in order to sort of live with COVID.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Right, yeah. You know--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --We're at 80,000. How do you get all the way down there? Is that even realistic?\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Yeah, I believe it is. Now MARGARET, I believe it is because there's no doubt there's one thing we know for sure: that 70 to 80,000 a day is an unacceptable level. I mean, we've heard people say, understandably, they're trying to look for a metric to give to the public that we're going to have to start living with COVID. I believe that's the case because I don't think we're going to eradicate it. We've only eradicated one infection of mankind, and that's smallpox. I don't think we're even going to eliminate it. The way you've eliminated polio from the United States, you've eliminated malaria, which was, you know, decades and decades ago. We had malaria right here in Washington, D.C. We've eliminated measles because we have a very, very, very intensive vaccine campaign that did that. So we're looking at control. So control has a pretty wide bracket. You don't want to control at 70 to 80,000. I have empirically said I would like to see it get below 10,000, but maybe even lower than that. Because if you have a smoldering amount of infection in society, that's 20, 30, 40,000 infections, what happens is that as immunity wanes among people, even the vaccinated people secondarily become more at risk. If you lower the level of infection so low that it doesn't give the virus the opportunity to either seek out the very vulnerable, or those who's never been vaccinated, and the somewhat vulnerable, those whose immunity has waned down to a certain level. So that's the reason why we have multiple moving parts. We'd like to be very arithmetic about it. This is the amount we need. This is the time we're going to do it. But when you have these moving parts, the best way you can get to where you want to go is to just say we're going to vaccinate as many people as we can, we're going to get as many people boosted as we can, and we're going to get that level down. And I think that's going to have to be as low as less than 10,000. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've been talking about all the problems you have there with convincing these people who are really dug-in and anti-vaccine. Is it really realistic that we have to get to 85% of the population, which is what you've said in the past, in order to sort of have herd immunity? I mean, it seems almost impossible to get there. DR. FAUCI: Let me get to that number, MARGARET, because it really is important. We have to be very humble about it. We don't know what that number is. And the reason is the number is a moving target. Because if you get someone who's vaccinated and he wanes down and gets below a certain level, I don't know whether you can count that as a full protected person, which is the reason why it's a combination not only of getting the total population vaccinated as a primary, but also getting people boosted. And that's what I mean by a moving target. I've always said, and I hope we can clarify it, that measles, we know that the number of people to be vaccinated is over 90%. And the reason we know it, because when you go over 90, you don't see any measles in the community. When you have pockets of sometimes isolated communities where it goes down into the 80s or so, that's when you get the kind of measles outbreaks. So we know, by almost trial and error, what the level of vaccination needs to be to get herd immunity, which as a concept means there's no virus going around. Everything is protected. You should call it more community immunity as opposed to herd immunity. We haven't gotten there yet with COVID, so we don't really know what that number is. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what you're describing is never really having control, necessarily, of COVID, but learning to what? Get boosted every six to eight months? DR. FAUCI: Great question. And that's what we don't know. And the only way- the important part when you're dealing with a unique, never-before-experienced outbreak of a new virus, that sometimes you can extrapolate what you know about other viruses because there are some commonalities, but sometimes you have to realize that this may be very unique. So for example, if we get a third shot with an mRNA, it is conceivable that there will be, based on immunological memory of B cells and T cells, the different types of cells that protect you, that you would get enough of what we call maturation. Affinity maturation means get those cells really, really trained to be able to powerfully block significant disease. It may not block getting a little sniffle, but it'll block you from getting significant disease. It is conceivable that when we get that extra boost, that will make the durability go well beyond six months and even longer. Or it may be that we will have to boost people intermittently the way we do it with influenza. Right now, we do not know definitively what that course is going to be. Whether it's going to be a three shot and you're done or three shots and then every once in a while you have to reboost. We'll have to see how things roll out. Otherwise, we just can't say something and guess about it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why isn't the CDC tracking breakthrough infections? Wouldn't you be able to better answer that question if you knew? DR. FAUCI: Yeah, I mean, yes, in many respects, they are. One of the things that--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --Among health care workers.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Yeah, yeah, we need to do a lot of things and the things that we certainly need to do, and we've been discussing this as recently as yesterday, that we really need to find out when you do boost an individual, how long does that immunity last, both from a laboratory standpoint and from a protection standpoint? So the one thing we want to make sure, now that we're getting full blown into the booster phase, we've got to make sure we know what that means from a clinical standpoint. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the public hears you cite information out of Israel, out of a foreign country. Why don't we have that data collection happening here now? DR. FAUCI: We should have it. We should have it.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why don't we? DR. FAUCI: I can't-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why did- why did the United States decide not to track those breakthrough infections? DR. FAUCI: Well, it's a very complicated indication- excuse me. It's a very complicated situation. And often the public doesn't hear yet in time things that are being collected. So there's a lot of data, clearly a lot of data, that's being collected by the CDC that people don't know about yet. So we need to make sure in real time we get that data out. Historically, when you're not in a pandemic, you can collect data, you can analyze it, you could talk about it and then you could look back and say this is what we've done. But when you're dealing with a pandemic, you've got to get that out in real time so your policies can be dictated by data that occurred relatively recently, not data that occurred four or five months ago. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the criticism that they're too academic.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Right, yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But is there data being collected now in the United States about breakthrough infections that the public doesn't know about? DR. FAUCI: Yes, yes. Yes. The CDC is collecting data, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Beyond just health care workers, everyday people. You have an idea of what's happening with breakthrough infections? DR. FAUCI: I don't have the data for you right now, that's obviously- we'll have to get the CDC to get us that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about how people should be handling the data they may have now, with their kids in particular. The Education Secretary recently told me there should be no need for remote or hybrid learning. OK. But then there are a lot of really confused parents out there.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Each school seems to be handling this differently in terms of masking and not masking, or when they alert parents and the like. What's the most responsible thing for parents to do if they know they're sending their child into a classroom and someone in that room tests positive? DR. FAUCI: Yeah, there are a lot of options about that. The one thing you don't want to do, and again, this is the CDC guidelines. This is the kind of things that they have been analyzing and trying to get the best approach. You know, there's the test to stay. In other words, if you test and you're negative, you don't have to go out and get quarantine. The idea about when you get an outbreak in a class of two, to then immobilize essentially, the class is functionally very, very difficult to get a good academic year with some continuity about that. And that's the reason why we need to do several things all at once. One, you want to surround the children with adults who are completely vaccinated. Number two, you want to vaccinate the adolescents that we already have been vaccinating for some time. Vaccinate the five to 11 year old. And when there is a case in the school, then you really got to do something about-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Sometimes parents don't even know if there's a case in the school. DR. FAUCI: I know that and it's- MARGARET, it's got to be articulated much more clearly, so that people know exactly and there's no ambiguity about that. When you don't know what the situation is and you have community spread around, that's the reason why the CDC still recommends masking for the children in school. MARGARET BRENNAN: The CDC guidelines, they're pretty convoluted about it. It says get tested immediately and quarantine if you've been exposed- this is for children. For a period of 14 days, unless you receive instructions from the school official or a public health official. It really kind of leaves it up to a lot of interpretation there. DR. FAUCI: I know. And I believe that has to change, to make it more- You know, my approach has always been to be very explicit and then repeat what you said.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. So- so for parents now that have partially vaccinated children, some unvaccinated children, I mean, are all of these guidelines just also going to be a moving target? DR. FAUCI: Right. No, I hope the guidelines- I think the data will change as we get more and more experience, particularly as we get into a situation where you have more people vaccinated and you get boosted. But you have to get the data to be as close to the recommendation as you possibly can. You can't have it be too much lagging because then you're behind the time. MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is one of those criticisms of how our country responded here. Which is just- maybe it's by virtue of the federal system, but district by district, state by state, different things. And then they look for you for unified, \"Tell me what to do. Just tell me what to do with my kids.\"\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Clarity. DR. FAUCI: Yeah, I mean, but the clarity when it comes to the situation of the public health, we really need to- and I think they are very likely doing much, much better than what the public thinks they are- is to get the CDC to be very clear, to be very, very sharp about what a recommendation is. And when you don't know what the data- I mean, when there's no data to make that to, then just give a recommendation based on best judgment, if you want to call it that. MARGARET BRENNAN: And when you say lack of data, this has- this has been a criticism throughout. That there's just not enough information being collected in this country. Not enough surveillance being done. Is that still the case in your view? DR. FAUCI: We do- we need to do more. No doubt about it. No doubt about it. We need to do more surveillance and we need to do more testing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Would we have to worry about vaccinating babies, toddlers, if adults were vaccinated at a higher rate? I mean, very young children still won't have a vaccine well into 2022, according to Pfizer. DR. FAUCI: Well, I believe it's going to be in the first quarter of 2022. I would hope it would be in the first quarter because the studies are being done right now on children from two to five and then from six months to two years. And now they may take longer because the younger you get, the more obviously vulnerable. Children are vulnerable. You got to be extra, especially careful about safety. I don't think there's going to be an issue with efficacy. There's no reason to believe why it will not be efficacious and ultimately effective in the children. But when you're dealing with children, it's a very sensitive area. And that's the reason why I may take a little bit longer. But I would hope by the time we get into the first quarter of 2022, we'll be able to do that. You know, one of the things that people should appreciate is that we are in a very stressful, unique and complicated situation with COVID 19. But when we look back on this, it's going to settle into something that will ultimately be a policy that's been tried, true and tested. We vaccinate children way down to lower age for diseases that have much less morbidity and mortality than COVID-19. So that's what I say when people say, \"Are you sure you want to be vaccinating the children?'' Yeah, we do want to be vaccinating the children because we want to vaccinate and protect everyone in society, including children. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the CDC often takes years before they give that recommendation for pediatric vaccines. Do you think it'll move faster? DR. FAUCI: Yes, it will. MARGARET BRENNAN: So next year, kid goes into the classroom. Will it be required, do you think? DR. FAUCI: I don't know if it's going to be required, but I can tell you, I have always been- I mean, I'm an infectious disease person. I'm a public health person. I would push for getting people who are vulnerable, and children are vulnerable, as quickly and as efficiently as possible. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when do we get to pull back the public health restrictions for kids? Is it until the toddlers get vaccinated? DR. FAUCI: No, I think that you're going to see likely a gradual pulling back when you get- You have to put the dynamics of the outbreak in a community into the mix of your decision making. You're going to have children vaccinated. You'll have teachers vaccinated. When the community level goes down- I mean, being in a- in a region, a state, a city or a county in which you are red hot by the color code, versus red, orange, yellow, green, et cetera. If you're in a red hot area, you're not going to want to pull back on masking or pull back on any of the mitigation. If X number of months from now, you have a very high proportion of children vaccinated and you are in an area with a level where I call the dynamics of infection is very low, I would be almost certain that you're going to see a significant diminution in the mitigations, such as masks and things like that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hmm. It's just such a moving target for people all the time, and they say, How do I know my community infection level? How do I know what's red? What's green? What's OK? DR. FAUCI: Yeah, I know. Easiest way to say click on the CDC website and you can- you can figure it out in a second. But not everybody has access to that, and not everybody knows how to do that. So it's going to be a combination of those who can access that online information, as well as getting out there would a lot of PSAs. I mean, the Community Public Health Service, that's one of the things that I've been talking about for some time now. When you talk about what the successes and what the vulnerabilities of our response have been to this, I divided up into two groups: scientifically preparedness and response and public health preparedness and response. Fortunately for us, the scientific preparedness and response has been unprecedentedly good, if not magnificent. And to be able to get a vaccine from the time you get the sequence of the virus, to get it a successful, highly effective and safe vaccine in the arms of individuals within 11 months has never even been imagined, much less done. So the science came through, the science came through. The public health is different. We thought we had a good system. We found out that our public health infrastructure at the local level was just extraordinarily outdated in so many respects. Personnel were leaving. People were using fax machines instead of computer online things. If you want to have a tracking of an outbreak or responding to an outbreak, getting messages out to the community, knowing whether you live in a community that's a yellow, an orange or a red so that everybody in the community knows, that's something we did not have early on. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we still don't have a national surveillance system that from the local level up-- DR. FAUCI: --Not to the level that I was built to be appropriate. Right-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --is built out. So you just brought us to one of the chief public failures as diagnosed by other doctors, and I want- I want to tick through some of these-- DR. FAUCI: --Alright-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --to see if you agree-- DR. FAUCI: --Sure--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --with some of the criticisms of the public health response. The U.S. didn't have a national surveillance system, testing was inadequate and there was a lack of data. DR. FAUCI: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You agree with that.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Yes.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: It was a deadly mistake by the CDC to try to use the flu as a model, according to Dr. Deborah Birx. It meant doctors were looking for spread in the wrong places and did not recognize the possibility of asymptomatic spread. Was that the chief, early on? DR. FAUCI: Well, you know, I think that some of what you said is correct. The idea about not recognizing that it was spread in a very efficient way, in an asymptomatic situation, was really a problem. Because what it did- it did not allow a testing of the asymptomatic individuals, which should have been done right from the get go. MARGARET BRENNAN: People were walking through TSA, getting their temperatures, and that meant nothing. DR. FAUCI: Right. Well, I always said that that was meaningless because I've been having my temperature taken and sometimes it's 32, which means I should be dead. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's the theater of public safety rather than the reality of it. DR. FAUCI: Yes, yes. I agree. I agree. I mean, clearly we needed to test people who are asymptomatic. No doubt about that. That would have changed a lot of things. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the flu model being used? Why was it used?\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: You know, I can't explain that. That's not what I do. I'm sorry I have to tell you that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Wasn't as discussed at the- at the COVID task force meetings? DR. FAUCI: No, it was not. It was not. It was just the CDC would do that and that's the way they looked at respiratory diseases. And it took a while to figure out that this is really, really different from flu, in many respects.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hmm. When did you realize that? DR. FAUCI: Well, Debbie Birx and I realize that right, you know, right in the middle of the outbreak. You know, the- 2020, right in the middle of 2020, it was very, very clear. And if you go back over the history of that, we did, I did certainly, said we need to be testing. I remember the words, if you go back on some of the statements I made at some of those White House press conferences, we need to flood the system with testing, is what I would say very often, flood the system with testing. Which means not just somebody who shows up with symptoms. Mm-Hmm. MARGARET BRENNAN: But I mean, we looked back at statements and in February of 2020, very early on there, you were still saying it's certainly a possibility, but it's extraordinarily unlikely that COVID was spreading in the U.S. DR. FAUCI: Right, and that's because we didn't know it at the time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why did you have that blind spot? DR. FAUCI: Well, it wasn't a blind spot because we didn't- we weren't testing. That was the point. What we were seeing is that the flu model is you look at symptomatic disease, ILIs, flu like illnesses, you know, those were the ones, influenza like illnesses. And influenza like illnesses are not noticed unless you get an influenza like symptom. So the model of using a flu model was never able to get applied until it was clear that it should have been not the ILI, but that the asymptomatic model that when you have a disease in which you have 30 to 40% of the people who get infected have never- no symptoms, then you see transmissibility. 50 to 60% of the transmisabilities occur from someone who has no symptoms, who either never will get symptoms or is in the pre-symptomatic phase. That was unprecedented in respiratory illness. So I guess you could say, well, you should have known that. The CDC should have known that. Well, maybe they should have known it after it happened for a bit, but they couldn't have known it from day one. You could not have known that from day one. But it should not have taken so long to figure out that, in fact, we have a substantial amount of transmission that's asymptomatic, which should trigger why you should be testing asymptomatic people. And getting back from things that have been brought up by historians now, because it was a year ago, when that came out of said only testing people with symptoms, Debbie Birx was against that and I was against that. It was very, very clear that we should be testing asymptomatic people. MARGARET BRENNAN: It also brings us to why people should have been wearing masks earlier. They didn't know that they were spreading it. DR. FAUCI: Exactly. And that's the reason why back in January and February, we're saying we're not so sure you really need masks because we didn't realize at the time that there was being asymptomatic spread. That was one of the real reasons. As soon as that became clear, there was no doubt you should be wearing a mask. MARGARET BRENNAN: Matt Pottinger, the former deputy national security adviser, brought that up, and he told us that was one of the most costly mistakes. And he brought it up in the context of- he said he was talking to doctors he knew in Asia who were telling him things that the CDC was saying, you're wrong, that the CDC was telling him he didn't know what he was talking about. Though he was talking to people on the ground who were telling him firsthand, this is how the virus was spreading.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Was the masks the costliest mistake? And where do you rank that the lack of informing the public earlier on to wear them? DR. FAUCI: Well, it was not only the masks. It was not realizing that we had an insidious enemy in the virus that was lurking below the radar screen. And it's not just a question of wearing a mask, which should have been done at the time had we known that. It was the realization that in crowded places, poor ventilation, congregating together. When you have an infection that 50 to 60% of it is transmitted by an asymptomatic person, a lot of things change, not just masks. Masks are clearly one of the big ones. I mean, I get asked that question all the time about why not mask in the beginning. It was not an appreciation. First of all, besides the fact that we didn't realize masks outside of the hospital setting work. We didn't know that. It was said- it was said the data shows it works in the hospital, but we don't know-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Matt Pottinger was saying he was in the White House telling doctors that you need to wear them. Look at what's happened in Asia previously and wearing masks. DR. FAUCI: Right, right. And the fact is, the Asians wear masks is a very important part- long yet- long after COVID leaves us, the Asians are going to be wearing masks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will we be wearing masks? DR. FAUCI: I think we might. I think people are going to realize that one of the things that was noticed, very clearly now, is that when you were wearing a mask, when everybody finally realized it was important to wear a mask, that influenza was sort of off the map. I mean, we didn't have hardly any influenza last winter. The Australians didn't have any influenza. So it was very clear, that something that was not fully appreciated. It was somehow dogma, which it was assumed that masks in a hospital setting work, but there's no evidence that they work outside of the hospital setting. And then when they did better analysis, it became clear that masks do work outside of the hospital setting. There was a feeling that, well, if we wear masks, we're going to take away from the masks that are needed by the people who were in the hospitals. MARGARET BRENNAN: Because there wasn't an adequate stockpile. DR. FAUCI: There wasn't an adequate stockpile. So that's where it was- then not a push for people to wear masks. And then the thing that was the real clincher, for sure, was the realization that you may be standing next to somebody talking to them, they have no symptoms and then they're infecting you right now. This idea, which was getting back to the incorrect flu model, which was clearly originally extrapolated to COVID, now it's clear it is not the right model, is that in a flu season, there's a very, very brief window before you get symptoms that you could transmit it. But you don't have people who go through the entire flu and- and- and- and don't get symptoms. So COVID is very different from flu in many respects. MARGARET BRENNAN: I point some of these specific things out because they don't- they're not political. These were public health mistakes.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's almost scarier. DR. FAUCI: Well, you know, I think to- to defend the CDC, if I could for a moment, is that one can say something is a mistake because, you know now data now that you didn't know then. So technically it really is a mistake. But if you had-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But then- but then if you look at the news reports, I mean, you look at doctors in China, in hospital wards, in hazmat suits. DR. FAUCI: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're talking about putting a mask on your face as being ridiculous at the time. I mean, it just in hindsight, it looks so-- DR. FAUCI: --but--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --obvious, but we were not up to the challenge here in getting ahead with such cutting edge medical care in this country. It's kind of shocking, isn't it? DR. FAUCI: Well, you're right in saying that, but let's get back to the hazmat suit because I'd like to respectfully correct you for a moment.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Is that hazmat suits were used by people who were taking care of sick individuals.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hmm.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: You didn't see too many people in China wearing hazmat suits walking down the street. They were wearing masks-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --No, in hospitals-- DR. FAUCI: --yeah, in hospitals-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --and our doctors didn't have adequate care when they needed it. DR. FAUCI: In the very beginning, we didn't have- It's not that we didn't realize you should wear them. It was that we didn't have enough PPE right in the beginning. MARGARET BRENNAN: But my point was, isn't that a warning--\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: --Yeah. Yeah--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --when you see it? DR. FAUCI: Yeah, like I said when I told you a moment ago. It was the scientific approach, preparedness and response, and the public health preparedness and response. I find it interesting that I'm here responsible for this and trying to defend this. MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I think you're just- you're America's doctor, Dr. Fauci. So everyone looks to you to explain it all. DR. FAUCI: That's true, and I try to explain it to the best of my ability. But there are some things that I can't defend because I'm not responsible for them. Maybe I would have done them differently if I were responsible for them. But if I'm not responsible for them, you want to talk about vaccines. That's what I did. MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to button that up. Why aren't we having a national conversation about what went wrong? I mean, apart from this room right now, why isn't there a 9/11 type commission? DR. FAUCI: Yeah, I think what's going to happen is that you are going to see that for sure, MARGARET. I think the lack of doing that now is because you're focusing on getting this thing under control. I would be astounded if we didn't have a very serious look at what went right, what went wrong, from a public health standpoint, from a local standpoint, from a global standpoint. I don't think that the public should imagine that this is going to go through with already 760,000 Americans dying and 40 plus million at least being infected, close to six million people globally dying. And we're not going to look back at this and tear it apart, examine it, do an autopsy on it and try and figure out. So people should not think that that's not going to happen. It's not happening now because everybody's focusing on getting this thing under control.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you want one?\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Oh, I absolutely want one. MARGARET BRENNAN: And do you think the administration will? Well, when will we see that?\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Yeah. I think once we get it on the much better control, you're going to start seeing a real close examination of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: You- well, in our examination of that, you were quoted as saying it was the worst possible decision for the Trump administration to have left things up to the states.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Yeah.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Where do you rank that? DR. FAUCI: I rank that right there, maybe a little bit below some of the things you are talking about, but way up there. Because my- as a scientist and a public health person, you know, people always ask if you had the magic wand and did things exactly the way you wanted, what it would be? One of them would be if ever, if ever there was a situation where you needed a synergistic uniform, well-thought-out approach is when you're dealing with a common enemy of a virus that is a global pandemic, the likes of which we haven't seen in 100 years, to be able to say if I don't really want to do this because I want, you know, my own opinion of what it's going to be with this state versus this state versus this state. To me, that's one of the antitheses of public health. We know exactly what needs to be done. We know you've got to get vaccinated. How can you possibly have a situation where one state says, I'm sorry and you shouldn't be wearing a mask? In fact, you have executive orders saying you shouldn't be wearing a mask.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Florida.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: You have another state that does not want to get vaccinated because they think it's a political statement to get vaccinated or not. I mean, we've had and I've said it many times, and I'll say for you, the divisiveness in this country to me is the biggest mistake that supersedes everything that we're talking about, supersedes the mask situation, supersedes everything, have a public health catastrophe and you have divisiveness that is pulling away from doing the right thing to get the outbreak under control. I mean, when we look back historically and look back at this and said we had this devastating plague out there that were killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, and we're having public health principles being decided on the basis of political ideology. I mean, when I give my history of it, that's going to be the number one mistake that supersedes all the other things that we're talking about. MARGARET BRENNNAN: Public health is often politicized. I mean, you know that so well, from your experience with AIDS, what was the chief lesson you brought into dealing with COVID from that experience with AIDS? DR. FAUCI: With AIDS? Well, the one thing that- well they were more than one with HIV AIDS is never underestimate infectious disease outbreak because it can be insidious the way AIDS was under the radar screen. And then you find out, you know, 40 years later, it's killed 37\u00a0 million people, 77 million people have gotten infected. You learn also to pay attention to what's going on in the community. And that's the major lesson I learned. I listened to the people and I wanted to find out what it is that was going on with them. How were they getting infected? Why were they getting infected? What was going on with the circumstances? That's how you really get your arms around an outbreak. You don't do it from above and dictate down. You go into the community and you find out maybe some of those lessons about finding out what's going on in the community with infection would have done us a little bit better. MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that happening at all in China when this first appeared going back to the fall of 2019? DR. FAUCI: You know, it was very tough what was going on in China. You know, it's kind of opaque. Clearly there was infection that was percolating, you know, as early as November, maybe even earlier. And then it was the same sort of thing, you know, back then, you had an infection that emerged almost certainly out of an animal reservoir to a- I mean, the bats there all have viruses that when you-\u00a0 the more you study bats there, the more you see how close some of the viruses are to SARS-CoV-2. Clearly, SARS-CoV-1 was a bat to a civet cat to a human. MERS was a bat to a camel to a human. In the beginning, when it first came out, it was, I remember, very, very clearly. It was the very, very end of December, the beginning of January. There was this outbreak in China. Of some unusual cases that was felt to be well, it looks just like SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-1 was one that was not spread very readily from human to human. It was spread almost all by symptomatic people, hence the transmissions that occurred in hospital and doctor's waiting rooms while people were coughing and sneezing. So it was assumed in the beginning, well, this is the coronavirus. We've just sequenced it on January 10th. We know what the sequence is. Why it- isn't it just assumed that it's SARS-CoV-1, which means it doesn't transmit very well and it's going to get controlled by public health measures, which is exactly what happened with SARS-CoV-1. Then you find out that even though it's SARS-CoV-2, it is a very, very different virus than SARS-CoV-1 because A, it is transmitted spectacularly efficiently from person to person-\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? DR. FAUCI: And B, most of it is a- 40 to 50 to 60 percent is asymptomatic. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why is it so efficient? I've heard so many virologists point to that that it was uniquely adapted to be just horrible in a human body. How did it get that efficient? DR. FAUCI: Well, it evolves in animals, it evolves in humans, and it could just, you know, sometimes viruses jump into humans and they take off and run right away. MARGARET BRENNAN: But we don't know what went between the bat and the human. There was something in between? DR. FAUCI: It was very likely in a host- what the Chinese did, I don't have firsthand knowledge of that, but the people who were reporting it, who investigated what they did is they cleaned out the markets as soon as it turned out that it was clear that there were clusters coming from the market. Which, you know, in typical fashion, I think trying to make sure that things don't get pointed to them, they probably got rid of the animals that were the intermediary hosts there. And that's the reason why it's very important to continue to get the cooperation of the Chinese in allowing surveillance of the animals that ultimately go into the wet markets, the civet cats, the raccoon dogs and all those other things that clearly the- this virus is a very promiscuous virus in the sense that it can infect animals. Animals can infect humans. There are animals out there, big cats, there are animals in the environment that are getting infected with SARS-CoV-2. It's a very highly infective- as long as you have that receptor for the virus, it'll infect you. So that's what makes it- its capability of binding so well to the receptors in the body. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Beijing acknowledges now that they don't think it originated in that market. DR. FAUCI: Well, it may not have originated in the market, but it certainly could have, I mean, I don't think that they admitted that it didn't originate in the market. I think they're saying they don't know how it originated. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there were clusters that may have been picked up and transmitted,-- DR, FAUCI: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --as I understand it, through the market,-- DR. FAUCI: Yeah.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --the place of origin was not within the market itself. DR. FAUCI: I don't think you could say that. I don't think you can say that. I think you could say we don't know how and where it originated. There were wet markets in Wuhan that are ample opportunity for a virus to jump from an animal that gets brought in from all parts of China that are very closely related physically to bat enclaves in caves and come to the market. So I don't think anyone can say that it didn't come from here or it did come from here. MARGARET BRENNAN: So it was the end of 2019 when the World Health Organization was first alerted about the strange pneumonia. Doctors, as you just said, had been tracking back to the fall, possibly as early as October. When was the first time that you heard that there was something, some strange pneumonia? DR. FAUCI: I think it was the very last day it may have been Dec 31 or the 30th or 1st of Jan. MARGARET BRENNAN: When they informed the World Health Organization? DR. FAUCI: Yeah, I mean, I got- I got a call from Bob Redfield who said, you know, I just heard from colleagues in China that there's an unusual pneumonia among people that has been detected. So we just got to stay heads up for that. And then a few days later, I think it was Jan 9th, or 10th the sequence came out. I got- as soon as I heard there was a new pneumonia, I said, well, a new pneumonia, Wuhan, wet market almost certainly it's going to be a coronavirus. We all thought it would be similar to SARS-CoV-1, and that's when I got my team organized immediately and said as soon as we get that sequence of what it is, let's go after that vaccine, let's plug it into MRNA. We were already collaborating with Moderna with MRNA and let's do it. And it was rocket speed. I mean, we found out on the 10th of January of what the sequence was. About five or six days later we were starting with the vaccine development with Moderna. Sixty-five days later, we did a phase one trial, and multiple months later, we knew we had a safe and effective vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: And- and that's incredible speed that you were already there, but it was despite the lack of information being shared. You you mentioned SARS,-- DR. FAUCI: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: the first version of it, you had experienced-- DR. FAUCI: The only- the only- MARGARET BRENNAN: --Go ahead.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Again, I'm going to get back to what- what I do and my job was to develop a vaccine. So the only information I needed was the sequence of the virus. And when we got that information, I put my team to work to make a vaccine, which was made in unprecedented record time to be a safe and highly effective vaccine. The antigen that's used, the immunogen that is used in virtually all the vaccines, regardless of what the platform is, was developed at the Vaccine Research Center by my scientist in the institute. So that's all I needed was the sequence. I mean, the public health part was handled by the CDC. I just needed the sequence of the virus to make the vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the live- live virus samples wouldn't have had a-\u00a0 it made a difference for you. DR. FAUCI: I didn't need it at all. I just needed the sequence to get a vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you knew doctors in China and the head of their CDC as all of this is going on. Bob Redfield, the former head of the CDC, said- and you know the story well. He was called by his Chinese counterpart weeping in January saying this is out of control. DR. FAUCI: Right?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: He maintains, Dr. Redfield, that their CDC was kept in the dark. You know, these doctors, I mean, is that what happened? How did this get so far ahead of the medical community? DR. FAUCI: I can't- I can't comment because I don't know. Margaret, what went on in China, except that the scientists that I know were communicating with us to the point that we- we have a real problem here. This is bad. We're seeing people getting infected and they're getting really, really very sick. And it's not like flu and it's not like anything else we've seen. That's- that's what we got. I mean, that was the information we got. And then when the Chinese started building, within days, these massive hospital complexes, then it became clear that this is a real problem. MARGARET BRENNAN: When did the alarm bells go off for you? DR. FAUCI: Well, they were gradual, it wasn't like one big aha, or alarm bells. It was just a gradual rolling out of new information that every time new information came in, it didn't make matters better. It made matters worse. So for me, my job being to get the vaccine, while we were working on the vaccine, I wasn't sure whether it would be a vaccine that we would never even need or be a vaccine that would be lifesaving for millions the way it turned out to be. So what happened? The evolution and the rolling out of the information. First, It's a coronavirus - good. Is it like SARS-CoV-1? Maybe, maybe not. A week or two later, wait a minute it is transmitted from person to person. It isn't just animal to human. A week later, not only is that person to person, it's pretty efficiently from person to person. Two-three weeks later, you know, there is some transmissibility that's from people without symptoms. And then a month or two later, well, not only is it transmissible without symptoms, but half of the transmissions are from people who don't have symptoms. And that was a period from literally day one into several months into it. And by the time we got months into it, New York was getting hit badly. It was clear, wait a minute, we don't- we didn't know back then what we know now, but every time we get new information, it gets worse and worse and worse. That's how things evolve with the pandemic. You don't know from day one exactly what's going to happen on month six until things evolve, because we've never had that situation or that experience before. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to read you something you said back in 2019 when somebody asked you what keeps you up at night? You said, \"the thing I'm most concerned about is the emergence of a new virus, the body doesn't have any background experience with very transmissible, highly transmissible person to person, high degree of morbidity and mortality. The thing that worries most of us in the field of public health is a respiratory illness that can spread even before someone is so sick that you want to keep them in bed.\" DR. FAUCI: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: You were describing COVID. DR. FAUCI: I was. My- my worst nightmare that I've been asked about multiple times over the last 37 years that I've been directing the institute has come true. And I've- that statement that you read, I must have said that 50 to 100 times to people in the media, people in the scientific community. When they ask me, what do you really worry about? I've said that- in fact, I said that to multiple presidents along the way, going way way back. I've said it to Reagan. I've said that to George H.W. Bush, to George W. Bush, to Clinton, to Obama. I've said it to everyone. My worst nightmare is something that you've just described, and unfortunately, it's happened. MARGARET BRENNAN: How many times have you thought of that in the past two years? I've- I've warned about this. DR. FAUCI: Yeah. I mean, I think about it every day, really. MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, it's an incredible description of where we are. How do you grade America's response to your nightmare scenario?\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Yeah, I grade- as I said, I look at a response as a person who is fundamentally a scientist and a physician and a public health person, indirectly that what I do is I look at preparedness and response in two pillars. One is scientific, and one is public health. I grade scientific, A+. I grade public health. C, B+, B-, C somewhere between B and C. It certainly is not A. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that there are lessons learned from this that improve the scenario, or are we in a place as a country where we're just not ready to fix ourselves? DR. FAUCI: Well, we better fix ourselves because going back to what I said, Thirty seven years ago, thirty years ago, twenty years ago, ten years ago, it's going to happen again. We're going to get another pandemic. It might be a blip on the radar screen, a new emergence that doesn't go anywhere or it might be something that explodes like this. But if you look at the history of mankind, we've had plagues before the ability to document them by scientific methods like identifying the agent like a thousand years ago, 2000 years ago. Then we've had outbreaks that have devastated us during times when history could record it, and then we've had outbreaks that have occurred when you could actually document what it is. Now, why do we think in our naivety that this is not going to happen sometime in the future? So I would think it would really be a shame on us if we don't take these lessons that we've painfully learned and make sure that they are lessons that have been learned and not just forgotten and put aside. That's the thing that I hope for. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sometimes, though, it seems the public thinks that the election changed everything. But what you're describing are some deep institutional problems and things that we really need to have addressed still. DR. FAUCI: Yeah. Yes, I mean administrations come, administrations go they- they vary in their response. I think right now, currently, the attention that's being paid to this, the effort that's put it in to get vaccines distributed. I think this is a good response that's happening right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think there need to be tougher regulations for- for labs that deal with contagious- highly contagious viruses? DR. FAUCI: Well, we did that years ago, we put a three year pause in any of the experiments that would be involving anything that would be dangerous and examined it very carefully, not we, the NIH or the CDC, but outside bodies like the National Academy of Science, the NSABB, multiple workshops to come up with a framework that would guide the kind of work that should be done, the conditions under which should be done, the kinds of things that should not be done. I don't think the public fully realizes that. They hear these words that mean nothing to them, like gain of function. What the heck does that mean? But what they think- People should realize that we are always open in the scientific community to re-examine what we do and how we do it-- MARGARET BRENNAN: And gain- gain of function for people listening is trying to give a virus new, improved abilities. DR. FAUCI: Right, and- and sometimes it's for a very- not sometimes you always do it and examine it because much of the science that gets done is by modifying things, modifying cells, modifying viruses to be able to study them well enough to prepare you for what will ultimately come. And there are very strict guardrails about that that I don't think the general public fully appreciates. When you have people that can make outlandish statements about things that are just not true. MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a political football, right? DR. FAUCI: Oh, it is a total political football, total. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you take the fire specifically for this. DR. FAUCI: I do. I do, all the time.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a congressional act with your name on it, literally. DR. FAUCI: Yes, exactly. And it's just a lot of- well, anyway, MARGARET BRENNAN: Finish the thought. DR. FAUCI: No- no. There's a lot of politicization of that. And I think there's a lot of misinformation, disinformation and outright lies about that. And that's really unfortunate. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're angry about it. DR. FAUCI: Well, you know, my concern that I keep saying is that my job is to do what I can as a scientist to preserve and protect the health of the American public and indirectly, in many respects, the health of the world because our country is a leader in science. A leader in health. A leader in the kinds of things- Where did these vaccines come from that are saving millions of people? They came from us. That's my job. The politicization of it is really unfortunate because as I've said, I've stayed away from politics my entire life. I am somebody who only cares about science and health, and it is- you're right, it's painful and disturbing to see when you're trying to focus all of your attention on doing what you can do the way we did to create the vaccines, to develop the drugs, to save millions of lives. And then you have this completely outlandish politicization of it. Politicization of everything. Politicization of the public health, politicization of the origins, politicization of all of it is really- I think when we look back at this, we're going to see what were we thinking, what was going on back then? MARGARET BRENNAN: The- two Washington Post\u00a0reporters said that back in July of 2020, you had been speaking to your wife about resigning. DR. FAUCI: I never spoke to my wife, ever about resigning. They got that wrong. I never even considered for a moment of resigning. MARGARET BRENNAN: Never considered it for a moment? DR. FAUCI: Not even for a second. MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Birx told us she thought about it almost daily, ultimately didn't but- DR. FAUCI: Dr. Birx is Dr. Birx and Tony Fauci is Tony Fauci. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you feel so strongly about that, about staying on the job when you become, I mean, you were personally not just rhetorically threatened, your security, your safety, your family? How did you deal with that? DR. FAUCI: I dealt with it by focusing on what my job is from the time that I went into medicine to right now, where I am at my age, my job has been totally focused on doing what I can with the talents and the influence I had to make scientific advances to protect the health of the American public. So anybody who spins lies and threatens and all that theater that goes on with some of the investigations and the congressional committees and the Rand Paul's and all that other nonsense, that's noise, MARGARET, that's noise. I know what my job is. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cruz told the attorney general you should be prosecuted.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Yeah. I have to laugh at that. I should be prosecuted? What happened on Jan. 6, senator? MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that this is about making you a scapegoat to deflect-- DR. FAUCI: Of course- MARGARET BRENNAN: --From President Trump? DR. FAUCI: Of course, you have to be asleep not to figure that one out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are a lot of Republican senators taking aim at this. I mean-- DR. FAUCI: That's OK, I'm just going to do my job and I'm going to be saving lives and they're going to be lying. MARGARET BRENNAN: It just, it seems, another layer of danger to play politics around matters of life and death. DR. FAUCI: Right, exactly. Exactly. And to me, that's- that's unbelievably bad because all I want to do is save people's lives. That's what I have done for the last 50 years, 40 of which was 37 of which was leading the institute. And when I see people who scattered around misinformation and lies that can actually endanger the lives of people, but also it is very easy to pick out an individual and make them a target because that's what people can focus on. But you're talking about systems, you're talking about the CDC, you're talking about the FDA, you're talking about science in general. So if they want to- I mean, anybody who's looking at this carefully realizes that there's a distinct anti-science flavor to this. So if they get up and criticize science, nobody's going to know what they're talking about. But if they get up and really aim their bullets at Tony Fauci, well, people could recognize there's a person there. There's a face, there's a voice you can recognize, you see him on television. So it's easy to criticize, but they're really criticizing science because I represent science. That's dangerous. To me, that's more dangerous than the slings and the arrows that get thrown at me. I'm not going to be around here forever, but science is going to be here forever. And if you damage science, you are doing something very detrimental to society long after I leave. And that's what I worry about. MARGARET BRENNAN: And in real world terms, what does that mean? Does that mean you fear vaccination rates go down? Does that mean the next national emergency people just don't listen to the doctors. What- what do you mean? DR. FAUCI: Yeah, what I'm concerned about is that if you put science aside and if you discredit science, you start to discredit the truth of what it takes to get people their health preserved, prevent disease, treat disease. When you do that, you are going to really disrupt society in very many respects, and that's what I worry about. I mean, anybody who looks at what's going on in the United States to say there's not a lot of- lies become normalized now, and the social media amplifies the normalisation of lies. So scientists try to say this is the truth, and it's based on data. That's what we live by, data, evidence, truth. And then you all of a sudden have permeating in society, it is OK to say anything you want that is patently, obviously wrong. And if you say it long enough and often enough and you get social media involved, then everybody- not everybody, X percent of the population starts believing it. See, that's what I worry about more than people throwing slings and arrows at me because my whole life has been as a scientist and I identify with the field of health and science. And if you're attacking me, you're really attacking science. I mean, everybody knows that. MARGARET BRENNAN: You told my colleague Ted Koppel that you would not retire until you get COVID in the rearview mirror?\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: That is correct.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that look like? What does rear view mirror look like? DR. FAUCI: Rearview mirror looks like when you and I are talking some time on an interview whenever, and we're talking about something else and that COVID is not dominating the economy, the- the mental framework of our society. Dominating our fear of being safe for ourselves and our children. That's what it means in the rear view mirror. Not that we've accepted something that's still terrible, but that it's so low that we can start thinking about other things that are much more important. MARGARET BRENNAN: We've been through a national trauma as a country. DR. FAUCI: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: How have you processed what you personally have been through, for the past almost two years? DR. FAUCI: You know, it hasn't been easy I- you know with- the things that I really don't like a lot is the fact that not only me, but my colleagues, when you say something like you need to get vaccinated, to protect yourself, your family and to- and to really fulfill your societal responsibility to keep the community safe. And for that, I get death threats. And for that, I get my family, my wife and my three daughters harassed. That makes me say society has really got a problem. So I've- I've never been someone who is ego-centric, I don't think about what effect it has on me. You know, I worry about what effect it is having on our democracy and our society, that's what I worry about much more. I'm going to be fine, you know, I'm going to be fine. I joke around with people who know me. I grew up in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn. I'm going to be fine. I don't worry about people who throw these lies around. I worry about what impact it's going to have on society. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think the country doesn't know how to process this right now. You look at overdose deaths, you look at, you know, drinking, you look at all the like, all the things that our country has suffered through this pandemic. Is there a playbook that you are handing over to the next person right behind you at the NIH when that retirement day does come? DR. FAUCI: Yeah, the playbook for them is to do what I'm doing now, no matter what nonsense, politicization and everything throws at you. Focus on what your goal is and your goal is to end an outbreak by what you have at your disposal. And what we have at our disposal is science, which has led to a highly effective vaccine and soon to be a number of highly effective drugs. And just phase out everything else. If you get caught up in this nonsense of politicization, you're not going to be able to do your job as well. So that's the reason why when all of these things come in, when they pass a law with my name on it, when Joe Schmo says I should retire, I should go to jail. I look at that and I go, forget that. I know what my job is. MARGARET BRENNAN: For you and your family, I know you've said your daughter's worried about exposing you. You didn't gather with them last year around holidays. This year going into the holidays, how do you advise people? What do they do to safely gather with their family? And are you gathering with your family? DR. FAUCI Yes, I am. I mean, not for Thanksgiving, only for logistic purposes. My daughters are in three separate cities, triangulated throughout the country and they have jobs and to fly all the way in just for a day. But we're all getting together for Christmas, for sure. The whole family, including the dogs. MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's- how do you do that safely? DR. FAUCI: You get vaccinated and you get boosted getting back to the beginning of a conversation, you get vaccinated. You surround yourself with vaccinated people and you get boosted. And when you're in a congregate setting outside of the family setting, you wear a mask because you're not sure what the status of these people are. So I am going to be in my home, with my wife, with my daughters and with their partners, and we're going to be sitting around maskless, enjoying a Christmas and Christmas Eve. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you- do you test going into the gathering and on the way back out? What should people do?\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: Well, it depends. I think- I mean, my daughters are very careful because of my age. You know, I'm not exactly the youngest person around here and they're concerned about me, even though I'm vaccinated. So what they generally do and I think they'll do this is even though they're vaccinated and boosted with they will likely do is to get tested 48 hours, 24 hours before they come home because they're going to have to make a trip to fly, be in an airport, get on a plane and just to make doubly sure they're going to get one of those home test and test. MARGARET BRENNAN: And on the way back, they'll do the same? DR. FAUCI: I would think so, yeah. And that's the reason why, getting back to what I said during 2020, when I said we need to flood the system with testing, I've said that more than once. MARGARET BRENNAN: And are we there yet because you hear frequently-- DR. FAUCI: No, we're doing- we're getting there, no- MARGARET BRENNAN: The at home tests are even hard to find. DR. FAUCI: Now give credit to President Biden where we can. He's invested billions of dollars to get as low as 200 million tests a month and as high as a half a billion tests a month. So the Fauci plea to flood the system with testing is going to happen for sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you feel traumatized by the past two years?\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: No, no. I really am very moved by people who are concerned about me, well-meaning people. Maybe even yourself, sincerely concerned about me. But when you focus on what your job is and your job is to save people's lives, you don't have any time to get traumatized. I mean, I don't- I just don't have any time to be thinking about traumatizing. I work- I haven't had a day off in 20 months, and it doesn't bother me because we're doing things that are saving lives. That's really important. That's why I went to medical school and 50 years later, I'm doing it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you- in this playbook, you're handing off to your future successor, do you say the next pandemic comes out as faster? It comes more frequently. I've had World Health Organization scientists say because of things like environmental changes, we're going to have more of these coming at us faster. DR. FAUCI: You know, I think we likely will, though you can't predict, you know, I've been through multiple, multiple emergencies of diseases. Some have been one off trivial, doesn't mean anything. And you know, there- but for the grace of God, a little change in a mutation could have made it do something a little bit differently. But I think the- the idea of the human animal interface is something that we've really got to address that. You know, that's the reason why I get back to the fact of these wet markets that bring in animals that are next to bats, in caves, in wherever, who knows, all in Southeast Asia, in China. MARGARET BRENNAN: You want more regulation of those internationally? DR. FAUCI: I want that to be regulated. I really, really do. And we know the Chinese were trying to regulate that. But there were people who were breaking the law and there was good documentation from people who photographed that- that animals that were not supposed to be brought in from the wild into the wet markets were there. They were breaking the law. And I think that's the reason why when this happened, I don't know, but I think why the Chinese just completely cleaned it out. We're not supposed to be doing that. I think that is one of the reasons why we're not able to find out what the original source was. I think they've destroyed some of the evidence. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when the PLA, when the Chinese army comes in, they're the first line of control versus the Chinese CDC. You don't think that's about intentionally covering things up, you're painting a scenario there where it's just trying to clean up the mess as quick as possible. DR. FAUCI: Yeah, the experience with China is even when they have nothing to hide, they're acting suspicious. No, it is. That's the truth. I mean, that is the truth. They're very, very much that they just don't- whenever there's an outbreak, they just want to be able to say it's nothing to do. And even when they've done nothing wrong, they act suspicious. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Dr. Fauci, I know we've taken a lot of your time. Thank you for making it.\u00a0 DR. FAUCI: My pleasure.\u00a0",

Rusten warns that experts aren't focused on the existential threat of nuclear weapons, weighs in on current nuclear treaties and argues that beginning to repair alliances would be a good place to start.\u00a0 Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. \"Intelligence Matters\" transcript: Lynn Rusten Producer: Paulina Smolinski MICHAEL MORELL: Let's start with a background on you and on the Nuclear Threat Initiative. How did you get interested in nuclear nonproliferation and how did you end up spending a good bit of your life devoted to it? LYNN RUSTEN: It started in college, I went to Oberlin College and came under the tutelage of a man named George Allen who taught Soviet foreign policy. I got really interested in Soviet politics and foreign policy and went to graduate school in that in the early 80s. When it was time to look for a job, the jobs were basically either in the intelligence community, in the defense community, or in a specialized field of arms control. I fell into that out of a combination of both interest and luck. MICHAEL MORELL: What drew you to it? LYNN RUSTEN: It was partly that I was interested in the idea. I remember this was in the early 80s when the nuclear freeze movement was active. There was a lot of concern that there could be nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. So doing something about that appealed to me. I was hired at a Common Cause, a public interest group, which in those days also was interested in advocacy around nuclear issues. I helped write a primer on nuclear arms control, which was interesting for me since I didn't know that much about it, I had to research various chapters and then figure out how to explain it to people who were at the same starting point where I was. Then I went on to the Congressional Research Service at the Library of Congress, where I researched and wrote on these issues for Congress. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0 Did you did you ever work with George Tenet who did arms control for the Senate Intelligence Committee for years?\u00a0 LYNN RUSTEN:\u00a0 I did not. I did work for Mark Lowenthal. I worked with him at the at the Library of Congress before he then went onto the House Intelligence Committee. MICHAEL MORELL: For the listeners who don't know. Mark is a is a longtime expert in intelligence analysis. He's probably a listener on our show. LYNN RUSTEN: And a Jeopardy winner. MICHAEL MORELL: That's right. Then the Nuclear Threat Initiative. Tell us about the organization.\u00a0 LYNN RUSTEN: The Nuclear Threat Initiative is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to reducing the risks of nuclear and other catastrophic weapons of mass destruction. And disruption, we like to say, which also refers to cyber. It was started around the year 2000 or 2001 by former Senator Sam Nunn and Ted Turner, who are its founding co-chairs. Senator Nunn was the CEO.\u00a0 Now former Secretary of Energy, Ernest Moniz is the CEO and co-chair, along with Senator Nunn and Ted Turner. MICHAEL MORELL: What are the kind of things that you guys do to try to meet your mission? LYNN RUSTEN: We try to achieve systemic change to address these risks through research, analysis, convening, collaborating with international partners as well as domestic partners in government and outside of government to reduce the risk of nuclear use, to reduce the threat of proliferation. Other parts of the organization deal with the risks of radiological material. We have a very large global health security program, which is very focused on preventing pandemics, as the one we are in right now.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Do you get you get all your money from private sources or does some of it come from public sources as well? LYNN RUSTEN: NTI does not accept any money from the US government to preserve our independence. We do get a lot of funding from private sources, some of the large foundations and some individual donors. We do take money for specific projects from some foreign government. For instance, the government of Norway is funding a particular nonproliferation project that I'm involved in right now. MICHAEL MORELL: From the 50,000-foot level, how would you characterize the threat that the world faces today from nuclear weapons? In 2019 that The Economist had a cover story about this, A Complacent World is Playing with Armageddon. How do you think about where the threat is and how it's evolved? LYNN RUSTEN: Exactly. Senator Nunn and Secretary Moniz co-authored an article with a similar theme that was in Foreign Affairs last August as well basically saying that we are closer to the potential use of a nuclear weapon than we've been since the Cold War. Part of that is because the relations between the nuclear powers, between us and Russia, us and China, are declining and the risk of conflict is growing. At the same time, there's an unprecedented complacency about this. People just aren't focused, including leaders, sufficiently on the risks of these weapons and the risk of miscalculation, the risk that new technologies like cyber can introduce that could lead to blundering into the use of a nuclear weapon in a war that no one would want. MICHAEL MORELL: Why do you think people are complacent about it? LYNN RUSTEN: We spoke earlier about the Cold War, when people were really worried about the use of war between the United States and the Soviet Union. It wasn't that long ago when people were still doing these duck and cover drills under their desks. No one thinks this is going to happen now. Just like no one thought, we'd all be working from home for a year, wearing masks because of a pandemic. It's really dangerous to not see the growing risks and address them. So we're not wondering why we didn't do something earlier. MICHAEL MORELL: Let me ask you about some specific countries here. Your thinking on them, your concerns about them, and what we need to do as a government. Let's start with Russia, a country that can destroy us with nuclear weapons in a matter of minutes, in a country where we've had a long history of arms control agreements. Where are we now and how do we get to a better place? LYNN RUSTEN: The trends that I've been talking about in terms of the deterioration of relations between nuclear powers and the rising risks, they've been happening for a long time. I have to say that the policies during the Trump administration have been an accelerant to these bad trends. Between the United States and Russia, we have still over 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons. There's between thirteen thousand and fourteen thousand nuclear weapons in the world. Most of them are owned by the United States and Russia. We have a unique responsibility to manage those weapons, to lead the world in terms of nonproliferation and to make sure that they're not used. What's happened is all of the architecture of arms control that's really existed since the Cold War to regulate and reduce these weapons has become dismantled, both because of actions that Russia has undertaken, but also because of actions and decisions the current administration has taken. We're now at the point where the only remaining treaty that's regulating and limiting U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons is the new START treaty. That treaty will expire on February 5th, a mere 16 days after Inauguration Day, unless President Biden and President Putin take the steps they would need to take to extend it. MICHAEL MORELL: Do you think that's going to happen or are you concerned that it's not or are you thinking about that? LYNN RUSTEN: I think it will happen. First of all, let me just say why it's so important, the treaty is so important. Not only does it limit the number of deployed US and Russian strategic nuclear weapons, but it provides incredible verification, including 18 onsite inspections every year, thousands of notifications that go back and forth constantly about the location and movement of these systems. It really gives each side tremendous insight into what the other side is doing. It allows you to plan to not do worst case planning, and it tamps down an arms race. President elect Biden has said that he would extend the new START treaty. President Putin has said that they want to extend the treaty. I think it will happen. It's demanding, for any incoming administration to do anything consequential in the first 16 days when much of your personnel are not yet in place. But I think it's really on their radar and I'm confident they'll get it done. MICHAEL MORELL: Will that require congressional approval extension? LYNN RUSTEN: It does not. The original treaty has a clause in it that says it can, by mutual agreement, be extended for five years. There's just a requirement to consult Congress or inform the Senate before you do it. On the Russian side apparently, it requires action by their parliament and they've said that'll take about forty five days and therefore it will require a legal mechanism called provisional application to actually get it done, because our countries will have to agree to do it before February 5th and then provisionally apply it until Russia completes its parliamentary procedures. MICHAEL MORELL: So you think Putin sees it in his interest to get this done as well? LYNN RUSTEN: I do. There's no reason that the Biden administration should have been jammed on this. We've known since the treaty was negotiated that it had this clause. The clock has been ticking. The Russians have made clear they wanted to extend. Over the last 18 months, they made some key concessions. They had some other conditions they wanted to attach. They dropped them. They made it clear that two of their new systems, ICBM and Hypersonic which were concerning. They've made clear that they will count under the treaty. So they've basically said we're ready to do it, and we're making it fairly easy. The Trump administration just frankly, wasted a lot of time for us trying to figure out whether it would even extend the treaty and then just in the last couple of months decided that it would extend the treaty if Russia agreed to a whole lot of other things. That negotiation has not yielded results. Now we're in a position where the Biden administration will have 16 days to get this done. MICHAEL MORELL: What about the INF treaty? How do you think about its importance?\u00a0 LYNN RUSTEN: That's a more complicated case. The IMF treaty was signed between President Reagan and Soviet President Gorbachev. It banned an entire class of weapons, intermediate range ballistic and cruise missiles that were land based, globally deployed. That meant for us in Europe, but for the Russians everywhere because they had them in Asia as well. This was signed in 1987. Unfortunately, when I was in government at the National Security Council, we came to the conclusion that the Russians were violating that treaty, that they had developed and deployed missiles in this class. We went through a long period of trying to resolve this diplomatically with Russia without success. They never conceded the violation and came up with a bunch of response measures. Ultimately, the Trump administration withdrew from the treaty. You can argue whether or not that was the right response or not, but that was what precipitated it. The treaty is gone now. It's dead. I mean, it can't be revived without going through another ratification process. The Russians have made an offer of a moratorium of this class of missiles in Europe. They have recently said, without conceding that the missile that the United States thinks is a violation, have said that under their moratorium proposal, they would remove that missile from the west of the Urals. That's an interesting proposal that would merit further exploration, further consideration. The United States would have to consult with its allies in Europe. I think if we could prevent a proliferation and a rearmament of missiles in this class, it would be a very good thing. MICHAEL MORELL: We can shift to talk about North Korea and Iran here a little bit. At present, there are not effective limitations on either of those two countries' programs. What was your view on the nuclear deal with Iran? LYNN RUSTEN: I think the nuclear deal with Iran was a groundbreaking achievement that enhanced the security of Americans and indeed the world by putting in place strict provisions that would keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. They don't have nuclear weapons yet, which is different from the North Korea case.\u00a0 But they have the capacity to produce materials to create a weapon. The Iran deal put really strict restrictions around that with incredible verification by the IAEA. That agreement is now hanging from a head because the United States withdrew, the other parties are European. The E.U., UK, France, Germany, China, and Russia are still parties. The question is whether and how to reenter that agreement under a Biden administration. MICHAEL MORELL: What's your assessment of the critique of the deal, do you think it was all based on substance, or do you think there were politics involved?\u00a0 LYNN RUSTEN: There is an ideological strand of thinking in our country and in the Congress that has some antipathy towards arms control deals in general. There is a suspicion of them, that feels that on balance, we're better off being an unconstrained ourselves. This is different\u00a0 than a deal with Russia, where it's reciprocal. The idea that we shouldn't be giving things up to get constraints on other countries, that we're just better off with a total freedom of action ourselves. On the Iran deal, which again is not like standard arms control deals with Russia, I think there was a lot of concern about what's not in the deal, the things that it didn't address, like their ballistic missile programs, their other disruptive behavior in the region. That was one concern and there were also concerns about the duration of some of the limits, but I just want to say it's very common for critics of arms control deals, including the new START, to criticize what it doesn't do. But they never look at the real world choice of the agreement we have versus not having it. They compare the agreement we got with the mythical agreement people would want that did everything we wanted and gave no concessions to the other party. That's not how you reach agreements or have sustainable agreements. MICHAEL MORELL: How do we get back into the deal with the Iranians and how hard do you expect that to be given a significant political change in Tehran? LYNN RUSTEN: I think it's going to be difficult to unwind all the sanctions on our part. What they've done is because the US withdrew, they've backed off and stopped implementing some of their commitments under the deal. But to date, they've still let the IAEA continue verifying, which is very important. So it will be possible to get them to assume the constraints they had assumed initially. And for the United States to work very closely with its other treaty partners in this to try to get back. I think that's a starting point to then building on that to extend the limits and address some other issues. MICHAEL MORELL: And the Iranians have a presidential election next year as well which is a complicating factor. On North Korea, I don't know how many presidents have tried to deal with this issue of North Korea actually having nuclear weapons as opposed to Iran, as you pointed out, which is just developing the capability to do so. Do you see any possible path to a deal with North Korea that would either eliminate their nuclear weapons program or cap it in a significant way? LYNN RUSTEN: We certainly have to get back to trying to achieve that outcome. There's not a single area in terms of nuclear arms control and nonproliferation policy that isn't in worse shape now than it was at the beginning of the Trump administration. Certainly, the North Korea case is exhibit A. North Korea has more fissile material now than it did and undoubtedly more nuclear weapons now than it did four years ago. I think President Trump's willingness to pursue diplomacy with the North Korean leader which although unorthodox, was fine to try, but the problem was it wasn't backed up with any serious plan going into it or any serious follow through coming out of it in terms of organizing a sustained, serious negotiation. It was all photo-op diplomacy with no follow through. We're now in a situation where that collapsed, and the threat is growing. Our alliances are badly strained with allies in Asia, not to mention in Europe. We're going to have to start from the ground up. Our relationship with China is also very strained and complicated. China is a key factor in reaching an agreement with North Korea on freezing and hopefully ultimately eliminating its nuclear capability. MICHAEL MORELL:\u00a0 To what extent is China the elephant in the room here? Is there anything we can realistically do about China's nuclear program and the impact that's having on how we think about other issues in this area? LYNN RUSTEN: China's really important and addressing its nuclear capabilities in the Asia-Pacific is important. But it isn't as big an elephant in the room as the Trump administration made it out to be. The United States and Russia each have more than 4000 nuclear weapons. Russia has more than that. China has two to three hundred. When the Trump administration tried to condition the extension of the new START treaty with Russia on China joining either that agreement or a future agreement in a trilateral arrangement, it was just completely unrealistic, a poison pill. It only had the effect of ensuring that we didn't get to a new START extension under the Trump administration and got us no closer to a serious dialogue with China on nuclear risk reduction and strategic stability, which we need to have. I think that has to happen more slowly. We're not going to immediately jump into a nuclear arms control negotiation with China. I think the United States really needs to do more homework in terms of what we actually want and what are we prepared to give to get it when our forces and interests are so asymmetrical.\u00a0 There is what's called a P5 dialogue. That's the recognized nuclear powers, United States, Russia, China, U.K. and France, who have a special responsibility under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to work towards disarmament. We have a review conference for that treaty coming up. It's been postponed to the summer of 2021 because of covid. The world is really looking toward the P5 to show commitment toward reducing nuclear weapons and their reliance on them. It's an important moment for the Biden administration to show global leadership. For the US and Russia to not just extend the new START but to build on that agenda, to do more. For the P5 to continue talking about the circumstances under which they could join in a negotiation as well as taking immediate steps. Bilaterally, there needs to be an intensification of dialogue in military channels and diplomatic channels to talk about strategic stability and nuclear risk reduction, both with Russia and with China separately. MICHAEL MORELL: Do you think we would have an open door in both places if we knocked on it? LYNN RUSTEN: I think the door is very open with Russia. Partly because we have an established history and pattern over 50 years of talking about this stuff. I think with China it's a little bit of an open door. The P5 dialogue context is already established, and I think the issue is making it more productive. In bilateral, this is a piece of a broader set of dialogues that need to go on. They're certainly sending signals. My read is that they would like to be in not as a confrontational situation as far as the United States and China appear right now. But they never like to talk about nuclear things. They're very focused on secrecy, whereas we think of transparency as being stabilizing. It's a process, but it's necessary. MICHAEL MORELL: The U.S. leadership is critical here to getting things done, to furthering the mission that your organization stands for. How do you think about the health of the U.S. government's capabilities to negotiate and to verify agreements going forward? LYNN RUSTEN: There's a couple of elements. It's important to have a functioning national security, interagency process. I worked in the executive branch under 4 administrations 2 Republican and 2 Democrat. In my experience, there's been a functioning national security decision making process led by the NSC, where options are developed and considered and raised for decision at the highest levels. Then there's a coordinated government approach to implementing them. That has completely broken down in the current administration. I think that capacity is still there, although at some agencies the morale is really bad. For instance, at the State Department. A lot of the most capable people have left or been forced out. We need to reconstitute and refresh the talent in agencies, but also the mechanisms of government. I'm really excited about the team that President-elect Biden is bringing in because they're seasoned national security professionals who know how to do this work both within the government and then negotiating with the other. There's two other really critical elements. We've really got to have more cohesion between the executive branch and the Congress on national security and foreign policy. We need to repair our alliances in Europe and in Asia as a foundation. We need to do that. As we pursue security policies and arms control with countries like Russia and China, you need to do it in coordination with and in consultation with allies whose security is directly at stake. MICHAEL MORELL: What worries you the most when you think about the threat from nuclear weapons?\u00a0 LYNN RUSTEN: I think it's the finite capacity of human beings and policymakers to understand and manage the consequences of advances and in technologies. For example, the idea of nuclear deterrence and avoiding a war, it all rests on the idea that technology is infallible. Information's accurate. Humans don't make mistakes. None of that is true. So you worry at what point will there be a breakdown with a catastrophic consequence? When you introduce something like cyber, which can come not only from an adversary, but it could be from a third party. We have as much interest in the Russian nuclear command and control system working properly and not being messed with as we do our own because we're on the other end of their mistake. That's what I really worry about, is the capacity of policy makers to understand and mitigate the risks of technologies as well as capturing its many benefits. MICHAEL MORELL: If you had a few minutes with President Biden, , what's the one key point you would want to get across to him about this issue that you've worked on your entire professional life? LYNN RUSTEN: Of course, he has too. He knows a lot about this. But nonetheless, I'd say, 'you're inheriting an incredible mess, you've got covid, you've got an economy and in duress, you've got domestic issues that we need to address, social justice. In addition, nuclear weapons are inherently presidential. And without your attention and direction, we'll continue to drift in this dangerous, complacent path that we're on. I urge you to make this a priority and set a safer course for our country and the world.' MICHAEL MORELL: This is one of the few things that actually poses an existential threat to the United States of America.\u00a0 LYNN RUSTEN: Exactly. MICHAEL MORELL: Not too many other national security issues do. Lynn, thank you thank you so much for joining us. It's been great to have you. Really great conversation about a complex issue that people need to pay more attention too. So thank you so much for joining us. LYNN RUSTEN: Thank you so much for having me. It was really great to talk to you.",

            "article_content": "In her new book, \"Zero Fail: The Rise and Fall of the Secret Service\" (Random House), Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporter Carol Leonnig (co-author of the bestselling \"A Very Stable Genius: Donald J. Trump's Testing of America\") traces the evolution of the agency responsible for protecting the president, and how in recent years the Secret Service has become marred by black marks, scandals, and a toxic work culture. Read the excerpt below, and don't miss Jim Axelrod's interview with Carol Leonnig on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" May 16! Chapter 1Protecting Lancer Win Lawson felt his chest puff out a little this particular day in Buffalo, his shoulders hiking his lanky frame just a little taller and straighter. Proud. Yep, he could admit it to himself. Win Lawson, the shy, quiet worrier, felt proud.  The thirty-four-year-old had grown up in a no-stoplight town along the banks of Lake Erie that few outside upstate New York had ever heard of: Portland, New York. The community, about sixty miles south of Buffalo, was best known for its chilly lake air, vineyards and apple farms, and families as hardy as the crops they tended.  Lawson, the son of an elementary school teacher and a local banker, had left for college the summer after high school. He got his degree, married a fraternity brother's sister, and joined an Army intelligence unit as the Korean War began.  Now, a dozen years later, on this fall day in 1962, Lawson had returned to his home turf in a prestigious new role: He was an agent with the Secret Service, assigned to protect the president of the United States.  Nearly two hundred thousand people spilled across Buffalo's largest downtown square, angling for a glimpse of the most famous man on earth, John Fitzgerald Kennedy. And Win Lawson stood beside him.  Kennedy visited Buffalo on October 14, 1962, the day of the city's beloved Polish heritage parade. Seeing the crowds eight deep on the limo route, Lawson thought: Polish or not, all of upstate New York has turned out today to see their dashing president.  Lawson and the seven other members of the president's detail had a job that required every ounce of their concentration: Safeguard Kennedy from start to finish of the trip. They shadowed him as he stepped off Air Force One, as he stood waving from his limo the last half mile of the parade, and now finally as he addressed the enormous crowd in the city's center \u2014 Niagara Square.  That inner ring of detail agents kept a unique vigil that relied largely on sensory instinct and coiled muscles. When \"the Boss\" \u2014 their informal name for the president \u2014 stepped on the platform stage, his detail trained their eyes and ears on the crowd for any odd duck, strange movement, or person with hands stuffed in their pockets. When Kennedy was shaking hands, as he loved to do, detail agents flanked him on either side, watching those outstretched hands for any sign of danger. Their duty: to put their body between the president and a gun, knife, or any other threat.  Standing at the base of the wooden stage in front of City Hall, Lawson rotated his head from left to right, scanning the square, a human periscope rolling over endless heads, faces, and arms, alert to any sign of danger.  For this visit, Lawson had the added duty of serving as the Secret Service's chief of security planning. He had arrived three days earlier to assess the safety of every step the president would take on the visit, an elaborate choreography known as \"the advance.\" He had chosen which streets to block off for the motorcade, how close crowds could stand, and what perimeter posts local cops and motorcycle escorts would man.  But Lawson's meticulous planning didn't change the laws of physics: He and his fellow agents were ultimately insignificant dots in the swirling mass of people pouring into the square.  Cheers went up as Kennedy told the crowd they had kept Poland in their hearts and urged them to pray that her people might one day live free of Communist rule. \"And as the old song says, 'As long as you live, Poland lives,'\" Kennedy continued. Thundering applause filled the square. Kennedy smiled at how long he had to wait before he could say the next line.  Kennedy was winning hearts, and \u2014 his political aides hoped \u2014 votes. To help Democrats win congressional seats that November, the White House wanted as many voters as possible to see the president. Secret Service agents privately disapproved of how close Kennedy wanted to get to his public, but they didn't have the power to override him. Still, the agents knew that the longer the parade route and the more hand-shaking at rope lines, the greater the chances that something bad could happen.  Hard as it was to believe that the president needed protecting from the cheering masses in Niagara Square, Lawson and the detail had to assume at all times that an enemy lurked within the throng. Kennedy may have been handsome, rich, and devilishly charming, but plenty of people in the country despised him. A select few wanted him dead.  The forty-three-year-old politician threatened the status quo. He was the first Catholic to win the presidency, a shock for an older generation that considered Protestants the nation's nobility. Many Americans were also deeply unsettled by Kennedy's insistence that Blacks deserved to study in the same schools, use the same bathrooms, and eat in the same restaurants as Whites.  A few weeks after Kennedy won the 1960 election, Richard Pavlick, a retired seventy-three-year-old postal worker with a history of mental problem and rants against Catholics, loaded the trunk of his Buick with seven sticks of dynamite. He drove from his native New Hampshire to Palm Beach, where the president-elect was staying before his inauguration. Pavlick plotted to blow up Kennedy by ramming his car as he left to attend mass, but he scrapped the plan when he saw Kennedy's wife and children walking by his side. Palm Beach police arrested him a few days later, based on a tip from a worried colleague who pieced together that Pavlick had been stalking Kennedy. In Kennedy's first six weeks as president, the White House received three times the average number of letters threatening violence against the president. \"We are sick of the dirty black Catholics,\" read one anonymous letter postmarked from Los Angeles. \"The next bomb will be for you, Mr. Kennedy.\"  The agents who make up the president's White House detail privately feared for Kennedy's safety. And not just because their job naturally bred paranoia. To the public, President Kennedy was a dashing, cerebral leader with a picture-perfect family. In private, Kennedy's Secret Service agents saw a man courting danger.  Kennedy kept up an unrelenting pace compared to his predecessors, and it pushed his detail close to exhaustion. He was also extremely reckless with his own personal safety. His actions made some of his protectors uneasy and a few quite angry. The agents on his detail liked the new president personally, but professionally, he was their toughest assignment yet.  When Kennedy moved his young family into the White House in January 1961, the Service was so small it resembled a modest city police force more than a federal agency. The Service's top official was even called Chief. The agency ran on a $5 million budget and employed just over three hundred agents, the majority of whom were stationed in field offices spread across fifty states. Just thirty-four agents were assigned to the White House detail \u2014 the arm that protected the president. They typically worked in six-man teams around the president, rotating in eight-hour shifts.  These agents \u2014 all men, and most of them from working-class backgrounds \u2014 had grown up in the shadow of World War II and possessed a keen sense of duty to country. The typical hire was an athletic, straitlaced college graduate in his late twenties or early thirties who served in the military or worked for a local police department.  New agents were always sent first to a field office, but \"keepers\" were summoned to the White House for a tryout on the detail within one or two years. The Service struck a deal with the federal government to bypass the federal hiring pool and instead hire any agent the chief wanted. As part of the agreement, the Secret Service had to put these relatively junior agents on the president's detail within two years if the Service wanted to keep them on the job.  The agents received no specialized protection training, but learned on the job from experienced colleagues on the detail. \"That's how the Secret Service worked. They got you started, they paired you with someone good,\" said Tim McIntyre, a former Kennedy detail agent. \"The Service had a policy of allocating assignments to you and expecting you to respond. When you're posted at various spots, it could be anyplace. It could be in an auditorium. They don't have time to spend to explain a whole lot to you. They expect you to pick up the ball and run with it.\"  The work of an agent, standing watch at a fixed post, was grueling \u2014 even boring. But working alongside the affable, debonair Kennedy gave the job a special cachet. And unlike the general before him, this president made an effort to get to know his agents and greeted them by name. His glamorous life, which included regular sightings of Frank Sinatra, Marilyn Monroe, and the queen of England, sprinkled a little stardust on his security team. Agents relished standing next to history.  \"I'd go down to the LBJ ranch, I'd be working the midnight shift. I'd be standing under one of those big oak trees out in front. And it'd be two in the morning, and it'd be cold,\" Lawson grimaced, recalling one assignment. \"You'd think, 'What in the world am I doing here? You know I'm a college graduate and here I am almost like on guard duty in the middle of the night and so far away. I've been away from home, it's over Christmas,' whatever.  \"Then maybe two weeks later, you'd go to an event you couldn't buy your way into. I was at Cape Canaveral ... for the first moonshot. I was there when they took off,\" he said. \"You think, 'My gosh, I'm a guy from a little town in western New York and look what I've just been witness to.'\"  The Polish heritage parade was one of those days for Lawson. After the parade was over, the president of the United States hopped into his open-topped limousine and left Buffalo, all without incident. Then, as he'd prearranged, Lawson met his parents and brother at the Niagara Falls airstrip parking lot and quickly placed them in a choice spot on the fence line. He knew the president would shake hands there before boarding his plane for the return flight to Washington. Kennedy loved this part of his public outings best: the face-to- face greetings with voters who'd waited for hours to welcome him.  As the president neared Lawson's family, Lawson stood behind his left shoulder and nodded quickly at his parents. Lawson's shift leader, Floyd Boring, paused at their section of fence.  \"Mr. President,\" Boring said, \"this is Agent Lawson's family.\"  Ever gracious, the president beamed. He shook hands with Lawson's brother and father and thanked them for Win's service. Lawson's mother, wearing one of her best day dresses and a pillbox hat decorated with pink and lavender flowers, thrust her right hand toward him with a determined look.  \"I am sorry for how busy we have been keeping your son,\" Kennedy said, grasping the mother's pale white arm. And then came that Kennedy trademark: his whip-fast humor. \"He must be doing a pretty good job, because nobody has shot me yet,\" the president deadpanned.

And this week on FACE THE NATION, along with a sunny economic outlook come clouds of caution with the growing number of new coronavirus cases. Now that spring has sprung, some businesses are booming.\u00a0JEROME POWELL: We're at a place where the economy is about to start growing much more quickly.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll preview Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's 60 MINUTES interview with Scott Pelley. And if that's the case, do we need the full two trillion dollar jobs bill Democrats are trying to get through Congress? We'll ask House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and hear from a top House Republican, Congresswoman Liz Cheney. We'll also look at the crucial caveat in Chairman Powell's assessment. Our recovery is tied to the Americans taking the coronavirus seriously. In Michigan, the COVID-19 situation is so bad that Governor Gretchen Whitmer used a trifecta of sports analogies as she pleaded for just that.\u00a0GRETCHEN WHITMER: Bases loaded. Bottom of the ninth. Second overtime. Shot clock running out. Fourth down on the two yard line with five seconds left in the fourth quarter. We cannot afford to strike out, miss the shot or fumble the ball now. It's everybody against COVID.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk to Governor Whitmer. She's lobbying the Biden administration for more vaccine supply. So far they've said they'll help, but no extra shots.\u00a0JEFFREY ZIENTS: We don't know where the-- the next increase in cases could occur. Now is not the time to change course on vaccine allocations.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Especially not when there are supply glitches, and even more demand. In a week, all Americans over eighteen will be the eligible for a COVID vaccine.\u00a0PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: No more confusing rules, no more confusing restrictions.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll check in with former FDA Commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb and look at the new guidance to schools with California's Public School Superintendent Tony Thurmond.\u00a0It's all just ahead on FACE THE NATION.\u00a0Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin today with caution and optimism. Although there is concern about the rising number of COVID-19 cases, especially among children, Saturday saw a record 4.6 million vaccinations. Nearly seventy-one million adults have been fully vaccinated. When it comes to unemployment, we're still far from where we were pre-pandemic. But as Mark Strassmann reports, the job market is looking much brighter in some key sectors.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN (CBS News Senior National Correspondent): And just like that, jobs are back.\u00a0WOMAN #1: We are hiring on the spot. We're looking for over forty guest room attendants.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Credit a burst in spending from a nation no longer in hibernation. A double injection of adrenalin from the recent 1.9 trillion dollar stimulus package and roughly three million more Americans getting vaccinated every day.\u00a0SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-Kentucky, Senate Minority Leader): The economy has taken off like a rocket. A lot of pent-up demand. People anxious to get out of their houses to get back to normal.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: But in many sectors, the new north normal for employers is a labor shortage. Many restaurants and hotels have had to raise their hourly wages. And some chains now offer signing bonuses, not to executives, but to cooks and kitchen staff.\u00a0COVID America's runaway unemployment crisis is over. We're seeing the return of job fairs like this one.\u00a0WOMAN #2: Go get your vaccinations and come out and get a job.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Nationwide, more than one in three Americans have had at least one shot of a vaccine. In many moments and ways, America feels back.\u00a0WOMAN #3: (INDISTINCT).\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Baseball fans crowded ballparks. Twelve states have lifted their mask mandates, but other states are in deep COVID trouble again.\u00a0JARED POLIS: I don't think I'm too optimistic in saying this, I think it's the fourth and final wave.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: COVID's stalking Upper Midwest states, Michigan especially. Cases have spiked seven-fold since late February. Hospitalizations increased by more than four times. So far Governor Gretchen Whitmer has resisted calls to shut down the state again.\u00a0JEFFREY ZIENTS (White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator): We're offering to surge federal personnel, including CDC response teams, FEMA, DOD, and other federal personnel to support vaccination efforts and get more shots in arms.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: Complicating that effort, a vaccine shortage starting this week. America's supply of the Johnson & Johnson single-shot vaccine will plunge eighty-five percent because of contamination issues at that production plant in Baltimore. Fifteen million doses had to be tossed, a clear setback.\u00a0GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN (R-Maryland): Our biggest concern right now is this bad news we got from the Feds that they're going to be dramatically slashing our supply of vaccines.\u00a0MARK STRASSMANN: That will delay what epidemiologists want: herd immunity, the ultimate booster shot for a post-COVID America.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann reporting from Augusta, Georgia, this morning.\u00a0Scott Pelley sat down with the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, for an update on the state of this economy.\u00a0JEROME POWELL (60 MINUTES): What we're seeing now is really an economy that seems to be at an inflection point. And that's because of, you know, widespread vaccination and strong fiscal support, strong monetary policy support. We-- we feel like we're at a place where the economy's about to start growing much more quickly and job creation coming in much more quickly. So, the principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again. You know, it's-- it's going to be smart if people can continue to socially distance and wear masks.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott Pelley's interview with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell airs tonight on 60 MINUTES.\u00a0We go now to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She joins us from Capitol Hill. Good morning, Madam Speaker.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (Speaker of the House/@SpeakerPelosi): Good morning to you and congratulations.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you-- thank you very much. As our viewers can see, baby on the way here.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Mm-Hm.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I wanted to ask you about that rosy assessment from the Federal Reserve chairman, because six trillion dollars has already been spent to get us to this point. Isn't the momentum that he's talking about a-- a reason that we don't need to spend trillions more like President Biden is asking you to figure out how to do?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: No, it isn't at all. In fact, if you listen very closely to what he said, we're at a place where we will begin to see, we will begin to see. And then he also cautions against a-- a surge in the virus. If we're going to grow the economy with confidence, we've got to crush the virus. They are definitely related. So, begin to see, a recovery in our economy is quite different from what Mitch McConnell is saying. The economy has taken off like a rocket. No, begin to see. Again related to the econ-- the-- and as I watched your report, you know, it's exciting to see people thinking we're out and this or that, but crowded venues and no mask-wearing and the rest are not--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --a-- a positive sign about how we crush the virus. So I think that we have to, again, listen to the science, the science and the governance of how we get this done. And then, of course, it will open the doors--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --for our economy to grow.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, on the specifics of how the President wants to see the economy grow with this two-and-a-quarter-trillion-dollar package he's asking, you have a Democratic majority. It's a slim one here. You can only really afford to lose about two Democrats. What are you going to do? What concrete proposals can you offer to get Republicans on board with this jobs and infrastructure package?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, you've heard me say again and again, public sentiment is everything. Lincoln said that. The public understands that the worst and most expensive maintenance is no maintenance. And we have to maintain our roads, our bridges, our mass transit. We have to upgrade our water systems. We have to build out our-- our broadband for distance learning and telemedicine and the rest of that. So we have a big responsibility. We have a big need to the tune of trillions of dollars, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what you just labeled--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: This is a very important piece of--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --what you just laid out there does have Republican support. It's the rest of the package that Republicans are largely objecting to. Can you trim this down to focus on just the portions--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: No.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --you outlined there, the roads, the bridges, the waterways?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, no, because infrastructure is-- it's about education, about getting children healthily in school with separation, sanitation, ventilation. It's about investments in housing, as well. Overwhelmingly, this bill is about infrastructure in the traditional sense of the word. We also think that infrastructure-- there's a need for workforce development in order to have the workforce fully participate in how we go forward and childcare so that women can be involved in that as well. So it's physical infrastructure. It's also human infrastructure that is involved. And the figure that they use is a ridiculous one to say that it's just a small percentage of the bill. It is overwhelmingly what the legislation is about. And some newer versions of why-- how we build the infrastructure in a way that takes building back better means we're all going down the path together.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as we talked about there, you have a-- a slim majority. So to keep the progressives in your party happy, they are pushing you to actually make it bigger, not to slim it down. They're pushing you as well on paid family and medical leave. I know you continue to say you are committed to making those things permanent--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Yeah.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --but that's not in these White House proposals.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, no.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When do you plan to put those things in a bill to make those permanent?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, the President has talked about additional legislation, our families bill, that would come next and have issues that relate to lowering the cost of prescription drugs by having a-- a negotiation for lower prices about family and medical leave being made permanent. And of course, I want to make the child tax credit permanent as well. But that was--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: When?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --all a matter of conversation as we go forward, I have no doubt that we will have a great bill in the House. I hope that it will be bipartisan. I've been in Congress long enough to remember when bipartisanship was not unusual and that actually growing-- building infrastructure has never been a partisan issue.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: They would only make it-- they made it partisan under President Obama by shrinking the bill. Hopefully the need is so obvious now that Republicans will vote for it. We'll see. I'm not-- I-- I-- I-- the door is open. Our hand is extended. Let's find out where we can find our common ground. We always have a responsibility--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --to strive for bipartisanship.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so no date on that. Let me ask about infrastructure at the Capitol. It has been three months since that January 6th siege. How much longer can you wait before putting forth this supplemental bill to do all the things you say are necessary to protect the Capitol?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, we'll-- we'll put it forth when it is ready and it's just about ready now. There was a great deal of review, of request of organization-- entities that had spent money on that day, January 6th, the day of the insurrection incited by the President of the United States, who would ever suspect such a thing. And so there were costs associated then, but now cost associated with building, hardening the windows, the doors, the Capitol put forth by the architect of the Capitol-- of security issues put forth. I had General Honore--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you do that?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --make a recommendation. I'm sorry?\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And-- and I read that report. I mean, it was just incredibly detailed and scathing, frankly. So can you really wait? I mean are you going to--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: No, we're not waiting.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --wait until the committees finish their investigation or can you do something now?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: No, no. We're ready to go forward. The-- there're different reports. I'm talking about General Honore's suggestions--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --about what are needed. Then there's been a report about shortcomings-- short in the Capitol Police that must be addressed and that was addressed in General Honore's. No, I think we're right now at a good place. But you know, again, we're talking about money and we want to make sure that it is the appropriate amount, nothing less than we need, but nothing more than we need and appropriately prioritized to again open up the Capitol so that it is the temple of democracy, that it is that people can come and be there with adequate protection so that they can do so safely. And the Appropriations Committee had that responsibility in addition to the committees of-- of jurisdiction, the House administration, et cetera.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: So we're in a good place and we feel, how can I say it, we think that it is the appropriate prioritizing that we're putting forward. But it's always-- in legislation it's always--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: --a conversation.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll stay tuned for that. The House Ethics Committee has opened an investigation into Congressman Matt Gaetz, as you know, for a long laundry list of allegations. Are you going to wait for the committee report or do you think it's time for him to resign right now?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, it's up to the Republicans to take responsibility for that. We in the Congress, in the House, have Bill 23, which says that in the conduct of our duties, we are not to bring dishonor to the House of Representatives. I think there's been a clear violation of that. But it's up to the Ethics Committee to investigate that. And it's up to the Republican leader, Mister McCarthy, to act upon that behavior.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: The-- but we're hopeful about other things in the Congress rather than that we're optimistic about what can happen to our economy if we crush the virus.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: What the President has put forth is quite transformative for our country so that we can, as he says, help is on the way.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Help us here. We will build back better.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker Pelosi, thank you for your time this morning.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Thank you. My pleasure.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: FACE THE NATION will be back in a minute with the top Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with the number three Republican in the House, Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney. She is also joining us from Capitol Hill. Good morning to you, Congresswoman.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY (R-Wyoming/@RepLizCheney/House Republican Conference Chair): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me. And congratulations as well.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. I love having powerful women back-to-back.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: That's right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Straight to you on--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Powerful women who are mothers of five, I mean, you know.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- and I think there is something to that in terms of wrangling cats, no doubt.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: That's probably right.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2017, you did support the idea of spending, you know, President Trump's proposal of a trillion dollars on infrastructure. Nothing ever came of that, of course. But you liked the concept. Why are you opposed to it now?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Well, it's a very different proposal, obviously. Something less than six percent, as you mentioned, of this proposal that President Biden has put forward is actually focused on infrastructure. The National Association of Manufacturers has said that we will probably lose over a million jobs if this is enacted. And-- and you are certainly going to see in addition to the corporate tax increases in the bill, you'll see middle-class tax increases. This is a pattern that we-- we watch the Democrats use time and again, where they massively increase spending. They massively expand the size and scope of the federal government, and then they come back around and impose middle-class tax increases. So those are not things that we support, not things that I support.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that tax increase you're talking about with the National Association of Manufacturers, that was losing a million jobs over two years. It was specifically targeting the corporate tax rate going about twenty-eight percent. Is that an area you're focusing in on? If Speaker Pelosi offers you an olive branch and says we'll go down to twenty-five percent, for example? I mean, is that something you can work with?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Look, the bill would need to be fundamentally redone. It would need to be a different bill. It would need to actually focus on infrastructure, not on so many of the additional Green New Deal spending priorities, spending priorities that are focused on helping Democrat allies around the country. You know, we-- we have already, as you pointed out, appropriated trillions of dollars since January and-- and last year as well. I'm really concerned about the impact on the economy, the potential inflationary pressure that we might see with this additional injection of cash. And-- and so much of it is unnecessary. Six percent is actually focused on the kind of infrastructure that-- that there is bipartisan support for.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: So I would urge Democrats, let's focus on that.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Portman, Republican colleague of yours, said twenty percent of the bill, if you're generous, is on infrastructure. You're-- you're putting it even lower at six percent. On the question, though, of paid leave, which is something that Speaker Pelosi says is a long-term goal of hers, is that something you can get on board with?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Look, Margaret, I think that there are fundamental differences in how the Democrats and the Republicans approach the economy. We know that we've got to enact policies that are going to help spur this economic recovery, policies that are going to create jobs, policies that are-- are not going to expand the federal government so that it's involved in every aspect of our lives. We understand that the engine of economic growth is the private sector.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But as you know, that was so key when it came to female-- female employment in this past pandemic-related contraction.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Look--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Is-- isn't that something that you think is necessary?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: I think that it is very important for us to provide opportunity for everyone. And I think that, you know, one of the things the Democrats often do is they sort of try to segment-- segment women out and say, \"Well, these are the women's issues. \"I think that women need to be in a position where they know that their elected officials are doing everything possible to keep them safe, to keep the nation safe, to get their kids back in school. If you want to talk about what is really going to help women get back to work, it's getting schools open again. And Speaker Pelosi, four times now since January has blocked the Reopen Schools Act from consideration on the House floor. Those are the kinds of things we ought to be focused on.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker John Boehner was just on CBS SUNDAY MORNING saying January 6th should have been a wakeup call for your party. It was an example of political terrorism, was a phrase he used. And he doesn't understand why more in your party don't speak up. You did speak up and President Trump is threatening to primary you. Was separating yourself worth the risk?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Look, January 6th was clearly an attack that was attempted to stop the counting of electoral votes. I just listened to Speaker Pelosi say that, quote, \"Right now we're in a good place.\" We're not in a good place. We absolutely need-- and it is her responsibility to create a commission, a bipartisan commission to study what happened, to understand what the provocation was, to understand what happened, to make sure that it never happens again. After every major crisis in this country whether it's September 11th--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: There wasn't-- there wasn't Republican support for the version she put forward--\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Well--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --which would have had a Democratic majority.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: The version that she put forward was not bipartisan. It was very heavily partisan towards the Democrats. This is a serious issue. It shouldn't be a partisan issue. You just had a hundred and forty national security officials from Republican and Democratic administrations--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --send a letter to Congress saying we need a commission. I think that's the single most important thing we need to do--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --to make sure that kind of attack never happens again.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, unfortunately, last night the Pres-- the former President seemed to be talking in a proud way about the crowd size on January 6th. He gave the speech at Mar-a-Lago. He was the keynote speaker at the RNC fund-raiser and-- and talked about Vice President Pence not doing more to stop the election certification, according to reports in the Times and-- and The Post. So is he really the best messenger for the party?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: You know, the-- the former President is using the same language that he knows provoked violence on January 6th. You know, as a party, we need to be focused on the future. We need to be focused on embracing the Constitution, not embracing insurrection. And I think it's very important for people to realize that a fundamental part of the Constitution and-- and of who we are as Americans is the rule of law. It's the judicial process. The election wasn't stolen. There was a judicial process in place. If you attack the judicial process and you attack the rule of law, you aren't defending the Constitution. You're at war with the Constitution. And for us as a party going forward, we have to embrace the Constitution and we also have to put forward positive solutions. We've got to be the party of hope, of aspiration,--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --of inspiration. The party that recognizes and understands that, you know, that the taxes need to be low, the government needs to be limited in size,--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: --strong national defense, those substantive things, not the party of-- of insurrection.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker Pelosi just said it's up to your party to take responsibility for Congressman Matt Gaetz, who, as you know, is undergoing an ethics investigation. Are you ready to call for his resignation? Or are you going to wait?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: You know, as-- as the mother of daughters, the charges certainly are sickening. And as the speaker noted, there's an ethics investigation underway. There are also criminal investigations underway. And I'm not going to comment further on that publicly right now, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Were you surprised at these allegations?\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: I'm not going to comment further, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Well, he's one of your chief critics, so I needed to offer you that opportunity, as you well know.\u00a0REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Thank you for the opportunity, Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Congresswoman, we will leave it there. We'll be back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Gretchen Whitmer joins us now from Lansing. Good morning, Governor. What is driving the spike in infections in your state?\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-Michigan/@GovWhitmer): Well, a number of things, Margaret. Number one, you know, we kept our spread low for a long period of time. So we've got reservoirs of people that don't have antibodies. We have variants, big presence of variants here in Michigan that are easier to catch. And people are tired and they're moving around more. And this is kind of the combination of things that is contributing to what we're seeing as a large amount of community spread in Michigan right now.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, stay with us, because I want to get into the details of what you need to combat this. Stay with us. And on the other side of it, we'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. So stay with us. Governor Gretchen Whitmer is standing by. We'll have perspective from Doctor Scott Gottlieb and the California public school superintendent Tony Thurmond also joins us. Don't go away.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation with Michigan Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer.\u00a0Governor, you have publicly called for a surge of vaccine doses to your state, but the White House's COVID response coordinator, Jeff Zients, as we played at the top of the show, shot that down. Does this-- I mean, does this offer that they're giving you of vaccinators, of resources make up for the fact that they're not surging you doses?\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: Let me start by saying this. You know, we did not have a national strategy for a long period of time, and then the Biden White House came in and we have one. And by and large, they're doing a great job. I would submit, though, that in an undertaking of this magnitude, with such consequence, it's important to recognize where there might need to be some adjustments along the way. We are seeing a surge in Michigan despite the fact that we have some of the strongest policies in place, mask mandates, capacity limits, working from home. We've asked our state for a two-week pause. So despite all of that, we are seeing a surge because of these variants. And that's precisely why we're really encouraging them to think about surging vaccines into the state of Michigan. And I'm going to continue to fight for the people of Michigan.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know, you know, taking up vaccine takes some time. But, according to reports in the Post and the AP, Biden officials are telling reporters that you aren't maxing out your orders, that it's a state problem here, that you're not placing them correctly or something, or you're not being efficient in allocation. How do you respond to that?\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: I don't think there's a governor in the country that's leaving any vaccines on the table. And I can tell you that's certainly the case in Michigan. We are getting shots in arms. We got over a million shots in arms just in the last two weeks. So we have really been rolling. We've spent a lot of time with the COVID response team, walking through. I think we found some common ground at the end of last week around the data. But all of that being said, right now, we know we've got even greater capacity. We could get more vaccines in arms. And when there is a surge, we think that it's important that we-- we go to-- we rush in to meet where that need is, because what's happening in Michigan today could be what's happening in other states tomorrow. And so it's on all of us to recognize we can squash where we're seeing hot spots. It's in everyone's best interest.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So did you get any explanation as to why the White House won't surge you vaccine at this time of crisis?\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: Well, I think they've got a plan and they're committed to sticking to it, and I understand that. And we are definitely grateful for the boots on the ground that they're sending, the mobile units. We're definitely grateful for the therapeutics and the increased testing. Those are all really important. And we're going to continue to work well with this White House and-- and we're grateful for that. But I am going to also continue fighting for my state and anyone who's watched what's going on in Michigan over the last year knows that that's-- that's how I am.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: I'm going to fight for-- to get everything I can for the help for the people of Michigan that we need.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- I mean, devil's advocate, if you get doses, are you confident you can actually administer them? Because if you look at what's happening in the city of Detroit, your-- your largest city, the mayor there said, you know, they're really having a hard time in some ways getting the vaccine uptake. There is hesitation. What's the problem?\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: Well, the mayor's done an incredible job, and I think he has been wanting to expand the population to whom he can offer vaccines. And so we have done that. Michigan was the first to heed the Biden administration's call to drop all of the priority groups and make it accessible for everyone. Right now, if you are sixteen and up in Michigan, you can get vaccinated, you're eligible too. But we have thousands of partners who are ready to put shots in arms. We just need those vaccines to come into Michigan.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Would you drop the requirement to make an appointment?\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: Well, we know that making appointments is-- is really important in terms of our management of how many vaccines we have, in terms of ensuring that, you know, first and second doses, especially for Moderna and Pfizer. And so the appointment process, we think, has been really important. You look at what happened in Florida in the early days where people were waiting in line and it was chaotic--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: --and-- and actually somewhat dangerous. We've had an appointment process and it's worked-- it's worked quite well. And I think that with more vaccines, we'll continue to see that work well.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, because that's one of the arguments to get it into poor communities that don't have digital access. What about kids? If Pfizer, which asked the FDA for emergency use authorization to put vaccines in the arms of twelve-year-olds, if they get that, would you mandate that for kids to go back to school?\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: We're not having conversations around mandates. What we are trying to do, though, is to make it easier for people to access vaccines. And I think parents understand--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But why not? Schools mandate vaccines for other things with children.\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: Right. And-- and the schools may-- may well do that. At this juncture, we are not having that conversation. I can tell you this. We have continued to have good mitigation policies. We've continued to move shots in arms. And that's all despite the fact that I've got a reduced set of powers because of the-- the-- the antagonism from my own legislature. And so there's not a conversation on that front. But we are encouraging schools to move forward, to take a pause right now and to promulgate policies to keep their students and their staff safe.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned antagonism from your own legislature. You've also been the target of some high-level Michigan Republicans recently. Ron Weiser, the party chairman, said this about you.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0RON WEISER (Michigan GOP Chair; North Oakland Republican Club): Our job now is to soften up those three witches and make sure that we have good candidates to run against them, that they are ready for the-- for the burning at the stake.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: He was talking about you and two of your female Democratic colleagues. The Senate majority leader was also bragging that the Senate had, quote, spanked you on the budget and appointments. They've both apologized. But do you think there should be repercussions for misogynistic, threatening remarks like this?\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: Well, when you say that they've apologized, I don't know to whom they've apologized because I haven't heard from them. I can tell you this, though, that sadly in this moment there have been a lot of death threats. We know that there was a plot to kidnap and kill me. Death threats against me and my family. It's different in what I'm confronting than what some of my male counterparts are. So, yes, I do think that there is a layer of misogyny here that every woman in leadership has been confronting and dealing with to some extent. I don't have time, though, to focus on that or to go punch for punch. I'm not going to do that. I've got a job to do and that is helping get my state through this, helping get our economy back on track, supporting the American Jobs Plan so that that helps us do both of those things. And that's what I'm going to stay focused on.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Whitmer, thank you for your time. Good luck.\u00a0GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER: Thank you.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back to talk about kids going back to school and keeping them safe. Stay with us.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to California State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond. He joins us from San Francisco. Good morning to you.\u00a0TONY THURMOND (California Superintendent of Public Instruction/@TonyThurmond): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me on.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for joining us. Well, California is the last state in the country in terms of reopening schools, but elementary schools in L.A. tomorrow are going to be returning to in-person learning. Why did it take this long? Why didn't the governor really force things to reopen?\u00a0TONY THURMOND: Well, if you think about the complexities of our state, we have, you know, 6.2 million students. You mentioned our largest school district, Los Angeles Unified, is opening tomorrow with more than six hundred thousand students. And if you think back to the winter, we had one of the biggest spikes anywhere. I mean, we've lost more than sixty thousand Californians. We have 3.7 million cases. This has been complex. And everyone has been trying to find a way to get our schools open. We're pivoting now and we're at a place now where we see nine thousand of our ten thousand schools are either open or found a way to get open. So we're moving forward\u2013\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0TONY THURMOND: --by giving our schools what they need, vaccines and rapid COVID tests and ventilation and resources to get open safely and to stay open safely.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of staying open, as I asked Governor Whitmer, Pfizer has requested FDA approval to give their vaccine to twelve-year-olds and up. The CDC director's hopeful kids will return for in-person instruction in the fall. Will they do that in California and will you mandate the vaccine?\u00a0TONY THURMOND: Well, this week, our vaccines will be, you know, now have eligibility for anyone sixteen and over.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0TONY THURMOND: And so we know that will be important as we look to see more increases of schools that open for high school age students. And so we know that right now--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not mandated for them.\u00a0TONY THURMOND: Well, our governor hasn't mandated that. But, you know, making vaccines available has been a game-changer in our state. We've just surpassed providing twenty-two million vaccine doses in our state, more than four hundred thousand to our educator workforce. And so these are the keys that allow us to get our schools open and keep them safe. Of course, we need everybody to continue to wear a mask--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0TONY THURMOND: --and to social distance. And as we monitor these variants to make sure that we can stay open safely in our schools.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you consider it?\u00a0TONY THURMOND: Well, my office doesn't have the power to mandate. We have a thousand school districts in our state that--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have the power to consider it--\u00a0TONY THURMOND: Unfortunately, as-- as--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --and recommend.\u00a0TONY THURMOND: I do have the power to recommend using things like vaccines and COVID tests. You know, these are ultimately individual choices that our families are going to have to make about whether or not their children will take the vaccine. You know, as a parent, I certainly would encourage it. As someone who has recently had my vaccine, I've gone on live to do live webinars for people to see that it's safe, that it's pain-free, and that it can make a difference in keeping us safe. And with all these variants that we're seeing coming to the U.S., we know that the vaccines are among the-- the most important things that we can do to keep every one of our forty million Californians safe.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. I want to ask you about the kids as they come back into instruction. You spoke powerfully about your own personal experience growing up as a child of a single mom who you lost at a very young age. There was a study that was published this week talking about the forty thousand children in this country who have lost a parent to COVID-19. Twenty percent of those kids, according to this JAMA study, are African-American. In-- in California, how do you plan to deal with this particular part of the inequity problem?\u00a0TONY THURMOND: The first thing we do when our students return is to really check in on their social and emotional well-being, making sure that they have mental health supports. This has been hard on our kids all across the nation. We've seen a high rate of depression and we know that we have to first and foremost provide social emotional supports. Second, you know, with all due respect to the hard work of so many educators trying to support our kids, we-- we literally in this country moved into distance learning overnight because we had to keep people safe. And let's face it, education systems weren't built for this.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0TONY THURMOND: And so with all due respect to those efforts, we know that many of our kids have had unavoidable impacts. So we'll provide them more tutoring, more supports. We've got to make sure that more of our kids have computers. In this nation we have so many students, including students of color, who've gone without computers and who've gone without access to high-speed internet. In our state, we've worked to provide hundreds of thousands of computing devices and we've got all of our Internet companies to commit to providing Internet at low cost to our students.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0TONY THURMOND: At-- at the same time, I-- I want-- I want to say that many of our families are still asking to remain in distance learning. If you look at nationwide across the country, you know students of color--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?\u00a0TONY THURMOND: --are asking to remain in distance learning. That tells me they still have concerns about safety. And that's why I think it makes sense to go slowly, to be cautious, to get open, to show folks that this can be done, and to use important resources like what we're using in California. We've secured, with the governor and others, five million rapid COVID tests that give you results about someone being positive within fifteen minutes.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0TONY THURMOND: That kind of awareness gives you a sense about whether or not it's safe to reopen your school campuses. And we're using them throughout the state of California.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: To make up for lost time, do you need to have a summer semester?\u00a0TONY THURMOND: We are planning to use our summer school programs to provide more enrichment. But that's not the only way. At the end of the day, we'll assess where every student enters, and look for ways to offset any learning gaps that have been exacerbated during the pandemic. That means a lot of tutoring. That means after-school programs. That means specialized training for teachers and educators and really working closely to engage our families to make sure we're hearing them,--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0TONY THURMOND: --we're providing supports to them and to make sure that our students have access to high-speed internet.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And quickly, given what we're seeing in the Midwest, do you still intend to hold youth sports because that's being seen as a way the virus is being transmit-- trans-- transmitted?\u00a0TONY THURMOND: Our state has opened for sports. Many of our school districts are using the rapid COVID test to have awareness for our athletes. What we're planning to do is to continue to monitor these new variants and-- and to make sure-- variants and to make sure that we are doing the things that we know that will keep us safe--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0TONY THURMOND: --using face masks and social distancing. We're going to have to continue to do these things for quite some time.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Superintendent, thank you very much for your time this morning.\u00a0We'll be--\u00a0TONY THURMOND: Thanks.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --back in a moment.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a quick look now at the COVID news around the world. CBS News senior foreign correspondent Liz Palmer reports from London.\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER (CBS News Senior Foreign Correspondent/@CBSLizpalmer): Good morning. As the global death toll from COVID closes in on three million, there are three main hotspots on the planet-- India, Brazil, and Europe.\u00a0(Begin VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: Even in well-off, well-organized Germany, the ICU wards in some regions are full, and the medical system under strain. Europe is currently a patchwork of lockdowns, and there's a race to vaccinate faster than the virus is spreading. But public confidence has been shaken, first by an investigation into the AstraZeneca vaccine's link to rare blood clots, and now another into Johnson & Johnson's. By contrast, Britain's getting ready to reopen. Infection and death rates are sharply down, so pubs and shops can welcome costumers back as of tomorrow. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be among them.\u00a0BORIS JOHNSON: And on Monday, the 12th, I will be going to the pub myself and cautiously but irreversibly raising a pint of beer to my lips.\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: Politicians across India are on the campaign trail and rallies like this with few masks and no social distancing are helping to fuel an explosion of COVID cases. The rise in death is so alarming, authorities have decided that India, a huge vaccine producer, will stop exporting any and keep everything it makes for itself. In Brazil, too, the situation is critical. Hospitals are overfull. Some running short of supplies. And the number of COVID deaths every day has tripled since January. With vaccine shortages and no strict lockdown, the situation is deteriorating.\u00a0(End VT)\u00a0ELIZABETH PALMER: And that's a global concern, because new variants will inevitably emerge from a run-away outbreak like Brazil's. And if they're vaccine resistant, that could put us all back to square one. Margaret.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Liz Palmer, thank you.\u00a0We turn now to former FDA commissioner and Pfizer board member Doctor Scott Gottlieb, who joins us from Westport, Connecticut. Good morning to you, Doctor. The governor--\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Good morning.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: --the governor of Michigan name checked you in a press conference this week as one of the health experts she has recently consulted with. So let's start there. What do you think of her request to the White House to surge vaccine supply? A number of health experts, the former surgeon general, for example, said this is a mistake on the White House's part, not to deliver her the doses she says she needs.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD: Well, look, it's a request that's been made for weeks now, and I think we should have done it weeks ago. It's never too late to do it. And it's not just additional vaccine, but it's the resources to actually get the vaccine into arms. Some of the federal resources that FEMA has, they're developing these mobile vans to go into communities to-- to ramp up vaccination. I think we need to think about putting those resources into hotspots. It's been sort of a Hunger Games for vaccines among states so far. And we need to think differently about this pandemic. If you look at all the planning for past pandemics, the flu planning that we've done in the past, even planning for bioterrorism incidents, it always contemplated surging resources into hot spots. They never perceived that there was going to be a confluent national epidemic, but there were going to be localized outbreaks. That, in fact, is likely what we're going to see going forward. We're not going to see a confluent epidemic, but we'll see these hotspots. So we need to get in the habit of trying to surge resources into those hotspots to put out those fires that's spread. And it's not just Michigan right now. It's the entire Great Lakes region.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a good reason to be sticking to the plan of only delivering doses based on population size?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD: Yeah, governors are going to complain about it. Every governor wants their allocation. But we're going to be in a situation probably as early as three weeks right now-- three weeks from now, where supply outstrips demand. And I think a lot of states are going to see themselves with excess supply and excess appointments. So it's going to be a shame to look back and in retrospect, realize that we probably should have put more vaccine into some of these hotspots to snuff them out earlier. Now, it's tough because the vaccine does take time to have its effect. It doesn't have an immediate effect, and that's why we should have done it earlier. It's never too late. But if we start surging supplies into Michigan now, start surging capacity to deliver those supplies into Michigan, it could have an impact on the tail-end of the epidemic that they're experiencing. There are some signs that they're-- they're rolling over right now, that cases may be starting to come down. They may be reaching a turning point. A lot of their cases are in younger people--\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD: --people who haven't been eligible for vaccination. If you look at the cases, about fifteen percent increase in-- in cases for those under the age of eighteen, a fifty percent increase for people between the age of twenty and twenty-nine, a thirty percent increase for people between the ages of thirty and thirty-nine. So they're occurring in groups that haven't been vaccinated.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: And the governor and the CDC director both highlighted youth sports activities as a possible vector of transmission. What do parents at home take away from that? Do they send their kids to the classroom but not let them go to lacrosse practice?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD: Well, what we've seen consistently through this whole pandemic is that the risk in the schools correlates with the risk in the community. So if you're in a community that has relatively low prevalence, and that's a lot of parts of the country right now, things are starting to look better across a lot of parts of the country, the risk in the schools is lower. If you're in a community that has a high prevalence like-- like the metro Detroit region, the risk in the schools is higher. And, in fact, a lot of the outbreaks that they're seeing are associated with the schools. There's been a seventeen percent increase in outbreaks in the community associated with spread that they think originated in schools in the first week of April if you look at the Michigan data. So I think it was prudent that the governor tap the brakes or at least make-- made recommendations to local authorities to tap the brakes on extracurricular activities and also high schools. They're going to need to take a pause until they get over this-- this surge of infection that they're seeing right now. But in most parts of the country, I think that you can open schools safely. You can continue those activities safely in lower prevalence environments.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Both the governor and the California school superintendent were reluctant to embrace the idea of a mandate for a COVID vaccine for kids. Why? You have to be vaccinated to go to school in most states. Why should COVID be any different?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD: Look, people have-- have come to accept the other vaccines in the pediatric schedule that you reference, measles, mumps, rubella, flu vaccines, I think this is novel. I think issues around COVID have become an unfortunate political flashpoint in this country. And I think you're going to see governors across the political spectrum be reluctant to mandate it, in part, because they know if they step into this debate and impose mandates, that's going to engender more opposition. So they're likely to leave it up to local districts at least to start the year. I think what's going to happen is if you see outbreaks in local communities, they'll be pressure for local school boards to mandate the vaccine. And I think you're also, unfortunately, in some-- some communities probably going to see fights among parents trying to influence local school boards to mandate vaccination or local health districts to mandate vaccination among kids. So this is going to play out at a local level. Hopefully we enter into the school year where enough adults have vaccine that we don't see outbreaks in the schools. Again, the community spread is the best-- best predictor of what happens in the schools. And if you look at the data out of Israel, you're seeing cases come down substantially among kids below the age of sixteen, not because they're vaccinated, but because their parents are vaccinated. So they're not bringing the infection into the schools.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you think of this idea of vaccine passports?\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD: I think we should allow people to own the information about whether or not they've been vaccinated. Right now, you don't own that information. The card that you got can be bought on eBay. It's not going to be verification. We've piggybacked reporting on whether or not you've been vaccinated on the child immunization scheme. There's sixty-four districts that the states report to on whether-- on who's been vaccinated for COVID. That system is-- is actually the system that states report to on childhood immunization. It can't be queried by individuals.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0SCOTT GOTTLIEB, MD: You can't get access to that information. So we need to create a way for people to own this.\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I've got to cut you off there. Doctor Gottlieb, thank you very much.\u00a0We'll be right back.\u00a0(ANNOUNCEMENTS)\u00a0MARGARET BRENNAN: For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.\u00a0\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The House passed President Biden's \u00a0$1.9 trillion\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0relief package early Saturday morning almost entirely along partisan lines. The bill now goes the Senate, although it included a minimum wage hike that the Senate parliamentarian ruled on Thursday cannot be included if Congress uses the budget reconciliation process. Two Democrats, Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Jared Golden of Maine, voted with the Republicans in the 219-212 vote. Not one Republican voted for the bill.\u00a0 Debate on the bill went until nearly 1 a.m. on Saturday. \u00a0 The bill, called the American Rescue Plan, includes $1,400 in direct checks for Americans making under $75,000, a $400 per week supplemental unemployment bonus, money for vaccine distribution, and funding to aid schools and state and local governments. Although previous coronavirus relief bills have passed with bipartisan support, the bill had been expected to pass in the House along party lines, as Republicans have criticized the high price tag and the inclusion of provisions they see as unrelated to the crisis. The vote in the House came days after the U.S. passed the grim milestone of 500,000 American deaths\u00a0from the coronavirus. Millions have lost their jobs due to the economic fallout, and supplemental unemployment assistance established by Congress late last year is set to expire in mid-March.\u00a0 The American Rescue Plan is broadly popular among Americans, earning support from Republican voters as well as Democrats and independents. A\u00a0poll by Morning Consult/Politico released on Thursday shows that 76% of Americans support the package, including 60% of Republicans. \"The need is great. The opportunity is there,\" Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Thursday. The bill also includes a provision raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, even though the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the bill could not include an increase of the federal minimum wage if Congress uses the budget reconciliation process. Congressional Democrats opted to use the procedural maneuver known as budget reconciliation to pass the bill, allowing it to be approved by only a simple majority in the Senate. Most legislation requires 60 votes in the Senate to advance, so the budget reconciliation process allows Democrats \u2014 who hold a 50-seat majority \u2014 to pass the bill without any Republican votes. There are strict rules for utilizing the budget reconciliation process, such as the \"Byrd rule,\" which requires that all provisions in the bill be budget-related, and must not increase the federal deficit after a 10-year budget window. Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled that the minimum wage hike did not fit the parameters for budget reconciliation. In a statement on Thursday, Pelosi said MacDonough's decision was \"disappointing.\" \"House Democrats believe that the minimum wage hike is necessary.  Therefore, this provision will remain in the American Rescue Plan on the Floor tomorrow,\" Pelosi said. The federal minimum wage of $7.25 has not been increased since 2009. However, it's unclear that the provision raising the minimum wage would have been included in the final bill even if MacDonough had ruled that it was possible to include a wage hike in the bill. At least two Democrats, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, had expressed concerns about raising the minimum wage. Without support from all 50 Democrats in the Senate, the bill's prospects would be doomed. Once the Senate considers its version of the bill, progressives in the House could threaten to withhold their support for the final package unless some kind of minimum wage hike is included. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested on Thursday that progressive members of the House should pressure their own party in ways similar to conservative Democrats in the Senate. \"There are progressive Democrats that have that muscle in the House,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"If we as a party decide to stand down on our promise of elevating the minimum wage, I think that's extraordinarily spurious and it's something that as a party we could have a further conversation about how to fight for it.\" Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, the chair of the House Progressive Caucus, told reporters on Friday that the Senate should consider eliminating the legislative filibuster, which would allow any legislation to pass in the Senate with a simple majority. Using budget reconciliation is a work-around that allows lawmakers to approve bills with a simple majority without torpedoing the filibuster. \"The rules in the Senate have been really put there to preserve the power of the minority,\" Jayapal said. \"Now we have to show that it's going to make a difference that we're not going to get caught up in the tyranny of the minority that exists in the Senate.\" Jayapal and other progressives have pushed for Vice President Kamala Harris to overrule the decision of the parliamentarian in her capacity as president of the Senate. A senior Democratic aide confirmed to CBS News that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is looking to add a new provision to penalize large corporations that don't pay their workers at least a $15 minimum wage, an idea which appears to be gaining traction. Senator Bernie Sanders, the chair of the Senate Budget Committee and an outspoken advocate for raising the minimum wage, said Thursday that he would introduce an amendment to the package to \"take tax deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don't pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages.\" \"That amendment must be included in this reconciliation bill,\" Sanders said. Other senators appear to be open to punishing corporations for not paying their workers sufficient wages. Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden suggested a \"plan B\" approach to the minimum wage in a statement on Friday, which would \"impose a 5 percent penalty on a big corporations' total payroll if any workers earn less than a certain amount.\" \"At the same time, I want to incentivize the smallest of small businesses-those with middle-class owners-to raise their workers' wages. My plan would provide an income tax credit equal to 25 percent of wages, up to $10,000 per year per employer, to small businesses that pay their workers higher wages,\" Wyden said. Republican Senator Josh Hawley, who joined Sanders in calling for $2,000 direct checks late last year, also introduced a bill that would require companies with revenues of $1 billion or more to pay their employees $15 per hour. Amendments only require a simple majority to be added to legislation, so an amendment on the minimum wage is possible as long as all 50 Democrats approve. Raising the minimum wage is widely popular, with a 2019 poll by the\u00a0Pew Research Center\u00a0showing that 67% of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15. It even has support in some red states, as demonstrated by a ballot initiative in Florida to increase the minimum wage increase to $15 by 2026 which passed with support from more than 60% of voters in the last election.\u00a0 Jack Turman contributed to this report Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The White House has shared few details about first lady Jill Biden's return to teaching, even though it's the first time in history a first lady has held a full-time job outside the East Wing. But getting Dr. Biden back to her students required months of negotiation, concerns about how to list her in the schedule and a close reading of the Constitution's Emoluments Clause among other things, according to hundreds of planning and administrative documents obtained by CBS News through a public records request to Northern Virginia Community College. The emails reflect an attempt by the first lady to keep a low profile even as she is now far more recognized than when she taught during her time as second lady. Special considerations \u2014 like whether her name would appear on schedules for students enrolling in Dr. Biden's English classes \u2014 were discussed for weeks. \"I think she was going to be listed as 'TBA,'\" the NOVA Community College president told her administrative colleagues in an email at the end of November. But a month later, the dean told the first lady he was \"worried\" she would not get the class schedule she would like because of the \"TBA\" professor listing. \"I would like to put 'Biden' rather than 'TBA'...is that all right with you?\" he asked. But days before classes were to begin in January, the issue of which name would appear was apparently unresolved. The campus provost told her colleagues the \"name is the hold up\" in order to \"pin down plans for Jill's schedule.\" Potentially complicating the decision was Biden's use at the college of her middle name, Tracy, sometimes in lieu of her last name, because her account information had to match in the remote teaching system. Ultimately, the public schedule listed morning classes with \"Jill T. Biden.\" Biden immediately sought to wall off her other high-profile job at the White House from her work at the community college once her husband was in office. \"I am an English teacher at NOVA \u2014 not First Lady,\" she wrote to colleagues in an email the week after President Biden's inauguration, to head off a potential mention of her White House role in a campus flyer. \"I am trying to keep my roles separate as I did as Second Lady. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I want students to see me as their English teacher. I am not mentioning it in my classes AT ALL. Thanks for honoring my teacher identity. Jill\" This semester she is teaching three introductory English courses, two of which are \"hybrid\" courses with live-streamed instruction and independent online classwork, according to a copy of her schedule, which is available in public records. The separation of roles appears to not only be important to Dr. Biden for personal and professional reasons, but potentially for legal and ethical considerations. Two weeks after Mr. Biden was declared the election winner in November, the college's dean notified fellow administrators that Dr. Biden's staff \"...was meeting with attorneys to make sure there were no legal barriers to her teaching.\"\u00a0 The issue apparently being examined by Dr. Biden's lawyers was the Constitution's Emoluments Clause, which stipulates appropriate compensation for the president and makes clear the president \"...shall not receive...any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.\" \"The clause is specific to the President and not the First Lady...But since NOVA is a state school and Jill and Joe file [taxes] jointly, the 'any of them' clause, meaning a state, is the issue,\" the dean explained in an email about his discussions with Dr. Biden's staff.\u00a0 The emails do not mention that former President Trump was sued over the Emoluments Clause because of his ongoing financial interest and ownership in his hotels and restaurants during his presidency, including the Trump International Hotel located near the White House. In January, the Supreme Court\u00a0dismissed\u00a0the case. \"[Dr. Biden's senior adviser]...said it was not a question of if she would teach but how,\" the dean wrote, \"It may be that her salary will have to be donated to the Foundation or an endowed chair would need to be set up so that her salary would come from a non-state source.\"\u00a0 It is unclear from the public records obtained by CBS News what Dr. Biden's lawyers ultimately determined regarding the Constitution and her potential public salary, but the first lady's office confirmed to CBS News that \"[p]rior to moving to the White House, Dr. Biden and her team worked with NVCC to ensure that all appropriate steps were taken to facilitate her continued teaching.\"\u00a0 In late November, after top college administrators were informed of the potential constitutional conundrum, NOVA President Anne Kress and the human resources department discussed paying Dr. Biden's salary with \"non-state funding\" from the NOVA Foundation, the university's 501(c) 3 non-profit fundraising arm, which discloses on its website that it regularly funds faculty positions.\u00a0 The college's president floated the idea of using a foundation grant to fund this semester's portion of the first lady's annual $81,904 salary, according to her public faculty employment contract signed on July 13.\u00a0 \"Before I approach the Foundation, would this be an appropriate use of the proceeds from the Brazil grant?\" Kress inquired with two human resource directors in an email on November 30. They deemed it to be \"appropriate.\"\u00a0 \"I'd say let's use this funding rather than individual donations to the Foundation,\" Kress replied without detailing any reasoning.\u00a0 NOVA confirmed to CBS News beginning this semester Dr. Biden's salary was funded through its foundation. A spokesperson said the funds \"are not attributable to any specific donor\" and that \"the 'Brazil Grant'\u2026 is institutional shorthand for the unrestricted proceeds of a grant NOVA completed in 2019.\" The first lady had hoped to return to campus in January, and asked if she could be there \"to zoom for classes...to keep work separate from WH,\" according to discussions between administrators. The request was denied because administrators were limiting faculty on campus during the pandemic until \"possibly mid-February,\" the administrators' wrote. \"In the meantime, the resources of the College...are fully available to support Dr. Biden Biden while she is teaching remotely.\"\u00a0 As of this week, the first lady's office confirmed she is still teaching remotely.\u00a0 \"I was waiting to see for many years what it would look like for a first lady to be employed outside the White House because I was always concerned about conflicts of interest and security. I really just wondered if it was really going to work,\" Myra Gutin, first ladies historian and professor emerita of communications and journalism at Rider University told CBS News. \"It looks like Jill Biden has made it work.\"\u00a0 Correspondence obtained by CBS News also reveals a glimpse of her commitment to teaching and her enthusiasm for the job. Last July, as she helped her husband campaign for the White House, Dr. Biden submitted her leave of absence for the fall teaching semester.\u00a0 \"I am not ready to retire...but I KNOW we have to work as hard as we can to win. So, I'm going to sign up for hybrid training for teaching NEXT semester,\" Dr. Biden wrote in an email to an associate dean about the leave request. \"Life has taken such surprising turns for all of us\u2026 hope you and your family are well. Thanks for your patience,\" Dr. Biden concluded, with a pink double-heart emoticon next to her name, a frequent part of her email signatures.\u00a0 But teaching has its drawbacks, too, like online training courses. \"She was locked out of her account because of the training but has finished most of the training courses now,\" the college's dean told colleagues in December.\u00a0 Emails also showed something of the impression she's made on her colleagues. When a Wall Street Journal opinion piece in December questioned her use of the title of \"doctor\" before her surname for her doctorate in educational leadership, her colleagues were quick to defend her. \"We are so proud of the work you do as an English professor at NOVA and know you will bring inspiration and grace to your new position as First Lady,\" a group of 13 faculty members wrote to her a night before Inauguration Day, including a Zoom group photo of them wearing t-shirts with the words: \"Doctor, First Lady, Jill Biden.\"\u00a0 They dubbed her: the \"Teacher-in-Chief.\"\u00a0 Bo Erickson is a reporter covering the White House for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday encouraged House Republicans to work across the aisle to pass President Biden's sprawling infrastructure package, saying the \"door is open\" for bipartisan cooperation. \"I've been in Congress long enough to remember when bipartisanship was not unusual and that actually building infrastructure has never been a partisan issue. They made it partisan under President Obama by shrinking the bill. Hopefully the need is so obvious now that Republicans will vote for it. We'll see,\" Pelosi said in an interview with \"Face the Nation.\" \"The door is open. Our hand is extended. Let's find out where we can find our common ground. We always have a responsibility to strive for bipartisanship.\" Mr. Biden put forth his $2 trillion infrastructure proposal late last month and has deployed five members of his Cabinet to lead the efforts to push the plan through Congress. Pelosi said last week she hopes lawmakers would pass the measure before the month-long August recess, but with Democrats holding a slim majority in the House and power in the Senate evenly divided \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris casts tie-breaking votes \u2014 there is little room for error. Pelosi, however, believes public sentiment will drive Republicans to support Mr. Biden's package. \"The public understands that the worst and most expensive maintenance is no maintenance,\" she said. \"And we have to maintain our roads, our bridges, our mass transit. We have to upgrade our water systems. We have to build out our broadband for distance learning and telemedicine and the rest of that. So we have a big responsibility. We have a big need to the tune of trillions of dollars.\" But garnering Republican support for Mr. Biden's plan will be an uphill battle. GOP lawmakers take issue with the size and scope of the package and argue a small portion addresses traditional infrastructure, such as roads, bridges and waterways. They also object to the president's plan to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% to pay for his $2 trillion measure. Congresswoman Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the House, indicated that even if Democrats were willing to lower the new corporate tax rate, such a concession would not be enough for GOP lawmakers to sign on to Mr. Biden's infrastructure plan. \"The bill would need to be fundamentally redone,\" she said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"It would need to be a different bill. It would need to actually focus on infrastructure, not on so many of the additional Green New Deal spending priorities, spending priorities that are focused on helping Democrat allies around the country.\" Pelosi, however, batted down the suggestion of the measure being trimmed down to focus specifically on physical infrastructure, which would boost the likelihood the plan passes with Republican support. \u00a0 \"Overwhelmingly, this bill is about infrastructure in the traditional sense of the word. We also think that infrastructure \u2014 there's a need for workforce development in order to have the workforce fully participate in how we go forward and childcare so that women can be involved in that as well. So it's physical infrastructure. It's also human infrastructure that is involved,\" she said. Cheney said in addition to the corporate tax hike, she expects there to be middle-class tax increases to cover the cost of the president's infrastructure package, which Republicans oppose. Mr. Biden has vowed that any infrastructure legislation would not raise taxes on the middle class. \"This is a pattern that we watch the Democrats use time and again, where they massively increase spending. They massively expand the size and scope of the federal government, and then they come back around and impose middle-class tax increases,\" she said. \"So those are not things that we support, not things that I support.\" While Democrats are focusing on ushering Mr. Biden's infrastructure proposal through Congress, Republicans are grappling with the future of the party, as former President Donald Trump continues to maintain a tight grip on the GOP. During remarks before the Republican Party's top donors on Saturday night, Mr. Trump continued to falsely claim the 2020 presidential election was rife with widespread fraud and criticized former Vice President Mike Pence for resisting pressure to toss out states' electoral votes when Congress convened to count them January 6. Cheney, who was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump for incitement of insurrection on January 6, criticized the former president for using the same language during his keynote address that provoked the mob of his supporters three months ago.\u00a0 \"As a party, we need to be focused on the future. We need to be focused on embracing the Constitution, not embracing insurrection,\" she said.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Eric Adams, the Brooklyn Borough president, is projected as the winner of the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, according to the Associated Press. The former New York City Police Department captain ran as a more moderate Democrat and made curbing crime his central issue. Adams will be favored in the general election matchup against Republican Curtis Sliwa because of the high percentage of Democrats and liberals in New York City. If Adams wins in November, he'll be New York City's second Black mayor. He jumped out to a lead on primary night as the first choice of voters who cast ballots during in-person voting. Adams held on to that lead as various rounds of ranked-choice voting tallies were conducted.\u00a0 The Board of Elections released updated results on Tuesday night that included the bulk of absentee ballots and showed Adams ahead of his closest rival, former New York City Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, by 8,426 votes.\u00a0 \"While there are still some very small amounts of votes to be counted, the results are clear: an historic, diverse, five-borough coalition led by working-class New Yorkers has led us to victory in the Democratic primary for Mayor of New York City,\" Adams said in a statement. \"Now we must focus on winning in November so that we can deliver on the promise of this great city for those who are struggling, who are underserved, and who are committed to a safe, fair, affordable future for all New Yorkers.\" New York City's first citywide ranked-choice election had its bumps. Last week the Board of Elections had to retract unofficial ranked-choice results from in-person voting because test ballots were accidentally included in the final tally. The board released the correct results the following day, showing Adams with a two-point lead over Garcia with just the in-person votes tallied.\u00a0 While Adams' lead tightened on Tuesday after the majority of absentee ballots were included, he still maintained a one-point lead over Garcia. She congratulated Adams on Wednesday morning and celebrated what she had accomplished in the race. \"We proved that you can compete even without decades of being in the political machine,\" Garcia said. \"This campaign has come closer than any other in history to breaking that glass ceiling and selecting New York City's first female mayor. We cracked the hell out of it and it's ready to be broken.\" Civil rights attorney Maya Wiley was eliminated in the second-to-last round of Tuesday's ranked-choice voting tabulation. Wiley was in second place for most of the rounds, but Garcia passed her by about 12,000 votes after former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang was eliminated. Yang encouraged his supporters to rank Garcia second on their ballots, a move that seems to have given Garcia an edge over Wiley.\u00a0 \"We now have an initial and uncertified counting of absentee ballots and tabulation of Rank Choice Voting. It would be an understatement to express dismay at the (Board of Elections') administration of this election,\" Wiley said in a statement. \"Today we simply must recommit ourselves to a reformed Board of Elections and build new confidence in how we administer voting in New York City. New York City's voters deserve better, and the (Board of Elections) must be completely remade following what can only be described as a debacle.\" Wiley said she will have more to say about the next steps \"shortly.\" Adams' projected victory came the same day that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a disaster emergency due to the spike in gun violence. Murders in New York City are up 8.5% compared to last year and shootings are up about 38%.\u00a0 Crime was the central issue of Adams' candidacy. He frequently said during his campaign that the city needs solutions for both intervention -- to address the spike in crime -- and prevention, which would address some of the root causes of crime. He has also said that he'll strike a balance between confronting rising crime and ensuring racial justice. On \"CBS This Morning\" Wednesday, Adams maintained that New York needs to treat gun violence \"as a public health emergency.\" He said too many people have \"demonized public protection\" because \"we have too many abusive officers who were allowed to stay.\" Adams insisted that he will support NYPD officers, but wants those on the force to put public safety first even if morale is low.\u00a0 \"I say to my officers, 'If you don't want to be on the street anymore, then get off my streets,'\" Adams said. \"I don't want to hear someone say because they don't like what government is doing, (they're) not going to protect my public.\" \"I'm going to have the finest officers. I will have their backs, but they're going to have the backs of the people of this city,\" he added. \"We're not going to make laws that are not going to be hurtful to the public and to our law enforcement officials.\" Adams was beaten by police officers when he was a teenager in South Jamaica, Queens, while he was in custody. He says that inspired him to become a police officer to try to change the department from the inside.\u00a0 His opponents criticized him for saying that some controversial police tactics like \"stop-and-frisk'' can be an important tool for police officers. He assured voters that he would not allow the practice to go back to the way it was used under former mayors Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg.\u00a0 A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the NYPD misused the practice in an unconstitutional manner and specifically cited Adams' testimony against the practice.\u00a0 In addition to his career with the NYPD, Adams also served four terms in the New York State Senate. He was elected Brooklyn Borough president in 2013.\u00a0 The New York City Board of Elections said Tuesday there are still hundreds of ballots that are eligible to be cured, which means voters can fix issues so the ballots can be counted. The final deadline for some of the ballots to be cured is July 14. After that, the board will proceed with certifying the election results.\u00a0 CBS News political reporter.",

I'm confident he could have done a fantastic job. I can think of no more passionate, devoted ally to working people in this country,\" Biden said Friday. \"But after Tuesday's results in Georgia, giving Democratic control to the United States Senate and a tie vote, Bernie and I agreed \u2014 and as a matter of fact Bernie said \u2014 we can't put control of the Senate at risk on the outcome of a special election in Vermont.\" Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff picked up two\u00a0Senate seats in Georgia\u00a0on Tuesday, securing\u00a0control of the U.S. Senate\u00a0for their party.

            "article_content": "In his new book \"The Way Out: How to Overcome Toxic Polarization\" (coming in June from Columbia University Press), Peter T. Coleman, co-executive director of the Advanced Consortium on Cooperation, Conflict and Complexity at Columbia University, examines conflict resolution, the importance of overcoming political and social schisms, and healing the divides. Read the author's preface below, and don't miss Susan Spencer's interview with Coleman on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" April 4! It feels both urgent and frivolous to sit with my laptop and opine about the science on reducing toxic forms of polarization, while my various devices send me constant updates on the reality of the increasingly tense, poisonous, fractured state of our union. Initially, the context was Birtherism, Benghazi and Brexit, but then jumped to Russian hacking of our elections, the Mueller inquiry and Trump's impeachment. Then, amidst this crisis of Western democracy, my family and I suffered the profound, unexpected loss of a dear, 27-year old friend of ours, the only son of our closest friends. Immediately afterward came COVID-19 (which we contracted in February), a near-complete worldwide social and economic shutdown, and unprecedented levels of civil unrest in our streets triggered by the perpetual stream of brutal killings of unarmed black Americans at the hands of our own police. I am deeply shaken. We are destabilized. In the context of this maelstrom, I wrote this book. It will not rid us of predatory despots, racists, misogynists, anarchists, or other types of extremists and opportunists who take advantage of our divisive human tribal tendencies in order to gain power. These are pathologies afflicting societies around the world \u2013 which are nearing epidemic levels in the USA \u2013 and which many leaders in politics and the media have learned to play like maestros. It is clear to me that these forces must be actively challenged, fought, blocked, controlled and legally constrained if our original vision of American democracy \u2013 of optimism and egalitarianism and fairness and E Pluribus Unum (out of many, one) \u2013 is to ever be realized. However, this book is not about how to win this fight. It is about finding another way out of it. I grew up in middle America in a lower working-class family who struggled to make ends meet. Born in Chicago, my mother, siblings and I fled a dangerous situation there (my father drank, gambled and owed money to violent men) and moved to Iowa when I was ten, where I was thereafter raised in a single-parent home. Although my mom worked to exhaustion, we found ourselves needing to go on welfare, so I began working at ten-years-old to help out. Since then, I have held over fifty different jobs, many of them menial labor, to make my way out of hard times. Despite being pigeonholed as an indigent \"Industrial Ed\" kid in high school, I attended college at a state school, moved to New York City, eventually got a PhD, and today live on the Upper West Side where I am proud to be a professor of peace and conflict studies at Columbia University. All this to say that I feel a genuine connection with, and concern for, both Americas: rural and urban, poor and well-off, progressive and conservative. No, I am not a fan of Donald Trump, and feel his mean-spirited divisiveness, trivialization of facts, truth and science, and profound selfishness and recklessness are dangerous in a president. But I understand why some see him as a folk hero, and so am an advocate for many Trump voters as well as adamant anti-Trumpers \u2013 I understand how they got there. Because I, too, am angry. There is an old tale about a Cherokee elder who was teaching his grandchild about life, who said, \"A fight is going on inside you. It is a terrible fight between two wolves. One wolf represents fear, anger, envy, greed, arrogance and ego. The other stands for joy, peace, love, hope, kindness, generosity and faith. The same fight going on inside you is inside every other person, too.\" The child thought about it for a moment and then asked, \"Which wolf will win?\" The old man replied, \"The one you feed.\" These days, my enraged, fearful, arrogant wolf is well-fed. I feel perversely energized by my distain for leaders on the other side of our political chasm and bewildered by their followers. I feel constantly pulled into fits of self-righteous certainty and disgust. There is an obsessive, addictive, contagious quality to all this. Our violent wolves are battling their vicious wolves to the death \u2013 damn the consequences! All the while our kinder, more generous, hopeful wolves are left battered, withered, quivering on the ropes. Writing this book is my attempt to resuscitate our compassionate wolves.  A hundred years ago, Mary Parker Follett, one of the great unsung heroes of the 20th century, did exactly this by offering a vision for quelling violent labor strife and oppressive management practices in the U.S. Follett was an American social worker by trade who wrote prophetic essays about business, industrial relations and management. In the early 1900s, she offered a view on reducing worker-management enmity that was a radical departure from the prevailing orthodoxy, which believed in the raw use of threat, coercion and control to overwhelm one's opponent. At a time when management philosophy was deeply rooted in what came to be known as \"Theory X\" (the belief that workers are basically lazy, irresponsible and greedy and need to be controlled by a strong hand)[i], and when coercive, \"power-over\" approaches to employee management and union strategy prevailed, she offered an alternative. She wrote, \"It seems to me that whereas power usually means power-over, the power of some person or group over some other person or group, it is possible to develop the conception of power-with, a jointly developed power, a co-active, not a coercive power\u2026 Coercive power is the curse of the universe; co-active power, the enrichment and advancement of every human soul.\"[ii] In Follett's view, one of the most effective ways to reduce the use of abusive forms of control and stem the battle in industry was to make them less relevant \u2013 by developing the idea, the capacities, and the conditions that foster co-active power and integrative solutions for all involved. As such, she was able to rise above the poisonous, polarizing struggles between labor and management that had threatened the survival of many organizations of her time by appealing to those in the middle and encouraging both sides to see the value of working together to improve their mutual conditions. Although it took decades, Follett's vision was ultimately transformational, spawning widespread movements \u2013 in participatory leadership and inclusive management practices, constructive conflict resolution, and employee empowerment and teamwork in organizations \u2013 that continue to enhance our lives today. My aim is similar. While I fully recognize that the battles against our more destructive political forces and tendencies must continue unabated, I hope to offer an alternative way out of our current dystopian struggles \u2013 one that will be sufficiently hopeful, attractive and feasible to make the more combative approaches to them become much less germane. In the end, while we may need both wolves to survive, our humanity, our decency, and our sense of community and solidarity depends on the capacities of our kinder ones to thrive. The pathological nature of the current climate of contempt that we are trapped in is a first-order problem. Unless our nation can find its way out of it, we will never be able to come together sufficiently to address the other wolves at our door \u2013 deadly novel pandemics, the tipping-point of climate change, the unsustainable brutality of racism and inequality, and the quite sudden disappearance of a majority of our jobs to emerging technologies. Existential challenges of this nature and scope require a unified response. They demand we be at our best. Recent events have reminded me, once again, of the incredible promise of the human spirit and of the devastating fragility of life and brevity of our time on this planet. They have made me refocus my energies on doing everything I can to make our world a more just and generous place. So, in good faith, I offer this book to my America, to our America, with the genuine hope that it can help us all to find a better way out together. [i] McGregor, D. (1960).

            "article_content": "In this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast, CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett talked with Boston University professor Ibram X. Kendi, author of \"How to be an Anti-Racist\" and \"Stamped from the Beginning,\" about racism and its legacy in America. Kendi observes a tendency in people who support racist policies to say that they personally are not racist; he argues that racism should not be defined \"in a way that exonerates us,\" but instead \"based on the evidence and the material reality.\"\u00a0 \"[A] racist is someone who is expressing an idea of racial hierarchy or supporting a policy that's leading to racial inequity. An anti-racist is the very opposite: someone who is expressing an idea of racial equality, or supporting a policy that's leading to racial equity,\" Kendi told Garrett. By that definition, anyone who supports a policy that results in racial inequity is being racist. \"We have been taught throughout this nation's history that the reason why certain racial groups have more is because they've worked harder, is because they're smarter, and other groups have less because they haven't worked as hard, they aren't as smart. And so therefore, we haven't, as a people, commonly recognized that actually the racial groups are equals, and the reason why certain groups have more or less is because of bad policy,\" Kendi said. Kendi also briefly addressed the recent controversy around \"critical race theory,\" an academic framework that posits that racism is a social construct that is embedded in the country's legal, economic and political systems. Several states have considered banning critical race theory from being taught in schools, with some conservatives worrying that it teaches that white people are inherently racist. \"It's really unfortunate, because anyone who has studied critical race theory \u2014 what we know is that if it's going to teach anybody to not like something, it's going to teach them to not like racism,\" Kendi said. He talked about how white supremacy has historically been detrimental to White Americans, as well as Black Americans. Kendi discussed the poor whites of the antebellum South \"whose poverty was directly related to a few thousand slaveholding families,\" and the many working class poor whites also harmed by Jim Crow laws because they could not pass literacy tests. He tied this to the slew of recent laws under consideration or passed in Republican-led states that would restrict voting rights. \"In the next election you're going to have White people who struggle to vote, because of a series of voter suppression policies,\" Kendi said. \"I think that it's important for White Americans, for people of color, to realize that as we create more equitable policies for the community, we're going to benefit because we're members of the community.\" One of the searing moments in our culture took place last year, when the cell phone video of George Floyd being pinned to the ground as a White police officer kneeled on his neck for over nine minutes sparked months of protests against police brutality and racial violence. \"I think for many people, watching George Floyd's murder, his slow murder, they just no longer could deny it. They could no longer deny that there was a huge problem that a police officer could literally kill someone like that in broad daylight and then even later claim he was not guilty,\" Kendi said. Derek Chauvin, the white police officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was found guilty of murder by a jury in April. Kendi also touched on Juneteenth, which was officially made a federal holiday on Thursday when President Biden signed the bill into law. Kendi said companies that have recently sought to celebrate the day and emphasize its importance must do more to truly change systemic issues of race in the country. \"There's no easy way out of racism,\" Kendi said.

            "article_content": "Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday tried to lay the groundwork for Puerto Rico to become a state, introducing a bill that would set up a vote for residents to decide on statehood and the election of its own senators and representatives. The bill was introduced by Representative Darren Soto of Florida, a Democrat, and Delegate Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, the island's resident commissioner, a Republican, and Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico plans to introduce it in the Senate. The measure has the backing of Puerto Rican Governor Pedro Pierluisi. Its supporters argue that the federal government doesn't treat Puerto Rican citizens equally, something statehood would help rectify. Soto says the bill has about 50 co-sponsors. At a news conference Tuesday, he pointed to the hardships the island has endured, including the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria in 2017, and he argued residents deserve the same representation as all Americans. \"They have finally decided that enough is enough, that their territorial status and second class citizenship isn't working and it's time for change,\" Soto told reporters. But the bill contradicts a proposal written by Puerto Rican Representatives Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last summer. The two outlined a panel of elected delegates who would decide what the best long-term solutions would be for the island, giving the options of independence or a statehood or territory status. A spokesperson for Ocasio-Cortez told CBS News the congresswoman does not back the statehood bill and continues to support a \"process of self-determination for Puerto Rico.\" Last August, Ocasio-Cortez wrote in an opinion piece on NBC News that the island's residents should determine for themselves if they want statehood. \"The key is that this framework would be developed by Puerto Ricans and for Puerto Ricans, not dictated to them like so many previous policies,\" the two wrote. The proposal received instant backlash from pro-statehood supporters in the House. In November, Puerto Rico residents voted 52 to 48% in favor of immediate statehood on a ballot referendum. But the congressional passage of Puerto Rico statehood is far from guaranteed. In the Senate, the measure would need 60 votes, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has declared that statehood for the island would result in the election of two more Democratic senators, though there's no guarantee that this would be the case. \u00a0 While the new bill does not address the $129 billion in debt that is crushing the island, Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n said Puerto Rico currently does not have enough programs to \"get out of poverty.\" \"This is not an issue of the Republican Party. This is not an issue of the Democratic Party,\" she said. \"This is an issue of the rights of American citizens living in Puerto Rico that need to be heard.\"",

            "article_content": "We streamed, we Zoomed, we ordered groceries and houseplants online, we created virtual villages while navigating laptop shortages to work and learn from home. In many ways, 2020\u2032s pandemic-induced isolation threw our dependence on technology into overdrive, snipping away at our real-life connections while bringing digital relationships to the fore. But for every life-changing Zoom, there was at least one soon-forgotten Quibi. Here's a look at the year's tech wins and fails. As the world adjusted to a new stuck-at-home reality, the pandemic could have been virtual reality's chance to offer an escape. With the use of special headsets and accouterments like gloves, the technology lets people interact with a 360-degree view of a three-dimensional environment, seemingly a good fit for people stuck indoors. But people instead turned to easier-to-use software and games they already had. Few rushed to spend hundreds of dollars on a clunky new headset or learn the ropes of virtual reality meeting software. And no VR games broke into the mainstream. So virtual reality, on the verge of success for decades, missed its moment \u2014 again. It was the year of warning labels on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and even TikTok. Ahead of the U.S. presidential election, the social media platforms promised to\u00a0clamp down on voting misinformation, including baseless charges of fraud and candidates' premature declarations of victory. Their most visible strategy toward this effort was the bevy of warning labels applied to tweets, posts, photos and videos of dubious merit. \"Some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process,\" read one typical label applied to a tweet by President Donald Trump. But many experts said that while the labels made it appear that the companies were taking action, \"at the end of the day it proved to be pretty ineffective,\" as Jennifer Grygiel a professor at Syracuse University and social media expert, put it. Less than a year ago, Quibi launched a splashy Super Bowl ad that posed the question \"What's a Quibi?\" People may still be scratching their heads. Quibi, a portmanteau for \"quick bites,\"\u00a0was a short-form video streaming app started by Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, former CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The startup had set its expectations high, raising $1.75 billion from investors including major Hollywood players Disney, NBCUniversal and ViacomCBS. But the paid service struggled to reach viewers, even as the coronavirus pandemic kept many people at home. Perhaps the aspirational startup never stood a chance against such formidable competitors as the Chinese-owned video-sharing app TikTok, and YouTube, both of which are free. Quibi announced it was shutting down in October, just six months after its launch. Fresh off their initial public offerings the year before and still struggling to show they can be profitable, the ride-hailing services were clobbered by the pandemic in 2020, as people stopped taking cars and huddled down at home. In May,\u00a0Uber laid off\u00a03,700 people, or about 14% of its workforce. Lyft also announced job cuts. But there are some signs of hope. After significantly reducing costs by restructuring in the second quarter, Lyft\u00a0said last month\u00a0it expects to have its first profitable quarter at the end of 2021. And the companies scored a major victory in California, where voters passed Proposition 22, granting them and others an exception to a law that sought to classify their drivers as employees, an expense that analysts thought would have pummeled their business in the nation's most populous state. While India outlawed the popular video-sharing app, in the U.S., TikTok appears close to riding out Mr. Trump's term without the president succeeding in his efforts to ban it. Earlier this month, a\u00a0federal judge\u00a0blocked a potential ban. It was the latest legal defeat for the administration in its efforts to wrest the app from its Chinese owners. In October, another federal judge\u00a0postponed\u00a0a shutdown scheduled for November. Meanwhile, a government deadline for TikTok's parent, ByteDance to complete a deal that would have Oracle and Walmart invest in TikTok has also passed, with the status of the deal unclear. While President-elect Joe Biden has said TikTok is a concern, it's not clear if his administration will carry on the Trump administration's attempts at a ban. In a year heralding splashy new consoles from Xbox and PlayStation, the Nintendo Switch was the console that could. Launched in 2017, the Switch became a fast-seller, followed by the game console's handheld version, the Switch Lite, launched in September 2019. In March, it became hard to find a Switch as people searched for ways to be entertained at home. Boosting Switch's popularity to a whole new level was the release of the island-simulation game \"Animal Crossing: New Horizons,\" which debuted March 20 and has\u00a0now sold\u00a0a cumulative 26 million units globally, according to Nintendo. According to the NPD Group, during the first 11 months of 2020, the Nintendo Switch sold 6.92 million units in the U.S. It has been the best-selling console in units sold for a record 24 consecutive months. While all video-conferencing software from Microsoft Teams to WebEx thrived during the abrupt shift to remote working and schooling by tens of millions of people during the pandemic, only one brand has become the new word for \"video-conference.\" Zoom Video Communications was a relatively unheralded company before the pandemic hit, but its video-conference software's ease of use led to its wide adoption during the pandemic. There were some\u00a0growing pains, including lax security early on that led to \"Zoom bombing\" breaches. The company has since revamped its security and remains one of the most popular platforms for hosting remote meetings and classes. The ransomware scourge \u2014 in which criminals hold data hostage by scrambling it until victims pay up \u2014 reached epic proportions in 2020, dovetailing terribly with the COVID-19 pandemic. In Germany, a patient, who was turned away from the emergency room of a hospital because its IT system was paralyzed by a cyberattack, died on the way to another hospital. In the U.S., the number of attacks on\u00a0health care facilities\u00a0this year was nearly double the 50 that occurred in 2019. Attacks on state and local governments were up about 50% to more than 150. Even grammar schools have been hit, resulting in shutdowns in remote learning for students from Baltimore to Las Vegas. Cybersecurity firm Emsisoft estimates the cost of ransomware attacks in the U.S. alone this year totaled more than $9 billion between ransoms paid and downtime/recovery. After beginning the year grappling with delays in their supply chains, the personal computer industry found itself scrambling to keep up with a surge in demand for machines that suddenly became indispensable amid a pandemic that kept millions of workers and students at home. Worsened by the pandemic, the supply chain delays stymied production as overseas factories were forced to shut down during the early stages of the health crisis. Those closures contributed to a steep decline in sales during the first three months of the year, but the PC market recovered by the end of Q2. It's been boom times for the PC ever since. The July-September period was particularly robust, with PC shipments in the U.S. surging 11% from the same time in 2019 \u2014 the industry's biggest quarterly sales increase in a decade, according to the research firm Gartner. The biggest of the bunch, Amazon, is\u00a0one of the few companies\u00a0that has thrived every moment throughout the coronavirus outbreak. People have turned to it early on to order groceries, supplies and other items online, helping the company bring in record revenue and profits between April and June \u2014 despite its having to spend $4 billion on cleaning supplies and to pay workers overtime and bonuses. But it's not just Amazon. The pandemic is accelerating the move to online shopping, a trend experts expect to say even after vaccines allow the world to resume normal lives. And thanks in part to shoppers consciously supporting small businesses, Adobe Analytics said online sales at smaller U.S. retailers were up 349% on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. At the more than 1 million businesses that use Shopify to build their websites, sales rose 75% from a year ago to $2.4 billion on Black Friday, according to Shopify. Without a doubt, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google did well financially in 2020. Each company's stock price and profits are up considerably since the start of the year. They've gained users, rolled out new products and features and have kept on hiring even as other companies and industries faced significant cuts. But not all is well in the world of Big Tech, and those big profits are part of the problem. Regulators have been breathing down the necks of Big Tech's richest foursome throughout the year \u2014 and that's not likely to ease up in 2021. Google faces an\u00a0antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice;\u00a0and Facebook has been hit with a suit from the Federal Trade Commission, along with nearly every U.S. state that seeks to have it split off from WhatsApp and Instagram. More legal cases could follow. Congressional investigators spent months digging into the actions of Apple and Amazon in addition to Facebook and Google, and called the CEOs of all four companies to testify.",

            "article_content": "Local Atlanta officials have said MLB's decision to relocate its July 13 All-Star Game will cost the region an estimated $100 million in lost tourism dollars. But the decision to move the event is also a financial swing and a miss for the baseball league. That's because MLB officials signed partnership contracts with Georgia businesses and venues across Cobb County for All-Star Game services, such as the Omni Hotel at the Battery Atlanta and the Cobb Galleria Centre, according to local tourism and chamber of commerce officials. Some 8,000 local hotel rooms were set aside for league officials and fans through MLB contracts, according to the Cobb County Travel and Tourism Bureau. Such contracts likely had cancellation clauses requiring MLB to pay a fee for not going forward with the game in Atlanta, sports management experts said. What's unclear is how much money in total those local businesses have charged MLB and if the baseball league has already paid them. The Cobb Galleria Centre was slated to host an interactive MLB exhibit during the weeklong All-Star celebration. The event space has not decided how much it will charge the league for pulling out, a Galleria official told CBS MoneyWatch. The Omni Hotel did not respond to requests for comment. MLB relocated the game after Georgia lawmakers passed sweeping changes in election voting rules. The changes have been labeled by Democrats as a deliberate attempt to suppress voters of color. State Republicans\u00a0contend\u00a0the changes will help ensure the integrity of elections. Soon after the voting changes passed, civil rights activists and dozens of Black business executives pushed major companies like Delta Air Lines and UPS to publicly denounce the legislation. They also pressured MLB to relocate the All-Star Game, also known as the Midsummer Classic, to Denver, Colorado.\u00a0 MLB did not respond to requests for comment on how much moving the game will cost the league.\u00a0 Cancelling the event also means Georgia misses out on the revenue that MLB's All-Star Game would have generated to repay the financing for the Atlanta Braves' Truist Park stadium. According to bond documents, Cobb County taxpayers are on the hook if the stadium's revenue falls short of what's needed to repay the principal and interest on $392 million in bonds issued in 2015 to help construct the facility, which is located about 10 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CBS This Morning she fears MLB is just one of many events this year that could leave Georgia because of the voting changes. Atlanta is the nation's 10th largest economy and among the biggest losers from MLB's decision are working-class Georgians, Bottoms said. \"This is hurting the economy of our state and that's not good for anyone, no matter what side of the aisle you are on,\" she said.\u00a0 Khristopher J.

            "article_content": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, threatened to veto funding for the state legislature Monday after Democrats blocked a controversial voting restrictions bill brought by the GOP. Abbott had said he would sign the bill into law, but state House Democrats prevented it from passing by walking out late Sunday night and denying the chamber a quorum ahead of a midnight deadline. The state constitution allows Abbott to veto certain items in bills, giving him the power to remove the funding for the legislature in the state budget. \"I will veto Article 10 of the budget passed by the legislature.  Article 10 funds the legislative branch.   No pay for those who abandon their responsibilities.  Stay tuned,\" Abbott tweeted on Monday. Defunding the legislature unlikely to have that much of an effect on state lawmakers, who earn only $7,200 per year when not in session and $38,140 when in session, meaning that most legislators hold outside employment when not in session. However, it will affect legislative staff, who are paid through the legislative branch. \"Punishing working class office staff, maintenance, and other support services because he didn't get every single one of his demands is very on-brand for Texas Republicans,\" Democratic state Representative Gene Wu said on Twitter in response to Abbott's announcement. Abbott also announced Monday in a separate statement\u00a0that he would call a special session of the legislature to address the bill, along with other issues. \"Ensuring the integrity of our elections and reforming a broken bail system remain emergencies in Texas, which is why these items, along with other priority items, will be added to the special session agenda,\" Abbott said. Senate Bill 7, the measure blocked by Democrats, includes several controversial provisions that critics say would disproportionately affect poor and minority voters. It also specifically targets voting practices employed this past year in Harris County, the state's largest county, by banning drive-through voting and 24-hour voting. Those practices were used by 140,000 voters in 2020. S.B. 7\u00a0makes it a state jail felony for local officials to attempt to send mail-in ballot applications to voters who did not request them, a practice Harris County tried to do\u00a0in 2020. The bill also limits early voting and implements more restrictions on absentee voting, including adding more identification requirements for those who wish to vote-by-mail.\u00a0 President Biden condemned the bill in a statement on Saturday, calling it \"part of an assault on democracy that we've seen far too often this year\u2014and often disproportionately targeting Black and Brown Americans.\" \"It's wrong and un-American. In the 21st century, we should be making it easier, not harder, for every eligible voter to vote,\" Mr. Biden said.\u00a0 Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "Delhi\u00a0\u2014 People are dying in record numbers amid the surge in coronavirus infections in India. CBS News correspondent Chris Livesay found that even the capital city's hospitals are desperately short on beds, forcing them to turn away people battling symptoms of COVID-19.\u00a0 CBS News watched as one woman showed up breathless at the Moolchand Hospital in Delhi, desperate for oxygen and a bed. The facility has some of the best resources in New Delhi, but there was no space left, so they sent her away.\u00a0 Dr. Nabeel Rahman runs the emergency room at Moolchand, which has been converted into extra space for an ICU that, still, is absolutely crushed with patients. He told CBS News that his team had resorted to purchasing its own oxygen supplies privately, at massively inflated prices, amid a desperate national shortage.\u00a0 The patients in the expanded ICU are extremely sick, but they're also extremely lucky: In a country that's losing the battle against COVID-19, they're lucky to have oxygen, lucky to have access to doctors and lucky to have beds in a hospital that's well over capacity.\u00a0 Many of India's coronavirus victims caught the disease during huge religious gatherings, which were promoted by the Hindu nationalist party of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it campaigned for recent state elections. \u00a0  School teachers were ordered to oversee voting stations, and many were among those who caught the killer virus. About 700 died of COVID-19.  Shad Hasan's mother is one of the teachers who survived, but now she's on life-support, and he told CBS News that he couldn't afford to get her potentially life-saving medication. \u00a0 Like many Indians, Hasan blames India's government for the shortages, and for allowing the huge events to go ahead unchecked this spring, putting his mother and countless others at risk.  \"At this time of crisis, how can you be so stupid?\" he wondered. Hasan said he'd never forgive the country's leaders for missteps that he believes have left thousands to suffer. But for most working-class Indians, the situation is even more dire. People are literally dying in line, waiting to refill oxygen tanks. Bear in mind that India is one of the world's most populous nations \u2014 home to almost 1.4 billion people.  With many cases and deaths going unreported, the true toll that COVID-19 is taking in the country is believed to be up to 10-times higher than reflected in the official figures, which are already harrowing with a death toll over 200,000 and more than 20 million infections confirmed.",

            "article_content": "Several million people stand to save hundreds of dollars in health insurance costs, or more, under the Democratic coronavirus relief legislation on track to pass Congress. Winners include those covered by \"Obamacare\" or just now signing up, self-employed people who buy their own insurance and don't currently get federal help, laid-off workers struggling to retain employer coverage, and most anyone collecting unemployment. Also, potentially many more could benefit if about a dozen states accept a Medicaid deal in the legislation. Taken together, the components of the coronavirus bill represent the biggest expansion of federal help for health insurance since the Obama-era Affordable Care Act more than 10 years ago. Obamacare not only survived President Donald Trump's repeated attempts to tear it down but will now get a shot of new life. Consider a couple of examples: A hypothetical 45-year-old making $58,000 now gets no aid under the ACA. With the bill, they'd be entitled to a $1,250 tax credit, or 20% off their premiums, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A 64-year-old making $19,300 already gets generous subsidies that reduce premiums to $800 a year. But with the bill, that person would pay no premiums for a standard plan. Because health insurance is so complicated, consumers are going to have to do their homework to figure out if there's something in the bill for them. And health care benefits are not like stimulus checks that can be blasted out. Experts say there will be a lag as government agencies, insurers and employers unpack the bill's provisions. There's also a political twist. Since most of the health care aid is keyed to the pandemic and expires by the end of 2022, that will let Democrats set up election-year votes to make new benefits permanent, or build them out even more. \"There was always a hope that we were going to be able to return and build on where we started in 2009-2010, and we finally got to a place where it was possible,\" said Judy Solomon of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Her organization advocates on behalf of low-income people and was an early supporter of the health care law. \"We had this massive fight that went on for 10 years,\" said blogger Robert Laszewski, who followed Obamacare for an industry audience. \"Over the weekend, it's like it's been erased.\" The COVID-19 bill follows President Joe Biden's strategy of building on the health law to move the U.S. toward coverage for all. It's still unclear how big a dent the legislation will make in the number of uninsured people, which has risen to an estimated 33 million or more. A major health care item in the bill will depend on some Republican-led states going along. States mainly in the South have refused to expand their Medicaid programs to low-income adults under the ACA. The legislation offers them a temporary infusion of billions of dollars to reconsider. If those states, including Texas, Florida and Georgia, were to do that, Biden would be closer to his coverage goal. Even if the hold-outs spurn the offer, the legislation provides plenty of other benefits. The biggest winners will be the more than 11 million people already enrolled in Obamacare as well as those who are now shopping for HealthCare.gov coverage. Biden has opened up a special sign-up period through May 15. The bill would change the formulas for health insurance tax credits to make them more generous for most people, and also allow a wider number of individuals to qualify. That makes coverage more attractive for people who are considering whether to buy and more affordable for those who already have it, mainly low-to-moderate income working people. Insurers are hoping that the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will be able to quickly update HealthCare.gov software, allowing the companies to promote lower premiums and attract more consumers while the current sign-up window remains open. The industry also wants the agency to automatically adjust what existing customers are paying, sparing millions the headache of having to go back and reapply. In a politically significant change, the bill would provide health insurance tax credits to people with solid middle-class incomes who don't now qualify for help with their premiums. That's a demographic that includes many self-employed people and business owners who were hit with higher premiums as a result of the ACA, but cut out of the benefits. Their complaints fueled Republican opposition to the health law. \"These are the people Trump was responding to,\" said Laszewski. Another inducement is aimed at people who have lost jobs. Those who collect unemployment this year, if even for one week, would qualify for the most generous ACA tax credits as well as its biggest reductions in copays and deductibles. Other people who lose their jobs may want to keep their employer coverage. A federal law known as COBRA allows that, but the employee has to pay the full premium, often a prohibitive expense. The bill would provide a temporary 100% subsidy. Republicans cite the health insurance provisions as an example of coronavirus overreach by Democrats. Policy consultant Brian Blase, a former health care adviser in the Trump White House, said most of the additional subsidies for coverage will merely substitute for what private households would have otherwise paid. If made permanent, he predicts that over time the sweeter tax credits will have the unintended consequence of enticing small businesses to stop offering coverage to their workers. \"This subsidy expansion largely replaces private spending with government spending.\" Blase said.",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney that aired Sunday, April 11, 2021, on \"Face the Nation. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with the number three Republican in the House, Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney, she is also joining us from Capitol Hill. Good morning to you, Congresswoman. REPRESENTATIVE LIZ CHENEY: Good morning, MARGARET. Thanks for having me. And congratulations as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. I love having powerful women back-to-back.\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: That's right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Straight to you on-- REP. CHENEY: Powerful women who are mothers of five, you know.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I- and I think there is something to that in terms of wrangling cats, no doubt. REP. CHENEY: That's probably right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2017, you did support the idea of spending, you know, President Trump's proposal of a trillion dollars on infrastructure. Nothing ever came of that, of course. But you liked the concept. Why are you opposed to it now? REP. CHENEY: Well, it's a very different proposal, obviously. Something less than 6%, as you mentioned, of this proposal that President Biden has put forward is actually focused on infrastructure. The National Association of Manufacturers has said that we will probably lose over a million jobs if this is enacted. And- and you are certainly going to see in addition to the corporate tax increases in the bill, you'll see middle-class tax increases. This is a pattern that we- we watch the Democrats use time and again, where they massively increase spending. They massively expand the size and scope of the federal government, and then they come back around and impose middle-class tax increases. So those are not things that we support, not things that I support. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that tax increase you're talking about with the National Association of Manufacturers, that was losing a million jobs over two years. It was specifically targeting the corporate tax rate going about 28%. Is that an area you're focusing in on? If Speaker Pelosi offers you an olive branch and says we'll go down to 25%, for example? I mean, is that something you can work with? REP. CHENEY: Look, the bill would need to be fundamentally redone. It would need to be a different bill. It would need to actually focus on infrastructure, not on so many of the additional Green New Deal spending priorities, spending priorities that are focused on helping Democrat allies around the country. You know, we- we have already, as you pointed out, appropriated trillions of dollars since January and- and last year as well. I'm really concerned about the impact on the economy, the potential inflationary pressure that we might see with this additional injection of cash. And- and so much of it is unnecessary. Six percent is actually focused on the kind of infrastructure that- that there is bipartisan support for. So I would urge Democrats, let's focus on that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Portman, Republican colleague of yours, said 20% of the bill, if you're generous, is on infrastructure. You're- you're putting it even lower at 6%. On the question, though, of paid leave, which is something that Speaker Pelosi says is a long-term goal of hers, is that something you can get on board with? REP. CHENEY: Look, MARGARET, I think that there are fundamental differences in how the Democrats and the Republicans approach the economy. We know that we've got to enact policies that are going to help spur this economic recovery, policies that are going to create jobs, policies that are- are not going to expand the federal government so that it's involved in every aspect of our lives. We understand that the engine of economic growth is the private sector.-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But as you know, that was so key when it came to female- female employment in this past pandemic-related contraction.\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: Look-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that something that you think is necessary? REP CHENEY: I think that it is very important for us to provide opportunity for everyone. And I think that, you know, one of the things the Democrats often do is they sort of try to segment- segment women out and say, well, these are the women's issues. I think that women need to be in a position where they know that their elected officials are doing everything possible to keep them safe, to keep the nation safe, to get their kids back in school. If you want to talk about what is really going to help women get back to work, it's getting schools open again. And Speaker Pelosi, four times now since January has blocked the Reopen Schools Act from consideration on the House floor. Those are the kinds of things we ought to be focused on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker John Boehner was just on CBS Sunday Morning saying January 6th should have been a wake up call for your party. It was an example of \"political terrorism,\" was a phrase he used. And he doesn't understand why more in your party don't speak up. You did speak up and President Trump is threatening to primary you. Was separating yourself worth the risk? REP. CHENEY: Look, January 6th was clearly an attack that was attempted to stop the counting of electoral votes. I just listened to Speaker Pelosi say that, quote, right now we're in a good place. We're not in a good place. We absolutely need- and it is her responsibility to create a commission, a bipartisan commission to study what happened, to understand what the provocation was, to understand what happened, to make sure that it never happens again. After every major crisis in this country whether it is September 11th-- MARGARET BRENNAN: There wasn't- there wasn't Republican support for the version she put forward,--\u00a0 REP. CHENEY: Well. MARGARET BRENNAN: --which would have had a Democratic majority. REP. CHENEY: The version that she put forward was not bipartisan. It was very heavily partisan towards the Democrats. This is a serious issue. It shouldn't be a partisan issue. You just had 140 national security officials from Republican and Democratic administrations send a letter to Congress saying, we need a commission. I think that's the single most important thing we need to do-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REP. CHENEY: --to make sure that kind of attack never happens again. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, unfortunately, last night the president- the former president, seemed to be talking in a proud way about the crowd size on January 6th. He gave the speech at Mar-a-Lago. He was the keynote speaker at the RNC fundraiser and- and talked about Vice President Pence not doing more to stop the election certification, according to reports in the Times and The Post. So is he really the best messenger for the party? REP.\u00a0 CHENEY: You know, the- the former president is using the same language that he knows provoked violence on January 6th. You know, as a party, we need to be focused on the future. We need to be focused on embracing the Constitution, not embracing insurrection. And I think it's very important for people to realize that a fundamental part of the Constitution and- and of who we are as Americans is the rule of law. It's the judicial process. The election wasn't stolen. There was a judicial process in place. If you attack the judicial process and you attack the rule of law, you aren't defending the Constitution. You're at war with the Constitution. And for us as a party going forward, we have to embrace the Constitution and we also have to put forward positive solutions. We've got to be the party of hope, of aspiration, of inspiration. The party that recognizes and understands that, you know, that the taxes need to be low. The government needs to be limited in size, strong national defense, those substantive things, not the party of- of insurrection. MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker Pelosi just said it's up to your party to take responsibility for Congressman Matt Gaetz, who, as you know, is undergoing an ethics investigation. Are you ready to call for his resignation? Or are you going to wait? REP. LIZ CHENEY: You know, as soon as the mother of- of daughters, the charges certainly are sickening. And as the speaker noted, there's an ethics investigation underway. There are also criminal investigations underway. And I'm not going to comment further on that publicly right now, MARGARET. MARGARET BRENNAN: Were you surprised at these allegations? REP. LIZ CHENEY: I'm not going to comment further, MARGARET. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, well, here's one of your chief critics, so I needed to offer you that opportunity, as you well know. REP. CHENEY: Thank you for the opportunity, MARGARET. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congresswoman. We will leave it there. We'll be back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us.",

            "article_content": "Harry Reid, the son of a Nevada miner who rose to become one of the most powerful Democrats in Senate history, has died, his family said Tuesday. He was 82. Reid's family said in a statement that he died Tuesday afternoon after a \"four-year battle with pancreatic cancer.\"\u00a0 \"We are so proud of the legacy he leaves behind both on the national stage and his beloved Nevada,\" his wife, Landra Reid, said in a statement. \"Harry was deeply touched to see his decades of service to Nevada honored in recent weeks with the renaming of Las Vegas' airport in his honor.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted that Reid was one of the \"most amazing individuals I've ever met.\" \"He never forgot where he came from and used those boxing instincts to fearlessly fight those who were hurting the poor & the middle class,\" Schumer tweeted. \"He's gone but will walk by the sides of many of us in the Senate every day.\" Reid was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, after serving two terms as a congressman from Nevada's newly-created 1st district. Reid accumulated power in the Senate through the years, being chosen as minority whip in 1998 and eventually rising to become Democratic leader in 2005. He led the Senate Democrats until his retirement in 2016 amid health problems. Famous for his deal-making skills, Reid was key to getting all 60 Democrats on board with former President Obama's signature piece of legislation, the Affordable Care Act. He credited his support of Obamacare to his early years with no access to health or dental care. \"Health care. The Affordable Care Act. I have talked about that a little bit,\" Reid said in his farewell speech in the Senate. \"It would have been wonderful if we had something like that around to help my family when we were growing up.\"\u00a0 Reid was born in Searchlight, Nevada, a former mining boomtown, in 1939. His father was a rock miner and his mother did laundry for the brothels and casinos \u2014 and neither had a high school diploma. In his farewell speech to the Senate in 2016, Reid said Searchlight had about 250 people and \"had seen its better days.\" \u00a0 Reid worked at a service station in high school where he used the money he earned to buy his mother new teeth, and since the town had no high school, he went to high school in Henderson, Nevada. Reid said that he and his brother were born at home because there was no hospital, and he said he didn't go to the dentist until he was 14 years old.\u00a0 Reid's father, who the former senator said suffered from depression, died by suicide when Reid was 32 years old and serving as Nevada's lieutenant governor. At Basic High School, Reid met his future wife, Landra Gould, who he was married to for 62 years.\u00a0 In the Senate, Reid was not only famous for favoring his home state's issues, such as mining and the gaming industry, but also for being an avid partisan and dealmaker \u2014 in 2003, he persuaded Republican Senator Jim Jeffords to switch parties and become a Democrat, giving Democrats the majority in the Senate. Reid first took a leadership position in 1999 and led the Democratic opposition to privatizing Social Security and after becoming Majority Leader in 2006, he became more vocal in opposing the Iraq War.\u00a0 When Obama took office in 2009, Reid pushed through the former president's priorities \u2014 the stimulus package and then the Affordable Care Act. That cost Reid politically: In the 2010 election, he won by less than 300 votes, according to Politico.\u00a0 In 2013, Reid advocated for Democrats to eliminate the filibuster for judicial appointments. He told The New York Times he \"had no choice\" but it cost Democrats when they lost the majority in 2014 and. Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell used it to his advantage to appoint conservative justices during former President Trump's presidency.\u00a0 Reid remained steadfast in his opposition to the filibuster, saying at a 2020 event that \"it's not a question of if it's going to be gone, it's only when it's going to be gone.\"\u00a0 Reid sustained an exercising injury in 2015, forcing him to wear an eye patch after undergoing several surgeries. He announced later that year that he would not seek a sixth term. His chosen Democratic successor, Catherine Cortezo Masto, won his seat that year. After Trump's election, Reid told New York magazine that he wouldn't miss Washington. \"If Hillary had won and had a Democratic majority, I would have really missed the action,\" he said. \"With this, no, I'm not going to miss it.\"",

            "article_content": "California Governor Gavin Newsom wants to send $600 stimulus checks to state residents under a multibillion dollar spending plan he introduced this week.\u00a0 About 11 million low- and middle-income Californians would receive payments under Newsom's so-called Golden State Stimulus plan. Households with annual income of between $30,000 and $75,000 would get $600 payments, while families with at least one child would receive an extra $500, or a total of $1,100. Newsom said during a press conference in Oakland on Monday that two-thirds of Californians would receive a stimulus payment under his proposal. \"Direct stimulus checks going into people's pockets and direct relief \u2014 that's meaningful,\" Newsom said. Newsom's plan to send cash to Californians comes as he\u00a0faces a recall election. Newsom's rivals in the race, including former San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer, criticized the stimulus check plan.\u00a0 \"One-time payments for just one year isn't enough, not nearly enough,\" Faulconer told the Associated Press. \"We need permanent, lasting tax relief for middle-class families.\" If passed, the stimulus checks would total $8.1 billion. Newsom has also proposed spending $5.2 billion to help residents make rent payments and $2 billion for assistance to pay past-due utility bills. The proposal needs approval from state lawmakers.\u00a0 California is gradually emerging from the pandemic with a $76 billion state budget surplus. The surplus stems from wealthy Californians paying more in taxes last year, along with $27 billion in federal\u00a0 pandemic relief. Other states are receiving federal pandemic aid this week, as well. \u00a0 California lawmakers said they've lifted many pandemic-related restrictions and residents are returning to work, but some families are still struggling financially. Another round of stimulus checks would help those households, particularly low-income families, they said.\u00a0 Some federal lawmakers also believe another round of stimulus payments would help families across the nation. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker and others are pushing for a fourth round of stimulus aid that would effectively send recurring payments until the coronavirus pandemic ends. Of the three rounds of federal stimulus issued during the health crisis, most recipients say they've used it to pay down debt, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Individual states are also getting their own version of a stimulus payment. The U.S. Treasury Department said Monday that $350 billion in state and local government COVID-19 relief payments are going out this week. The money is meant to replace revenue that governments lost during the pandemic. Most of the $350 billion \u2014 a little over $195 billion \u2014 is slated for state governments. Counties will split $65 billion and major cities will divide $46 billion, with the rest spread among tribal governments and smaller government entities.\u00a0 Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said this week that governments can use the funds \"to return to a semblance of normalcy\" and \"rehire teachers, firefighters and other essential workers.\" Most governments will receive the federal funding in two batches, one this year and the other in 12 months. States that saw their unemployment rate increase by 2% or more since February will get one large sum. Governments must spend the funding by the end of 2024.\u00a0 The Associated Press contributed to this report. Khristopher J. Brooks is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering business, consumer and financial stories that range from economic inequality and housing issues to bankruptcies and the business of sports.",

            "article_content": "California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday expanded a drought emergency to a large swath of the nation's most populous state while seeking more than $6 billion in multiyear water spending as one of the warmest,\u00a0driest springs on record threatens another severe wildfire season across the American West. The Democratic governor said he is acting amid \"acute water supply shortages\" in northern and central parts of California as he called again for voluntary conservation. Yet the state is in relatively better shape than it was when the last five-year drought ended in 2017, he said, as good habits have led to a 16% reduction in water usage. His emergency declaration now includes 41 of 58 counties, covering 30% of California's nearly 40 million people, and he said a further expansion is likely as conditions worsen. The U.S. Drought Monitor shows most of the state and the American West is in extensive drought just a few years after California emerged from the last punishing multiyear dry spell. \"We're staring down at what could be disastrous summer and fall, with the potential of communities running out water, and fires,\" said Democratic U.S. Representative Jim Costa, who accompanied Newsom to the announcement made before a Central Valley reservoir with a deep bathtub ring of dry earth surrounded by browning grass. Like most of the state's extensive interconnected system of reservoirs and canals, the San Luis Reservoir is at less than 60% of its seasonal average as scarce winter rain and snow turns to a dry summer that Newsom said is imperiled by climate change. Officials fear an extraordinarily dry spring presages a wildfire season like last year, when flames burned a record 6,562 square miles. \"The hots are getting a lot hotter in this state, the dries are getting a lot drier,\" Newsom said. \"We have a conveyance system, a water system, that was designed for a world that no longer exists.\" That requires the state to envision \"a much more resilient, a much more vibrant, much more dynamic water delivery system,\" he said, noting that the one largely constructed in the last mid-century to carry water from Northern California to the south, \"helped us build the world's largest middle class\" by enabling the state's population and agricultural growth. The governor is asking state lawmakers to approve what he said is a record $5.1 billion over four years for water projects, plus another $1 billion to help an estimated million Californians who are behind on their water bills in part because of the economic hardship of the pandemic. His proposed water spending includes $1.3 billion for drinking water and wastewater systems and prioritizing smaller and poorer communities. Another $200 million would go to repair canals damaged when the ground beneath them sank as more groundwater was pulled from wells. Other projects would address groundwater cleanup, water recycling, fish and wildlife habitat, flood preparedness, weather forecasting and agricultural water use. His expanded drought emergency declaration includes the counties in the Klamath River, Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Tulare Lake watersheds across much of the northern and central parts of the state. The Sierra Nevada snowpack, which provides about a third of the state's water, was at just 59% of the average on April 1, when it is normally at its peak. This year is unique because of extraordinarily warm temperatures in April and early May, Newsom said. That led to quick melting of the Sierra Nevada snowpack in the waterways that feed the Sacramento River, which in turn supplies much of the state's summer water supply. The problem was worse because much of the snow seeped into the ground instead of flowing into rivers and reservoirs, he said. The warmer temperatures also caused water users to draw more water more quickly than even in other drought years, he said, leaving reservoirs extremely low for farmers, fish and wildlife that depend on them. That all reduced the state's water supplies by as much as what would supply up to 1 million households for a year, he said. Newsom urged residents to limit their use, whether by limiting outdoor watering, checking for leaks, or taking shorter showers and turning off the water when washing dishes or brushing teeth. Senate Republicans blamed majority Democrats for not building more dams to increase water storage, with GOP leader Scott Wilk saying in a statement that the governor's declaration \"does nothing to remove regulatory roadblocks that hold up shovel-ready water projects.\" Newsom is spending the week previewing highlights of the revised budget he will present to state lawmakers Friday for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Earlier Monday in the San Francisco Bay Area, Newsom proposed tax rebates of up to $1,100 for millions of lower- and middle-income Californians, one leg of a pandemic recovery plan made possible by an eye-popping $76 billion budget surplus. The barnstorming comes as Newsom faces a fall recall election driven in large part by frustration over his handling of the pandemic, though he noted that he also previewed his budget proposals in the past when he wasn't facing a recall. \"This expanded #drought declaration should have happened weeks ago,\" tweeted former Congressman Doug Ose, one of the Republicans who wants to replace Newsom. \"Playing politics like this with people's livelihoods doesn't do anybody any good.\" The governor's fellow Democrats, who control the Legislature, have until June 15 to pass a spending plan.",

            "article_content": "Buffalo is the second-biggest city in New York. It's the third-poorest city in the nation. It could soon be the first major American city in six decades to elect a socialist as mayor. And now, Buffalo is a flashpoint for the national divides in the Democratic Party. \"This race has taken on a life of its own,\" India Walton, the Democratic nominee in Buffalo's mayoral race, told CBS News. \"I feel the weight of the nation watching what is happening in Buffalo right now.\" Walton shocked the city when she won the Democratic primary in June. She's a 38-year-old nurse and community activist who has never worked in government. She'd be the city's first female mayor. Walton ran as a Democratic socialist against incumbent Mayor Byron Brown, a Democrat running for a fifth term. She won by 1,500 votes. \"This is organizing,\" she told a cheering crowd on the night of her upset victory. \"When we organize, we win.\" But Brown didn't concede. Instead, he's running against her as a write-in candidate.\u00a0 Buffalo could be the first major U.S. city in decades to elect a socialist mayor \u2014 India Walton.The incumbent she beat in a primary, Byron Brown, is running against her as a write-in.A Democrat wins either way \u2014 but the race reflects a national divide https://t.co/RvTIbUZef0 pic.twitter.com/zxrN42ENU8 He said just days after his primary defeat that his supporters didn't want \"a radical socialist occupying the mayor's office in Buffalo City Hall.\" And he set up a campaign office right across the street from hers. Walton is endorsed by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders \u2014 who started his political career as the socialist mayor of Burlington \u2014 and by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned for her in Buffalo last weekend. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York also endorsed her. Brown, who is Buffalo's first Black mayor and calls himself \"a progressive moderate,\" is getting considerable support from Republicans, real estate developers and Buffalo's police union in his write-in campaign. Meanwhile, New York State's Democratic Party and Governor Kathy Hochul, who's from Buffalo, haven't issued an endorsement, even though Walton is officially the Democratic nominee. In the race's final days, both candidates are running on the same question: What would actually happen if a socialist becomes mayor? \"A socialist mayor is not going to kill business,\" Walton said. \"A socialist mayor is not going to take away people's rights to own private property. A socialist mayor is not going to unleash a reign of crime and disorder on the city.\" Walton said that under her leadership, Buffalo has \"to go back and address the root causes of concentrated poverty.\" A top priority for her first year in office is building new housing for lower and middle class residents. She wants the city to have a universal basic income. And she said the wealthiest Buffalonians will pay higher taxes to fund city services. \"We're going to see those things happen in real time, and we're going to prove that it works,\" she said. Brown said Walton will either hurt the city's economy, or just not get much done. \"She doesn't know what city government does from what county government does from what the state government does,\" Brown told CBS News. \"She just mixes it all together like the mayor is some all-powerful figure.\" But he's surprised Walton's idea connected with so many voters in Buffalo. \"What I underestimated was there were people that organize around a socialist ideology, and they had organized in a section of the community that came out in pretty large numbers,\" he said. Others saw it coming. \"The conditions here put Buffalo in the forefront\" for a socialist candidate, said Henry Louis Taylor, Jr., the University at Buffalo's Director of Urban Studies. \"How do you deal with the reality that this a majority Black and people of color city, and most of them are poor?\" he said. Taylor pointed out that across the country, \"socialism is no longer a dirty word with a lot of people.\" \"People are looking and searching for answers, because they realize that a lot of things that they face today are not working.\" Buffalo is a Rust Belt city whose population and economy declined for decades. Downtown development has boomed under Brown, with the creation of new hotels, businesses and a built-up waterfront. But poverty has barely budged under Brown's four terms. Today, more than 28% of Buffalo's resident live in poverty \u2014 an improvement of just 1 percentage point since Brown took office in 2006. And 43% of Buffalo's children are living in poverty. When asked if he takes responsibility for those numbers, Brown told CBS News that if it wasn't for his efforts, \"the poverty rate here could be a lot deeper.\" \"Of course I'm concerned about where poverty is right now,\" he said. \"And within my powers, as mayor of the City of Buffalo, I have done everything that could possibly be done, and continue to do, to improve it.\" Walton says that poverty is personal, and that it shaped her campaign. She had her first child when she was 14 and dropped out of high school, later earning her GED and a nursing degree from a community college. Walton said that just a few years before her campaign, she had left an abusive marriage and struggled to support four children on a nurse's salary. She teared up while recounting her story to CBS News. \"I'm walking my five-year-old in 20 degree weather five blocks home with four bags of groceries. Right?\" she recalled. \"And I'm a registered nurse.\" \"I know the struggle and I don't want people to have to be exceptional to live a decent life,\" she added. \"You should just not. And when you fall, when you make a mistake, there should be somebody there to pick you up. And I don't see anything wrong with that.\" Voters will decide November 2 which Democrat will go to Buffalo City Hall. And what they decide will send a message to Democrats far beyond Buffalo. \"The problems that Buffalo face are the problems that America face,\" Taylor told CBS News. \"In Buffalo, what we're seeing is a battle that is sure to take place over the years in a growing number of the cities around America.\" Early voting in Buffalo runs through Sunday, October 31. Election Day is November 2.\u00a0 Absentee ballots must be postmarked by November 2. For voter information, visit: elections.erie.gov",

            "article_content": "In her first novel, \"The Cave Dwellers\" (Scout Press, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, a division of ViacomCBS), Christina McDowell, author of the acclaimed memoir \"After Perfect,\" writes of a Washington elite whose bloodlines and exclusive status can't protect them from murder. Read an excerpt below. Genevieve Banks was the epitome of chic. She never left the house without stockings or her signature Yves Saint Laurent hot-pink lipstick with Chanel beige lip gloss slathered on top. She was no dummy. A buyer for Lord & Taylor in her early twenties, she'd met Mr. Banks when he was still a young lawyer. \"I just knew he would make a lot of money on his own,\" she would say to her girlfriends, as if his family money weren't the reason she'd decided to marry him. But there would always be money \u2013 and she deserved some sort of prize for it. Mrs. Banks was a girl of good breeding: educated, Ivy League parents (though her parents didn't come from money, they were intellectuals, upper middle class). She was \"good enough\" to marry up, but she never felt good enough. Not many people knew this, but she was often a jealous person, competitive with her friends; it made most wonder if she even had any real ones. She was the kind of woman who knew how to find a man and, more important, how to keep him. When she and Mr. Banks had sex, she often sounded like she was tasting apple pie for the first time: \"Mmm, mmmm, mmmmm!\" She embodied a whole new vision of \"fake it till you make it.\" When Mrs. Banks became more notable in the Washingtonian social circle, hosting book parties and election parties and fundraisers for nonprofits like Teach for America, then moving up to hosting events at the French and British Embassies, she became known not just in Washington but through the social ranks of New York. This made Mr. Banks nervous because he couldn't control her or keep his family contained anymore, which meant he would have a harder time protecting them: Washington Life, New York Social Diary, the Washington Post Style Section, The Glam Pad blog, Facebook, Instagram! And Audrey, poor thing, was Little Miss Popular, because it was becoming easier and easier to pay for friends, creating a curated virtual path into the life of a rich kid whom everyone could envy and want something from (Instagram stories on private jets: prayer hands, heart emoji!). Which, of course, posed an even greater risk of breaching the privacy Mr. Banks tried so hard to protect \u2013 something the old families of Washington coveted. A \"quiet\" reputation was desired among the elite of the elite. Those whose old money and manner lurk through the cobblestone streets of Georgetown, Kalorama, and Capitol Hill; those whose names can only be found in the exclusive Green Book \u2013 a discriminative, secret diary founded by the niece of Edith Roosevelt's social secretary \u2013 the names of Very Important People. Everyone inside it is wealthy, everyone inside it is powerful, and everyone has a reputation to protect. The pecking order at the top, the aristocratic bloodlines woven into the fabric of Washington, generation after generation after generation, only socialize within their inner circle, which is impenetrable \u2013 turning a blind eye to those who come and go on the political merry-go-round, yet rooted within the very foundation America was built upon. But what they have failed to understand is that the world is changing. It wasn't until the Banks family was murdered that everything about their legacy was called into question. They're called the Cave Dwellers. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Excerpted from \"The Cave Dwellers\" by Christina McDowell.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Dr. Scott Gottlieb that aired on Sunday, September 19, 2021, on \"Face the Nation.\" DOCTOR SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think that the public health establishment as a whole has taken a hit in the setting of this pandemic, and this isn't just a sort of Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal thing. I think that there's a lot of people around the country who feel that the advice they got from public health officials wasn't precise, changed wasn't- wasn't formulated in a way where it was sort of immutable, wasn't carefully explained, wasn't propagated in a way that it could be assimilated into people's lives. You know how do I wear a mask? What masks should I wear? When should I wear a mask? When not? And things changed. And so people were confused by it and lost confidence in it. MARGARET BRENNAN: You say the CDC, which is supposed to be the gold standard public health agency, doesn't have an operational capability to manage a crisis of this scale. So if the CDC doesn't, who does? DR. GOTTLIEB: Nobody does. I mean, there was a perception early on in this crisis that the CDC has this that they would have the capacity to develop a diagnostic test and deploy it and gather the data that we would need to sort of scope out what the contours of the response would be, and they would be able to deploy the diagnostic test and deploy the vaccine and stand up this infrastructure. They're not a logistical organization. CDC has a very retrospective mindset. It's a high science organization that does deep analytical analysis of data that's oftentimes out of sync to when the decisions need to get made. They're not the Joint Special Operations Command. They don't surface real time information to- to inform current policymaking.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not a quick reaction force. DR. GOTTLIEB: Right. They'd rather take the data, analyze it for months and publish it in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. And the idea that they were going to be able to mass manufacture a diagnostic test and forward deploy it, they clearly- they contaminated their own tests. So they- they- they botched the manufacture of their tests. MARGARET BRENNAN: We needed to turn to private industry, earlier in the pandemic. DR. GOTTLIEB: We need an all of the above approach. Certainly by the end of January, we had enough awareness that this could be a global pandemic, that someone could have hit the red button and said, we need it- and all of the above approach here. But CDC had the ball. The CDC was following their standard blueprint. Their blueprint is- could keep up with a slow moving outbreak, but in a fast moving epidemic like this, it was unmatched now. CDC should have raised their hand and said, we really don't have this. I think-- MARGARET BRENNAN: why didn't they?\u00a0 DR. GOTTLIEB: I think it's very difficult for an agency to have the self-awareness that they don't have the capacity to respond the way they're being asked. We need to get FEMA and the DOD engaged with the CDC and try and organize a national level response and that that was a failure of political leadership. I mean, and there was a failure of vision. But you know, there were a lot of people who were good political leaders who wrongly assumed the CDC had this mission. MARGARET BRENNAN: You say the point isn't that federal health officials were wrong. The point is they were working with faulty tools, faulty data sets. They didn't know what they didn't know. DR. GOTTLIEB: They didn't understand that this wasn't spreading like flu. If you're just looking for flu symptoms, you might not see coronavirus spreading. So they were very confident early on that there was no community spread. We should have been doing things differently in anticipation that this probably was spreading. We just weren't picking it up, which in fact was the case. MARGARET BRENNAN: You also say this should have been viewed as a national security threat, and that's how we need to think of pandemics. DR. GOTTLIEB: I think the Intelligence Committee has different tools that should be focused on this mission. We have to look at public health preparedness through the lens of national security. We make certain preparations for things that are unlikely to happen. But if they happen, they're so catastrophic that we have to prepare. We cannot allow something like this to hit us this bad again, so we have to prepare differently domestically. But internationally, we rely on other nations to tell us when they have an outbreak. That has repeatedly failed. It failed in this case, China didn't surface the early information. They still haven't shared the source strain. So the question becomes, can we still rely on the International Health Regulations and the W.H.O. in the World Health Assembly? Are we going to all hold hands again and promise that we really mean at this time and we're going to share information? Or do we need to get our clandestine services more engaged in this mission? And I think we're going to need to get our clandestine services more engaged in this mission. There was data very clearly available in China in Wuhan that if we were looking for it, we could have detected this much sooner. We could have answers. Some questions we could have seen the asymptomatic spread. We could have seen the human to human transmission. You could have had some key questions answered early that could have allowed us to mount a more robust response and a two or four week head start on something like this can make a very big difference.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you learn in the course of your research about the origins of COVID? DR. GOTTLIEB: I learned that we're not going to answer this question absent one of two things happening. Either we find the intermediate host, the animal that was the one that spread COVID, or there's a whistleblower inside China. Or someone close to this who knows that this came out of a lab comes forward, defects, goes overseas. Or we intercept some communication that we shouldn't have had access to. Absent something like that, we're not going to be answer this question. This is going to be a battle of competing narratives. I think over time, the side of the ledger that- that says that this might have come out of a lab has grown more robust and the side of the ledger that says that this came out of a natural species has not really moved. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you say came out of a lab, you were saying through a lab accident, not a construct. DR. GOTTLIEB: The administration has said this in the intelligence report they put out. They've sort of firmly debunked the idea that this was something that could have deliberately come out of a lab or was deliberately engineered. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do we need to know who Patient Zero is? DR. GOTTLIEB: If we determine that this came out of a lab or we even assess that there is a probability that this came out of a lab, I think it changes how we try to govern research internationally. The most speculative, most dangerous research often goes to the countries willing to conduct it, and the countries willing to conduct it are oftentimes the countries that have the poorest controls. The other thing we're going to need to look at is do we continue to do things like publish the sequences of novel viruses? Once you publish that sequence as part of normal scientific discourse and part of the scientific process, you basically provide a recipe to anyone who's a rogue actor on how to manufacture that virus. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: What is the lesson for the Biden administration as they roll out boosters, do they need to change the playbook from what the Trump administration did? DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I think the logistical lesson on the rollout of the boosters is that they need to have in place the infrastructure to actually distribute those vaccines in hard to reach communities and hard to reach settings. I think what the Biden administration has done here is by backing into an approximate date, they're now able to start that planning process in advance. If FDA does authorize it and the advisory committee, the CDC ultimately judges it to be appropriate for a certain population. They're going to be ready to start making it available in the nursing homes right away, so there's not going to be a delay. So I think they're in a better position. I don't know that the vaccine boosters are going to be controversial from the standpoint of sort of right versus left politics. I think where the fault lines are going to be is on some of the mandates that the administration is putting in place. MARGARET BRENNAN: How does it sit with you when you hear members of your party, the Republican Party, describe all this along civil liberties lines not making the medical argument, but simply around civil liberties? DR. GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, I think it's a misjudgment. There is this argument that this is an individual choice. Your choice to get vaccinated is an individual choice and it's not an individual choice. This is a- this is a decision that affects your community. This is a collective choice. If you go- and just like with childhood vaccinations, if you go into a school setting and you're not vaccinated for measles and you introduce measles into that setting, you're affecting your community. So I don't think governors should tell schools and businesses you can't mandate a vaccine. If a business makes a decision that the only way that I could protect my employees or my customers is by having a fully vaccinated workforce, they should have the ability to make that decision.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not just shots. We're talking about masks. DR. GOTTLIEB: And the mask debate is inexplicable to me. I can't- I can't decouple it. I can't explain it. I can't defend it. People generally have an apprehension about taking a medical product, especially when they're healthy, especially for a preventative purpose. I understand just sort of people's general questions and concerns about a novel medical product, but a mask is such a simple intervention it's not going to cause you any harm. It's just an act of, you know, community responsibility. It's an act of respect. And I think, you know, the federal government is well within its right to mandate vaccination for federal workers, for health care workers. I think even mandating vaccination within the Medicare program could be something that's defensible. But when you impose the mandate down to the level of small businesses, now you're setting up the political fault lines and you're taking something that was sort of subjectively, political and it's going to be objectively political. So are you going to get enough benefit from a public health standpoint for the price you pay in terms of hardening those lines? I think that was worth a very vigorous debate, I hope the White House had it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which governors handled this the worst? DR. GOTTLIEB: Certainly looking at South Dakota, where this was just allowed to travel largely unfettered with public health interventions where you saw one of the highest death rates per capita. You have to look back and say that was a bad experience. Once we learned how to treat this, once we were able to reduce the case fatality rate by half, by the summertime, when we got there, we got there pretty quickly. States that were still excessively engulfed by this and had a lot of death and disease, those were important policy decisions. Those were in part, the result of policy choices that those states made. MARGARET BRENNAN: I think about the first few days where this strange virus that was just surfacing started to make headlines here at home. You were starting to see things that weren't yet really being raised as red flags. How were you on the outside seeing things that they weren't seeing on the inside? DR. GOTTLIEB: There was a presumption again that the CDC has this. The department has this. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is in control. So, they let- they let that health care apparatus run with the ball. And it really wasn't until probably more like the end of February, the March timeframe that you saw the White House really starting to get engaged and pull this away from the Secretary of Health Human Services and health care institutions and start to at least try to more actively manage it. And that was the- the genesis of the coronavirus task force. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's been reported that you were actually considered to come and run that task force. Is that true? DR. GOTTLIEB: You know, I don't know for sure. The president asked me to come in. I met with him, I met with the vice president and asked me to take a position as sort of as an adviser or helping oversee the task force after the vice president had been put in charge. That felt like it was moving along and more real. Ultimately, it didn't come together.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? DR. GOTTLIEB:\u00a0 I don't know for sure. There were probably people in the White House who wanted to see me in that position and probably people in the White House who didn't. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you regret though,\u00a0 not being on the inside? You had been with the Trump administration until 2019.\u00a0 DR. GOTTLIEB: So I regret not being at the FDA. I don't know that there was much that I could have done dramatically differently inside the White House, and eventually I would have worn out my welcome because it would have been people inside the White House who wouldn't have liked what I was preaching. If I had been at FDA with my staff working with the career staff in the device center, I'm pretty confident that we would have made a very hard pivot to try to instigate the private industry to start getting engaged and developing diagnostic tests early in January. MARGARET BRENNAN: And so you wish somebody at the FDA was doing that. DR. GOTTLIEB: I think that would have had to happen at the commissioner level. It couldn't happen below that level. If I would have called any big manufacturer, though, they would have done it. I have no doubt about that. Having been there and having made those calls and having known that CEOs responded positively in moments of public health crisis. That's the one thing I wish I was there to do. And you know, I wrote articles about doing that at the time. I was writing articles in January. This is what we should do. But, you know, writing op-ed's and putting things on Twitter isn't like being there and actually being able to pick up the phone, effectuate the action. I wish I was there. I think that that's- the- the FDA and the OPHHS, the operational divisions of HHS is where the action happens. That's where you can really affect the outcome, affecting the outcome from the White House. Much harder.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNA: As you write in March, when you went in to speak with the president that he was serious, he knew the grave risks. DR. GOTTLIEB: There was a point in time when they were very concerned about this willing to take dramatic actions. But later on, their attitudes really changed to the point where when the president was contagious with COVID, he ceremoniously took his mask off. And so what message does that send to the country? But my view is that they were sold on the idea that you weren't going to be able to really affect the spread and that anything you did was just going to have so many repercussions in terms of impact on children who might not be in school. Impact on the economy, that the costs were worse than the disease. And the schools is a perfect example of the lack of effective policymaking. So the single reason why most schools remained shut was because the CDC was telling them they had to keep kids six feet apart. If- if CDC has said you can only- you have to keep kids three feet apart, then a lot of schools would have been able open. And in fact, when the Biden administration wanted to open schools in the spring, this past spring, they got the CDC to change that guidance from six feet to three feet. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you write that the six feet was arbitrary. DR. GOTTLIEB: The six feet was arbitrary in and of itself, nobody knows where it came from. The initial recommendation that the CDC brought to the White House and I talk about this was 10 feet, and a political appointee in the White House said we can't recommend 10 feet. Nobody can measure 10 feet. It's inoperable. Society will shut down. So the compromise was around six feet. Now imagine if that detail had leaked out. Everyone would have said this is the White House politically interfering with the CDC's judgment. The CDC said 10 feet, it should be 10 feet, but 10 feet was no more right than six feet and ultimately became three feet. But when it became three feet, the basis for the CDC's decision to ultimately revise it from six to three feet was a study that they had conducted the prior fall. So they changed it in the spring. They had done a study in the fall where they showed that if you have two masked individuals, two people wearing masks, the risk of transmission is reduced 70% with masks if you're three feet apart. So they said on the basis of that, we can now make a judgment that three feet is an appropriate distance. Which begs the question if they had that study result in the fall? Why didn't they change the advice in the fall? Why did they wait until the spring? This is how the whole thing feels arbitrary and not science based. So we talk about a very careful, science based process and these anecdotes get exposed, and that's where Americans start to lose confidence in how the decisions got made.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You do put blame on President Trump for a few things, but do you think fundamentally looking at everything you've analyzed that the outcome of this pandemic would have been different if President Trump wasn't in office? DR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, it would have been different if we had different political decisions and the White House was exercising different leadership. There's no question about that. There's no question that the White House made mistakes, and the lack of consistency was a big mistake, and also the lack of using the White House as an effective bully pulpit to really galvanize a collective action that can make a difference on the margins, allowing this to sort of get divided along political fault lines in the setting of an election when things were already- the temperature was already very high, I think really hurt us. But stepping back from that, I think that there were fundamental weaknesses with our response that regardless of who is in power, we had an ill prepared bureaucracy. We didn't have the right infrastructure, we didn't have the right agencies. The agencies weren't properly empowered. So even if you had competent leadership, very effective leadership up and down the chain, you still would have had some of the same problems.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday tossed out a closely watched legal battle targeting the Affordable Care Act, rescuing the landmark health care law from the latest efforts by Republican-led states to dismantle it. The court ruled 7-2 that the red states and two individuals who brought the dispute do not have the legal standing to challenge the constitutionality of the law's individual mandate to buy health insurance and ordered the case to be dismissed. Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented. Justice Stephen Breyer delivered the majority opinion for the court. The Supreme Court did not address the constitutionality of Obamacare's individual mandate or whether it can be separated from the remainder of the law, the other two issues raised by the states. \"We do not reach these questions of the Act's validity, however, for Texas and the other plaintiffs in this suit lack the standing necessary to raise them,\" Breyer wrote. The states, the Supreme Court said, failed to show that the individual mandate, \"without any prospect of penalty, will harm them by leading more individuals to enroll in these programs.\" The ruling from the Supreme Court is a major victory for President Biden and Democrats, who have fought to shield the Affordable Care Act from numerous attempts by Republicans to kill it both through legislation and in the courts. Mr. Biden, who was vice president when Obamacare was enacted, has vowed to expand the health care law during his presidency. In a statement, Mr. Biden said the decision \"is a major victory for all Americans benefitting from this groundbreaking and life-changing law.\" \"After more than a decade of attacks on the Affordable Care Act through the Congress and the courts, today's decision \u2014 the third major challenge to the law that the U.S. Supreme Court has rejected \u2014 [shows] it is time move forward and keep building on this landmark law,\" the president said. Former President Barack Obama said the Supreme Court's ruling reaffirms that \"the Affordable Care Act is here to stay\" and pushed for the law to be expanded. \"The principle of universal coverage has been established, and 31 million people now have access to care through the law we passed \u2014 with millions more who can no longer be denied coverage or charged more because of a preexisting condition,\" Mr. Obama said in a statement. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cheered the decision from the high court, calling it a \"landmark victory for Democrats.\" \"Thanks to the tireless advocacy of Americans across the country and Democrats in Congress, the Affordable Care Act endures as a pillar of American health and economic security alongside Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,\" she said in a statement. The Trump administration backed a coalition of 18 red states who sought to topple the law by targeting the individual mandate, which they argued was intertwined with Obamacare and therefore could not be excised from it. But in February the new Biden administration informed the Supreme Court the government reversed its position in the case and believed the mandate to be constitutional.\u00a0 Arguments in the case took place remotely in November, a week after the presidential election and in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which left the Supreme Court's doors closed to the public. The battle marked the third legal challenge to the landmark law, which extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans and provides protection to people with preexisting conditions. This latest dispute challenged the constitutionality of Obamacare's individual mandate, which, as passed, required Americans to obtain health insurance coverage or pay a fine if they failed to do so. But Congress did away with the financial penalty as part of its tax-reform package in 2017.\u00a0 A group of Republican-led states then filed a lawsuit arguing that because the fine was $0, the mandate was unconstitutional because the change from Congress \"made it impossible to fairly interpret\" the provision as a tax, as it was construed in a 2012 legal challenge to Obamacare. In that case, Chief Justice John Roberts joined with the court's liberal wing to uphold the individual mandate. The red states also argued that if the mandate was deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the law should fall. But a group of 20 states and the District of Columbia, joined by the Democrat-led House of Representatives, argued Congress's change to the law \"modified the terms of the choice presented by [the mandate] \u2014 by allowing individuals to freely decide whether to buy health insurance without facing any tax assessment if they do not.\" After the Republicans mounted their legal battle in 2018, a federal district judge in Texas struck down the full law as unconstitutional. Then, in December 2019, a three-judge panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the mandate was unconstitutional, but sent the case back to the lower court to determine whether the rest of Obamacare could stand without it. Democrats were concerned the Supreme Court's ideological makeup \u2014 there is a 6-3 conservative majority \u2014 did not bode well for Obamacare's prospects. But during arguments, Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, appointed by former President Donald Trump, signaled they disagreed with the GOP-led states and believed the mandate could be separated from the rest of the law.",
