            "article_content": "It has long been known that high-income people in the U.S. tend to live longer than those lower down the income ladder. But a growing body of research shows that millions of Americans are, for the first time in more than a century, seeing their life expectancy slip. And, while the reasons for that decline are complex and not yet fully understood, the contours of an explanation are starting to take shape: Despair is shortening their lives. \"One thing we're seeing is that people who are poor live a lot less -- a striking amount less -- than the rich,\" said Diane Whitemore Schanzenbach, an economist with Northwestern University and director of The Hamilton Project, a think tank focused on boosting the country's economic prosperity. \"There are real disparities across the income distribution.\" Schanzenbach is co-author of a paper that explores why some Americans are seeing their longevity decline and mortality rates increase. Specifically, over the past three decades the life expectancy of low-income workers has stagnated. or even declined. (Life expectancy is an estimate of how many more years a person has to live at a given age, while the mortality rate refers to the number of deaths over a given period of time.) Beyond the simple issues of social justice around why some Americans are dying sooner than others, these trends have enormous implications for everything from how the U.S. seeks to reduce poverty, to Social Security costs, to public investment in health care. More broadly, they demand answers to a key question: Are the eroding financial security, diminishing job opportunities and generally grim economic prospects facing many Americans putting them in an early grave? Meanwhile, the socioeconomic currents that appear to be driving these changes in life expectancy are also -- as the U.S. presidential election shows -- roiling our politics. At a time when many Americans are rebelling against inequality and questioning the merits of a globalized economy, getting to the bottom of this divergence in lifespans is a matter of national importance. These findings are not an unrelenting tale of woe, it's worth noting. As Schanzenbach emphasizes, the last century has seen a huge increase in longevity in the U.S. and in other developed nations. Americans as a whole have gained roughly 25 years in life expectancy over that time. Around 1900,  the average woman could expect to make it to 48 years, while life expectancy for men was an even shorter 46. Today, those figures stand at 81 for women and 76 for men. The main factors behind that progress are technological advances, especially in medicine and the production of safer cars. By far the greatest number of deaths in the early 20th century were caused by infections such as pneumonia, influenza, tuberculosis, smallpox and measles. But the development of antibiotics and vaccines has greatly reduced the toll, leaving cancer and heart disease as the major killers. Improved nutrition, better sanitation and changes in social behavior, such as a decrease in smoking, have also boosted life expectancy. So it's no surprise that some Americans continue to see improvements in life expectancy. Between 1999 and 2014, the mortality rate for black men aged 45-54 fell by roughly a third, research shows. Infant mortality rates have also declined. Yet while some Americans can look forward to longer lives and falling death rates, others are seeing the opposite. For the past three decades, the life expectancy of low-income workers has stagnated and even fallen. As a result, a 40-year-old man in the top 1 percent of income earners in the U.S. (those making at least $389,000 a year) can expect to live to 87. Among the bottom 1 percent, a man of the same age can expect to make it to 72. Poorer, middle-aged whites, in particular, are being affected. Between 1999 and 2014, mortality rates for this group have risen roughly 10 percent. The main reason, as economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton showed last year: a surge in deaths among people in this group from drug and alcohol abuse and from suicide. \"It's one thing if everybody is having gains, but some are having gains at more rapid paces than others,\" Schanzenbach said. \"But worsening mortality rates are not something we see very often.\" Another key finding emerging from the work of economist Raj Chetty of Stanford University is that where you are born and grow up has a profound effect on how long you can expect to live. He has found that poor Americans tend to have greater life expectancy in cities with larger populations of high-income, better educated people, such as New York and San Francisco. Not surprisingly, perhaps, such cities also tend to spend more on social services. Life expectancy for the poor is lower in metropolitan areas like Detroit and Washington, D.C., where there is less income diversity and poverty is more widespread. That same gap based on geographic factors is not present for richer Americans. Exactly what accounts for that -- the relationship between geography and life expectancy -- remains unclear. Similarly, for now economists and public policy experts are wary of drawing a direct link between the host of problems caused by diminished economic opportunity and rising mortality rates. Other issues, such as the social isolation and depression that often accompanies poverty, almost certainly also play a role.  And while the recent surge in suicides and poisoning from drugs and booze reveals a disturbing trend in mortality, it doesn't explain why someone ultimately chooses to end his life. \"We are hard at work trying to connect the dots, but at this point it is just speculative,\" Case, the Alexander Stewart 1886 professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One could make a case that as jobs disappear and benefits disappear, it could have a really negative effect on expectations for the future, and that could lead to behavior that cuts people's lives short.\" But \"It's too early to say how much of this is due to changes in the labor market, GDP or employment practices,\" she cautioned. Why have these changes in mortality become apparent only in recent years? One possibility is that the rise in deaths from suicide and poisoning was masked by advances in fighting heart disease. But progress in fighting such diseases has slowed, with the result that deaths that may be linked to what Case calls the \"deaths of despair\" among certain Americans are pushing up mortality rates. What is clear, by contrast, is that among the world's richer nations the divergence in life expectancy is a uniquely American problem. Other wealthy countries haven't seen a surge in suicides and deaths cause by substance abuse, while mortality rates for low-income, middle-aged people have continued to decline. As the research continues, Schanzenbach calls for a shift in how economic issues are thought of and understood. Any discussion of the \"economy\" is, after all, a discussion about people. That requires going beyond the usual focus on growth figures, inflation and wages to consider the many ways in which the economy is, for better and for worse, a matter of life and death.

            "article_content": "MENOMONIE, Wis.\u00a0-- On election night, when Donald Trump claimed victory in her home state of Wisconsin, Shay Chamberlin was so excited she passed out. Chamberlain believes Trump is her savior, sent by God to save America from ruin. She owns a women\u2019s clothing store in this remote town; her husband runs a construction company. They have two children and barely get by on $44,000 a year, living paycheck to paycheck. In his victory speech, Trump called people like Chamberlain and her family America\u2019s \u201cforgotten men and women\u201d - the blue-collar workers in the manufacturing towns of the Rust Belt and the hallowing coalfields of Appalachia who propelled him to an improbable victory. They felt left behind by progress, laughed at by the elite, and so put their faith in the billionaire businessman with a sharp tongue and short temper who promised to Make America Great Again. When Trump first ran, Chamberlain thought to herself: \u201cThat\u2019s the man everybody has been praying for.\u201d And she now feels vindicated by his victory. \u201cThis is a movement,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a candidate anymore. This is a movement.\u201d Not all of Trump\u2019s support came from the blue-collar downtrodden. But the Republican\u2019s overwhelming backing among whites with less than a college education is at least partly a reflection of how little the economic recovery since the Great Recession has benefited them. Their job opportunities have dwindled and their incomes have fallen, even as broader measures of the nation\u2019s job market show improvement. But they also turned to him to hold back the tide of social change: same-sex marriage, transgender rights, a society growing more racially diverse. The white working class, long ignored, found an unlikely spokesman in Trump. He promised to build the wall to keep out immigrants. He promised to tear up trade deals that have ushered American factory jobs overseas. He promised to put blue-collar America back to work and restore the country to a time when white workers felt appreciated and fulfilled. \u201cI feel like, not just most, but all Trump supporters are true patriots,\u201d said 59-year-old Ginger Austin, who owns a graphics company in a tiny town in Jones County, one of the poorest places in North Carolina. \u201cThey love this country. But they\u2019re taking our country away, and they\u2019re changing it. They\u2019re just changing everything. All our rights are just slowly being dwindled away.\u201d She\u2019s angry at the Republican Party she has supported all her life. She is angry at Barack Obama and the Affordable Care Act. She is angry that America is changing, and worried that her grandchildren are growing up in a world too liberal and too politically correct. The nation woke up Wednesday morning to learn just how starkly divided it has grown: Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by less than 200,000 ballots. But Trump won battleground states that had voted for Obama twice. Thousands of registered Democrats, including many former union workers from the mines and factories, crossed party lines and sided with Trump. For example, in Dunn County, where Shay Chamberlin lives, Obama beat Mitt Romney 53 percent to 46 percent in 2012, and John McCain 57 percent to 42 percent four years earlier. But it flipped to back Donald Trump, 52 percent to 41 percent, over Clinton. Scott Hiltgen, a 66-year-old small business owner in Wisconsin, called Washington a \u201ccesspool\u201d of career politicians, aware of and indifferent to the plight of the American worker. \u201cWe are considered flyover country, as you well know, and they don\u2019t care about us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think it was the silent majority that finally said, \u2018Enough\u2019s enough. We want a change. We don\u2019t like the way things are going.\u2019\u201d Middle-aged white men with only high school degrees - the core of Trump\u2019s support - saw their inflation-adjusted incomes plummet 9 percent from 1996 through 2014, according to Sentier Research, a data analytics firm founded by former Census Bureau officials. White male college graduates in the same age bracket, by contrast, saw their incomes jump 23 percent. The Great Recession wiped out millions of middle-income jobs in manufacturing, office administrative work and construction, and those jobs haven\u2019t returned, even as the nation now has 6.5 million more jobs than it did before the recession began. In many parts of the country, they have been replaced with lower-income work in restaurants, hotels, and in home health care. This \u201chollowing out\u201d of the nation\u2019s economy has left many Americans with high school degrees feeling shut out of the middle class. Jerry Blackburn, a retired county official in rural Virginia, said he feels like people from someplace else took all they could from him and his neighbors and then left them with nothing. \u201cThey took our coal out of here and everybody got rich on it. And what did we get?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe got black lung. We don\u2019t have good water to drink, we don\u2019t have roads, we don\u2019t have anything except a bunch of broken down old coal miners that\u2019s forgotten. But everybody else got rich on us.\u201d Miners streamed into a convenience store on a highway between one struggling, West Virginia coal town and another on Wednesday morning. From behind the counter, manager Mary Jones recognized something she hadn\u2019t heard in years: Hope. They talked about jobs returning to this broken-down county. They talked about a chance at a brighter future. They talked about Donald Trump. \u201cI think we sent a message to Washington that we\u2019re tired of them sitting up there doing nothing to help the working-class people,\u201d said Jones, a native of Wyoming County, where the collapse of the coal industry has left behind a string tumbledown houses and a quarter of families in poverty. Coal trucks used to barrel by all day and the parking lot stayed full. No trucks come by anymore. The store is for sale. She\u2019s not sure she\u2019ll have a job much longer and is certain she won\u2019t find another. They struggle to make enough money to pay the bills and write the paychecks. She considers the ballot she cast for Trump as a protest against Clinton and every other member of the political elite. \u201cWorking-class people built this country and now the working class people have been forgotten,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about time they paid attention.\u201d But in West Virginia, Jones worries that the working class is too far gone to be saved. \u201cThere\u2019s some things you can do as a president. And there\u2019s something you can\u2019t. They all make promises, I just don\u2019t know how he can keep all those promises,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel more hopeful today than I have in a long time. But I\u2019m still scared for the future.\u201d",

They are not racist. They did not vote for the Democrats this time.\u201d Globalization, Biden said, has fundamentally altered the economic outlook for these voters -- especially blue-collar white American men -- who are feeling left behind by the political process.  \u201cFor the first time in recent memory, this is one section of American population where the life expectancy has gone down,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is white American men between the age of 40 and 55. They have the highest suicide rate in America.

There has been no election in American history when the negatives of both the candidates have been this high.\u201d Biden concluded his speech on a high note, exhorting his audience to take heart. \u201cI do not care what your political affiliation is, we have to not give up,\u201d he declared. \u201cOne election will not change American.\u201d Julia Boccagno is a digital journalist for CBS News.",

Bernie Sanders on Wednesday said he\u2019s willing to work with president-elect Donald Trump if he\u2019s interested in pursuing policies that help Americans, but he also had a warning for him. \u201cTo the degree that Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him,\u201d the Vermont independent said in a statement.  \u201cTo the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him,\u201d Sanders added. He also tweeted Thursday. If Donald Trump takes people's anger and turns it against Muslims, Hispanics, African Americans and women, we will be his worst nightmare. During the 2016 presidential primaries, Sanders, as a Democratic presidential candidate, often blasted Trump for his \u201cbigotry\u201d and being a \u201cpathological liar.\u201d In his statement, Sanders said that Trump tapped into the middle class\u2019s anger toward \u201cestablishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media.\u201d \u201cPeople are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids - all while the very rich become much richer,\u201d Sanders said.  One area of agreement between Trump and Sanders is their position on trade. Both have been opposed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Trump has advocated renegotiating trade deals. Even Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who often got into Twitter fights with Trump during the 2016 race, said she\u2019s willing to work with him now and \u201cput aside our differences.\u201d In a statement Wednesday, Warren said the integrity of U.S. democracy is more important than an individual election.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- With less than an hour to spare, the Senate late Friday backed legislation averting a government shutdown as coal-state Democrats retreated on long-term health care benefits for retired miners but promised a renewed fight for the working class next year. The vote was 63-36 and sent the stop-gap spending bill to President Obama, who signed the measure early Saturday morning. The Senate also passed and sent the president a $10 billion water bill with money for the California drought. The vote was 78-21. The votes came hours after Democrats dropped threats to block the spending measure in hopes of using the shutdown deadline to try to win a one-year respite for 16,500 miners facing the loss of health care benefits at year\u2019s end. Instead, the legislation provides benefits at a cost of $45 million for four months. Democrats evoked President-elect Donald Trump, a working class hero in coal country, in pressing for more benefits. Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., a potential member of the Trump Cabinet, led the fight of coal-state Democrats. But House Republicans were unrelenting - and had already vacated the Capitol for a three-week holiday - forcing Democrats to concede. Manchin acknowledged Friday night that he did not have the votes to block the bill, but said \u201cthe fight will continue\u201d next year. \u201cI\u2019m born into a family of coal miners. If I\u2019m not going to stand up for them, who is?\u201d he asked reporters. Manchin was meeting with Mr. Trump on Monday. The fight gave Democrats, who suffered devastating election losses a month ago at the hands of working-class voters, a chance to cast themselves and not the GOP as the champion of the common man. Manchin was joined by other coal-state Democrats who face re-election in 2018 in states Mr. Trump won last month, including Pennsylvania and Ohio. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting warmed up,\u201d said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., vowing a fight next year. \u201cThese miners and their families kept their promise, put their lives at risk. ... It\u2019s not too difficult for a senator or House member to keep a promise.\u201d The dispute over health benefits and a separate fight over controversial legislation to shift more of California\u2019s scarce water resources to inland farmers were the final battles of a two-year session marked by constant quarreling. It was capped by a burst of productivity on legislation to authorize hundreds of water projects, repair Flint, Michigan\u2019s lead-tainted water system, and keep the government running through April. Congress will take a break before reconvening on Jan. 3 to get a swift start on repealing key elements of the Affordable Care Act and confirming Mr. Trump\u2019s Cabinet. The underlying funding bill would keep the government running through April 28 to buy time for the incoming Trump administration and Congress to wrap up more than $1 trillion in unfinished agency budget work. It also provides war funding, disaster aid for Louisiana and other states, and an expedited process for considering Mr. Trump\u2019s nominee for defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis. The trucking lobby won permanent relief from recent Transportation Department rules mandating more rest and overnight breaks for long-haul drivers, though the White House and Main Street Republicans were denied in a bid to revive the Export-Import Bank\u2019s ability to approve export financing deals exceeding $10 million. The miners\u2019 issue had history. Seventy years ago, President Harry S. Truman guaranteed a lifetime of health and pension benefits for retired miners to avert a strike. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the four-month extension was better than nothing. McConnell himself represents thousands of miners in the struggling coal industry and said he tried to get a longer solution in talks with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \u201cWould I have preferred that provision to be more generous? Of course I would have,\u201d the Republican said in a speech on the Senate floor. The House had left town on Thursday, creating a dynamic in which the Senate had little choice but to adopt the stopgap measure. Both the funding measure and a water projects bill passed there by sweeping bipartisan votes. Democratic opponents of the popular water projects bill, led by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., assailed provisions to divert more water to corporate farmers. The bill also authorizes long-delayed funding of $170 million to help Flint, Michigan, to fix its lead-tainted water system. Democrats griped that GOP negotiators on the water bill dumped a permanent \u201cBuy America\u201d provision requiring U.S.-produced steel be used in water projects. But that effort lost steam Friday. The spending bill also would provide $7 million to reimburse the New York Police Department for the cost of security around Trump Tower in Manhattan, far less than the $35 million the city requested.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump did what almost no one expected he could do Tuesday night: he overcame a daunting electoral map, virtually all national polling and the expectations of the entire political class to win the presidency. There will be plenty of time for recriminations in the days to come -- and oh, will there be recriminations -- but in the meantime, everyone is asking one big question: how could so many people have been so wrong?  What it comes down to is that Trump\u2019s victory has demolished so many baseline assumptions and truisms of American politics on which politicians and journalists alike have based their thoughts and predictions -- a fact that will perhaps forever change the way we think about and report on politics. Here are the top assumptions that, after Tuesday, have been upended: It is quite an understatement to say that polling had a bad year. Trump himself has long been fond of telling his supporters at rallies that the U.S. presidential election would be another Brexit -- by which he meant that pollsters didn\u2019t expect the United Kingdom to actually vote to leave the European Union, but they did it anyway. A quick glance at the wealth of reputable national polling over the course of the general election finds that the only poll -- the only one -- to correctly and consistently put Trump in the lead was the Los Angeles Times/University of Southern California poll. All the major networks -- CBS News included -- had Clinton with a solid advantage heading into Election Day. Included in the future discussion about polling is exit polling the day of Election Day -- which suggested Clinton would eke out a victory, even in some states where Trump was ultimately victorious. Exit polling data has long been taken as objective truth, but after Tuesday night it\u2019s hard to imagine that happening again. Then-Sen. Barack Obama\u2019s much-vaunted 2008 campaign and its revolutionary use of data and analytics ushered in a new era of politics in which candidates and campaign operatives believed good data would lead to victory. It was a bipartisan conclusion: candidates and officials in both parties began building up high-dollar analytics firms and touting their digital and data efforts. The same goes for a sophisticated ground operation, which goes hand-in-hand with the data and analytics developments of the last eight years. But twice this year, the candidates with the better analytics operations lost: during the primary, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz spent millions of dollars accurately mapping out the GOP electorate and modeling support and scenarios. He fell to Trump. Clinton effectively inherited the data pros of the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaign, and she lost as well. People in the political consultant class who\u2019ve built their careers and their fortunes on telling candidates they should pay big bucks for a data operation have got to be terrified that their livelihoods are about to disappear.  Let this sink in for a minute: With the news Tuesday that former President George W. Bush and his wife Laura literally left the presidential slots on their ballot blank, it\u2019s official that no living former presidents supported Trump in his campaign. John McCain and Mitt Romney, the respective 2008 and 2012 GOP nominees, did not support Trump. A slew of other major party leaders did not support Trump. Many party leaders pulled their endorsements after the now-infamous Trump Access Hollywood tape emerged in October. He won anyway. Gone is the assumption that a candidate without the full support of his or her party can\u2019t win the presidency. Despite Mike Pence imploring Republicans to \u201ccome home,\u201d Trump effectively told the Republican establishment that he didn\u2019t need or want their support. It turns out he was right: he won the presidency without it. It seems almost farcical that the person to do the most to reverse the effects of Citizens United, the landmark Supreme Court case that effectively created super PACs, would be a rich New York business mogul.  In recent elections, the adage has been that more is better: more super PAC cash, more ads on TV, more money overall. Even Democrats, initially reluctant to embrace super PACs, raised some major cash for the pro-Obama, then pro-Clinton Priorities USA and plastered the airwaves with ads. But Trump won this campaign while being massively outspent on the airwaves and with less super PAC money on his side. Clearly, money is no longer the best determinant of who\u2019s going to win. Another post-2008 assumption was that the geographical realignment President Obama brought about -- victories in Mountain West states like Colorado and Nevada, and in East Coast states like North Carolina and Virginia -- were here to stay, at least for the foreseeable future. Obama won because he earned strong support from the demographic groups among the country that are growing -- chief among them African-Americans and Latinos -- so Democrats\u2019 declining share of the white vote was offset. Trump doubled down on working-class white voters -- so even though Clinton too won among African Americans and Latinos, she ultimately lost the election. The fact that Trump\u2019s victory was officially projected after picking up Pennsylvania (which hasn\u2019t voted for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988) and Wisconsin (which hasn\u2019t gone to a Republican since Ronald Reagan in 1984) is proof that he has reshaped the map yet again. Democrats counted on Midwestern Rust Belt states to go Democratic again this November; future Democratic national candidates won\u2019t make that mistake again. Every four years, the party that loses the White House goes through a public and private identity crisis, going over what went wrong and how they need to improve four years down the line. For months now, everyone has assumed the party going through that identity crisis would be the Republicans: after a messy and divisive primary with 17 candidates that resulted in Donald Trump as the party\u2019s standard-bearer, the conventional wisdom was that he would lose and Republicans would have to internally beat each other up over whose fault it was. Instead, Democrats have quite the reckoning coming. Clinton had the better campaign operation, ran more TV ads and had the various wings of the party behind her (albeit reluctantly, on the part of some Sanders-wing progressives). But she still lost -- and what that says about the party\u2019s path and message going forward remains to be seen. Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "KENOSHA, Wis. -- A Chrysler engine plant used to stand on a now-empty lot in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Six years ago it was shut down, and today it is a barren field. At a nearby bar, Jamie Sabena said plant workers used to come there in droves. Hoping for a return to the good old days, she voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cI hope we can get some type of factory work back here in Kenosha,\u201d Sabena said. And she thinks Trump can do that. \u201cHe\u2019s an awesome businessman he\u2019s made everything work,\u201d she said. In 2012, President Obama won Kenosha County by 12 points. This time, Trump eked out a victory by a fraction of a point.  It\u2019s a pattern seen in rural areas and small cities and towns across Wisconsin. Trump won non-college educated white voters by 28 points. Four years ago, Mitt Romney won them by only eight points. Pollster Charles Franklin of Marquette University Law School has been keeping track of Wisconsin voting patterns for years. When asked why Trump won, he said \u201cI think fundamentally he broke through with people that Republicans had not managed to win or mobilize enough in previous elections.\u201d Franklin said another big factor in Trump\u2019s surprising Wisconsin victory is that many Democratic voters simply stayed home. In Milwaukee County, Clinton got almost 50,000 fewer votes than Obama did in 2012. \u201cThe Clinton campaign was supposed to be great at field operations and get out the vote efforts. They weren\u2019t able to pull that out,\u201d Franklin said.  He also agreed that lack of enthusiasm was part of the issue. Chip Reid is CBS News' national correspondent.",

Others, such as repealing Obamacare, will require Congress. Like President Obama eight years ago, the people who put him in office have great expectations. We sat down with three Trump voters at the Minute Grill, where diners have chewed over politics since 1963.\u00a0 \u201cIf Donald Duck had been running against Hillary Clinton, I would have voted for Donald Duck,\u201d said Harold Martin, who is retired Navy.\u00a0 Joe May is a soybean farmer.

This midpoint between Atlanta and Savannah was once a manufacturing hub. On Election Night, America\u2019s rural areas voted overwhelmingly for Trump. Urban areas were Clinton country: She won 81 percent of Georgia\u2019s metro vote. The Trump vote in Dublin\u2019s Laurens County mirrored much of rural America: He won almost 2-to-1. Lance Hooks is a 39 year-old registered Republican. He remembers when Trump campaigned in rural Georgia back in February. \u201cHe was smart enough to come rally his base,\u201d Hooks said. \u201cHis base was the working-class America and that is the reason he got the electoral vote he got.\u201d When Hooks looked at the Electoral College map, he said \u201cTrump had better coverage than Verizon.\u201d Hundreds of people in this area work for three foreign-owned factories. Trump won in counties like this despite his anti-free trade stance because working-class voters think this country needs a CEO.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Labor Secretary Tom Perez is telling senior Democratic officials that he plans to mount a bid for the head of the Democratic National Committee. Perez, who was urged to run by White House officials, will challenge Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the early front-runner for the post, according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the conversations who requested anonymity to discuss private plans. Ellison has faced mounting opposition from top Democrats, labor leaders and some Jewish groups, who\u2019ve raised questions about his comments about Israel, his defense of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and his commitment to his own party. Perez, who was considering a run for Maryland governor, has been contacting top Democrats including governors up for reelection in 2018, according to the strategist, and plans to make his intentions public this week. Representatives of Perez did not respond to requests for comment. Having spent most of his career in appointed government posts, Perez has little experience as a political candidate. But supporters say his Dominican-American background and Rust Belt childhood in Buffalo, New York could help him attract support from Latino leaders and speak to white-working class voters. \u201cHe is a leader whose character and visions are a strong addition to the conversation around where Democrats need to head,\u201d said Henry Munoz, the DNC Finance Chairman, who\u2019s stressed that Latinos must play a major role in discussions about the party\u2019s future. Hoping to assuage some concerns, Ellison said last week that he would resign his seat in Congress if he were picked as chairman by DNC members at the late February elections. \u201cWhoever wins the DNC chair race faces a lot of work, travel, planning and resource raising,\u201d Ellison said in a statement. \u201cI will be \u2018all in\u2019 to meet the challenge.\u201d Even before Perez jumped into the race, the contest has divided Democratic leaders, placing Obama\u2019s team at odds with Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada and his replacement, New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer, whose early support for Ellison was seen as an effort to shore up the liberal flank in Congress. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are also backing Ellison. While White House aides say that Obama is unlikely to comment publicly on the race, behind the scenes his backers have been speaking with Democratic donors and potential candidates to see who else might be persuaded to run, according to several Democrats familiar with the discussions. These Democrats were not authorized to publicly discuss those private discussions and spoke on condition of anonymity. They tried to draft Vice President Joe Biden and former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm, both of whom have ruled out a bid. South Carolina\u2019s party chairman, Jaime Harrison, and the party head in New Hampshire, Ray Buckley, have announced bids, though they haven\u2019t gotten much traction. Missouri\u2019s secretary of state, Jason Kander, who attracted attention for running a surprisingly competitive Senate race this year, says he\u2019s gotten calls exploring his interest in the post. Ellison backers argue that the party must take a more populist approach after the 2016 losses, saying Democratic leaders did too little to address the economic pain of working-class voters.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Vice President Joe Biden closed the door Tuesday on the possibility of leading the Democratic Party after leaving the White House next year. Biden\u2019s name has been floated in recent days among Democratic insiders looking for someone with the stature and position to lead the party out its electoral abyss. Democrats urging him this year to run for the Democratic National Committee chairmanship had said his appeal to white, working-class voters might help the party refocus after losing badly among those voters to President-elect Donald Trump. \u201cThe vice president is not interested in being DNC chair, but he intends to remain deeply involved in helping shape the direction of the Democratic Party moving forward,\u201d his spokeswoman, Kate Bedingfield, said. Largely leaderless other than outgoing President Barack Obama, the Democratic Party early next year will choose a new national chairman following devastating losses in the 2016 elections. Longtime Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz stepped down under pressure during the Democratic National Committee. Since then, interim Chairwoman Donna Brazile has led the party, also under pressure after stolen emails showed she\u2019d communicated with Hillary Clinton\u2019s aides about potential questions to be asked in campaign forums. \u201cJoe Biden is the one person who I think could bring the party together, the progressive wing of the party, the left and center, and start giving a cogent message to those working-class Democrats who abandoned us,\u201d former DNC Chairman Ed Rendell told CNBC earlier Tuesday. Bowing out of the DNC race means Biden will likely cease to have a formal role in the party come January after serving more than four decades in elected office. He\u2019s expected to remain a public voice and has discussed with universities the possibility of setting up a policy center or institute. He\u2019s also said he\u2019ll continue to work on the \u201cmoonshot\u201d he launched after his son died to accelerate cancer research. Biden faced even louder calls last year to run for president, but ultimately declined.",

            "article_content": "\u201cFace the Nation\u201d host John Dickerson will discuss predictions for 2017 with a panel of CBS News correspondents in a segment that will air Sunday. CBS News Justice and Homeland Security Correspondent Jeff Pegues said that he predicts FBI Director James Comey will stay in his job despite the blowback he received from how he handled the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and the last-minute discovery of related emails a week before the election.  \u201cThere are a lot of people in Washington who might disagree with that. But I talked to sources who say that he\u2019s spoken in groups of retired agents and he\u2019s been very comfortable there. And he\u2019s defended his decision as something that he had to do given the cards that he was dealt. So I think he stays at the F.B.I,\u201d Pegues said.  President Obama nominated Comey in 2013 to lead the FBI and the Senate confirmed him for a full 10-year term.  CBS News National Security Correspondent David Martin predicts that President-elect Donald Trump will meet with the leader of North Korea.  \u201cI will predict that he will meet personally with Kim Jong-un and the leader of North Korea and attempt to cut a deal that would somehow at least freeze the North Korean nuclear weapons program,\u201d he said.  CBS News Foreign Affairs Correspondent Margaret Brennan also predicts \u201cfrequent confrontation\u201d under a Trump administration involving pushing the limits of Iran\u2019s nuclear program and with North Korea, which she said is scheduled for another missile test soon.  CBS News chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett predicts Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be a powerful figure in the new administration.  \u201cA year from now we will be writing about Vice President Mike Pence, the most important person in the Trump administration because at every personnel level, at every turn, he will have won more than he\u2019s lost. And whatever the ideology of President Trump, the personnel implementing it will be at almost every vital turn selected, vetted and recommended by Mike Pence. And in more ways than Dick Cheney, a very powerful vice president,\u201d he said.  For Democrats, CBS News Congressional Correspondent Nancy Cordes predicts they will redesign their strategy so they\u2019re able to reach out more to white working class voters.  \u201cI think by the end of the year you will see a new Democratic organization that does not currently exist, designed to try to reach some of these white working class voters that the Clinton campaign wasn\u2019t able to reach in 2016,\u201d Cordes said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a number of high-ranking Clinton campaign officials who thought they were going to spend the next four years very busy at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue now looking for a new purpose.\u201d  CBS News Chief Legal Correspondent Jan Crawford made a prediction about the battle to fill the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the late Justice Antonin Scalia.  \u201cI think that the Supreme Court confirmation fight is going to be the biggest battle that we will see. I think it\u2019s going to be a place for Democrats to kind of put all their pent up rage and frustration at what happened in November. You\u2019re going to see a real effort to block President Trump\u2019s nominee to the Supreme Court. My prediction is that will fail,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "In such a tumultuous election year, it\u2019s hard to know what to expect on November 8th. There are, however, a few tried and true predictors of U.S. presidential elections that have weighed in yet again. Sure, one\u2019s a monkey and another\u2019s based on the sales of Halloween masks. But combined, they have an estimated 112 years of successful predictions to their names. And currently, these five offbeat predictors are skewing 3-2 in favor of Donald Trump. For the past 48 years, students at Benjamin Franklin Elementary School\u00a0in Yorktown Heights, New York, have been casting their \u201cvotes\u201d to determine the winner of the U.S. presidential election. They spend months learning about the candidates. They debate the facts. Then, in small groups of around five students, every class from kindergarten through fifth grade heads into the mock polling booth.\u00a0 And for the past 48 years, the school has never been wrong. \u201cWe have minority groups, students that speak English as a second language, white collar, blue collar,\u201d Benjamin Franklin Elementary School principal Patricia Moore told CBS News. \u201cIt could be representative of the nation.\u201d Clearly, it is. For nearly half a century, the little melting pot has correctly predicted the outcome of the election based on the popular vote. And this year, after all the votes were tallied, Hillary Clinton won with 52 percent (277 votes) compared to Republican rival Donald Trump with 43 percent (230 votes). Now, the students just have to wait and see if they\u2019re right... again. Every four years, the retail chain Spirit Halloween puts out a survey of which\u00a0presidential candidate\u2019s mask\u00a0people plan to dress up in for Halloween. And for the past two decades, this poll has correctly predicted every presidential election winner. This year, the \u201cmask index\u201d has Donald Trump ahead of Hillary Clinton, 55 to 45 percent. A mystic monkey in Changsha, China also got in on the action this year. Shiyanhu Ecological Tourism Park in China\u2019s Hunan province regularly utilizes the animal, named Geda, to predict the results of European soccer matches. In fact, this year, Geda correctly predicted that Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s Portugal would win the European football championship, which they did... in overtime.\u00a0 So, fresh off his sports success, Geda\u2019s handlers figured, why not try the monkey\u2019s luck at politics as well? The 5-year-old monkey, whose name means \u201cgoose bumps,\u201d is believed to have the gift of prophecy, after all.\u00a0 Consequently, last Thursday, Geda stood on a red table between two life-size cardboard cutouts of Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, as eager reporters looked on. He wore a yellow t-shirt which read \u201cking of prophets\u201d in Chinese. And after a thoughtful process of sampling bananas next to each cutout, the clairvoyant monkey chose Donald Trump as the clear winner. The animal even thrilled nearby cameramen by planting a celebratory kiss on the Republican candidate\u2019s face. American University professor Allan Lichtman has correctly predicted the results of every presidential election since 1984. Interestingly, though, his method does not rely on polls, demographics or an analysis of swing states. Rather, Lichtman has developed 13 keys to predicting the election based on the performance of the party currently in the White House. \u201cThere\u2019s a real theory behind this. And the theory is presidential elections don\u2019t work the way we think they do,\u201d Lichtman told CBSN anchor Josh Elliott in June. \u201cThey\u2019re not decided by the turns of the campaigns, the speeches, the debates, the fundraising. Rather, presidential elections are fundamentally referenda on the performance of the party holding the White House. If that performance is good enough, they get four more years. If it\u2019s not, they\u2019re turned out and the challenging part wins.\u201d Lichtman says his 13 keys to predicting the results of the presidential election are simply ways of \u201cmathematically and specifically\u201d measuring that performance. They are: (1) incumbent-party mandate, (2) incumbency, (3) third party, (4) short-term economy, (5) long-term economy, (6) nomination contest, (7) policy change, (8) scandal, (9) social unrest, (10) foreign or military success, (11) foreign or military failure, (12) incumbent charisma, and (13) challenge charisma.\u00a0 The history professor says he came across this method \u201ctotally by accident in 1981,\u201d when he met a Russian geophysicist who wanted to collaborate using the methods of earthquake prediction to predict elections. Lichtman insists that\u2019s not nearly as far-fetched as it sounds because both prediction formulas gauge stability vs. upheaval. As for the results of this election, Lichtman says 2016 has been the hardest race he\u2019s ever attempted to predict. When the author of \u201cThe Keys to the White House\u201d appeared on CBSN in June, he had yet to make his call. However, since then, he has doubled down on a Trump win on November 8th. Every election season since 2004, The Monogram Shop in East Hampton, New York has correctly predicted the winner of the U.S. presidential election based on its sales of reusable plastic cups. The cups \u2014 which are emblazoned with the names and logos of the Democratic and Republican presidential tickets \u2014 are sold for $3 a piece, and a tally of the cup sales is then kept updated in the store\u2019s window. It is wet and raw here in East Hampton but her for you all is the current Monogram Shop cup count!! The Monogram Shop\u2019s presidential cup sales begin just after Super Tuesday. And for the past three elections, the candidate that has sold more cups has gone on to win the election. So, local residents are anxiously keeping an eye on this year\u2019s tally. As of this weekend, Hillary Clinton has a strong lead over her Republican opponent, with 4,946 cups to Trump\u2019s 3,388. It\u2019s important to note, however, that the sampling of the electorate this contest measures is far from representative of the entire U.S. population. Residents and visitors in East Hampton are overwhelmingly white and very wealthy, with many houses in the town serving as vacation homes for the New York City set.

            "article_content": "PALM BEACH, Fla.\u00a0-- The scramble to shape his administration underway, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s team has simultaneously begun turning its attention to raising tens of millions of dollars for festivities related to his Washington inauguration. Mr. Trump, who vowed during the campaign to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d of special interests corrupting Washington, has set $1 million donation limits for corporations and no limits for individual donors, according to an official on the Presidential Inaugural Committee with direct knowledge of tentative fundraising plans. At the same time, Mr. Trump\u2019s inaugural committee will not accept money from registered lobbyists, in line with his ban on hiring lobbyists for his nascent administration. Barack Obama set stricter limits on donations for his first inauguration, in 2009, holding individual donors to $50,000 each and taking no money from corporations or labor unions, as well as none from lobbyists and some other groups. Plenty of corporate executives, though, gave individually and often at the maximum amount. And he opened the spigots for his 2013 inauguration, setting no limits on corporate or individual donations. The new details, confirmed Thursday on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to disclose private deliberations, came as Mr. Trump gathered with family at his Palm Beach estate on Thanksgiving. It was a working holiday of sorts for Mr. Trump, who suggested on Twitter that he was engaged in trying to prevent an Indiana air conditioning company from moving jobs to Mexico. \u201cI am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted. \u201cMAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!\u201d The company, which has announced plans to move 1,400 jobs to Mexico from Indiana in the coming years, said  Thursday it \u201chas had discussions with the incoming administration\u201d but that there was \u201cnothing to announce at this time.\u201d Carrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together. Nothing to announce at this time. On the eve of the national holiday, the president-elect offered a prayer for unity after \u201ca long and bruising\u201d campaign season. \u201cEmotions are raw and tensions just don\u2019t heal overnight,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a video message on social media. He added, \u201cIt\u2019s my prayer that on this Thanksgiving we begin to heal our divisions and move forward as one country strengthened by shared purpose and very, very common resolve.\u201d Unity has emerged as a common theme during Mr. Trump\u2019s limited public appearances in the days since his stunning general election victory, which followed a campaign season in which he rained extraordinary personal attacks on his opponents in both parties, the media and his many Republican critics. Mr. Obama also emphasized this in his own Thanksgiving message.\u00a0 Thanksgiving reminds us that no matter our differences, we are still one people, part of something bigger than ourselves,\u201d the president said in a video published Thursday. \u201cWe are communities that move forward together. We are neighbors who look out for one another, especially those among us with the least. We are always, simply, Americans.\u201d Unity would also be a theme for the incoming president\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration, the official said. While Mr. Trump\u2019s fundraising plans have not been completed, he is expected to raise significantly more than the $43 million Obama raised for his 2013 inauguration. Taxpayers cover the cost of official activities such as the swearing-in, but outside donations pay for the many related balls and parties. Mr. Trump has focused most of his attention in the two weeks since his victory on building a White House team from scratch. He injected the first signs of diversity into his Cabinet-to-be on Wednesday, tapping South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and charter school advocate Betsy DeVos to lead the Department of Education. They are the first women selected for top-level administration posts. And Haley, the daughter of Indian immigrants, would be his first minority selection after a string of announcements of white men. The South Carolina governor has little foreign policy experience, yet Trump praised her as \u201ca proven dealmaker.\u201d DeVos, like Mr. Trump, is new to government but has spent decades working to change America\u2019s system of public education. The president-elect called DeVos a \u201cbrilliant and passionate education advocate,\u201d saying in a statement that \u201cunder her leadership we will reform the U.S. education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families.\u201d Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson on Wednesday said \u201can announcement is forthcoming\u201d on his position, which would make him the first black choice - possibly as secretary of housing and urban development. But he also suggested he\u2019d be thinking about it over the Thanksgiving holiday. \u201cI feel that I can make a significant contribution particularly to making our inner cities great for everyone,\u201d Carson wrote on his Facebook page. Mr. Trump praised his former primary opponent as a \u201cgreatly talented person,\u201d after months of launching vitriolic campaigns against the neurosurgeon. \u00a0 I am seriously considering Dr. Ben Carson as the head of HUD. I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people! Mr. Trump is also expected to select billionaire investor Wilbur Ross Jr. to lead the Commerce Department, a senior Trump adviser said on condition of anonymity because the adviser was not authorized to disclose internal deliberations. The 78-year-old Ross, who is white, is chairman and chief strategy officer of private-equity firm W.L. Ross & Co., which has specialized in buying failing companies. The picks come as Mr. Trump works to dissociate himself from the alt-right, a movement of white supremacists who continue to cheer his election. His first appointments included chief counselor Steve Bannon, who previously led Breitbart News, a website popular among the alt-right. Mr. Trump on Thursday was with his family behind closed doors at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach estate. He\u2019s spending the Thanksgiving holiday there after a week of interviewing potential appointees in New York, punctuated by announcements of members of his national security team. The president-elect is not expected to meet with anyone over the Thanksgiving holiday, but according to pool reports, Mr. Trump is still making phone calls throughout the day.\u00a0 He will be sworn into office in fewer than 60 days. Beyond his Cabinet, he must fill hundreds of high-level administration posts. Mr. Trump is expected to stay in Florida through the weekend.",

            "article_content": "The election is over, but not before revealing a nation sharply divided, both demographically and geographically. To find out why one corner of our country voted as it did, Senior Correspondent Ted Koppel traveled deep into the heart of Trump Country:  McDowell County, West Virginia, echoes to the sound of \u201cused to be\u2019s.\u201d There used to be a hundred thousand people in the county.\u00a0 Used to be. \u00a0Back when the coal mines ran three shifts a day. That\u2019s another used to be. Automation cut back the work force.\u00a0 Machines replaced men. That was already an issue back in 1960, when John F. Kennedy was campaigning here: Coal Miner: \u201cWhat are your plans for the situation existing in the coal mines in West Virginia?\u201dKennedy:\u00a0 \u201cI think there are at least four or five things the government can do.\u00a0 First is the area redevelopment bill.\u201d JFK carried the county, and the state. Folks here used to be staunch Democrats. Used to be. \u201cWell, I graduated from high school over here in 1973 and it was bustling then,\u201d said Sheriff Martin West. \u201cThe streets were full, the businesses were here, and then I got laid off in \u201882. That\u2019s when the bottom went out.\u201d McDowell County today, says Sheriff West, is in desperate straits. \u201cThis county was one of the most prosperous in the state at one time,\u201d he told Koppel. \u201cThese were the billion-dollar coalfields, and they were just enjoying the richness of it. And now we\u2019re on the bottom and we\u2019re being totally neglected.\u201d Most of the mines are closed now, and the county\u2019s down to fewer than 19,000 residents -- too many of those on welfare and food stamps. Unemployment is more than double the national rate. And there is the property that \u201cused to be\u201d a Walmart.\u00a0  So, when the voters went to the polls last Tuesday \u2026 Trump: \u201cYou look at our miners; Hillary Clinton wants to put all of the miners out of business.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d say 90-percent of West Virginia will vote for Donald Trump,\u201d said one voter. \u201cAin\u2019t gonna say he\u2019s a savior.\u00a0 If we do have a chance, he could possibly help us out.\u201d McDowell County was, unambiguously, Trump country.\u00a0  Donald Trump swept West Virginia, and trounced Hillary Clinton in McDowell County by almost four to one (4,614 votes to 1,429). Koppel asked, \u201cYou really think things are going to change?\u201d \u201cI think that he can help us, yeah,\u201d replied Sheriff West. He used to work in the mines. Then he spent seven years at a processing plant where they cleaned and sorted the coal that fired the furnaces at U.S. Steel. It\u2019s shut down now.  \u201cThey put all these regulations onto us from Washington, and the mines is trying to operate,\u201d said Sheriff West. \u201cThe people is counting on that in order to feed their family, to pay their bills and obey the regulations that we have. But they keep putting more regulations upon us.\u201d The Sterling Drive-In, established in 1945, is one of the only places left that hasn\u2019t shut down. It\u2019s a good place to talk. Koppel asked a group of residents, \u201cI want you folks to tell me why it is that people down here in McDowell County were so much smarter than everybody in New York, Washington and Los Angeles, and Chicago. What did you know that we didn\u2019t know?\u201d \u201cReally, to me, Donald Trump is probably the only way this county, and let alone state, is gonna survive,\u201d said Brandon Burks, a correctional officer at Stephens Correctional Center. \u201cI mean, we\u2019ve always been a coal county.\u201d Koppel asked, \u201cIs Donald Trump going to be able to make a difference? Is the coal industry ever gonna come back?\u201d Ed Evans, a science teacher who was recently elected to the Western House of Delegates, said, \u201cIt\u2019s not gonna come back to where it was.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see [that] level, but I think we\u2019ll see some return of coal.\u201d Eddie Asbury is President of Southern Minerals Coal Company, which has seven coal mines, three of which are shut down. \u201cIt\u2019s not a United States market or state market or a county market, it\u2019s a world market. We gotta compete in the world, in the world.\u201d \u201cAnd you think Donald Trump\u2019s gonna be able to do that?\u201d Koppel asked.  \u201cI do believe he will. And I\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019ve been Democrat all my life. All my life.\u201d Leroy Johnson used to work in one of Eddie Asbury\u2019s mines. But when it comes to politics they part ways. \u201cI voted for Hillary because she was more experienced and she was talking about more of the policies that we need, and the things that we need to work on,\u201d he said. \u201cDonald wasn\u2019t talking that. He was just throwing words out there, giving people what they wanted to hear. And I didn\u2019t think that was right.\u201d Kristen Mitchem, an unemployed single mother of three young children, did not vote.  \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d Koppel asked.  \u201cI felt that this was the most ridiculous election I\u2019ve ever witnessed in my life,\u201d Mitchem said. \u201cI know I\u2019m young, but they went about it the most childish way I think someone ever could. Through the whole election I never heard either party talk about the lower class. I\u2019m lower class. They\u2019re worried about middle class and higher class.\u201d  \u201cYou were born here?\u201d \u201cI was born and raised here.\u201d \u201cSo you know a lot of people your own age?\u201d \u201cI do, I do.\u201d \u201cIs there a lot of desperation?\u201d \u201cThere truly is. I would never have imagined in my life that I would be in this kind of position,\u201d Mitchem replied. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna leave my home. But I feel as if I\u2019m being forced out of my home because there\u2019s nothing here anymore.\u201d Delores Johnson, Leroy\u2019s wife of nearly four decades, and the President of the McDowell County Chamber of Commerce, nodded her head.  Koppel asked, \u201cYou see a lot of this?\u201d \u201cYes. And I agree with what she\u2019s saying. It\u2019s sad.\u201d \u201cThe nuclear family in McDowell County is really broken down,\u201d said Evans. \u201cWe have somewhere in the high 40 percent of kids that do not live with their natural mothers and fathers. Most of them will go off to find jobs in other places. They\u2019ll mail money back to grandma who takes care, or Uncle Bill, who takes care of the kids.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s coming out of this community to me is that a lot of people voted for Donald Trump because they felt, \u2018What the hell? What have we got to lose?\u2019\u201d said Koppel. \u201cDo you buy that?\u201d Asbury replied, \u201cI do.\u201d Evans added, \u201cWe have nowhere to go but up.\u201d There\u2019s a little disagreement about when McDowell County held its first Veterans Day Parade -- either 1918 or 1919 -- but it\u2019s one of the oldest in the country. This last Veteran\u2019s Day, Friday, was picture-perfect. The parade came down McDowell Street and you could barely notice all the shutdown stores. There was a flavor of what it must have been like.\u00a0  Not everyone, but most people, seemed ready to give their President-elect a real chance. \u201cThe voters of McDowell County gave Donald Trump a four-to-one margin of victory, I think \u2018cause he said he\u2019s going to bring the coal industry back,\u201d said Koppel. \u201cYou think he can do it?\u201d \u201cI think he can do anything he said he could do,\u201d one woman said. \u201cHe\u2019s that good.\u201d With the kids chanting their thanks to the veterans, and the high school bands, and the crowds lining either side of the street, you almost had a feeling of how it used to be.",

            "article_content": "The election has stoked Americans\u2019 anger, and that\u2019s been good for Donna Alexander\u2019s business.\u00a0 Alexander\u2019s Dallas-based\u00a0Anger Room Corp.\u00a0was built on the idea that people would pay for the chance to wield a sledgehammer without consequence: Her customers enjoy the unusual experience of smashing as much stuff as they can without getting in trouble. Such stress relief, she said, is in especially high demand because of the election. \u201cThey can destroy mannequins dressed up as Trump or Clinton,\u201d Alexander said of her election promotion. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a Republican state, it has been even between Donald Trump and Hillary. If we go on the damages, we went through three Donald Trump mannequins in less than a month, and only one Hillary Clinton mannequin.\u201d Stress may be a ubiquitous part of modern American life, but Alexander said she has noticed an uptick since she started her business eight years ago in her townhouse\u2019s garage. \u201cThis one has to be the most heaviest year for people expressing their anger about everything that\u2019s going on in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cIdeally I would love to see it subside, but it\u2019s never going to stop completely. It\u2019s an emotion that we\u2019re born with. I would hope that we could help slow it down and trying to get it back to the neutral level where it\u2019s not as extreme as it is now.\u201d The original idea came to her when she was a teenager in Chicago in the 1990s and noticed that some people were jailed for damaging property, such as punching holes in the wall. That led her to think about creating a space where people could vent their anger by smashing things -- but without the consequence of tangling with the law.\u00a0 In 2008, she put her plan into action by creating an \u201canger room\u201d in the garage of her townhouse. She charged her friends $5 to come over to break things, and word of mouth grew.\u00a0 \u201cI started getting strangers at my door asking me if this was the place to break stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cI just knew I had something.\u201d Customers are middle-class and upper-income Americans, people with 9-5 jobs and stay-at-home parents, she said. Clients tend to book the anger room for life issues, such as letting off steam because of problems with relatives, relationships or work. \u201cWe don\u2019t attract people who are mentally unstable,\u201d she noted. \u201cThey\u2019re people you see each and every day.\u201d First-time customers are often surprised at how physically exhausting it is to swing a weapon into old TVs, couches and other items, she said, describing the experience as a workout. \u201cAfter they get over the exhaustion, they say they feel totally relieved,\u201d Alexander added.\u00a0 Prices start at $25 and go up to $500 for custom-built rooms, which can be created to replicate an office, kitchen or living room, for example. Items are donated by local residents or obtained on bulk trash pickup days. The weapon selection changes each week, ranging from baseball bats to golf clubs. Since Alexander started her business, other anger rooms have popped up in other states and countries, such as The Smash Shack in North Carolina and the Rage Room in Toronto.\u00a0 The gender split in Alexander\u2019s client base leans toward women, which she estimates at anywhere from 55 percent to 70 percent of her customers. Women \u201cgo through through a lot more stress than guys do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have so much on our plates.\u201d",

On this last weekend before Election Day, the end can\u2019t come soon enough, as the tension that has characterized this race stays with us until the end.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: By the way, folks, while we\u2019re at it, great...  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Donald Trump was rushed off the stage by the Secret Service in Reno Saturday night, as a protester was roughed up by supporters in the crowd.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Nobody said it was going to be easy for us. But we will never be stopped.  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Campaigns whipped up their schedules and made last- minute dashes across the country to sewer up support in a flurry of final photo-ops, last-minute pleas for votes.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  HILLARY CLINTON (D), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I want to be the president for everybody, everybody who agrees with me, people who don\u2019t agree with me, people who vote for me, people who don\u2019t vote for me.  (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)  (END VIDEO CLIP) DICKERSON: And for the Democrats, a parade of appearances high- profile celebrities and musicians.  Despite the tight polls and jittery supporters, both candidates are trying to stay upbeat and keep calm going into Tuesday.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: Stay on point, Donald. Stay on point.  (LAUGHTER)  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: We will hear from Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate, Tim Kaine, and we will get a report from the head of the Republican Party, Reince Priebus.  Plus, we will have new Battleground Tracker numbers for two must- win states for Donald Trump, Florida and Ohio.  We will get an update on terror and hacking threats heading into Election Day and tell you what to look for on Tuesday.  It\u2019s all ahead on FACE THE NATION.  Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  Just two days until Election Day, and across the country, some 40 million people have already cast their ballot. There were long lines in North Carolina and in Ohio as early voting came to a close.  And our last round of CBS Battleground Tracker polls before the election show a dead heat in Florida, where the candidates are tied at 45 percent of the vote. In Ohio, Donald Trump has a one-point edge over Hillary Clinton, 46 percent to 45 percent.  We begin this morning the two CBS News correspondents who have folded themselves into countless airplane seats and rental cars and crisscrossed the country to be with both candidates every step of the way, Major Garrett with the Trump campaign in Denver, and Nancy Cordes covering Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia.  Major, I want to start with you.  There was a dustup at a Trump rally last night. What happened?  MAJOR GARRETT, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Here are the facts, John, that come from the Secret Service and the Reno police.  About two-thirds of the way through Donald Trump\u2019s stump speech last night, there was a commotion. It was a protester set upon by other Trump supporters. During that commotion, someone shouted out erroneously that they thought they saw a gun. When the Secret Service heard that, they swiftly whisked Trump off stage and the commotion continued.  This person, this protester, Austyn Crites, said he was set upon by Trump supporters because he silently held a sign that said \u201cRepublicans Against Trump.\u201d He was briefly detained and released. It was an episode that created some bit of drama, but in the end posed no threat to Trump.  DICKERSON: As if we needed more drama.  Major, where is Trump going to position himself in this final sprint? He\u2019s heading into Minnesota, Michigan. Those are not traditional states that are in play. What is going on?  GARRETT: They see tightening in both states. And they see Michigan and Minnesota as hedges against possible losses in Nevada and Virginia. They believe they\u2019re expanding the map, two stops today in Michigan, one in Minnesota.  John, I can tell you the Minnesota event advertised 24 hours ago, I\u2019m told by the campaign has 20,000 RSVPs.  DICKERSON: Wow.  Nancy, what does the Clinton campaign make of those forays into Michigan? She is now going there. The president is going there. Are they worried?  NANCY CORDES, CBS NEWS CORRESPONDENT: They are worried.  They see the tightening polls and they see the fact that Donald Trump is trying to make a play for Michigan. They\u2019re not just sending not just Secretary Clinton back to Michigan, but they\u2019re sending former President Bill Clinton back to Michigan and President Obama back there as well.  Beyond that, though, in these closing couple of days, there are fewer and fewer states where it makes sense to send Hillary Clinton. You don\u2019t want to send her to states where they have done the bulk of their voting by early voting. Those votes have already been cast, fewer and fewer votes to hunt for.  So, she is going to states in those closing days where people vote primarily on Election Day, like here in Pennsylvania, like New Hampshire and like Michigan.  DICKERSON: And who is she trying to turn out, Nancy? When she\u2019s in Pennsylvania, who should we watching for on Tuesday?  CORDES: She needs to run up the score here in Philadelphia, John, and in the surrounding suburbs. This is going to be the key to her.  Pennsylvania is key to her voting strategy. They need to win this state. And she is not going to do as well in Western Pennsylvania. It is a concern to the Clinton campaign that there is a transit strike going on here in Philadelphia. If it takes you longer to get to work, you might not decide to try to fit in a stop at the polling place before that.  But the campaign insists that they have got volunteers at the ready to try to get people to the polls and then to work, because, without Pennsylvania, it\u2019s unlikely that Hillary Clinton can win this election.  DICKERSON: And, finally, Major, Donald Trump, his closing argument, what his final case?  GARRETT: His final case is that he\u2019s a change agent and that Hillary Clinton is ethically disqualified from the presidency and would mire the country in countless congressional, possibly criminal investigations.  And I will tell you this, John. For the first time, those in the Trump inner circle are now saying, we\u2019re going to win. They believe they are going to win Pennsylvania, Michigan, closely, but, nevertheless, they believe every poll that you see that has the race close, because of the level of enthusiasm they see in the Trump movement.  DICKERSON: All right, Major Garrett and Nancy Cordes, thanks so much for being with us.  We go now to Virginia Senator and Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate Tim Kaine, who is in Milwaukee. Senator, Major Garrett just reported the Trump campaign is feeling like they might win with a comfortable margin. How do you see things? \u00a0  TIM KAINE: Well, we like where we are, but we\u2019re taking nothing for granted. So we\u2019re working very, very hard these last few days. We\u2019re seeing tremendous energy in registration, requests of absentee ballots, and especially early vote all across the country. And what we know about the early vote in the states that have it-- Wisconsin, for example, just set a record in early vote. What we see we\u2019re really excited about. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: You mentioned in an interview with AOL that you thought Hillary Clinton was the underdog. How is she the underdog? She\u2019s got the name, the money. She\u2019s been in politics before. Her opponent hasn\u2019t. What makes her the underdog? \u00a0  TIM KAINE: You know, John, I\u2019ve been -- I told Hillary, I encouraged her to run in April of 2014. And we talked about that. And she had not decided yet. But I said, \u201cNo matter what the polls say and no matter what you see in that editorial, consider yourself the underdog. You\u2019re trying to do something that\u2019s never been done.\u201d I said, \u201cIf it had been easy for a woman to be president in this country, we would have had a woman president of the country. So consider yourself the underdog until they call you the winner.\u201d That\u2019s what I say to myself, John, in every race I\u2019ve ever run in Virginia, which until recently has been pretty tough real estate. I tell myself I\u2019m the underdog until they call me the winner. And that gives me the discipline to do what I need to do until the polls close right at the very end. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: You are in Wisconsin. Hillary Clinton\u2019s going to be going to Michigan. Barack Obama, the president\u2019s going to be in Michigan. There seems to be some nervousness in the campaign that those Rust Belt states, Midwestern states, are ones, though traditionally Democrat, Donald Trump is making some inroads. Are you worried?  TIM KAINE: We feel very, very good about where we are, but we\u2019re taking nothing for granted. I was in Arizona earlier this week, which is a really difficult state for us. But we\u2019re making a play there. And we want to do the same here in the Midwest. The polls in Wisconsin and Michigan look favorable to us, but polls can be wrong. So we don\u2019t take anything for granted. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m really excited to be doing events in three different cities in Wisconsin today before heading to North Carolina and Virginia tomorrow. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: A week ago, F.B.I. Director Comey released a letter about new emails that were found. There\u2019s been some debate about the effect of that on the campaign. What effect has that had? Has it been responsible for these polls tightening? \u00a0  TIM KAINE: You know, what we saw, John, was actually polls tightening a little bit before that letter came out. And I view that as kind of a natural tightening, (coughs) excuse me, at the end of a race. Undecided voters if they have a Democratic or a Republican lean, they tend to go back to their team. And we are seeing that happen at the end. And so the tightening began before. I will say one thing we\u2019ve really seen. Since that letter came out, and then the director sort of backtracked on it a day later, and then there\u2019s been subsequent stories this week about internal turmoil within the F.B.I., we\u2019ve seen an add to the energy on our side. People on our side view this campaign as so important. The \u201cstronger together\u201d message is so important. And people don\u2019t want to be distracted.  JOHN DICKERSON: So-- \u00a0  TIM KAINE: So there has been a great uptick in energy on our side in early vote. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: So has it helped the campaign? \u00a0  TIM KAINE: I wouldn\u2019t say -- I think at the end of the day it\u2019s probably going to be a net wash. There was some concern. But then as more information has come out about internal turmoil within the F.B.I., it generated energy. And more than anything, I think Hillary\u2019s point of view is, \u201cLook, let\u2019s not get distracted.\u201d We\u2019re making our case about a nation that\u2019s stronger together that builds an economy that works for everybody and promotes the right view of American leadership in the world. That\u2019s what voters want to hear about. And we\u2019re going to stay focused on that through the end. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: There\u2019s been some pretty tough things said about the F.B.I. director from even inside the campaign. Is Hillary Clinton going to be able to work with Director Comey if she gets elected? \u00a0  TIM KAINE: You know, this is -- I worked with Jim Comey when I was mayor of Richmond and he was the head of the criminal division in the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in the eastern district of Virginia. And we\u2019ve had a solid working relationship. There\u2019s been some -- it\u2019s been puzzling and troubling. The decision to release that letter violated two protocols. A protocol about not releasing controversial information right on the eve of an election and also one about not talking about pending investigations. Stories this week raise other questions that are challenging about why that would happen. But those are questions for later. We have to focus on making the case as to why Hillary will be the best president between now and when the polls close on Tuesday, November 8th. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. And the response that we\u2019re seeing-- I was in Florida all day yesterday, one of the closest states here at the end. The energetic response, this new coalition of voters that Hillary Clinton is putting together, which is a reflection of people\u2019s positive views about her, we\u2019re really gratified by.  JOHN DICKERSON: So I didn\u2019t hear a, \u201cYes, she\u2019ll be able to work with him.\u201d \u00a0  TIM KAINE: That\u2019s just-- that assumes, you know, something we\u2019re not ready to assume. We\u2019re not assuming anything about the outcome Tuesday. We are focused on doing everything we can to win on Tuesday. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: Alright-- \u00a0  TIM KAINE: And then we\u2019ll think about what happens later. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about some information that came out this week. When Hillary Clinton became secretary of state, she said she would let the State Department know if a major donation was made to the Clinton Foundation. It turns out a million dollars was given to the Clinton Foundation by the government of Qatar. State Department was never informed. Why not? \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  TIM KAINE: John, my understanding of the MOU that Hillary struck as secretary of state with the State Department about the Clinton Foundation is the Clinton Foundation would alert State Department if anyone gave a donation that was materially different than what they had been giving before Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. The government of Qatar had been a donor to the foundation, which as you know does great work around the world, before she became secretary of state. The-- the fact that they are a donor is-- has been known, but they were a donor before Hillary became secretary of state. This wasn\u2019t a change in their position.  JOHN DICKERSON: So this is in keeping with what you call the MOU, the memorandum of understanding. \u00a0  TIM KAINE: Yes. \u00a0  JOHN DICKERSON: So even though they gave a million dollars to the foundation, she felt no obligation to let the ethics department of the State Department know?  TIM KAINE: They were, they were very clear about when notice would be required. And that would be if a government decided to do a contribution that was significantly different from what it had been doing before. The government of Qatar had been giving to the foundation. As you know, the foundation does great work around the world, in the distribution of AIDS drugs here in the United States, the distribution of drugs to battle opioid addiction. So if donors were already contributing prior to her time as secretary of state, there was a clear understanding that there was not additional notice required.  JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Senator Tim Kaine, thanks so much for being with us.  TIM KAINE: You bet. Absolutely, John. Thanks.  DICKERSON: And we are joined now by the chairman of the Republican Party, Reince Priebus.  Mr. Chairman, welcome back.  Donald Trump is suddenly going into Minnesota and Michigan. Those are Democratic states, basically. What do you see there?  REINCE PRIEBUS, CHAIRMAN, REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE: Well, we see probably the same things that the Clinton campaign sees. \u00a0And we go into these states with consumer data, voter data and we go in with a 3,000-person sample -- I\u2019m sure they do similar things. \u00a0And we\u2019re seeing a dead heat. \u00a0In fact, we\u2019re seeing that all over the country. \u00a0We\u2019re seeing it in Pennsylvania, we\u2019re seeing it in Colorado. \u00a0There\u2019s a lot of surprises here in the end. I was surprised myself. \u00a0Last night we pulled ahead of the Democrats in vote count in Colorado, the actual vote count itself, by 1,700 ballots. \u00a0Now -- it\u2019s not a lot, but it\u2019s also, I think, a little bit of a surprise to everyone involved that Donald Trump is closing and he\u2019s got the momentum going into Tuesday. \u00a0 DICKERSON: One of the things that happen sometimes late in these presidential races, is campaigns see a state and they think it looks good, but those states are traditional Democratic states for a reason. They\u2019ve an electorate there that sort of sets up well for the Democrat and so, time is spent - this happened to Mitt Romney in Pennsylvania -- time is spent at the end, Democrats match it and it\u2019s time that\u2019s wasted in a state that maybe he should be spending his time somewhere else. \u00a0 PRIEBUS: Well, look -- he\u2019s also -- you -- it\u2019s a -- he\u2019s a different kind of candidate, too. \u00a0And it\u2019s a different day and it\u2019s a different year. \u00a0I mean, I don\u2019t think anyone can say that 2016\u2019s been normal. \u00a0It\u2019s been -- it\u2019s been a wild political year. \u00a0And we\u2019ve got a candidate that appeals to a lot of voters that haven\u2019t engaged in a long time. And he actually appeals to a lot of folks in the Midwest. \u00a0I\u2019m from Wisconsin. \u00a0I -- I know what it\u2019s like to lose factories where -- where I grew up. \u00a0And that\u2019s the way people feel in -- in Michigan. \u00a0And he gives those people hope. \u00a0And the other piece of this is that, you know, Hillary Clinton\u2019s got a heck of a bad narrative cooking up here for the last ten days. \u00a0And it\u2019s -- it\u2019s plaguing her campaign. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Let me ask you though, if Michigan and the midwest was such a place that works well for Donald Trump, why not spend more time in Michigan and Minnesota, why is this -- why not a more concerted effort there than Nevada, Colorado which are less likely for Trump? \u00a0 PRIEBUS: Right. \u00a0Let me just hit that point real quick, though. \u00a0I mean, on the ground, in the operation, when it comes to get-out-the vote efforts, voter identification, absentee balloting, we have massive organizations in Michigan and Wisconsin. \u00a0Probably the two best political parties. \u00a0Ohio\u2019s really good -- now I\u2019m going to offend some state chairmen. But these are two very good -- \u00a0 DICKERSON: Yeah, you might want to mention Wisconsin again. \u00a0 \u00a0 PRIEBUS: Yeah, they are very good operations that we have spent millions and millions of dollars in. \u00a0You -- you\u2019re also seeing it tightening in all of the senate races. \u00a0And -- and we believe that a Pennsylvania, a Michigan, a Wisconsin could quickly move on to our board. \u00a0 DICKERSON: You mention Donald Trump\u2019s a different kind of candidate, appealing to different kinds of voters, he is also -- from the early vote we can see in Nevada and Florida -- he is also driving away the kinds of voters you were- talked about attracting after the last 2012 election, Latino voters in Florida and Nevada seem to be coming out very heavily for- for Hillary Clinton. What do you make of that? \u00a0 PRIEBUS: Well you don\u2019t know exactly how they\u2019re voting. But you -- you can obviously look at the data and see that it\u2019s happening. \u00a0That they\u2019re turning out. \u00a0 \u00a0 DICKERSON: But- but- Do you think Trump will do better with Latinos than Mitt Romney? \u00a0 PRIEBUS: I think he\u2019s going to do better than people think. \u00a0I don\u2019t know what the- the total\u2019s going to be. \u00a0But here- but let\u2019s just look at the numbers, real quick, in Florida. \u00a0In Florida today, we are 7,000 ballots down. \u00a0 But four years ago, we were 104,000 ballots down. \u00a0So all this stuff- there\u2019s great antidotes (sic) and everyone, not accusing you, but the Clinton campaign, in particular, can pick- cherry pick all they want we\u2019re ahead in early vote from where we were by a mile four years ago. \u00a0Look at North Carolina. \u00a0We\u2019re ahead by over 100,000 votes in North Carolina from where we were four years ago. \u00a0We were down by 455,000 ballots four years ago -- we won North Carolina. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Let me ask you this, before people get lost in the numbers, on the question of Latino vote, it used to be seen by a number of Republicans as something the party had to do to catch up with the future of the country. As the Latino vote grows, do you think Donald Trump has helped or hurt that effort? \u00a0 PRIEBUS: Look, we\u2019ll- we\u2019ll wait and see. \u00a0But I can tell you what we\u2019ve done as far as the growth and opportunity report. \u00a0We put in millions of dollars -- \u00a0 DICKERSON: That\u2019s the RNC effort. \u00a0 PRIEBUS: That\u2019s right. We\u2019ve put millions of dollars in black and hispanic engagement. We didn\u2019t just show up six months ago. We\u2019ve been on the ground, in Puerto Rican communities in Orlando, in Cuban communities in Miami and hispanic communities in Nevada. We have been there for four years talking about our party and what we believe in. And you know what? \u00a0Jobs, the economy, choice in where you want to go to school, SBA loans for small business owners, that\u2019s what people care about. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 DICKERSON: So if the RNC -- RNC did its work, if Donald Trump doesn\u2019t turn out Latino voters, it\u2019s his fault? \u00a0 PRIEBUS: Our job -- well, no. First of all, he\u2019s, he\u2019s -- we need to give him credit for all of his attempts. I mean he\u2019s- he\u2019s the one going into Little Haiti in Miami. He went, we did a round table with Puerto Rican families in Orlando, he went up to Detroit, he went to Cleveland. He\u2019s doing well in black communities. \u00a0So, he has been talking about school choice. And, and, and money for small business owners and getting people back to work.Those issues appeal to hispanic and black voters. And they appeal to white voters. They appeal to all of us as Americans. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 DICKERSON: Do you feel -- there have been times at this race when Donald Trump has called out the establishment, he\u2019s even -- along this long, winding -- \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 PRIEBUS: We\u2019ve had our -- we\u2019ve had our own arguments, you know that. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Do you -- do you worry if things don\u2019t turn out his way on Tuesday, that after all the work you\u2019ve done with him, that he might turn around and blame you? \u00a0 PRIEBUS: Oh I don\u2019t -- listen this is politics, I don\u2019t really care. What I care about is winning. I care about keeping the House and the Senate and winning the White House. And post-Tuesday, I\u2019m not worried about that, I think -- I think we\u2019re winning. I also think, if you would have said two months ago, and I think most people -- if they are being honest -- that we\u2019d be here today arguing over Michigan and Pennsylvania, I think people would have been shocked. \u00a0And here we are, and it is a tight race, and we are going to do everything we can and we need our voters to get out and vote. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Before we leave -- okay, apparently we\u2019re out of time. \u00a0We\u2019ll have to save this for after the election. \u00a0 PRIEBUS: Okay, John. \u00a0Thanks. \u00a0 DICKERSON: Thanks, Mr. Chairman. \u00a0Thank you for being here. \u00a0 \u00a0 PRIEBUS: You bet.  DICKERSON: And we will be back in one minute with what we\u2019re looking for on Election Day.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We\u2019re back now with some more insight into why this race is tightening with CBS News elections director Anthony Salvanto, who is in our New York studio.  Anthony, it\u2019s our last meeting before Election Day. So, what are you seeing in these numbers out of Florida and Ohio?  ANTHONY SALVANTO, CBS NEWS ELECTIONS DIRECTOR: Since we last talked, these races have gotten tighter, Trump now up a point in Ohio. It\u2019s even in Florida.  And the reason is that he has gotten a few of those previously unsure voters. There weren\u2019t a lot of them to start with. But they have moved toward Donald Trump. And one of the reasons, I think, is that we asked people how they saw each of these candidates relative to this political system.  The majority are saying now that they feel like Hillary Clinton is part of what is wrong with politics. But, by the same taken, they see Donald Trump now as entirely separate from the political system, neither what is wrong, nor what is right.  And you can imagine that some of those unsure voters on the fence have moved a little bit towards him because of that. Now, whether that\u2019s enough to carry him to a win, we will have to see. And that will probably, as always, come down to turnout.  DICKERSON: And that why he\u2019s been hammering that change message here in the final stretch.  In Florida, I want to ask you about Latino voters. The Clinton campaign, Democrats, very enthusiastic about the early voting by Latinos. Did any of that show up in your numbers?  SALVANTO: It does. They are strongly for Hillary Clinton. She will need that in order to win.  If you look at the early vote, the ones that have been cast so far, it looks like an uptick in Latino turnout in Florida, larger then it might have been, was in 2012. And that\u2019s a good sign for her.  The tough part for her, though, is what is still out there, what is outstanding, still looks like it\u2019s a bit little younger then the rest of the electorate. And that means to get the rest of the collision that she needs in Florida, she is still going to need a strong turnout come Election Day.  DICKERSON: Staying on the idea of early and absentee voting in these states, does it look like in your numbers that Republicans are voting for the Republicans and Democrats for the Democrat?  SALVANTO: Democrats for Democrats and Republicans for the Republicans.  In fact, one of the things that is bolstering Donald Trump a little bit is that he has gotten some Republicans coming back to him now. You and I all year have been following this story of reluctant Republicans, that he just was not getting enough of that base. They\u2019re starting to come home. He\u2019s ticking up with them in both of these states. And that\u2019s helping move the needle for him a little bit.  DICKERSON: How about on Tuesday? What are you going to be looking for? What should we pay attention to?  SALVANTO: Yes, it\u2019s sort of the map vs. momentum, in some sense, which is the map favors, even if narrowly, Hillary Clinton, because you have got all these states that are reliably Democratic that we think are likely going to be in her camp.  But the trend line in some of the national polls and in a lot of these states has been toward Donald Trump. And so the question is whether or not he can start to either flip some of those Democratic states. And we will know that fairly early.  You will get an early closing in Virginia. You will get an 8:00 Eastern closing in places like Pennsylvania. Those are states Hillary Clinton all about has to win.  If you see those states tight and competitive, they can\u2019t be projected early, that could be the sign of a good night for Donald Trump. If Hillary Clinton does hang on, she will probably do so with the help of Hispanic voters and also with the help of college -- women with college degrees. That\u2019s been a big part of her collision so far.  I think you will see a large gender gap. In fact, if you don\u2019t see that large gender gap, given Donald Trump\u2019s strength with men, that could be a very good sign for him.  DICKERSON: OK, Anthony, thanks. We will see you on Tuesday night.  SALVANTO: Thanks, John.  DICKERSON: And we will be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Be sure to join us Tuesday for our extended CBS News election coverage starting at 7:00 Eastern. Our entire election team, Scott Pelley, Norah O\u2019Donnell, Gayle King, Charlie Rose, Elaine Quijano, Bob Schieffer and I, will be there all night long to get you and the rest of -- to get you the latest results and tell what you it all means.  I will also start writing an election blog today at FACETHENATION.com. The blog updates through Tuesday night. And we will be tweeting it from our handle, @FACETHENATION.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Some our CBS stations are leaving us now.  But, for most of you, we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including an update on those Election Day terror threats and our political panel.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  U.S. intelligence warned this week of a possible al Qaeda terror attacks in New York, Virginia and Texas just one day before the 2016 election. How real is that threat? CBS News senior national security analysis Fran Townsend and \u201cWashington Post\u201d columnist David Ignatius are here to tell us.  David, I want to start with you.  How significant was it that it\u2019s al Qaeda in this case? We\u2019ve heard a lot about ISIS. But how significant is it that it\u2019s al Qaeda and how serious is this?  DAVID IGNATIUS, \u201cWASHINGTON POST\u201d: First, it\u2019s important that this is core al Qaeda, which means the fragment of the organization that\u2019s left in Afghanistan principally. I\u2019m told that this intelligence came after the killing of a key al Qaeda operative, Faruq al-Qatani, who was an operation planner in Kunar province in northeastern Afghanistan two weeks ago. So his discussion of operations plans is where this begins.  It\u2019s taken seriously because it\u2019s specific. It names three states. it names a time.  One reason that an official says we\u2019re not in panic mode about this is that core al Qaeda is a long way away, it has great difficulty organizing operations today, it is not seen as an imminent threat. The terrorism issue I think that concerns the FBI/Homeland Security most is the -- is the lone wolf, homegrown problem. Somebody who gets a gun and goes to a polling place motivated by all of the stuff that\u2019s online. But in terms of this threat, it\u2019s specific, it was disseminated, but the reason officials think that it\u2019s not a three alarm fire.  DICKERSON: And the reason is because the ability to carry out an operation has been degraded over the last few years from attacks on al Qaeda.  IGNATIUS: This planning comes from core al Qaeda, again, from a key operation planner who survives, who is now -- who is now dead, but who survived, in his conversations with his operatives. The question is the ability to carry those plans out. And people think it\u2019s fairly limited.  DICKERSON: Fran, let me ask you, so this information coms. What happens on the Homeland Security end with this kind of information? What can be done? What is being done?  FRAN TOWNSEND, CBS NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, first of all, John, I would say that there are -- they\u2019ve identified about over a dozen operatives who have been deployed. They\u2019ve been trained over the course of three years in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region and they\u2019ve been back -- brought back to the United States. And so as David points out, DHS will work with state and local officials, and law enforcement. Here in New York, we know that they\u2019ve stood up a task force to try and identify investigations where operatives have traveled and might fit that profile so that they can try and disrupt it.  DICKERSON: All right, Fran, got a little laryngitis there. Thank you for -- for that.  David, let me ask you, now another threat that we\u2019ve been talking about on Election Day that people have been worried about is the threat of some kind of disruption. There\u2019s been a lot of talk about the Russians. The vice president said that these hacked e-mails, the WikiLeaks e-mails and also the hacked e-mails from the Democratic National Committee trace back to Russia. What\u2019s the status of that now in terms of U.S. operations responding to Russia and the worry of some disruption on Election Day?  IGNATIUS: Two top officials, our director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, and the secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson, issued a statement last month in which they were very specific. They said that the most senior level Russian officials must have approved the hacking that\u2019s been done of Democratic officials, of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta. And I\u2019m told that since then there was a private warning, I believe by President Obama himself, to Vladimir Putin saying, any further Russian attempts to interfere in the U.S. elections would have the most serious consequences.  I\u2019m told further that officials believe that the Russians have not escalated their attacks. They seem to have gotten the message. Although people are very -- very careful. They\u2019re watching each event. There\u2019s a cyber war room set up for -- for Tuesday to -- to monitor any attempt to -- to intrude.  I\u2019m told finally that although Vice President Biden warned of U.S. reprisals, none have been taken so far against Russia. And the reason is, there\u2019s a desire to avoid any kind of cycle of escalation in this very difficult period before the election.  DICKERSON: Fran, on the -- on Election Day, how might we see disruption from those who wanted to mess with the election returns?  TOWNSEND: You know, John, I think we normally think of it like (INAUDIBLE) attacks, like the recent one we saw. What I really worry about is something more sort of pervasiveness and insidious. Imagine massive text messages going out to voters saying polls are closed or poll locations have closed that might affect voter turnout. I think that\u2019s insidious and more difficult for officials both to react to and to detect.  DICKERSON: All right, so instead of actually hacking the infrastructure, but actually just misinformation, a lot of different messages. David, I want to switch to the FBI quickly here at the end. James Comey\u2019s come under some criticism for his handling of these e-mails. There are now leaks coming out of the FBI at a pace that seems new, or that seems more messy than we\u2019ve seen before. What do you make of what\u2019s going on right now inside the FBI?  IGNATIUS: Well, I -- first, the -- the FBI, right now, is -- is very leaky. You\u2019re never sure if people who claim to be speaking on behalf of FBI agents or to have spoken to them, you don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s -- that\u2019s true or not. But it -- it\u2019s a law enforcement agency that\u2019s -- that\u2019s in -- in turmoil. And that\u2019s something that everybody should be -- be worried about after the election. A strong FBI is crucial.  If Secretary Clinton wins on Tuesday, it\u2019s possible she may end up being glad that James Comey surfaced this issue of additional e- mails on an investigation because it reduces the possibility that you can say later that this was suppressed and rigged. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s conceivable. Right now, within the Clinton camp, Jams Comey is not their favorite person, obviously, but its -- it\u2019s possible if she wins she\u2019d say this was -- this made for a more stable transition.  DICKERSON: And, Fran, thanks so much for being with us.  David, thank you also for being with us.  We\u2019ll be right back with our political panel.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: We\u2019re back now with our politics panel. Amy Walter is national editor of \u201cThe Cook Political Report,\u201d John Heilemann is managing editor of Bloomberg Politics, Jamelle Bouie is chief political correspondent for \u201cSlate\u201d magazine and CBS News political analyst, and Mark Leibovich is a chief national correspondent at \u201cThe New York Times\u201d magazine and also a CBS News contributor.  John Heilemann, what\u2019s going on in the race right now?  AMY WALTER, \u201cTHE COOK POLITICAL REPORT\u201d: What is going on?  JOHN HEILEMANN, BLOOMBERG POLITICS: Well, it\u2019s almost over, John. The blessed day is nearly upon us.  What\u2019s going on is I think that after -- look, the race is tight and tighter than I think a lot of people thought it would be at the end. But it\u2019s still the case that Hillary Clinton has never been behind in this race, not for one day since the general election started. And although her lead is small, it\u2019s the case that people in the Clinton campaign feel more confident about where they are than those with were with the Obama campaign in 2012 felt at this same stage in 2012. They feel like she has a narrow but durable lead and a lot of paths to 270 electoral votes and that Donald Trump is behind and has very, very few paths to 270 electoral votes and so they are feeling not (INAUDIBLE) and not overconfident, but quite confident that they are going to end up winning on Tuesday.  DICKERSON: Amy, what do you make of the Donald Trump schedule change? So, was supposed to be in Wisconsin yesterday. Canceled. Now in Michigan and -- and in Minnesota. Is that a crazy last minute genius or is it a sign of spreading himself too thin? How do you read it?  WALTER: Well, two things. Going to the -- to John\u2019s point about feeling like 2012. I feel like we are in a deja vu moment here. We\u2019ve gone into the time machine. We\u2019ve gone back to 2012. We\u2019re talking about the exact same things today that we were at this point in 2012. Back then it was, can Mitt Romney win a national election really by just driving up votes among white voters and not growing the base. So we\u2019re litigating that yet again.  We also said, can Mitt Romney tip one of these rust belt state that\u2019s been a Democratic hands for years and years and years at the very last minute despite putting no effort, no on the ground work there? In 2012 it was Pennsylvania. This year it\u2019s Michigan. So, we know what the answer was in 2012, but this is -- it looks very familiar -- it -- we -- it -- and it looks like we\u2019re heading down that same path in 2016.  I think that your point that you raise to Reince Priebus was the right question, which is, it -- it makes perfect sense that a state like Michigan and Pennsylvania would be in Donald Trump\u2019s target list. These are the kind of states where if you\u2019re going to win with white working class voters only, those are the kind of places you go. But those are the places that you would also invest early by finding those voters, registering voters, getting those voters out, not going in with 48 hours to go.  DICKERSON: Jamelle, Mitt Romney got 59 percent of the white vote, didn\u2019t win. Ronald Reagan got 54 percent of the white vote, did win because it was a bigger part of the vote. So this goes to Amy\u2019s -- this was the argument at the beginning of this race. How do you think the -- this race itself -- Mitt Romney was a different candidate than -- than Donald Trump. Donald Trump has a better chance of turning out more of those working class white voters. So how do you think this theory plays out? Where\u2019s it playing out? Is Donald Trump -- is he proving the -- a lot of the skeptics wrong?  JAMELLE BOUIE, \u201cSLATE\u201d MAGAZINE: I don\u2019t think he is. I mean he\u2019s definitely turning out more working class white voters then before. And I think that explains the fact that he is not far behind in very many swing state. Working class white voters, such a large proportion of the electorate that doing extraordinarily well with them -- very well with them kind of lifts your ceiling considerably.  But what it\u2019s taken Trump to get all those voters out has also repelled college educated white voters. And Hillary Clinton is on pace to win college educated white voters for the -- for -- for Democrat for the first time since we\u2019ve been keeping track of this.  And on the same token, what it takes to bring out all those working class white voters also drives Hispanic and African-American voters to the poles. And we\u2019re seeing, anecdotal evidence at least, that Hispanic voters are turning out at a huge level. And so, you know, the idea that there is some pool of working class whites that you could turn out and maybe make up the deficit that Romney had, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong. I think what people didn\u2019t consider (INAUDIBLE) into which actions have reactions in that the things you would need to do to turn those voters out --  HEILEMANN: Right.  BOUIE: Alienates so many more.  HEILEMANN: Right.  DICKERSON: Right.  Well, how do you see things here at the end, Mark.  MARK LEIBOVICH, \u201cNEW YORK TIMES\u201d MAGAZINE: Well, I also think, before you look too deeply into what Donald Trump\u2019s travel schedule has been the last few days, you have to wonder how sophisticated their polling operation has been at all or if they\u2019ve done any polling. And we forget whatever commitments they have on the ground. I mean apparently I mean it\u2019s unclear who his pollster is now. I guess he didn\u2019t pay -- there -- there was some -- there was a whole back story about, you know, whether he actually had any infrastructure at all.  You always, I mean as -- as Amy said, you always have to be aware of the 11th hour sleeper states. I mean all of a sudden, you know, Minnesota, Michigan are the states we\u2019re talking about now. Again, Pennsylvania, Mitt Romney. John McCain. Remember, George W. Bush was supposedly really close in California in 2000 and it nearly cost him the election. So, there\u2019s that.  And, also, people are always looking probably too deeply into signs of momentum, crowd, that kind of thing. Look, people are engaged. This is the 11th hour. I mean you would hope people are -- are -- are engaged. And, look, we just don\u2019t know very much now. We\u2019ll know a lot more in 36 hours.  DICKERSON: John, you know, Mark brings up a good point. The RNC did put a lot of effort on the grouped the minute after 2012 ended.  HEILEMANN: Right. Right.  DICKERSON: The RNC is not Donald Trump.  HEILEMANN: Right.  DICKERSON: And -- and how in sync they are will be one of those stories of this election. But this election has also been about the smarty pants elites versus real human beings.  HEILEMANN: You\u2019re not talking about anybody at this table, right?  DICKERSON: No.  HEILEMANN: OK. OK. Just to be clear.  DICKERSON: Yes, present company ex -- included, twice.  HEILEMANN: (INAUDIBLE).  DICKERSON: But if the -- one of the challenges of this election is the -- the smart people think they know what\u2019s going on and they think Donald Trump has been extremely successful doing his thing.  WALTER: Right. Right.  HEILEMANN: Right.  DICKERSON: Is that going to be the story about sort of the old fashion question of the -- the -- the science of politics and turning people out and analytics and all these things you hear that are supposed to make politics like a science?  HEILEMANN: Yes.  DICKERSON: Maybe Donald Trump just knows something better.  HEILEMANN: Well, if that\u2019s true, a lot of us are going to have to really check a lot of our preconceptions at the door.  Here\u2019s where I think I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be true, and it\u2019s, again, one of the most important things to think about what\u2019s going on right now. It plays into the question of Michigan and everything else.  There are -- there is -- we have an Election Day on Tuesday. In some states, like Michigan, Election Day is Election Day. Everybody votes on Election Day. Part of the reason why Michigan is now, quote, \u201cin play,\u201d and why both the Clinton campaign and the Trump campaign are there is because there is no early vote in Michigan. So to the extent that there\u2019s been momentum, tightening, it could play out in Michigan. If Trump really has momentum, he could win on Election Day.  In a lot of the other states, they\u2019ve been voting for weeks or, you know, many weeks or many days, right? And that is where the question of science, where money, where infrastructure, where get out of the vote operations, where ground game really matters. So, you know, the part of the reason the Clinton campaign is confident that the tightening that we\u2019ve seen in this week -- in this past week, though real, will not have a huge effect is that in places like Florida, North Carolina, Nevada, other places like that. They have already banked a huge number of votes and have, in many cases, they believe, and there\u2019s some -- there\u2019s some actual statistical, not anecdotal, evidence to suggest it\u2019s true. They\u2019ve banked so much vote that no matter how well Donald Trump does on Election Day, it won\u2019t be enough to make up that gap.  DICKERSON: Right.  WALTER: And -- and they\u2019re still voting today --  HEILEMANN: Yes.  DICKERSON: Right.  WALTER: In -- in big states, Ohio, North Carolina. You\u2019re going to --  HEILEMANN: Florida.  WALTER: In Florida. So this is still, people are voting today. Even as we take all these polls --  HEILEMANN: Right.  WALTER: We\u2019re going to see a big number coming out of Ohio, I think, and that\u2019s why this -- that\u2019s the other interesting thing, when we look at what this path is -- this path to 270, and -- and John\u2019s right about the many opportunities for Hillary Clinton. Trump has a narrower path.  If she takes Ohio off the map --  LEIBOVICH: Right.  WALTER: If she wins Ohio, which right now it\u2019s a point, \u201cThe Columbus Dispatch\u201d had her up a point. Your poll has her down a point. This is where the ground effort matters. This is who turns out today matters. If that gets off the map, then all of this discussion about Michigan and Minnesota is -- is done.  HEILEMANN: But it\u2019s three of them, just quickly, right? If she takes off the table Florida --  WALTER: Correct.  HEILEMANN: Or North Carolina, or Ohio --  WALTER: Right.  HEILEMANN: The election is basically over.  WALTER: Right.  DICKERSON: Because of traditional state (INAUDIBLE) --  LEIBOVICH: And (INAUDIBLE) --  WALTER: Oh, we\u2019ve been putting Ohio in that Republican (INAUDIBLE).  BOUIE: Right. Right. It\u2019s -- we\u2019re saying that Sunday is a very important early voting day for African-American voters --  WALTER: Yes. Yes.  LEIBOVICH: Yes, huge.  BOUIE: In states like North Carolina and Ohio and Florida.  WALTER: Yes.  BOUIE: Souls to the Polls today could make a significant difference in the final outcome.  DICKERSON: What\u2019s the situation with the African-American vote. I mean they\u2019re -- Hillary Clinton\u2019s had these concerts. It\u2019s clearly a last-minute push. Is that a push out of desperation or is that, as you say, Souls to the Polls is a thing that happens on a Sunday.  BOUIE: Yes.  DICKERSON: So, is it happening where -- just give us a sense of where you think it is?  BOUIE: I think it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s a couple of things happening right now.  The first is that there is a reduction in enthusiasm from 2012. I think that\u2019s been portrayed as a collapse in enthusiasm, but it looks more like a reversion to the mean (ph) basically, that you had \u201808 and 2012. And when African-American voters are voting above and beyond white voters, now they\u2019re voting a lot like white voters, which, for Democrats, is not the greatest situation because any given -- pretty much any given black voter you turn onto the polls is a vote in your pocket and so they want to -- they want to encourage that.  The -- the other thing, and this is especially true in North Carolina, is that the last couple years of efforts to reduce polling locations, to erect barriers to -- to voting have been successful. There is a direct correlation between the reduction in polling areas in the North Carolina country and the level of voting among African- Americans. And so I think some of this conversation about enthusiasm is really better a conversation about the success of voter suppression measures over the past two years.  DICKERSON: Mark, Donald Trump in the -- since the third debate, we heard him this week say to himself, stay on track, Donald. The reason --  HEILEMANN: That\u2019s what Mark says to himself every day before the show.  DICKERSON: Yes. That\u2019s right.  LEIBOVICH: It never works.  DICKERSON: The reason that\u2019s amusing is because a lot of the people who have advised Donald Trump have said, when he speaks on a teleprompter, he stays on message, doesn\u2019t get into these diversions. And we\u2019ve now seen in the polls, Republicans who were worried about him, his temperament, his judgement are coming back home. So maybe the teleprompter, which he mocked so thoroughly, has been what\u2019s helping Donald Trump in the final case (ph).  LEIBOVICH: Maybe. I mean I think there are a lot of other forces in play, especially over the last week. I mean beginning with the FBI, you know, report or whatever, the Comey letter. I -- I do think that, look, precedent has been very, very friendly to Donald Trump when he has had these relatively incident free weeks, if you want to say that.  I do think, though, that a lot of -- a lot of this is baked into the cake. I mean I think precedent is -- has been a very, very cruel mistress through this entire campaign. And I just think that -- that any sort of -- first of all, we\u2019ve been proven wrong. I mean the quote/unquote \u201csmart people\u201d around the table, and I\u2019ve always -- I\u2019ve always thought that was overrated and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve never claimed to be smart -- have been just wrong so many steps of the way and I think Donald Trump would love nothing more than to just show that, look, every single bit of the playbook I have not only rewritten, but I have proven the old one wrong. And I think, yes, maybe he hasn\u2019t, you know --  WALTER: Right.  DICKERSON: Jamelle, on election night, what are you -- what are you looking for on Election Day? What\u2019s -- what\u2019s one of the things you\u2019ll be looking for?  BOUIE: I\u2019ll -- I\u2019ll be looking to see what Hispanic turnout is looking like in Nevada and Florida, and North Carolina. Same with African-American turnout.  I -- I, you know, when the poles start closing, I\u2019m really going to have my eye on North Carolina. I was just there for the past week. (INAUDIBLE) going between Charlotte and Raleigh/Durham and Fayetteville and that is a tightly contested state. And however it ends up on Tuesday I think will tell us how the race is going to end -- end up that night.  DICKERSON: Right, Clinton\u2019s going to run up the votes in the cities and hope to hold it down in the rural areas for Trump.  How about you, John?  HEILEMANN: I\u2019d like to look again look to the East Coast obviously first. And so I think Nevada\u2019s now basically --  DICKERSON: Because you\u2019re an elitist or because the numbers --  (CROSS TALK)  HEILEMANN: Well, no, because we get those results -- we get those results earlier.  LEIBOVICH: Tim zones.  HEILEMANN: We get those results earlier. Places like Nevada, I think now, given the early vote, is probably gone for Donald Trump already. But African-Americans in North Carolina, suburban, Philadelphia suburbs turnout, like just raw numbers in Philadelphia, whether Clinton can run up the -- the -- the totals there, that will kind of lock down Pennsylvania if she does. And we look at those compared to 2012. Those are the earliest things.  And I think actually keep an eye on New Hampshire just because it\u2019s a state that, you know, has -- she has had a pretty wide, in some cases, lead there. That race has clearly tightened up. And if Trump were to win New Hampshire, you know, obviously it doesn\u2019t matter that much in terms of the raw number of electoral votes, but it might be an early warning sign for the Clinton campaign that all is not well in some other battlegrounds.  DICKERSON: Right, because the voters in New Hampshire might be like voters on down the line.  HEILEMANN: Right.  DICKERSON: Even though they have four electoral votes.  How about you on election night?  WALTER: One of the states that closest earliest is Indiana. That is a big Senate race. This is a state that Democrats originally thought was in the bag for them. It is tightened. It may even be a little bit behind. This is going to tell us whether or not -- not necessarily if Democrats have enough to win a majority in the Senate, but it could definitely tell us if they will have a big majority. If the Democrat wins there, it\u2019s a sign that they\u2019re probably going to get a big number of seats that night.  DICKERSON: And just quickly, Amy, explain when John says Nevada may already be done, there was -- obviously in 2012 I was struck the Obama people basically knew -- Colorado they -- they --  WALTER: Yes.  DICKERSON: Before Election Day. How can a campaign know that it\u2019s done?  WALTER: That it\u2019s pretty much done?  DICKERSON: Yes.  WALTER: Yes. Well, in Colorado, it\u2019s almost all -- it is a mail- in state. Now, you can still show up at the polls, but about 90 percent of the vote comes in, in the mail. They know who their voters are in Colorado. They literally can tell you the number of people who have turned in their ballots. So they know, in the modeling, what that means for the kind of vote they\u2019re going to get. Same with a place like Nevada, where you\u2019re going to get 60, 70 percent of the vote coming in before Election Day.  And this is where Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, we have to watch on election night because they vote that day.  HEILEMANN: Right.  DICKERSON: How about you, Mark? What are you looking for on election night?  LEIBOVICH: Well, I mean, look, I -- I think, obviously, East Coast states, because that\u2019s what we know we don\u2019t have to wait around. It would be nice to -- I\u2019m trying not to pay attention to exit poles like we do. I mean there\u2019s been like a recent wave of people, drunk inclusions, between the hours of maybe 3:00 and 7:00 p.m.  DICKERSON: Right.  LEIBOVICH: That\u2019s blocked off for a nap at this point.  But, yes, we\u2019ll see. I think North Carolina, New Hampshire will be early indicator states and also the time zone advantages.  DICKERSON: And, Jamelle, we don\u2019t want to look at the exit poles too early because they are sometimes wrong in the way they work, right?  BOUIE: Right. Exactly.  DICKERSON: Quickly, Jamelle, whoever wins, there\u2019s going to be a huge chunk of the public that\u2019s going to be unhappy. Do you -- is there -- I mean is that just the way it\u2019s going to be or is there anything the victor can do right away on election night at all to begin the heal?  BOUIE: I -- you know, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m, unfortunately, pessimistic here. I think that\u2019s just the way it\u2019s going to be. I think the tenor of this campaign specifically on the Trump effort, the constant implications of rigging and the constant implications of Clinton and the Clinton electorate being somewhat illegitimate, it\u2019s going to leave us with some fraction of people who are not just going to be upset, but they\u2019re going to be (INAUDIBLE). And I don\u2019t know how that plays out.  DICKERSON: All right, we\u2019re going to have to end it there.  Sorry, Amy Walter.  WALTER: That\u2019s OK.  DICKERSON: Hopefully it will all be cleaned up by the time we\u2019re here next week.  Thanks to all of you.  We\u2019ll be right back.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Be sure to tune into CBS \u201cTHIS MORNING\u201d tomorrow for Charlie Rose\u2019s conversation with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in his first interview following the conviction of two of his former aides in the bridgegate scandal.  And then on Tuesday night, be sure to join Charlie and me and the rest of our political team, 7:00 p.m. Eastern, for our extended live coverage of election returns on CBS. And, of course, our digital network, CBSN, will have coverage all day leading up to that.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Finally a word of thanks to all of you, our viewers. This has been an emotional, hard fought, and a little jittery presidential race. You were always there with us, whether your preferred candidate was ahead, or behind, or you found yourself shaking your head about the choices. Thanks for sticking with us.  We\u2019ll be here after it\u2019s over, trying to make sense of it all, putting the news into context and looking to what lies ahead. We know you will be too.  Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I\u2019m John Dickerson.  ",

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg, mayor of the Rust Belt city of South Bend, Indiana, is considering a bid to lead the Democratic National Committee (DNC). \u201cI\u2019m looking at where I fit into the conversation,\u201d Buttigieg told Politico in an interview published late Thursday. \u201cThere can be a lot of ways to do that. What I care about though is our party moves forward in a way that\u2019s going to work, that makes sense on the ground in the world I live in and is not going to devolve into a factional struggle.\u201d According to Politico, the South Bend mayor declined to definitively say whether he plans to become an official candidate in the race for DNC chair. He did, however, say that he would step down from his role as mayor if he won the race to lead the national party.\u00a0 If Buttigieg runs, he would face a potentially crowded field.\u00a0Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota\u00a0remains a leading contender for the position, as well as Jaime Harrison, chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, and New Hampshire\u2019s Democratic Party chair, Ray Buckley. Labor Secretary Tom Perez is also gunning for the top DNC slot. Howard Dean, who has already served once in the position, dropped his bid earlier this month, announcing in Denver that \u201cother priorities\u201d prevented him from seeking a second stint as chairman. \u00a0 Compared to some of his potential competition, Buttigieg may lack some of the national name recognition needed for the party\u2019s chairmanship. But the Sound Bend mayor has also drawn plaudits for his adept handling of local Democratic coalitions and for his experience revitalizing a Rust Belt town. Buttigieg, 34, has been the chief executive of the fourth most populous city in Indiana since 2012. Unlike the majority of the red state, South Bend -- which is located in St. Joseph County and neighbors the University of Notre Dame campus -- went blue. (One of the only four counties in Indiana to vote for Clinton, St. Joseph\u2019s voters eked out a narrow victory for Clinton of fewer than 250 votes, according to CBS News\u2019 election map.) Buttigieg, with his Harvard pedigree and a master\u2019s from Oxford, has been dubbed by one New York Times columnist a \u201cperfect Democratic candidate.\u201d  But he\u2019s equally primed to appeal to more conservative white, working-class voters -- a demographic the Democratic party struggled to connect with during the 2016 campaign season. Since he first took office, the popular mayor has overseen the innovative urban renewal of South Bend, once a manufacturing hub and the former headquarters of automakers Studebaker. He is currently a lieutenant in the Navy Reserve, and was deployed in 2014 for seven months in Afghanistan.  Buttigieg is also gay. He came out in a local newspaper op-ed in 2015, in the midst of of his re-election campaign for mayor, and in November, he won 80 percent of the vote. He is the first openly gay executive in Indiana. In 2014, the Washington Post named him \u201cthe most interesting mayor you\u2019ve never heard of.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The mood in the Washington press corps is bleak, and deservedly so.  It shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone that, with a few exceptions, we were all tacitly or explicitly #WithHer, which has led to a certain anguish in the face of Donald Trump\u2019s victory. More than that and more importantly, we also missed the story, after having spent months mocking the people who had a better sense of what was going on.  This is all symptomatic of modern journalism\u2019s great moral and intellectual failing: its unbearable smugness. Had Hillary Clinton won, there\u2019d\u00a0be a winking \u201cwe did it\u201d feeling in the press, a sense that we were brave and called Trump a liar and saved the republic.  So much for that. The audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate, it turned out, was rather limited. This was particularly true when it came to voters, the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it. Trump knew what he was doing when he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him. They hate us, and have for some time.  And can you blame them? Journalists love mocking Trump supporters. We insult their appearances. We dismiss them as racists and sexists. We emote on Twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other, and yet we reject their feelings as invalid.  It\u2019s a profound failure of empathy in the service of endless posturing. There\u2019s been some sympathy from the press, sure: the dispatches from \u201cheroin country\u201d that read like reports from colonial administrators checking in on the natives. But much of that starts from the assumption that Trump voters are backward, and that it\u2019s our duty to catalogue and ultimately reverse that backwardness. What can we do to get these people to stop worshiping their false god and accept our gospel?  We diagnose them as racists in the way Dark Age clerics confused medical problems with demonic possession. Journalists, at our worst, see ourselves as a priestly caste. We believe we not only have access to the indisputable facts, but also a greater truth, a system of beliefs divined from an advanced understanding of justice.  You\u2019d think that Trump\u2019s victory \u2013 the one we all discounted too far in advance \u2013 would lead to a certain newfound humility in the political press. But of course that\u2019s not how it works. To us, speaking broadly, our diagnosis was still basically correct. The demons were just stronger than we realized.  This is all a \u201cwhitelash,\u201d you see. Trump voters are racist and sexist, so there must be more racists and sexists than we realized. Tuesday night\u2019s outcome was not a logic-driven rejection of a deeply flawed candidate named Clinton; no, it was a primal scream against fairness, equality, and progress. Let the new tantrums commence!  That\u2019s the fantasy, the idea that if we mock them enough, call them racist enough, they\u2019ll eventually shut up and get in line. It\u2019s similar to how media Twitter works, a system where people who dissent from the proper framing of a story are attacked by mobs of smugly incredulous pundits. Journalists exist primarily in a world where people can get shouted down and disappear, which informs our attitudes toward all disagreement.  Journalists increasingly don\u2019t even believe in the possibility of reasoned disagreement, and as such ascribe cynical motives to those who think about things a different way. We see this in the ongoing veneration of \u201cfacts,\u201d the ones peddled by explainer websites and data journalists who believe themselves to be curiously post-ideological.  That the explainers and data journalists so frequently get things hilariously wrong never invites the soul-searching you\u2019d think it would. Instead, it all just somehow leads us to more smugness, more meanness, more certainty from the reporters and pundits. Faced with defeat, we retreat further into our bubble, assumptions left unchecked. No, it\u2019s the voters who are wrong.  As a direct result, we get it wrong with greater frequency. Out on the road, we forget to ask the right questions. We can\u2019t even imagine the right question. We go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases. The public\u2019s estimation of the press declines even further -- fewer than one-in-three Americans trust the press, per Gallup -- which starts the cycle anew.  There\u2019s a place for opinionated journalism; in fact, it\u2019s vital. But our causal, profession-wide smugness and protestations of superiority are making us unable to do it well.  Our theme now should be humility. We must become more impartial, not less so. We have to abandon our easy culture of tantrums and recrimination. We have to stop writing these know-it-all, 140-character sermons on social media and admit that, as a class, journalists have a shamefully limited understanding of the country we cover.  What\u2019s worse, we don\u2019t make much of an effort to really understand, and with too few exceptions, treat the economic grievances of Middle America like they\u2019re some sort of punchline. Sometimes quite literally so, such as when reporters tweet out a photo of racist-looking Trump supporters and jokingly suggest that they must be upset about free trade or low wages.  We have to fix this, and the broken reasoning behind it. There\u2019s a fleeting fun to gang-ups and groupthink. But it\u2019s not worth what we are losing in the process.\u00a0 Will Rahn is a political correspondent and managing director, politics, for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "There were protests throughout the U.S. on Wednesday after Donald Trump\u2019s surprise election victory.\u00a0 Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0presidential victory set off protests in New York and across the nation Wednesday. CBS New York reported a small group composed of dozens of protesters grew in numbers that unofficially amounted to between 7,000 and 10,000 \u2013 and the group was still growing by 9 p.m. The protesters took over Fifth Avenue near Trump Tower. CBS New York confirmed that at least 15 people had been arrested.\u00a0 Protesters started at 6 p.m. in Union Square, and began marching northon Broadway to Sixth Avenue at 7:30 p.m. They eventually ended up at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, and later headed to Trump International Hotel & Tower at Columbus Circle. The protesters chanted \u201cNot my president\u201d and \u201chey, hey, ho, ho Donald Trump has got to go.\u201d They held signs that read \u201cTrump Makes America Hate\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Lose Hope.\u201d  Some of the protesters cursed out key battleground states that Trump had won to secure victory.\u00a0 Outside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in midtown police installed barricades to keep the demonstrators at bay.  Police say the protests have been mostly peaceful. The NYPD tweeted at 8:30 p.m. that they are looking for two men who may have Molotov cocktails at the protest.\u00a0 NYPD looking for two males with possible backpacks full of Molotov cocktails at the anti-Trump protest in Manhattan. The signs of his victory were evident in New York, where security barricades were placed in front of Trump Tower.\u00a0 Thousands of people are protesting the election of Donald Trump for President of the United States in downtown Los Angeles, CBS Los Angeles reports. The protest started at around 7:30 p.m. Wednesday night and may have been organized on Facebook. CBS Los Angeles was in Sky 9 above the protest that appeared to be disorganized and had no specific start and end point. The crowd was in large numbers on Main Street approaching Temple. There was also a large crowd gathered at the front of City Hall. The Los Angeles police was monitoring the crowd. An effigy of Donald Trump was burning but put out quickly. No violence has been reported. Protesters gathered at Philadelphia\u2019s City Hall on Wednesday, CBS Philadelphia reports.\u00a0 Hundreds of protesters came together for an event held by the Philadelphia Socialist Alternative. Police say they estimate the number to be around 700. In Portland, Dozens of mostly young protesters rallied against President-elect Donald Trump, disrupting traffic and shutting down streets and freeways.\u00a0 During the Wednesday gathering people shouted \u201cnot my president\u201d and many carried signs saying things like \u201cLove Trumps Hate.\u201d  The Portland Police said a portion of Interstate 5 through the city was briefly closed in both directions because of protest activity.  Earlier the protest in downtown drew several Trump supporters, who taunted the demonstrators with signs. At one point, a lone Trump supporter was chased across Pioneer Courthouse Square and hit in the back with a skateboard before others intervened.\u00a0 In Chicago, hundreds of protesters have gathered outside Chicago\u2019s Trump Tower to express their disapproval of the election results. Authorities say police have been stationed outside the hotel and condominium tower since early Wednesday, when it was apparent the Republican Trump had defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in their presidential contest.  The protest was organized by the groups Freedom First International and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, among others. The organizers contend the protest is designed to show solidarity with Muslims, women, LGBTQ people, poor and working people and Black Lives Matter.  CBS Chicago reports event was billed as an \u201cemergency protest,\u201d and thousands had signed up via Facebook. The demonstration started at 5 p.m. and was expected to last until 9 p.m. A different event had been planned by another Facebook group \u2014 to \u201cPoint and Laugh at Trump Tower\u201d the day after the election. The organizer made some last-minute changes, given Trump\u2019s unexpected victory. In Boston, protesters chanting \u201cwe will not be silenced\u201d and carrying signs reading \u201cHe Will Never Be My President\u201d gathered on the steps of the Massachusetts Statehouse following Republican Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory.\u00a0 Many of those chanting and singing hailed from Boston-area colleges and said they were shocked and disillusioned by Democrat Clinton\u2019s loss.  Meaghan Schaefer, a 19-year-old political communication student at Emerson College, said she was angry.  \u201cWe were so close to seeing the first woman become president and she lost to a man who has no political experience, who doesn\u2019t represent the majority in this country,\u201d she said.  Matthew Bittner said he was in utter disbelief with Trump\u2019s win.  He said he knows Clinton isn\u2019t perfect, but said he felt like people didn\u2019t want her in office because she\u2019s a woman.  \u201cThere\u2019s so much bigotry in this country that we thought was resolved but it was just covered with a blanket,\u201d said the 21-year-old theater student from Suffolk University. \u201cHe wants to bring back a sexist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic society and we will not stand for it.\u201d  The two were among hundreds who flocked to the Statehouse holding signs that read \u201cMake Bigots Afraid Again,\u201d chanting \u201cI\u2019m still with her\u201d and singing The Beatles\u2019 \u201cAll You Need is Love.\u201d  Massachusetts, a reliably Democratic state in presidential elections, handed its 11 electoral votes to Clinton on Tuesday. The last Republican presidential candidate to win Massachusetts was Ronald Reagan in 1984.  Nineteen-year-old Robert Duncan, who is black and a musical theater student at the Boston Conservatory, said he is gay and sees Trump as an oppressor.  \u201cHe\u2019s said awful things to people of all different kinds,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cI\u2019m here because I just want to get all my emotions out honestly. I\u2019m sad. I\u2019ve been crying all day.\u201d  Many of those protesting said despite Trump\u2019s victory, they have their eyes on the future.  \u201cFor the next four years, we just have to do what we can,\u201d Schaefer added. \u201cWe can\u2019t throw away our shot. We\u2019re young. We\u2019re educated. We can make a difference the next time around.\u201d At Berkeley, thousands of students walked out of several East Bay high schools Wednesday, protesting Republican Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory, CBS San Francisco reports.\u00a0 Students at Berkeley High, Bishop O\u2019Dowd, Albany High and Oakland Tech all staged walkouts. Meanwhile, several hundred students staged a noontime rally at San Jose\u2019s Lincoln High School and El Ceritto policesent out an alert at 1 p.m. asking drivers to be careful because walkouts were underway at several Contra Costa County schools. Students at a few Phoenix high schools walked out of class Wednesday in protest of Donald Trump\u2019s win, CBS affiliate KPHO reports.\u00a0 About 200 students at Carl Hayden High School chanted \u201cOut Donald Trump\u201d as they left school around noon. The high school is located at 35th Avenue and Roosevelt Street. Students at Metro Tech, North and Central high schools also staged walkouts. Students were seen holding signs and the Mexican flag as they marched to the Arizona State Capitol where they gathered outside the building and then walked a circuit around the plaza. Many of the signs expressed anti-Trump and anti-Sheriff Joe Arpaio sentiments. Arpaio was defeated by Democrat Paul Penzone after 24 years in office. Phoenix police officers were in the area to keep the students on the sidewalks and unharmed. The protest has remained peaceful. A small group of students gathered in front of City Hall in downtown Phoenix.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump and his advisers believe they are on the cusp of victory, and that an unexpected surge of Election Day voting can and will turn the tide in their favor, reports CBS News correspondent Major Garrett. In the campaign\u2019s final days, one state has emerged as the surprise centerpiece of the fight for 270 electoral votes: Michigan. CBS News Election Center: Live results \u201cThere\u2019s no place I\u2019d rather be for my last rally, right here in Michigan,\u201d Trump said Tuesday in Grand Rapids.\u00a0 At a midnight rally in the usually-Democratic state of Michigan, Trump framed today\u2019s election as a middle class rebellion. \u00a0 \u201cToday the American working class is going to strike back, finally,\u201d Trump said. Basking in the glory of his last campaign rally, Trump squeezed in his most popular campaign shtick one more time.  \u201cI just want to ask you one question, if you don\u2019t mind at one o\u2019clock in the morning. Who is going to pay for the wall?\u201d Trump asked.  \u201cMexico!\u201d the crowd yelled.  \u201c100 percent,\u201d Trump said.  In New Hampshire, Trump claimed he secured an endorsement from New England football legend Tom Brady.\u00a0 \u201cHe called today and he said, \u2018Donald, I support you, you are my friend and I voted for you,\u2019\u201d Trump said.   In Florida, where early vote totals have Trump backers encouraged, the candidate lightened the mood by reaching into the crowd for a flimsy likeness of himself.  \u00a0 \u201cNice head of hair, I\u2019ll say that,\u201d Trump said. \u00a0The move served as symbol for Trump\u2019s closing argument: only he can unmask the Washington system his supporters have come to loathe. \u201cIt\u2019s time to reject a media and political elite that\u2019s bled our country dry,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0 Florida, North Carolina and Ohio must form the foundation of every Trump victory scenario -- a setback in any of those three states spells defeat. Other states to watch: New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Colorado. As for Trump, he will vote in Manhattan, and like the rest of the nation, await the outcome.",

            "article_content": "Produced by Tom Seligson, Allen Alter and Susan Mallie [This story first aired on Feb. 13. It was updated on Dec. 10.] Thankfully, there aren\u2019t many small towns or big cities that have gone through what Kaufman, Texas, has.  Mark Hasse, Kaufman\u2019s assistant district attorney, was shot at 8 o\u2019clock in the morning on a busy street just a block from the courthouse. In this small town there was a huge turnout at the service for Hasse who was 57 and unmarried, but very well known.  Kaufman is just 30 miles from Dallas, but it\u2019s a different world.  It\u2019s rural and until Jan. 31, 2013, quiet.  Lenda Bush and Kelley Blaine were headed to the courthouse that morning.  \u201cI was driving up this road. I saw the shooter cross that street. And Mark was walking this way...\u201d Bush, a lawyer and former police officer, told \u201c48 Hours\u201d correspondent Richard Schlesinger. \u201cWhen I first got out of my car, I heard a gunshot, so I turned and looked towards this direction,\u201d said Blaine, a court coordinator. Neither is a stranger to crime or criminals. But they were not prepared for what they saw and heard that morning. \u201cHe shoved Mark ... Mark straightened up, shoved back and then he took the gun and shot right into his neck,\u201d said Bush. \u201cWhat did he look like?\u201d Schlesinger asked. \u201cHe had on a ... black mask so it covered his face,\u201d Blaine replied. \u201cCouldn\u2019t tell what he looked like, or his age at all.\u201d The gunman fired two final shots into the air and raced to his car.  Just then, Bush, the ex-cop, happened to be driving by on her way to work. She saw the shooting and the gunman whose face and body were completely covered. So Bush pulled in to try to read the license plate number on the shooter\u2019s car but there was no license plate. The shooter took off, and so did Bush. She followed the car for about three blocks. She tried to call 911, but she was nervous and she had a new phone so she fumbled and kept dialing 991, and the killer got away. Bush hurried back to the crime scene where she was captured on a police car\u2019s dashboard camera giving Hasse CPR. \u201cI gave CPR until the police officer came, and they took me aside and they said, \u2018We\u2019ll take it now,\u2019\u201d she said. The identity of the masked murderer remained a mystery, but there was no disguising the impact of Hasse\u2019s killing. Kaufman County Sheriff David Byrnes and Hasse\u2019s boss, District Attorney Mike McLelland, had a press conference within hours. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of running down many leads right now,\u201d Sheriff Byrnes told reporters. \u201cIt felt like a family member had died,\u201d the sheriff said.    \u201cMy name\u2019s Mike McLelland and I\u2019m the criminal district attorney for Kaufman County. We lost a really, really good man. He was an excellent friend and a spectacular prosecutor,\u201d the D.A. told the crowd. Because Hasse was Mike McLelland\u2019s chief deputy, special prosecutors had to be brought in. Dallas attorneys Toby Shook and Bill Wirskye took over one of the most important cases they\u2019d ever had. \u201cAnd this was pretty unprecedented, I mean it was an attack on the judicial system the way we looked at it,\u201d said Toby Shook. \u201cKilling a prosecutor is like killing a police officer. Another one is going to take his place,\u201d Bill Wirskye said. \u201c...and we thought we were the right ones to take Mark Hasse\u2019s place, and get justice for the person that murdered him.\u201d Local police immediately began the hunt for the killer. Soon, state and federal officers swarmed Kaufman to offer help. It was up to Lt. Jolie Stewart of the Kaufman County Sheriff\u2019s Department to help run the investigation. The first order of business was to find that getaway car.  \u201cWe knew we had a light colored maybe silver or tan sedan, four door, maybe a Ford Taurus. And that was gonna be our suspect vehicle. You just don\u2019t realize how many cars fit that description till you start stopping them,\u201d said Lt. Stewart. Lenda Bush had told police everything she could remember, but it wasn\u2019t much. So the Texas Rangers turned to a hypnotist to try to dredge up whatever was stored in her subconscious memory.  \u201cWell, I\u2019m always a little bit skeptical about things like that.  But I was certainly willing to do it, if it would help,\u201d she said.  Under hypnosis, Bush said there was an unusual pattern on the back of the car. That would help a lot before long, but it didn\u2019t mean much then. Investigators were relying on more traditional police work.  \u201cThe mindset when you have a major crime like this,\u201d Wirskye explained, \u201cit is to reach out and touch every suspect you can as fast as you can and try to account for them.\u201d \u201cAnd the accounts we were getting about how it happened, with the murder, getting up close with Mark, it just told me it was probably a grudge or a grievance this person had that was extremely personal,\u201d he continued. Mark Hasse was one tough Texas prosecutor. Over a long career he\u2019d sent a long line of murderers, armed robbers, and drug dealers to the penitentiary. Some of them were free now, bearing grudges and bearing arms. \u201cWe were literally swamped with suspects,\u201d said Wirskye. \u201cThis investigation, from day one, was like drinking out of a fire hose,\u201d said Stewart. There was one man right in Kaufman who police went to see right away. Eric Williams was a lawyer, and a justice of the peace, but he may well have had a motive to kill Mark Hasse. Williams had been caught and convicted of stealing computer monitors from a county office. The case had been prosecuted by Hasse.  \u201cYou know, it was common knowledge that he was not happy with that,\u201d said Sheriff Byrnes. \u201cSheriff Byrnes had detectives immediately go to his house,\u201d said Shook. \u201cHe comes to the door with his arm in a sling and claims that he had shoulder surgery,\u201d said Sheriff Byrnes. The deputies tested Williams\u2019 hands for gunshot residue and found none.  \u201cYou know, we had -- had no reason to disbelieve him at that time.  But we still -- you know, he was still on our radar,\u201d said Sheriff Byrnes. That\u2019s when public attention soon started focusing on the white supremacist prison gang, the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas or ABT.  The ABT had just been front page news after a federal indictment charged members of the gang with murder and drug trafficking. The indictment had been sought by a group of prosecutors, including Mark Hasse.  And then there were other high-profile shootings of law enforcement officials by members of other White Supremacist gangs.   About two months after Hasse was killed, Evan Ebel, a member of the 211 Crew prison gang murdered the head of the Colorado prison system. Two days later, Ebel was pulled over on a lonely Texas highway by a sheriff\u2019s deputy who thought something was suspicious about his car. Ebel shot the deputy and sped away, leaving the wounded officer in the grass.  He led police on a high-speed chase through the Texas countryside, about 125 miles from Kaufman.  He was finally stopped after hitting a truck and then was killed in a shootout.   It turns out that Evan Ebel wasn\u2019t even in Texas on the day Hasse was killed.  And while the white supremacists were getting all the headlines, investigators could not shake the feeling that they were spinning their wheels.  \u201cThe bottom line for those gangs is money, and killing a prosecutor, killing a police officer is just bad for their business,\u201d said Wirskye. But as the weeks went without an arrest or a major break in the case, the question became could whoever have killed Mark Hasse get away with it and even kill again?  For weeks after the murder of Mark Hasse, investigators were drowning in information -- tips and leads that Sheriff David Byrnes says all went nowhere. \u201cNinety-nine-point-nine percent of what we gathered was not helpful,\u201d he said. The sheriff and his team began eliminating some suspects with no possible links to the crime. They were convinced that neither the Aryan Brotherhood nor a drug cartel was involved.   \u201c...in Kaufman County, we\u2019re not prosecuting any cartel cases,\u201d said Sheriff Byrnes. Mark Hasse\u2019s murderer was still on the loose. And everyone around the courthouse was looking over their shoulders wondering if they were safe or if they were next. Kelley Blaine works in one of the courts. \u201cOne of the hardest things of all of that was helping my 70-something-year-old judge put on a bulletproof vest just so he could leave work and go home,\u201d she said. Hasse\u2019s boss, D.A. Mike McLelland, always carried a gun, but J.R. McLelland says his father worried about people he worked with. \u201cAnd that was the thing about Dad. Bein\u2019 the D.A. he felt responsible for everyone in that office,\u201d J.R. McLelland told Schlesinger, adding that his dad was armed \u201call the time.\u201d In fact, he was seen on video at a local gun store looking for weapons for his staff. And then, just hours after he went to the gun store -- and two months after Mark Hasse was shot down in broad daylight -- there was another, if possible, even more shocking killing.  KTVT News report: Tonight Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife have been shot and killed in their Forney home. It was a grisly killing. The district attorney and his wife were murdered at dawn in a hail of bullets. \u201cIt was a bad, bad scene,\u201d Sheriff Byrnes said. \u201cProbably one of the worst two crime scenes I\u2019ve ever been on because of the blood and the carnage.\u201d Cynthia McLelland was shot repeatedly, with one final shot to her head. J.R McLelland was driving when he got the news about his father and stepmother. \u201cI got out of the truck, and -- stood there.  I had my kids in there with me,\u201d he said. \u201cDidn\u2019t know what to say, didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d He had to tell his sister, Krista Ball. \u201cI was shocked for two or three seconds.  And I just broke down.  The first thing you\u2019d think of when you hear somethin\u2019 like that is, you know, did-- how long did they suffer?\u201d said Ball. The murder of the McLellands meant the law enforcement community was now dealing with a serial killer who so far had set his sights on them. \u201cWas there any doubt in your mind that these two murders were connected with Mark Hasse\u2019s murder?\u201d Schlesinger asked. \u201cIt was one of the first things that entered my mind when I got the call,\u201d said Lt. Stewart. \u201cWe knew that they were connected,\u201d said Sheriff Byrnes.  County officials immediately got around-the-clock armed police protection. And Special Prosecutor Toby Shook took precautions even though he lived 30 miles away in Dallas. \u201cI had my wife take out two guns, told her what the situation was and not to open the door,\u201d said Shook. \u201cNot even for a police officer?\u201d Schlesinger asked. \u201cNo.  And I told her I would be texting her and calling her before I came back to let her know it\u2019d be me comin\u2019 through the door,\u201d Shook explained. \u201cI wanted to think I knew that nobody was comin\u2019 after any of us but ... the paranoia was crazy,\u201d said J.R. McLelland. After all the false leads since the Hasse murder, police got a significant and unexpected break just one day after the McLellands were gunned down. An anonymous tip came into a Crime Stoppers website. And the tipster\u2019s opening line of his email: DO WE HAVE YOUR FULL ATTENTION NOW? He -- or they -- certainly did. \u201cIt was very specific as to the type of ammunition that was used in Mark Hasse\u2019s death ... so somebody who had that much knowledge probably knew a lot more. So he was definitely somebody that we wanted to start a dialogue with,\u201d said Lt. Stewart. Whoever it was seemed to be taunting the police and in the email exchange on the Crime Stoppers website threatened to commit more murders. By now, with every other suspect eliminated, police turned their full attention to Eric Williams. He was the one-time justice of the peace who stole those computer monitors. He wasn\u2019t hiding -- he was riding around town on a Segway. And he was talking to investigative producer Jack Douglas of CBS station KTVT . \u201cMy heart goes out to all the families that have been affected by this tragedy.  And especially to the people that work at the court house. I worked there for several years while I was going to law school and so I know that it\u2019s a tight-knit family - that this is devastating to them,\u201d Williams told Douglas. \u201cThere was a coldness about him,\u201d Douglas said of Williams. \u201cIt didn\u2019t look genuine to me,\u201d Special Prosecutor Bill Wirskye said. \u201cHe looked smug, he looked like he was smirking and he just looked like a psychopath.\u201d \u201cAnd what\u2019s it make you feel like knowing that you\u2019ve been somehow wrapped up in this?\u201d Douglas asked Williams. \u201cIt actually makes me feel [pause] that the police are doing the thorough job that they need to,\u201d he replied. Williams was right. The police were hard at work learning everything they could about him. Jenny Parks thought she knew Eric Williams pretty well and she liked him. \u201cProfessionally, we were very friendly,\u201d she said. Parks, a local attorney in Kaufman County, has known Williams since he was a young court coordinator in town. \u201cAnything you needed done on that docket, he would make sure it got done or set,\u201d Parks said. \u201cSo, I didn\u2019t know of anyone that didn\u2019t like him, you know, back when he first started practicing law.\u201d But everything changed in May 2011, just six months after Williams had been elected justice of the peace. That\u2019s when he was caught repeatedly on surveillance video taking those monitors and other equipment from a county building.  He said he needed them for his office. But within two weeks, he was arrested. Lt. Evans:  I don\u2019t think that you actually believe-- I mean, you\u2019re an educated person.  I see your class ring on your finger.  That you can just walk into a IT department and say, \u201cI need a monitor.  I\u2019m takin\u2019 that one.\u201d  I mean --  Eric Williams: There\u2019s places that do that.  Lt Evans: Places being here in Kaufman County or --  Eric Williams: Well, I mean, there\u2019s businesses that do that.   It was Mark Hasse and Mike McLelland who decided to prosecute Williams for the computer theft, a felony, and some people thought they had gone too far. \u201cI thought it was crazy,\u201d Parks said. \u201cI just know he wasn\u2019t stealing them from the county -- misappropriating them ... he was going to use them for a legitimate purpose. I feel sure about that. He maybe didn\u2019t go through the right channels to obtain them, because he didn\u2019t get along with the person that allotted them. There was even speculation that this was a political prosecution. Williams had supported McLelland\u2019s opponent in the election.  \u201cI don\u2019t think my dad and Mark Hasse tried Eric Williams any different than they would have tried anybody else if they\u2019d done somethin\u2019 that broke the law and -- and had charges filed against them,\u201d said J.R. McLelland. And, in fact, prosecutors offered Williams a deal: plead guilty to a misdemeanor and avoid jail. He refused. \u201cHe told me because it was all fabricated, and he would win, and there was nothing to worry about, and there was no problem.  And he didn\u2019t wanna have a misdemeanor on his record,\u201d said Parks. Eric Williams was a member of the international high-IQ society, Mensa. But his decision was not a very smart one.  Williams went on trial and was convicted of a felony and it cost him almost everything he had worked for.  \u201cShortly thereafter, of course, he lost his right to be an elected, public official,\u201d Parks explained. \u201c...he lost his health insurance.  He lost his law license, eventually, which meant his livelihood, his ability to provide for his family.\u201d \u201cSo he lost a lot?\u201d Schlesinger asked.  \u201cYes, sir,\u201d Parks affirmed. \u201cDidn\u2019t go to jail?\u201d  \u201cNo, sir. But he lost a lot, yes, sir,\u201d said Parks. And special prosecutor Toby Shook says Williams was out for revenge.   \u201c... and the judge sentenced him to probation and the computer records show the next day on LexisNexis, he started searching Mark Hasse, where he lived and that sort of thing,\u201d he said. Tonya Ratcliff started hearing about Eric Williams from her close friend, Cynthia McLelland, the D.A.\u2019s wife. They were both members of a quilting club. And she knows the McLellands were concerned about Williams ever since that trial. \u201cThey told me about some of his history with having been prosecuted before and that they thought he had just the personality type that couldn\u2019t stand being humiliated,\u201d Ratcliff told Schlesinger. \u201cDid they think that he was humiliated?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Ratliff replied. And after Hasse\u2019s murder, the McLellands were even more concerned.  \u201cDid they feel like targets?\u201d Schlesinger asked. \u201cPossibly.  Yes, because they -\u201d \u201cDid she ever say anything?\u201d Schlesinger asked. \u201cYes, she did tell me that she felt that Eric Williams was behind it and that they were going to take precautions at home to take care of themselves,\u201d said Ratliff. \u201cMike McClelland, from day one, minute one, knew that it was Eric Williams that had gunned down Mark Hasse,\u201d said Wirskye. That\u2019s why sheriff\u2019s deputies went to Williams\u2019 house that day. They checked out his story that he had shoulder surgery and within days they determined he was lying. So why wasn\u2019t Williams arrested then?  \u201cFor what?\u201d said Sheriff Byrnes. \u201cMurder,\u201d said Schlesinger. \u201cWell, where\u2019s our evidence that he did it?  We had no evidence.  And - \u201c \u201cHe lied to the police about - \u201c \u201c -- that\u2019s not  an offense.  It is federally.  You can\u2019t lie to a federal off -- you can lie to us all day.  And quite frankly we kinda expect most people we talk to lie to us,\u201d Sheriff Byrnes told Schlesinger. They needed more. They needed Eric Williams, the man from Mensa, to do something dumb. And they were about to get lucky.  \u201c...for being a self-proclaimed genius-- thinkin\u2019 he was smarter than everyone, he made some -- some pretty stupid mistakes,\u201d said Shook. After D.A. Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were killed, Texas lawmen knew any one of them could be next.  But even though they felt certain Eric Williams was their man, they didn\u2019t have enough on him. So everyone was on edge -- especially at the courthouse. News report: Some employees felt safer going into the building escorted by law enforcement officers. Others vowing to protect themselves packed a lunch and a gun. And they were running out of time. Remember that anonymous Crime Stoppers tip? The tipster had threatened that the killings would resume soon.  \u201cThen he made a threat that these assaults would continue unless a Kaufman County judge resigned by the next Friday,\u201d said Toby Shook. The police had to find the source of the tip before the fatal deadline. With the clock ticking, they found surveillance footage from businesses near the McLelland\u2019s house taken around the time of the murders. \u201cWe saw a white Ford Crown Victoria on different pieces of video footage, entering the neighborhood at about the right time and exiting it about the right time. So at that point, in addition to trying to interview Eric Williams, our focus was trying to find that white Ford Crown Victoria,\u201d said Bill Wirskye. Eric Williams had hired lawyers who prevented police from talking to him. Luckily for the police, that changed suddenly.  \u201cWe get an email on our phone from Eric Williams\u2019 lawyers saying, \u2018We no longer represent Eric Williams,\u2019 and that was a big moment in the investigation, \u2018cause we immediately realized he\u2019s not represented by lawyers, so we can send officers over to attempt to interview him,\u201d Wirskye explained. But police still didn\u2019t have enough evidence to get what they really wanted: a warrant to search inside the house where Eric Williams lived. They\u2019d have to get his permission and that didn\u2019t seem very likely. But Williams was full of surprises and when the police asked he said yes and invited them in.  \u201cAnd that fits in with his psychopathic, egotistical mindset. He thought he could fool law enforcement in this case,\u201d said Wirskye. Armed with Eric Williams\u2019 permission -- and several pistols -- Major Dewayne Dockery of the Texas Rangers and another officer entered the house, well aware that they were now alone with the man they believed had committed three murders. \u201cOne of us had to be watchin\u2019 him all the time because if he did have weapons in there, he would\u2019ve known where they were.  We wouldn\u2019t have known where they were,\u201d said Maj. Dockery. The officers made an audio recording of the entire search. Because they had no warrant, they could only look for things where Williams allowed. But they saw enough. They found parts of weapons that could have been used in the murders. First, they found a gun sight. \u201cHe had told me ... that sight hadn\u2019t been on a gun.  And I ask him about that,\u201d said Dockery.  Major Dockery: This has been on a gun at one time...I mean it\u2019s even got oil on it...It\u2019s been cleaned and everything.  Eric Williams: Yeah. That doesn\u2019t surprise me.   And they found another suspicious item. \u201cAnd I ask him about it, he said he didn\u2019t know what it was,\u201d Dockery said of the Heat Seeker 3500. \u201cIt\u2019s a device that uses infrared technology to find heat signatures up to 900 feet away.\u201d Heat signatures can help find people. It was enough to get that warrant they wanted for a detailed search of the house. And they came back the next day with more manpower, including the FBI. They went through every inch of the house and they got very lucky.  \u201cThe biggest thing they found during the search is we found a title to a white Ford Crown Victoria,\u201d Wirskye said. \u201c ...just validated what we thought, that we were on the right track, that Eric Williams was our killer, and we were gettin\u2019 close to getting him.\u201d It was a huge break, but not the only one. In the entryway to the Williams house, police found a scrap of paper tucked inside a computer bag. There were some numbers scribbled on it. And it didn\u2019t take long to figure out what they meant.  \u201cWhen you call in a Crime Stoppers tip, you get a personal ID number \u2018cause all that\u2019s anonymous,\u201d Sheriff David Byrnes explained. \u201cWe contacted the administrator on Crime Stoppers.  And ... we were able to find out that ... number was linked to that certain tip that we got,\u201d said Lt. Jolie Stewart. That tip was the one that correctly identified the ammunition used to kill Mark Hasse and threatened to kill again. It was enough to arrest Williams for something. And that very night he was arrested without incident at his home for making deadly threats. But there was still not enough to charge him with murder. \u201cWe still hadn\u2019t located the murder weapon, we hadn\u2019t located the getaway car, and we were a little bit dejected after the search that we didn\u2019t -- locate the-- the white Crown Victoria.  One thing that happened during the execution of the search warrant is the media showed up and the search was carried on live TV,\u201d said Bill Wirskye. And that led to the biggest break yet. The morning after the search was televised, one viewer called Wirskye. \u201cIt was a friend of Eric Williams, who told me, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve got some information I think you need to know.  I know about a secret storage place that Eric Williams has,\u201d Wirskye told Schlesinger. \u201cHe told us that he had rented a storage unit on behalf of Eric Williams, because Eric Williams didn\u2019t want his name associated with this storage unit, and he was able to lead us to that storage unit.\u201d Police quickly got a warrant for the unit that Williams secretly rented a few towns away.  \u201cWe had law enforcement just surrounding  the storage unit, and we finally cut into the lock,\u201d Wirskye explained. \u201cOnce we raised the door, there\u2019s the white Crown Victoria.\u201d The Crown Victoria -- one of the crown jewels in the case against Eric Williams.  \u201c...it was like Christmas morning and the Dallas Cowboys winnin\u2019 the Super Bowl all rolled into one, and there were a lotta hugs and high fives,\u201d said Wirskye. \u201cI told my wife this, that -- I said, \u2018Other than the birth of my children, that was probably the best feel -- feeling I ever had.\u2019\u201d Maj. Dockery recalled with a laugh. Besides the car was a boatload of weaponry: dozens of guns, thousands of rounds of ammunition, police badges, bulletproof vests and a crossbow. \u201cThat locker was-- a tactical officer\u2019s dream,\u201d said Lt. Stewart. And it was more than enough for the detectives. So on April 18, 2013, almost three weeks after the McLellands were killed, Eric Williams was charged with capital murder for shooting them and prosecutor Mark Hasse.  But it turned out Williams did not act alone.  In December 2014, 20 months after being charged with murdering D.A. Mike McLelland, his wife, Cynthia McLelland, and prosecutor Mark Hasse, Eric Williams went on trial in front of people who used be his courthouse colleagues.  It had been a long and difficult investigation, and now prosecutor Bill Wirskye could finally tell everyone in the courtroom it was Eric Williams who shot down their friends for revenge after being prosecuted for stealing those computer monitors. \u201cHe begins to plot, he begins to plan,\u201d Wirskye told the court. \u201c...to seek vengeance. Fatal and final retribution...\u201d This case was undeniably personal to Wirskye. And he got up close and personal to Williams when he said Williams killed Cynthia McLelland because she was in the way.  \u201cShe died because she was married to Mike McLelland and she died because this man didn\u2019t want to leave a witness to a murder!\u201d the special prosecutor said in a raised voice as he pointed to Williams. Prosecutors had a ton of evidence:  the weapons stockpile, the Crown Victoria, police uniforms and badges, and compelling witnesses.  Dallas police officer Charles Tomlinson was the first at the McLelland\u2019s house that night.  \u201cShe was just layin\u2019 on the ground. And the dried blood, coagulated blood,\u201d he testified. Tomlinson had been down the street visiting his parents, who were good friends of the couple, and they followed him to the crime scene. Charles Tomlinson: My parents were behind me and my mom immediately hit the ground.  Special prosecutor Bill Wirskye:  And when you say hit the ground, describe what you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about.  Charles Tomlinson: She just fell to her knees and started crying. The defense made no opening statement and called no witnesses. Mike McLelland\u2019s son, J.R., and daughter Krista looked on as Williams\u2019 lawyer made the case that the prosecution had not made its case. \u201cEric Williams did not commit these murders. There\u2019s not one single piece of biometric evidence that ties Eric to the McLelland home. Not one fingerprint, not one piece of DNA, not one hair, nothing,\u201d defense attorney Matt Seymour told the court. The jurors seemed to decide not only was there no reasonable doubt, there was no doubt at all -- they took just an hour and 40 minutes to reach a verdict, finding Williams guilty of capital murder. But some of the most shocking testimony would come in the sentencing phase of the trial, where the jury would decide if Williams would get the death penalty. It was the debut of a star witness. Eric Williams\u2019 wife of 16 years, Kim, had also been charged with all three murders. She admitted she drove the getaway cars after all the killings. Special prosecutor Bill Wirskye: Were you a willing participant in these murders?  Kim Williams: Yes, I was. Kim Williams had since filed for divorce and said she took part in the murders because she was addicted to pain killers.   Special prosecutor Bill Wirskye: Tell the members of this jury what you were addicted to. Kim: Kim Williams: OxyContin, morphine, valium, Provigil -- a lot of stuff. The soon-to-be ex-Mrs. Williams confirmed her husband\u2019s motive for murder was anger -- fury, really -- that he was convicted for stealing those computer monitors. Special prosecutor Bill Wirskye: Why did you agree to drive to the murder of Mark Hasse?  Kim Williams: I was so drugged up and I so believed in Eric and everything that he told me. His anger was my anger.  Remember Lenda Bush, the ex-cop who witnessed the shooting? She recalled under hypnosis the shooter\u2019s car had a strange pattern on the back. It turns out, the getaway car Eric Williams used after the Hasse murder had a strange pattern right where Bush remembered. It was paw prints. The former owner had been a cat lover.  After the Hasse murder, the car broke down and didn\u2019t last long enough to use in the McLelland murders. \u201cHe wanted to use the original car that we used for Mark Hasse but the transmission blew, couldn\u2019t use it,\u201d Kim Williams testified. Kim said that\u2019s why Williams bought that white Crown Victoria. And she said he dressed up like a police officer to dupe the McLellands into letting him in the house. She also said after killing the McLellands, she and Eric celebrated. Kim Williams: We had barbeque steaks, but we had steaks on the grill and Eric cooked those.  Special prosecutor Bill Wirskye: What was the mood like at the cookout?  Kim Williams: Happy, joyous.  And Williams was also, apparently, not finished.  Special prosecutor Bill Wirskye: After the McLelland\u2019s were killed, were there more on the hit list? Kim Williams: Yes. Kim Williams said judges would have come next, specifically the one who\u2019d mentored Williams and urged him to take that plea deal in the theft case.  \u201cAnd he bought a cross bow with razor tips,\u201d Kim Williams testified. Among all the items found in the storage unit, one of the most puzzling and chilling had been homemade napalm stored in of all things, pickle jars. Kim Williams said it was meant for the judge. \u201cHe was gonna wait for him and shoot him with a crossbow and then bore his stomach out and put the napalm in it,\u201d she said on the stand. Kim Williams\u2019 testimony might well have sealed her husband\u2019s fate, but Mike McLelland\u2019s family wanted a chance to talk to him. His son and daughter did not hold much back.   \u201cYou\u2019re a sorry S.O.B. and we hope you rot,\u201d said Krista Ball. \u201cI wish you could look me in the eye right but you can\u2019t,\u201d said J.R. McLelland. J.R. heard how Williams had celebrated after killing Mike and Cynthia and taunted him.  \u201cTonight, while you\u2019re eating a baloney sandwich, I\u2019m going to have steaks, ribeye, baked potatoes, a big fat glass of sweet tea,\u201d J.R. addressed Williams. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be there to watch you die along with the rest of my family.\u201d And Cynthia\u2019s daughter, Christina Forman, might have given the kind of sendoff most people in Kaufman would have wanted for Eric Williams: Christina Forman: Pretty much the only thing I have to say is f*** you Eric Williams ...  Judge: C\u2019mon ma\u2019am.  Christina Forman: My apologies to the court ... anyway, I hope you get exactly what you deserve.  Eric Williams was sentenced to death.  Judge: The people of Kaufman County, I know you\u2019ve been scared for the last couple of years, no reason to be scared anymore. We\u2019re in recess. \u201cHe always thought, and probably still today thinks, that he\u2019s the smartest person on the face of the earth,\u201d said Bill Wirskye. \u201cBut look where he is now,\u201d Schlesin  ger commented. \u201cExactly, he may be the smartest man on Texas Death Row,\u201d said Wirskye. Kim Williams pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. \u201cWhat did you expect justice to feel like?\u201d Schlesinger asked J.R. McLelland. \u201cI guess you expect it to feel like this big ball of relief just rolls over you. And everything is good now.  And that everything was terrible and now everything\u2019s great,\u201d he replied. \u201cAnd what did it feel like?\u201d \u201cIt felt no different,\u201d J.R. replied. It was the outcome the McLellands wanted and needed. But justice can only take a person so far. It\u2019s still up to the McLellands, like all survivors, to find a way to move on and move past the trial and the tragedy.   \u201cDad wouldn\u2019t want us to sit and grieve him forever,\u201d J.R. McLelland said. \u201cSo, you pick up, you go on.  And ... start livin\u2019 life again. ...But I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll ever be easy.\u201d Eric Williams\u2019 request for a new trial was denied; he has filed for a stay of execution. It can take more than 20 years of appeals before an execution. Correspondent, \"48 Hours,\" \"CBS Evening News\"",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Air conditioning company Carrier Corp. said Tuesday that it had reached a deal with President-elect Donald Trump to keep nearly 1,000 jobs in Indiana. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence planned to travel to the state Thursday to unveil the agreement alongside company officials. Trump confirmed the meeting on Twitter late Tuesday, promising a \u201cGreat deal for workers!\u201d I will be going to Indiana on Thursday to make a major announcement concerning Carrier A.C. staying in Indianapolis. Great deal for workers! In another Tweet, Trump celebrated: \u201cWe will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier.\u201d Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier Trump spent much of his campaign pledging to keep companies like Carrier from moving jobs overseas. His focus on manufacturing jobs contributed to his unexpected appeal with working-class voters in states like Michigan, which has long voted for Democrats in presidential elections. The details of the agreement were unclear. Carrier tweeted that the company was \u201cpleased to have reached a deal\u201d with Trump and Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indianapolis. We are pleased to have reached a deal with President-elect Trump & VP-elect Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indy. More details soon. A transition official confirmed that the president-elect and Pence, who is ending his tenure as Indiana governor, would appear with Carrier officials Thursday. The official insisted on anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the trip ahead of an official announcement. Trump said last week that he was \u201cmaking progress\u201d on trying to get Carrier to stay in Indiana, sending this tweet on Thanksgiving: I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon! In February, Carrier said it would shutter its Indianapolis plant employing 1,400 workers and move its manufacturing to Mexico. The plant\u2019s workers would have been laid off over three years starting in 2017. United Technologies Electronic Controls also announced then that it planned to move its Huntington manufacturing operations to a new plant in Mexico, costing the northeastern Indiana city 700 jobs by 2018. Those workers make microprocessor-based controls for the HVAC and refrigeration industries. CBS News 4, the CBS affiliate in Indianapolis, said that the company, which manufactures heating, ventilating, air conditioning and refrigeration systems, planned to send work to Mexico starting next year. That move would have saved it $65 million a year in labor costs, according to the union that represents the workers. Carrier and UTEC are both units of Hartford, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp. - which also owns Pratt & Whitney, a big supplier of fighter jet engines that relies in part on U.S. military contracts. Mr. Trump, whose own \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and\u00a0other Trump-branded\u00a0clothing items\u00a0use materials not made in the U.S., has called the intended closure of the Indianapolis factory \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cun-American\u201d over the course of his campaign.\u00a0 During an Indiana campaign stop in May, the then-GOP candidate told rally-goers that he could \u201c100 percent guarantee\u201d the plant would not leave if he were elected. Carrier\u2019s union says its Indianapolis workers average $34 an hour with benefits, and Mexican employees will make $6 dollars an hour with benefits, CBS News\u2019 Mark Strassmann noted in April.\u00a0 Chuck Jones, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents Carrier workers, said of Tuesday\u2019s news: \u201cI\u2019m optimistic, but I don\u2019t know what the situation is. I guess it\u2019s a good sign. ... You would think they would keep us in the loop. But we know nothing.\u201d The event Thursday in Indiana will be a rare public appearance for Trump, who has spent nearly his entire tenure as president-elect huddled with advisers and meeting with possible Cabinet secretaries. He plans to make other stops later this week as part of what advisers have billed as a \u201cthank you\u201d tour for voters who backed him in the presidential campaign.

            "article_content": "In the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election, reports of racially charged incidents are emerging from the nation\u2019s schools and universities, including students who chanted \u201cwhite power\u201d and called black classmates \u201ccotton pickers.\u201d  Reporting by The Associated Press and local media outlets has identified more than 20 such encounters beginning on Election Day, many involving people too young to cast a ballot.\u00a0 In Montgomery County, Maryland, a letter was sent home to parents after swastikas were reportedly found drawn on the walls of a middle school, CBS affiliate WUSA reports.\u00a0 The letter states that one of the boys\u2019 bathrooms at Westland Middle school was vandalized with multiple images of swastikas drawn in ink pen, pencil and a glue stick. According to the school, the graffiti has since been removed. Officials said they are \u201cvery saddened by this incident\u201d and that this \u201ctype of behavior will not be tolerated.\u201d At the University of Pennsylvania, black students were allegedly added to a group text message thread that included racist rhetoric and imagery.\u00a0 \u201cI feel sick to my stomach,\u201d Cavalry Rogers, an African-American UPenn student, wrote in a widely-shared\u00a0Facebook post. \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d Students at the University of Oregon reported seeing\u00a0people in blackface on campus. The university said Thursday that it is investigating.\u00a0 At the University of New Mexico, a Muslim engineering student said a man attempted to snatch off her hijab Tuesday while she was studying.  \u201cI turned around and there\u2019s a really buff guy wearing a Trump shirt,\u201d freshman Leena Aggad said Friday. \u201cHe reaches his hand out to my forehead and attempts to pull my scarf off.\u201d  Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League office that monitors extremism, said young people \u201cwere watching and observing this presidential campaign as closely as anyone else.\u201d Now that the campaign is over, \u201cthe impact of what they have seen is not just going to go away.\u201d  On Wednesday, minority students at a high school in Gurnee, Illinois, organized a meeting and protest after a \u201cwhites only\u201d message was found scrawled on a bathroom door. The same day in Michigan, students at Royal Oak Middle school were filmed chanting \u201cbuild a wall\u201d in the cafeteria.\u00a0 At Trump\u2019s alma mater, the University of Pennsylvania, black freshmen were added to a group chat in which one post read \u201cdaily lynching,\u201d and one participant was called a \u201cdumb slave.\u201d School officials are meeting with students groups to respond.  Also in Pennsylvania, two students at the York County School of Technology held a Trump sign in a hallway as someone shouted \u201cwhite power,\u201d an incident captured on video and widely shared on Facebook.  The president of the local NAACP said the video showed a hallway full of loud students so any teacher or administrator who was monitoring would have known what was happening. Sandra Thompson added that the parents of black children in local schools have been told to \u201cgo back to Africa.\u201d  School administrators in Vice President-elect Mike Pence\u2019s hometown of Columbus, Indiana, called for civility and respect after reports of Hispanic students being taunted. Felipe Martinez told The Indianapolis Star that his two sons were twice intimidated with chants of \u201cbuild that wall,\u201d including on Election Day. The chant was common at Trump campaign rallies.  The morning after the election, leaflets from the Ku Klux Klan showed up in a neighborhood in Birmingham, Alabama. At Central Texas University in San Marcos, police were investigating who posted fliers Thursday around campus urging the formation of \u201ctar and feather vigilante squads\u201d and threatening to \u201carrest and torture\u201d campus diversity advocates.  In Durham, North Carolina, two walls were spray-painted with the statement \u201cBlack lives don\u2019t matter and neither does your vote.\u201d  The words - and in some cases violence - cut both ways.  In Louisiana, a university football coach disciplined four players in response to a locker room video showing members of the team dancing and singing the lyrics of a profane anti-Trump rap song. Anti-Trump protests have swept U.S. cities, with one turning violent in Portland, Oregon, as demonstrators smashed windows and set trash afire Thursday night.  A videotaped assault in Chicago showing black men beating a white man as onlookers scream \u201cYou voted Trump\u201d gained traction among conservative social media users after being broadcast by local television. The teenager who shot the video and her father told WFLD-TV that the dispute began over a minor traffic accident and escalated with bystanders\u2019 shouts about the election, which was not a factor in the fight.  At the University of New Mexico, Aggad said she squirmed around in her chair to avoid contact with the man and then stood to confront him. He is white and attends a class with her.  \u201cHe said we think we can say whatever we want, but when they come and retaliate with whatever, they are the ones who get in trouble,\u201d said Aggad, who was born and raised in New Mexico by Palestinian parents who came to the United States about two decades ago.  Aggad said neither faculty members nor other students came to her aid. She later filed a report with the university\u2019s equal opportunity office, and a campus-wide email went out urging tolerance. She said she does not want anyone disciplined but wants her voice heard.  A university spokeswoman said officials had received complaints about several other incidents since the election and will investigate.  A racial backlash also unfolded after the election of Barack Obama, America\u2019s first black president, in 2008. At the time, police documented alleged crimes, from vandalism and vague threats to at least one physical attack. Insults and taunts were delivered by adults, college students and even children.  Anti-Trump protests have erupted this week in cities including Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago and New York.  \u201cIn order for it to die down, the impetus for it has to go away,\u201d Segal said. \u201cWe need our elected officials, our leaders, our community organizations, to make sure that this ... rhetoric that has become normal over the past few months goes away.\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- The likelihood that young adults will earn more than their parents has plummeted in recent decades, a study has found, fueling concerns that the American dream of steady upward mobility is foundering amid a widening wealth gap. Just half of Americans born in 1984 earned more at age 30 than their parents did at that age, down from 92 percent in 1940, according to research released Thursday by Stanford economist Raj Chetty and five colleagues. The study found two reasons for the drop: Income inequality has widened, so that even when the economy has grown, fewer Americans have received enough income gains to overtake their parents. And average annual economic growth has slowed since 1980, compared with the 35 years after World War II. \u201cReviving the \u2018American Dream\u2019 of high rates of mobility will require economic growth that is spread more evenly across the income distribution,\u201d Chetty and his co-authors wrote. Anxieties about status and economic opportunity formed a backdrop to the 2016 election campaign, with many voters concerned that their children wouldn\u2019t fare as well as they had. Conversely, many younger voters worry that they won\u2019t do as well as their parents, largely because of sluggish income growth and higher costs for housing, health care and student debt. Chetty\u2019s research suggests that those concerns are well-founded. The decline in mobility occurred across all states but was worse in Rust Belt states such as Michigan and Indiana, both of which backed Donald Trump. Mr. Trump has indicated that his administration will focus on accelerating economic growth but has said less about income inequality. His choice for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has said the administration\u2019s policies will increase the economy\u2019s growth to as high as 4 percent annually, from the roughly 2.2 percent pace that\u2019s prevailed since the recession ended. The U.S. economy hasn\u2019t posted 3 percent growth for a full year since 2005. Chetty\u2019s study underscores how much faster and more evenly distributed economic growth was after World War II. By 1970, when those born in 1940 were 30 years old, 92 percent - nearly all Americans, across all income levels - were earning more than their parents had at that age. \u201cGrowth patterns after the war were magnificent,\u201d said Nathaniel Hendren, an economist at Harvard and co-author of the study. \u201cThey were high, but also broadly shared across the income distribution.\u201d Among the poorest 10 percent of Americans, 94 percent of those born in 1940 had surpassed their parents\u2019 income 30 years later. That fell to 70 percent for those born in 1980 and who reached 30 years of age in 2010. The middle class suffered a sharper drop: 93 percent of those born in 1940 into families with median household incomes - halfway between the top and bottom - had fared better than their parents by 1970. By 1980, only 45 percent of those born into the middle class did better than their parents 30 years later. And for children born into the richest 10 percent in 1940, nearly 90 percent did better than their parents. That figure plunged to 33 percent in 1980, partly because it became harder for children of wealthy families to surpass their parents. Those figures show that mobility has fallen for everyone - rich and poor. Hendren suggested that that might, in fact, make it a less polarizing problem. \u201cThis is something that everybody shares,\u201d Hendren said. \u201cIt is perhaps a little less divisive than what one might have thought.\u201d The study follows separate research released this week by Thomas Piketty at the Paris School of Economics and two colleagues that documented worsening income inequality since 1980. That study found that Americans in the bottom half of the income scale have experienced stagnant income since 1980. Adjusted for inflation, the bottom 50 percent earned about $16,000 in 1980 and earns about the same now, the paper concluded.",

            "article_content": "Protests against President-elect Donald Trump roiled major cities across the U.S. for the second day on Thursday as the nation came to grips the result of the election. Like a rolling wave, protesters voiced their anger all across the country. Fires raged in Oakland where 7,000 gathered while an effigy of the President-elect burned in Los Angeles, CBS News\u2019 David Morgan reports.\u00a0 Protesters returned to Trump Tower in New York on Thursday night, CBS New York reports.\u00a0 CBS New York estimated that about 200 people were gathered across the street from the building on the sidewalk. Unlike Wednesday night, Fifth Avenue remained open. The group again held signs reading, \u201cBump Trump,\u201d and \u201cNot My President.\u201d Protests were also held elsewhere around the country again on Thursday. Trump took to Twitter Thursday evening to express his disapproval of the protests. In Minneapolis, a swarm of protesters blocked Interstate 94 in both directions Thursday night after marching from a rally at the University of Minnesota.\u00a0 The Star Tribune reports some protesters sat down on the freeway or stood locking arms and facing a line of police officers.\u00a0 It was the second night of protests in the Twin Cities over Trump\u2019s election. Similar protests popped up in cities across the nation both Wednesday and Thursday nights.  The demonstrators entered the freeway after marching down Franklin Avenue. Protesters blocked both lanes for more than a half-hour and chanted, \u201cShut it down.\u201d Officers from the Minnesota State Patrol and Minneapolis and St. Paul police departments rushed to the area. Hundreds of protesters displeased with Donald Trump\u2019s election as president have marched through Baltimore to the stadium where the Ravens were playing a football game.  Protesters marched downtown to the Inner Harbor and then to the M&T Bank Stadium, where the Ravens were hosting the Cleveland Browns for Thursday Night Football.  The protest brought traffic to a standstill but was otherwise peaceful.  The Baltimore Police Department says in statement that the protest attracted a crowd of roughly 600 people. The statement says two people were detained by police but no one has been charged.\u00a0 In Philadelphia, protests against President-Elect Donald Trump got underway around 5:00 p.m. on Thursday night, marking the second straight day of demonstrations over him being elected president, CBS Philadelphia reports.\u00a0 CBS Philadelphia\u2019s chopper was live over Center City where some protesters gathered. The protests came amid word that some of those who were displeased with the result of the election, took to vandalism at City Hall on Wednesday night. Philadelphia Police are telling commuters to expect delays. They add that a group of approximately 1,000 people marched on JFK Boulevard heading towards 30th Street. #BREAKING: Anti-Trump Demonstrations Continue In Philadelphia For Second Night: https://t.co/aafei4f6XG pic.twitter.com/QdxoA96SdY The signs throughout the protests have made it clear of the displeasure that the demonstrators have for a President Trump. The rally started with a gathering of hundreds of people outside of the Municipal Services Building before the marching began. Police said that Wednesday\u2019s protest was peaceful and they expected the same for Thursday. They estimated that as many as 1,000 people protested on Wednesday night. Officers characterized the protest as uneventful. \u201cFor the most part, they were peaceful,\u201d said Lt. John Stanford. He added that they were a couple instances along the way of people setting fires, some burning flags. A photo was also snapped of city workers cleaning the words \u201cNot My President,\u201d off of City Hall. Officers say it is important to strike a balance between people expressing themselves and the safety of others. Thousands of San Francisco high school students staged a citywide walkout n bikes, scooters, skateboards and on foot, \u00a0and shutdown San Francisco\u2019s Market Street before marching along the waterfront in a mass demonstration Thursday, protesting the presidential election Republican Donald Trump, CBS San Francisco reports.\u00a0 More than 2,000 students walked out of several schools Thursday morning and headed toward Civic Center Plaza, according to the San Francisco Unified School District. From there, many of the students walked down Market Street, through downtown and along the Embarcadero. As students from other city high schools streamed out of the Muni metro subway stations, the crowd swelled. Traffic on the busy Embarcadero grounded to a halt as the students marched toward Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. The group eventually returned to Civic Center Plaza and gathered on the steps outside City Hall, taking turns with a megaphone to talk about Trump. Fritz, a freshman from the independent Bay School of San Francisco, called Trump racist, sexist and homophobic. A student said he'll gladly face consequences for walking out of H.S. \"This the most important thing I've ever done\" pic.twitter.com/NkUp43CeNf \u201cDonald Trump cannot be our president. I mean it\u2019s depressing, America, I thought we were better than this,\u201d Fritz said. Nate, also a freshman at Bay School of San Francisco, said, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have a voice, even if we can\u2019t vote.\u201d He said if underage teen students were able to vote, \u201cthat probably would have changed things\u201d in the narrow race between Trump and Democratic candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Perry Cox, a 15-year-old Lincoln High School student who was at the protest with her mother, said, \u201cI don\u2019t want Trump as my president for the rest of my teen years.\u201d Cox said she hoped the San Francisco students\u2019 protest, one of several taking place around the Bay Area Wednesday and Thursday about the election of Trump, \u201cwill draw attention to the fact that he shouldn\u2019t be our president.\u201d Students from the Bay School of San Francisco were there with the permission of their parents and teachers. SFUSD officials said while they supported the students\u2019 right to free speech, the walkout from the public schools \u201cwas not authorized by SFUSD staff\u201d and families will be notified through the district\u2019s attendance system about their unexcused absence, per standard protocol. Interim Superintendent Myong Leigh was at the rally and said he has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about the walkout because of concerns for the students\u2019 safety, but said \u201cWe\u2019re proud of these young people, we\u2019re proud of the actions they\u2019re taking to channel their emotions and we want them to know we stand with them.\u201d The crowd was beginning to disperse as of shortly before 2 p.m. In Oakland, students walked out of classes and interrupted a press conference by Mayor Libby Schaaf. A group of between 200 and 400 Pittsburg High School students marched with their principal from their school to Antioch. According to Antioch police, the protestors headed through Century Plaza in Pittsburg and into Antioch on Auto Center Way and Sycamore Drive, causing significant hazard and traffic delays in the area. The group proceeded to the Antioch High School campus in an apparent effort to involve students there. Antioch High was placed on lockdown, but the Pittsburg High students still entered the campus and damaged school property, knocking down fences and kicking over trash cans. The group then left that campus and headed to Antioch Middle School, which was also placed on lockdown, as was Live Oak High School and nearby Fremont Elementary School, though the protest never made it that far. According to Antioch police, the Pittsburg High protesters continued to cause havoc on Antioch campuses and in the surrounding neighborhoods for more than two hours. 15 Antioch officers were involved in policing the protest, causing a strain on department resources. During the course of the protest, three juveniles were arrested. One teen was arrested for throwing a dangerous object at a police car, trespassing on school grounds and being a disruptive presence at school. A second was arrested for inciting a fight with an area resident, trespassing on school grounds and resisting a police officer. The third was arrested for assaulting a police officer. Elsewhere, between 400 and 500 students from Napa, New Tech, Vintage and Valley Oak high schools participated in the march that started around 9 a.m.and ended at Memorial Stadium about a block north of Napa High School, Napa Valley Unified School District spokeswoman Elizabeth Emmett said. School officials said the students organized the march and rally through social media Wednesday and those who participated will be charged with an unexcused absence. \u201cI was really impressed with their message. It was one of unity and support. There was no profanity or fighting. It was very respectful,\u201d Emmett said. In San Jose, Mount Pleasant High students walked as did students In Castro Valley, several high schools in Hayward and California High students in San Ramon. The Bay Area has been the scene of several demonstrations since Trump\u2019s victory was announced early Wednesday morning. Most have been peaceful, but a demonstration in Oakland turned violent Wednesday night. Oakland police arrested 30 protesters and cited 11 others alleged crimes includinf assault on an officer, vandalism, unlawful assembly, failure to disperse and firearm possession. Three officers suffered injuring during the protest. Police deployed tear gas several times throughout the night to keep members of the crowd from throwing rocks, bottles, fireworks, M-80s and Molotov cocktails at officers. Twelve other law enforcement agencies were called in to assist Oakland police, including police from San Leandro, Hayward, Fremont, Alameda, Livermore, Newark, Pleasanton, Berkeley and the University of California at Berkeley. On Wednesday, more than 3,000 students walked out of Berkeley High, Bishop O\u2019Dowd, Albany High and Oakland Tech.",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday afternoon, President-elect Donald Trump went to the Manhattan offices of the New York Times for an on-the-record meeting with staffers of the news organization. It was a reminder that despite his limited number of interviews since being elected the 45th president 15 days ago, Mr. Trump has not yet held a press conference. Last week, CBS News compared Mr. Trump\u2019s timeline to past presidential transitions and found that, as far as cabinet and staff appointments go, he\u2019s on pace with his predecessors. However, in comparison to the several most recent administrations, Trump is demonstrably behind on his engagement with the press. His post-Election Day actions raise questions about the kind of access the press will have to Mr. Trump once he\u2019s taken office in the White House. Open press access to the president is important not just to reporters, but to the public at large -- which deserves to know that their elected leader is accountable for his actions and whereabouts. With that in mind, here\u2019s a look at how Mr. Trump and past presidents-elect have engaged with the press during their transition periods: Since his victory speech in the early hours of Nov. 9, the president-elect has largely been sequestered either at Trump Tower or at his golf resort in Bedminster, N.J. There have been shots of him shaking hands with potential cabinet appointees -- like 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, or Arizona\u2019s Kris Kobach for example -- but on none of those occasions did he take questions from reporters. In addition to his stop at the Times on Tuesday, Mr. Trump also met privately with network executives Monday and has done a handful of sit-down interviews since Election Day -- including with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d -- but these are, of course, very different than a full-blown press conference. None of this is to say that Mr. Trump\u2019s team is not providing frequent updates on his behalf: his transition team holds a daily call with reporters, and aides like Kellyanne Conway, Jason Miller and Hope Hicks are responding to questions or holding press gaggles at Trump Tower. But apart from a 2.5-minute video released Monday and occasional tweets, Mr. Trump himself has not been the one providing updates on the transition process. Eschewing press conferences is not the only way Mr. Trump\u2019s engagement with the press has been different than past presidents-elect. He has also not adhered to the traditional protective press pool that past presidents and presidents-elect have accommodated, which means a small group of reporters follows the president-elect\u2019s whereabouts each day and travels along with him when he leaves his residence. Last week, Mr. Trump\u2019s staff told reporters he was in for the night, but he instead took an unannounced trip to a New York City steakhouse. And in fact, his lack of engagement with the press extends back far beyond Election Day: the last time Mr. Trump held a full press conference was at his Florida resort on July 27, almost four months ago. He took questions from a smaller group of reporters on Sept. 5.\u00a0 After his acceptance speech in Chicago\u2019s Grant Park the night of Election Day, which was Nov. 4, 2008, Mr. Obama waited only three days before holding his first press conference as the president-elect. On Nov. 7, 2008, he spoke to reporters to outline his first planned steps to combat the economic crisis, taking questions from his position on implementing tax increases to his intelligence briefings. \u201cImmediately after I become president, I\u2019m going to confront this economic crisis head on by taking all necessary steps to ease the credit crisis, help hardworking families, and restore growth and prosperity,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama held another news conference on Nov. 24, 2008, to introduce his economic team and take questions from reporters. He held a similar news conference to introduce his picks for national security positions and take more questions, including Hillary Clinton as his secretary of State, on Dec. 1. Other similar events with Mr. Obama introducing a cabinet nominee and taking questions were held throughout December.  The timeline for the 2000 election is about a month later than others: then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush was not declared the winner of the race until Dec. 12, and Democratic candidate Al Gore delivered his concession speech on Dec. 13 -- more than a month after voters originally went to the polls. That said, Bush held his first news conference just two days later, on Dec. 15. He answered mainly questions about his cabinet picks, such as whether Colin Powell as secretary of state would be his first cabinet announcement. (Bush did in fact announce Powell as secretary of state the following day, Dec. 16.) After that, Bush held a series of nearly-daily press conferences to announce top cabinet picks, Powell included. On Dec. 16, he announced Powell\u2019s selection and took some questions from the press at each; similar news conferences followed on Dec. 17, 20, 21, 22, and 28. He also took questions following a meeting with congressional leaders on Capitol Hill on Dec. 18.  Clinton, too, held several press conferences before Thanksgiving. After delivering an acceptance speech on Nov. 3, 1992, Clinton waited nine days before holding his first news conference. He held one on Nov. 12, in Little Rock, Ark., in which he took questions about his plans to revitalize the economy, on middle-class tax cuts, his expected relationship with Republican opposition in Congress and his foreign policy priorities. Clinton\u2019s next press conference was just four days later, on Nov. 16 in Little Rock, answering questions about policy regarding Bosnia and Vietnam, the issue of gays in the military and cuts to congressional staff.  Clinton held another press conference on Dec. 10, 1992, to introduce his first Cabinet pick (Lloyd Bentsen for Treasury Secretary) and take questions from reporters. Going farther back, Ronald Reagan did not hold press conferences until after he was inaugurated in 1981. George H.W. Bush held a press conference the day after Election Day in 1988.

Our latest CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0poll shows Trump and Clinton locked in virtual ties in both Ohio and Florida.  The Trump campaign arrived in Sarasota, Fla., just after 4:00 a.m. Monday morning, after stops Sunday in Denver; Sioux City, Iowa; Minneapolis; suburban Detroit; Pittsburgh; and Leesburg, Virginia. \u201cOne day \u2014 can you believe it?\u201d Trump told the crowd in Leesburg. \u201cOne day, one day, one day, one day. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201d CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett, who has been following the Trump campaign, reports that throughout Sunday, Trump\u2019s description of the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton evolved with the news of the day, starting with promises of sure-fire indictments before shrinking to laments about justice possibly thwarted. After midnight Sunday, in northern Virginia, Trump defined the election as a contest between corrupt elites versus the abused middle class, and he said the FBI\u2019s announcement it would not recommend charges after reviewing newly-discovered Clinton emails is proof of a system badly off-track. \u201cHillary Clinton is guilty,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe knows it. The FBI knows it.\u201d It echoed a call he had made throughout the night in Pennsylvania (\u201cShe\u2019s being protected by a rigged system\u201d), and in Michigan (\u201cYou can\u2019t review 650,000 new emails in eight days. You can\u2019t do it, folks!\u201d).  When the campaign day began in Iowa, before news of Comey\u2019s letter clearing Clinton, Trump lionized the FBI and its investigative zeal: \u201cFBI Director Comey and the great special agents within the FBI will be able to collect more than enough evidence,\u201d he told a Sioux City audience.  Trump\u2019s whirlwind weekend of roaring rallies was marred by a disturbance in Reno Saturday night.\u00a0 When Trump supporters confronted a lone protester holding a \u201cRepublicans Against Trump\u201d sign, someone shouted \u201cGun!,\u201d and agents whisked Trump off stage.  There was no gun, and the protester was later released. Trump came back to finish his appearance.\u00a0 \u201cNobody said it was going to be easy for us,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s schedule is so punishing because, while his top advisors say they\u2019re confident of victory, they cannot describe a clear path to 270 electoral votes. Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Michigan, they say, hold the key. Not surprisingly they are the last three stops on Trump\u2019s schedule today. Major Garrett is CBS News' chief Washington correspondent. He's also the host of \"The Takeout,\" a weekly multi-platform interview show on politics, policy and pop culture.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump succeeded in the election partly because of his vow to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d meaning he\u2019d take money out of Washington, D.C. Yet his Cabinet appointees represent a historic level of wealth and a break from the populist rhetoric that appealed to millions of middle-class voters. With many positions yet to be filled, Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees so far have a combined net worth of more than $14 billion, compared with the combined\u00a0$250 million of wealth controlled by the members of former President George W. Bush\u2019s first cabinet. That raises questions about whether Mr. Trump\u2019s administration will deliver on his promises to create positive changes for the average worker. Half of Americans have failed to share in the country\u2019s economic gains since the 1970s, according to new research from economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. That means about 117 million American adults are living on income that\u2019s stagnated at about $16,200 per year before taxes and transfer payments, such as Social Security.\u00a0 Mr. Trump defended his choices at a campaign rally in Des Moines, Iowa. \u00a0\u201cA newspaper criticized me: \u2018Why can\u2019t they have people of modest means?\u2019\u201d he said to the crowd. \u201cBecause I want people that made a fortune! Because now they are negotiating with you, OK?\u2026 It\u2019s no different than a great baseball player or a great golfer.\u201d Several of his appointees inherited or married into their wealth, such as Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who married into the $5.1 billion Amway fortune, and Deputy Commerce Secretary Todd Ricketts, whose $5.3 billion fortune is due to his father\u2019s business, Ameritrade.\u00a0 Ricketts is a co-owner of the Chicago Cubs and the CEO of Ending Spending, an organization that is \u201cdedicated to educating and engaging American taxpayers about wasteful and excessive government spending,\u201d according to its website.\u00a0 Mr. Trump has also picked three generals for his administration, including retired Gen. James Mattis as defense secretary. President Obama has also relied on retired generals to fill key roles, as did former President George W. Bush.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0-- Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is threatening political payback if congressional Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump try to undo President Barack Obama\u2019s major legislative achievements. \u201cThey will rue the day\u201d they repeal Obama\u2019s health care law, Senate Democrats\u2019 leader-in-waiting told The Associated Press in an interview in his office on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s a political nightmare for them. They\u2019ll be like the dog that caught the bus.\u201d Mr. Trump, after meeting with Obama, said he\u2019d like to keep popular pieces of the six-year-old law, including the requirement to extend coverage to people with pre-existing conditions and the provision allowing young adults to stay on their parents\u2019 health plans until age 26. But Schumer said it was a non-starter to try picking off favored pieces of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThere is no way that you can keep those things without keeping the ACA,\u201d Schumer insisted. He added that he\u2019d made similar points directly to Mr. Trump, but declined to share the president-elect\u2019s response. Congressional Republicans have tried repeatedly to repeal the law that helped some 20 million Americans gain coverage, but they\u2019ve been unable to coalesce around a replacement. Democrats chose Schumer this week to serve as minority leader, replacing Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, who is retiring after five terms. In the interview, Schumer also served notice on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill that provided for tougher oversight of financial institutions and created a consumer protection bureau after the 2008 economic crisis. \u201cHe should not even try to think about repealing Dodd-Frank,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cWe will have enough votes to beat that back.\u201d As leader of a 48-member Senate Democratic Caucus next year, Schumer will command enough votes to block majority Republicans from getting the 60 votes needed to proceed on most major legislation. As such, Schumer and his Democrats will be the only backstop against Mr. Trump and the GOP next year when Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. But the Brooklyn-born Schumer pledged to work with fellow New Yorker Donald Trump when possible, arguing that to do otherwise would amount to a \u201ca dereliction of our responsibility to the millions of Americans who need work, who need protection.\u201d Indeed Schumer argued that on some issues Mr. Trump has more in common with the Democrats than Republicans, suggesting a strategy that would amount to forming alliances with Mr. Trump where possible against the wishes of conservative Republicans and GOP leaders on the Hill. \u201cDonald Trump in his campaign advocated many things or a good number of economic issues that Democrats support and Republicans have opposed,\u201d Schumer said, pointing to trade, spending on infrastructure, and a financial loophole benefiting wealthy Wall Street interests. Schumer blamed Democrats\u2019 election failures on an ineffective economic message, and adopting some of Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric he pledged \u201ca bolder, stronger, sharper-edged economic plan aimed at the middle class and those trying to be middle class, and an understanding that the system is rigged against the average person and it\u2019s gotta change, a draining of the swamp if you will.\u201d But he also promised to fight Mr. Trump \u201cwith everything we\u2019ve got\u201d when the new president takes an approach opposed to Democratic values. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do something in name only,\u201d Schumer said. On infrastructure, Mr. Trump has proposed a $1 trillion spending program that some conservatives are already balking at. Schumer said he\u2019d told the president-elect: \u201cIt\u2019ll make a lot of your hard-right people against it, the Freedom Caucus will never go for a large infrastructure bill.\u201d \u201cHe didn\u2019t say \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Schumer said of Mr. Trump\u2019s response. And unlike demands from conservatives, Schumer said he didn\u2019t think such an infrastructure bill would have to be fully paid for - meaning it could add to the deficit instead - a position he said he believed Mr. Trump might share. Schumer also signaled a fight over the Supreme Court vacancy, noting that after refusing to act for nearly a full year on Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland, for the vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, \u201cour Republican colleagues who want to move this quickly don\u2019t come before us with clean hands.\u201d",

            "article_content": "RALEIGH, N.C. --\u00a0Nearly a month after Election Day, North Carolina Republicans appeared to finally accept Democrats\u2019 narrow win in the contentious governor\u2019s race. As it turns out, they weren\u2019t done fighting. In a surprise special session in the dying days of the old administration, some say, the Republican-dominated legislature has thrown the government into total disarray, introducing bills aimed at emasculating incoming Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s administration.\u00a0 Cooper, the current attorney general, has threatened to sue. And many in the state are accusing Republicans of letting sour grapes over losing the governor\u2019s mansion turn into a legislative coup that flies in the face of voters.  \u201cI believe fervently in democracy. I\u2019m watching it be undermined ... by people who seem unwilling to consider or to listen,\u201d said Margaret Toman, who was among hundreds of protesters rallying inside the Legislative Building this week, demanding that Republicans leave Cooper\u2019s authority alone.  The protesters were so loud that Senate and House cleared the galleries, and more than a dozen people were arrested. There were at least 16 new arrests Friday as the House resumed its debate. Protesters chanted \u201call political power comes from the people.\u201d\u00a0 The session continued after the brief interruption,\u00a0CBS Raleigh affiliate WNCN reported. More than 150 demonstrators remained behind in the rotunda of the Legislative Building, according to the Associated Press. At least 16 other protesters were arrested late on Thursday, when demonstrators spent hours chanting and holding signs. They urged elected officials to remember who put them in their seats to begin with. \u00a0\u00a0 HAPPENING NOW: protests erupt \"all political power comes from the people\" shouted in @NCLeg @WNCN #ncpol pic.twitter.com/euEZliEw0n Republicans are considering scaling back the number of political appointees Cooper can make and require the Senate\u2019s approval for top administrators at state agencies. They also are talking about erasing the governor\u2019s ability to shape elections boards statewide.  Republicans insist the legislation is simply adjusting the constitutional powers already granted to the General Assembly. They\u2019ve said many of the provisions had been debated for years but always got set aside.  \u201cThere\u2019s probably no better time than to deal with it in the present,\u201d said Republican Rep. Bert Jones. Democrats said it was a GOP power grab occurring a week after Republican incumbent Gov. Pat McCrory conceded a race he lost by just over 10,000 votes.  \u201cIt is done in a blatant political move by a party that must be afraid of the voters so they have to hold onto the power that they have,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Graig Meyer.  Rep. Billy Richardson, also a Democrat, agreed, expressing disappointment at the legislature\u2019s quick-footed actions during the special session.  \u201cI really fear that we have harmed our reputation and integrity this week,\u201d Richardson said.  Whatever bills get final approval, likely to come Friday, will head to the governor\u2019s desk, but it\u2019s unclear what would happen next. McCrory, who hasn\u2019t commented publicly, could veto or sign the bills, or they could become law without his signature - and before Cooper takes office Jan. 1.  Republicans gained power of both legislative chambers in 2010 for the first time in more than a century, and they have veto-proof majorities.  Two former North Carolina governors - Republican Jim Martin and Democrat Jim Hunt - said this week that the legislation goes too far.  Cooper ran on a platform of defeating Republicans\u2019 agenda, saying he would work to repeal a law known as House Bill 2 that limits LGBT rights.  \u201cIf I believe that laws passed by the legislature hurt working families and are unconstitutional, they will see me in court,\u201d Cooper said.\u00a0 Cooper says while Republican lawmakers aim to cripple his powers, the effect is to protect programs that transfer taxpayer money to private schools, allow increased pollution of air and water, and cut taxes for big corporations instead of the middle class,WNCN reported. Cooper promised he\u2019d fight the proposed legislation, which he called \u201cunprecedented.\u201d \u00a0 Any notion Cooper would get a honeymoon period with the legislature were dashed swiftly this week. Lawmakers began the surprise session on Wednesday within minutes of adjourning another special session McCrory called to approve a disaster relief package.",

            "article_content": "Produced by Lourdes Aguiar, Gail Abbott Zimmerman and Charlotte Fuller Every day, Melissa Calusinski wakes up in an Illinois prison -- a convicted child killer.  \u201cI had nothing to do with it and I\u2019m going to keep continuing to say that,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2026because I had nothing to do with Ben\u2019s death.\u201d In January 2009, 16-month-old Benjamin Kingan died after being in day care.\u00a0 Melissa, the last person to care for him, was found guilty of his murder two years later.  \u201cEverybody knows that the conviction\u2019s rotten to the core,\u201d said Kathleen Zellner, an attorney  who has built a career out of getting the wrongfully convicted out of prison. She tackles high-profile cases like Steven Avery\u2019s from \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d fame.  Zellner is convinced Melissa didn\u2019t get a fair trial.  Melissa is now at the center of a media and legal storm in Lake County, Illinois. There are allegations of medical errors, evidence tampering and even perjury.  Before Melissa became a cause celeb, she was living a quiet life with her parents in a working class neighborhood outside Chicago. \u201c48 Hours\u201d first interviewed her in 2014.  \u00a0\u201cMy family was wonderful. I\u2019m the youngest of five altogether,\u201d she told \u201c48 Hours\u201d correspondent Erin Moriarty. Paul and Cheryl Calusinski are Melissa\u2019s parents. \u201cShe\u2019s a kind hearted person,\u201d Cheryl Calusinski said. \u201cShe would bend over backwards for anybody.\u201d  Growing up, Melissa never got in any trouble, yet she stood out in other ways. She sometimes had trouble expressing herself and understanding others. Melissa\u2019s sister, Crystal, says she was teased at school.  \u201cWhat would kids say?\u201d Moriarty asked. \u201cJust mean things, like \u2026\u2019You don\u2019t know this. You\u2019re stupid,\u2019\u201d said Crystal.  \u201cShe would come home crying sometimes off the bus. Kids would tease her,\u201d said Paul Calusinski. But as she got older, Melissa found her calling. \u201cShe wanted to be taking care of children,\u201d said Cheryl. So when an opportunity later came up to work at the Minee Subee day care center with Crystal, Melissa, then 22, jumped at the chance to be a teacher\u2019s assistant.  \u201cYou know, just hearing them ... little babies it makes my day. It makes my day just being around them,\u201d she said. One of the children in Melissa\u2019s care was toddler Benjamin Kingan. Ben, his twin sister, and two older siblings all attended the day care center in Lincolnshire, an affluent Chicago suburb.  January 14, 2009, started out as a typical day.  \u201cI came to work on Wednesday. And I saw Ben. He was fine, normal, happy, playful,\u201d Melissa recalled. Around 3:30 p.m., after the kids were fed a snack and cleaned up. Melissa says she put Ben down on the carpet and he crawled into his bouncy seat on the floor.\u00a0  \u201cHe was sitting in his bouncy chair playing with his blanket,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd he started to fall back asleep which was normal.\u201d A teacher who was in the room stepped out briefly, leaving Melissa alone with the children. Melissa says that\u2019s when she noticed something wrong with Ben. \u00a0  \u201cHe didn\u2019t look right. \u2026I took his little hand and I touched his hand and I\u2019m like, \u2018Ben, Ben.\u2019 He did not wake up at all,\u201d she explained.  \u201cI saw orange foam ... coming out of his nose, and -- um I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Melissa said in tears. Melissa called for help and Crystal rushed in and administered CPR. Ben was taken to the hospital, but he was pronounced dead an hour later.  \u201cMe and my sister fell to the floor, and we\u2019re just -- we\u2019re just bawling,\u201d said Melissa. \u201cWhat happened to him and how? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she continued. Ben\u2019s death was a mystery. He did not have any cuts or obvious wounds; no serious bruises. But pathologist Eupil Choi would come up with an answer after two autopsies: Ben Kingan died from blunt force trauma of the head.  Dr. Choi said that Ben had suffered a skull fracture and massive brain hemorrhaging that happened that day. So investigators brought in the caregivers who had been with the toddler.  Cop to Crystal Calusinski: Somebody did something to him. Crystal Calusinski was questioned for eight hours and eventually released. But Melissa remained with police.  \u201cWhat did they tell you had happened to Ben?\u201d Moriarty asked. \u201cThat he died of a skull fracture,\u201d Melissa replied. Det. George Filenko | Lake Zurich Police Department: All you need to tell us is the truth. Det. George Filenko: You know 100 percent. We know what happened, but we need you to tell us. Tell us what happened. Investigators read Melissa her rights, and then over and over -- at least 79 times -- she denied doing anything to Ben. Melissa Calusinski: I never put my hands on him \u2026 I did not drop him. \u2026I completely did not do it. \u201cAnd I kept continuously repeating myself,\u201d she said. Det. Sean Curran | Lake Zurich Police Department: Please don\u2019t make us drag everything out of you because it makes it seem like you are being deceitful to us. \u201cAnd they were just continuously not believing me,\u201d Melissa told Moriarty. But after nine hours in that room -- under pressure and without an attorney -- Melissa confessed.\u00a0  Det. Sean Curran: He starts acting up and you get mad at him and you throw him on the floor. Melissa Calusinski: [Nods to affirm] Det. George Filenko: You threw him on the floor?  Melissa Calusinski: Yeah. Really hard. Det. George Filenko: Really hard? Melissa Calusinski: Yeah. She is taken to another station for booking and repeats the same story to another investigator. Officer Adam Hyde| Lincolnshire Police Department: How hard did you throw him? Melissa Calusinski: I went like that (throws doll down hard) After spending 14 hours with police, Melissa was arrested for the murder of Benjamin Kingan -- even though she almost immediately recanted her story.  Melissa Calusinski [in police car]: No, I\u2019m innocent. \u201cThe picture they put of Melissa on the news \u2026 she just looked horrible,\u201d Deluca said. \u201cThe initial reaction from everybody is this horrible person did this unspeakable act.\u201d  Attorney Paul Deluca knew he was facing a difficult battle from the moment he took on Melissa\u2019s case. \u201cIt\u2019s such an emotional case\u2026 see, what happens is a jury is going to want to find someone accountable,\u201d he said. But as Deluca prepared for the upcoming trial, he became convinced that the medical evidence was wrong and that Melissa had given a false confession.  \u201cI had full confidence that I was gonna beat it because I knew I\u2019m innocent,\u201d said Melissa. The State\u2019s theory was that Ben Kingan was a perfectly healthy 16-month-old when he died on Jan. 14, 2009. Lake County Assistant State\u2019s Attorneys Stephen Scheller and Matt DeMartini were part of the prosecution team.  \u201cHe was a very \u2026 healthy baby,\u201d Scheller said. \u201cJust a happy, happy little boy.\u201d \u00a0 \u201cHow would you describe what the parents have gone through?\u201d Moriarty asked. \u201cWhen somebody takes your child from you, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any words to describe what they\u2019ve gone through,\u201d said DeMartini. Melissa\u2019s trial began in November 2011. Prosecutors presented what they said was indisputable medical evidence. According to pathologist Dr. Choi, Ben suffered a skull fracture and massive brain bleeding on the day he died.  \u201cThere\u2019s a massive, massive catastrophic injury to this child,\u201d said Scheller.  But the defense believed Ben had an old injury that contributed to his death. \u00a0The injury was discovered at day care before Melissa started working there. A teacher, Nancy Kallinger, told investigators she heard a noise while another worker was handling Ben.  Nancy Kallinger to investigators: I had my back turned to her\u2026 I heard a thump, like, he hit, you know, the bars on the crib. Kallinger said Ben later woke up with an obvious injury:  Nancy Kallinger: He got a bump on the back of his head \u2026 I mean we called the mom. The mom called the doctor. But Prosecutor Stephen Scheller says that the injury in October 2008 was minor.  \u201cThe pediatrician actually examined Benjamin\u2019s head, had felt around, said there were no issues that she felt needed to be addressed, that mom should just keep an eye on him,\u201d Scheller explained. \u201cBen never had an issue after that.\u201d Not according to defense experts. They say that after that day, there were possible signs of head trauma. Medical records showed that Ben was lethargic. And Nancy Kallinger had pointed out to investigators that Ben slept a lot: Nancy Kallinger: There\u2019s always something up with him. That he sporadically falls asleep. And just two days before he died, Ben threw up on Melissa.  \u201cThis was big vomit. He -- it was like nonstop,\u201d Melissa told Moriarty. Prosecutor Matt DeMartini says Ben\u2019s vomiting two days before his death was just a stomach bug or a winter cold.  \u201cHe was given Pedialyte and put to bed. He woke up the next day and he was fine,\u201d said DeMartini. But the defense says Ben\u2019s prior injury was so serious that any new impact could have major consequences, and Ben did have a habit of throwing his head back.  \u201cHe would sit Indian-style, and when he got angry \u2026 he\u2019d flip himself back and he\u2019d hit his head. And he would do this over and over,\u201d Deluca explained. Nancy Kallinger recalled that Ben had done this twice shortly before his death.  Nancy Kallinger: I put him on the floor and he immediately threw himself on the floor \u2026 and I walked towards the sink and he threw himself again. But prosecutors rejected the defense theory.  \u201cThis child did not explode or implode on his own,\u201d said Scheller.  The State maintains that Ben died only from injuries caused by Melissa, who was overwhelmed by crying babies that day. Melissa Calusinski: It\u2019s frustrating with all these kids, cause they\u2019re screaming, crying\u2026 \u201cShe became frustrated holding Ben,\u201d Scheller said. \u201cShe threw him to the floor.\u201d And Melissa even said there was a witness. She said Nancy Kallinger was at the sink with her back to them. Yet the teacher told police she didn\u2019t hear anything.  Cop: She picked him up like this, raised up, and slammed him to the ground. Cop: \u2026those are her words, OK? Nancy Kallinger: She wouldn\u2019t have done that. But Melissa said she did: Det. George Filenko: You threw him on the floor? Melissa Calusinski: Yeah. Prosecutors told the jury that the blow was so severe it caused a skull fracture. They mentioned the skull fracture more than 30 times. Defense attorney Paul Deluca had little to counter it\u2026.these are copies of the X-rays he was given by the State. \u201cWhen I opened these X-rays, my thought is, \u2018This is ridiculous. We have black X-ray[s].\u2019 I\u2019m laughin\u2019 to myself. I can\u2019t believe this.\u201d The last State witness at trial was pathologist Dr. Manny Montez. He told the jury in powerful testimony that he had examined the child\u2019s body himself and had felt the fracture with his own hands.\u00a0  \u00a0\u201cHe said he put his finger actually through the hole. He said he could see through it,\u201d Deluca said. \u201cHe kept saying, \u2018this is a violent, traumatic forceful injury.\u2019\u201d  \u201cHow damaging was that?\u201d Moriarty asked. \u201cIt was terrible,\u201d Deluca replied. \u201cIt killed us.\u201d Melissa Calusinski was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to 31 years.  \u201cI just \u2026 I almost lost it,\u201d she told Moriarty of the verdict.\u00a0  Melissa has long insisted she\u2019s innocent, but jurors heard her admit her guilt in her videotaped interrogation: Melissa Calusinski: And I went \u201cboom!\u201d So why would Melissa confess to a crime she says she didn\u2019t commit?  \u201cIt took me years to wrap my head around the idea that somebody, short of having a gun to their head, would ever confess to a crime they didn\u2019t commit,\u201d Dr. Saul Kassin, a professor at John Jay College, told Moriarty. \u201cAnd yet, when you look at the database of known wrongful convictions \u2026 Homicide cases in particular, where there is DNA to exonerate \u2026 60 percent of them contain false confessions in evidence.\u201d Doctor Kassin has testified about false confessions in numerous cases, but the judge wouldn\u2019t allow any false confession testimony at Melissa\u2019s trial. \u201c48 Hours\u201d asked Dr. Kassin, a CBS News consultant, to analyze Melissa\u2019s interrogation. \u201cI don\u2019t look at a case like this and pretend to know whether she did something or not,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut I have concerns \u2026 she\u2019s a vulnerable suspect.\u201d \u00a0  When the defense had Melissa\u2019s mental capacity tested, she showed \u201cextreme vulnerability to suggestion\u201d and scored at the bottom for verbal comprehension.  Melissa Calusinski: \u2026because I\u2019m trying to think, what did I do... And Dr. Kassin says Melissa\u2019s long interrogation is worrisome. Melissa Calusinski: I had nothing to do with it. \u201cThe average length of an interrogation \u2026 is 30 minutes to two hours. This one goes nine hours,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that long interrogations put innocent people at risk.\u201d  \u201cEverybody has a breaking point,\u201d Dr. Kassin continued. Melissa Calusinski: I never put my hands on him. Hour after hour Melissa denied she hurt Benjamin: Melissa Calusinski: I did not drop him. Yet, the investigators ignored her denials. And that\u2019s not all. When they asked her to take a lie detector test, \u201cShe immediately says, \u2018yes.\u2019 Not a problem,\u201d said Dr. Kassin. Det. Sean Curran: \u2026It\u2019s called a polygraph examination. Melissa Calusinski: OK.  Det. Sean Curran: Is that something that you\u2019d be willing to take after this? Melissa Calusinski: Yeah. \u201cProfessionally-trained interrogators are led to understand that the innocent person who has nothing to fear and nothing to hide is more likely to say yes,\u201d Dr. Kassin explained. \u201cThen they ask, \u2018You know, there are kids in the room who may be able to communicate\u2026\u2019\u201d Det. Sean Curran: We have a specialist who speaks with children \u2026 do you think it would be a good idea to have that specialist talk to the children that were in that room?  Melissa Calusinski: Yes, I agree. \u201cIf she has something to hide, she might go, \u2018Uh oh. Really?\u2019 She says, \u2018Yeah. I think that\u2019s a good idea,\u2019\u201d Kassin said. \u201c\u2026she acted just like an innocent person should act \u2026 They overlook the innocence cues.\u201d  \u201cAnd I would argue that after hours and hours of-- of denials,\u201d said Dr. Kassin. Melissa Calusinski: I didn\u2019t do anything! \u201c\u2026in each case, the denial is met with a punishing rejection,\u201d Dr. Kassin pointed out. Det. Sean Curran: Give me a f---ing break, this kid\u2019s dead. \u00a0\u201cShe figures out what she needs to do,\u201d said Dr. Kassin. Det. George Filenko: We\u2019re not going anywhere until we get the facts here. \u201cI was just ready to get away from these men,\u201d Melissa told Moriarty. \u201cAnd the script is clear,\u201d Dr. Kassin said.  Det. Sean Curran: I do think an accident happened. \u201cSixty-eight times the word accident \u2026 or mistake or mistaken is made by the detectives to describe what likely happened here,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd, in fact, it comes from them first?\u201d Moriarty asked. \u201cAbsolutely comes from them first, the idea that this is an accident,\u201d Dr. Kassin replied, Det. Sean Curran:\u00a0 Did you hit his head by accident with something? Melissa Calusinski: Nope. Det. George Filenko: \u2026we\u2019re not here to condemn you, we\u2019re not here to put you in jail\u2026 After nearly six hours with investigators, Melissa tells them it was an accident.  Melissa Calusinski: \u2018Cause I didn\u2019t fully put him down, and he kind of almost slipped when I dropped him. And he hit the chair. But investigators don\u2019t accept her answer. They were convinced someone had deliberately hurt Ben that terrible day.\u201d\u00a0  Det. Sean Curran: There\u2019s no way that that would have cracked his skull.  Det. George Filenko: I\u2019m not believing anything you\u2019re telling me right now. \u201cA couple hours later \u2026 the tone is changing. And now the accident is more of a premeditated act,\u201d Dr. Kassin explained. \u201cSuddenly the word \u2018frustrated\u2019 and \u2018angry\u2019 makes its appearance.\u201d Det. Sean Curran: He didn\u2019t do anything to frustrate you? Was this something out of frustration? Melissa Calusinski: [Shakes her head no) Det. George Filenko: Something frustrated you, something happened\u2026 After nine hours in that room, Melissa finally breaks. \u201cThey\u2019ve made it clear that there\u2019s only one way out,\u201d said Dr. Kassin.  Investigators give Melissa a scenario of what she did and why she did it: Det. Sean Curran: We think in this situation the other babies are screaming, crying, whatever ...\u00a0 he starts acting up, and you get mad at him and you throw him on the floor. Melissa Calusinski: [Nods to affirm] \u2026and she goes along with it.  Det. George Filenko: You threw him on the floor? Melissa Calusinski: Yeah.\u00a0 ... really hard.  Det. George Filenko: Really hard? Melissa Calusinski: Yeah.  Melissa told \u201c48 Hours\u201d she truly believed that if she told investigators what they wanted to hear, they would all just go home. \u00a0  Melissa Calusinski: ...I\u2019m just kind of curious, how long \u2026 much more, \u2018cause ...?  Det. George Filenko: Not much longer, we\u2019re on the phone right now. We\u2019re trying to get this done as quickly as possible. Melissa Calusinski: OK. Because I just want to go home and spend time with my parents and my puppy. Melissa Calusinski: Now is this going \u2026 to be going on my record? \u00a0Incredulous, Dr. Kassin remarked, \u201cIs this gonna go on your record? Do you have any idea what\u2019s happening to you right now?\u201d  Dr. Kassin says the detectives coached Melissa to tell a story that matched the medical evidence. But what happens if the medical evidence was wrong? \u201cNormally a pathologist is not 100 percent. But I feel she\u2019s 100 percent innocent,\u201d said Dr. Thomas Rudd. In 2012, Melissa Calusinski had spent a year in prison when her father persuaded Dr. Thomas Rudd, the newly elected Lake County Coroner, to review the autopsy evidence that had helped convict her. \u201cAnd I was stunned. I could not believe what I was seeing, because it was the exact opposite of what was written,\u201d Dr. Rudd told Moriarty.  At Melissa\u2019s trial, pathologist Dr. Choi told the jury that Ben Kingan did not have an old injury. But according to Dr. Rudd, Dr. Choi had made a glaring error. \u00a0  \u201cI saw a membrane, and I thought, \u2018my God,\u2019\u201d said Rudd. \u201cThis is a slide of a part of this infant\u2019s brain?\u201d Moriarty asked. \u201cCorrect \u2026 This is a membrane, this is a scar tissue, this is a scab,\u201d Rudd told Moriarty, referring to the slide. \u201cBy definition if you have a membrane you have an old injury.\u201d Doctor Rudd was so flabbergasted that he called in Dr. Nancy Jones, a well-regarded pathologist who has performed more than 10,000 autopsies. She too saw evidence of an old injury -- one that had been healing for about two or three months, a time frame consistent with that bump the day care workers noticed on Ben\u2019s head.  \u201cHow big was that old injury?\u201d Moriarty asked Rudd. \u201cFour inch-by- four inch,\u201d he replied. \u201cIsn\u2019t that significant?\u201d Moriarty commented. \u201cHugely significant. And how they let that go is beyond me,\u201d Rudd replied. Doctors Jones and Rudd believed this old injury was further exacerbated by Ben\u2019s head banging, and point to evidence of brain swelling. \u201cHis head circumference was large,\u201d said Dr. Rudd. For the first year of his life, the size of Ben\u2019s head, the circumference, was consistently around the 50th percentile compared to other children his age. But less than two months after the October injury, Ben\u2019s head circumference increased to the 75th percentile. At the time of his death, a few short weeks later, Ben\u2019s head measured in the 95th percentile.  \u201cThat is drastic.\u00a0 There\u2019s something wrong,\u201d said Dr. Rudd. Doctors Rudd and Jones acknowledge that Ben did suffer another injury on the day he died, but it may have been a minor bump on the floor that caused that final, fatal swelling of the brain.\u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cThe added fluid of the recent injury \u2026 pushes that brain down and shuts down the breathing system. This was the cause of the child\u2019s death. It was the old injury. The old injury was massive,\u201d said Dr. Rudd. Dr. Rudd knew he had to do something so he called the now retired Dr. Choi. Asked if he was nervous about it, Rudd told Moriarty, \u201cYes ... I thought for a very long time, \u2018How will I do this?\u2019\u201d To Rudd\u2019s relief, Dr. Choi admitted he was wrong. He even signed a sworn affidavit conceding that, \u201cin my report and testimony I missed that Ben had suffered an old injury.\u201d But he crossed out the word \u201csignificant.\u201d\u00a0 Prosecutors Matthew DeMartini and Stephen Scheller say it doesn\u2019t change the case at all. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication anything there is significant,\u201d said DeMartini. And their boss, Lake County State\u2019s Attorney Michael Nerheim, points to a document in which Dr. Choi was asked whether the finding of the old injury would have changed his testimony at trial and he said \u201cno.\u201d \u201cIf his mistake changed the ultimate -- his ultimate opinion, which he hasn\u2019t said that he did, that would concern me,\u201d said Nerheim. But Dr. Rudd suspected that Dr. Choi may also have been wrong about another major part of the State\u2019s case -- that alleged skull fracture.\u00a0  \u201cThe alleged fracture was right in the middle of the head and towards the right going one inch,\u201d Dr. Rudd explained, pointing to the spot on top of his own head. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no laceration there? There\u2019s no bruise?\u201d Moriarty asked. \u201cNone. None whatsoever,\u201d he replied. \u201cHow do you fracture a skull without causing tissue damage to the skin above it? It\u2019s not possible.\u201d Dr. Rudd believes that what Dr. Choi may have actually seen was just a normal part of Ben\u2019s growing skull, but he couldn\u2019t prove it.\u00a0  But in June 2015, that would suddenly change. Melissa\u2019s father said he received an  anonymous call that there was a set of X-rays at the coroner\u2019s office that was never given to the defense. When Dr. Rudd\u2019s staff searched the computer archives, they turned up startling images. \u201cWhat was your reaction when you first saw these?\u201d Moriarty asked Rudd of the X-rays. \u201cI was dumbfounded,\u201d he replied.\u00a0  According to Dr. Rudd, the X-rays are proof that Ben Kingan did not suffer a skull fracture.\u00a0  \u201cThere\u2019s definitely no skull fracture here. I\u2019ve shown this to various pathologists and a radiologist,\u201d Rudd explained. \u201cThey\u2019ve all called me and said \u2018there is no skull fracture in this child at all.\u2019\u201d What the X-rays did confirm, says Dr. Rudd, was that Ben\u2019s head was abnormally shaped which was a clear indication of brain swelling.  \u201cHis head looks like the old-fashioned light bulb.\u201d he explained.\u00a0 \u201cThis is not a normal-shaped skull of a 16-month-old child.\u201d In 2015, Dr. Rudd reclassified Ben Kingan\u2019s death from \u201chomicide\u201d to \u201cundetermined.\u201d Ben\u2019s death may not have been a murder at all.  \u201cIt shocks me because if that would be the case, why am I still locked up?\u201d Melissa told Moriarty. Attorney Kathleen Zellner says the clear set of\u00a0 X-rays changes everything for Melissa, and in June 2015, filed a petition asking the trial judge to throw out Melissa\u2019s conviction.  \u201cThis case screams that it was a wrongful conviction,\u201d said Zellner. Zellner contends that not only does she have new evidence that could have affected the outcome of the trial, but she charges that the X-rays given to the defense were manipulated and she says she can prove it. \u201cThat was her high school and this is\u2026my God she\u2019s a grown woman now. She\u2019s grown up in jail,\u201d said Paul Calusinski while looking at pictures. Paul and Cheryl Calusinski have had one goal since the day their daughter Melissa was arrested in 2009: to bring her home.  \u201cShe knows that we\u2019re doing everything we can,\u201d said Cheryl. \u201cWe do believe she will be coming home soon ... it\u2019s just a matter of time,\u201d said Paul. aul tbd sound 30- years uff on table... \u201clusinski home and cut to them inside looking at letters... Although two higher courts have upheld Melissa\u2019s conviction, they are pinning their hopes on Kathleen Zellner. She\u2019s pushing for an evidentiary hearing to present what she believes is new evidence before Judge Daniel Shanes -- the same judge who had presided over Melissa\u2019s trial.\u00a0 \u00a0  \u201cEvidentiary hearings are extremely rare,\u201d Zellner explained. \u201c\u2026you have to show there\u2019s a substantial likelihood that there\u2019s a constitutional violation.\u201d And Zellner says it will be especially difficult in Lake County -- a jurisdiction that has come under intense scrutiny in recent years for wrongful convictions.  \u201cThey do not want to admit error, and they\u2019ve got a half dozen examples that have cost them millions and millions of dollars,\u201d said Zellner.  The legal wrangling over the hearing would drag out for months -- the State insisting there\u2019s no new evidence. By then, Matt DeMartini had left the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office for private practice.  Melissa\u2019s family and supporters waited for word on a decision.  \u201cThe wheels of justice are moving slow,\u201d Paul Calusinski told supporters outside the court. In June, Judge Shanes finally agreed to grant Melissa her day in court. The Calusinskis were overwhelmed.  \u201cI was just ecstatic. Started crying, actually,\u201d said Melissa. \u201cDid you think this day wouldn\u2019t come?\u201d Moriarty asked. \u201cI knew it was gonna come, but I wasn\u2019t expecting it to hit me as hard as it did that day,\u201d she replied. In August 2016, five years after she was convicted of murdering Benjamin Kingan, \u00a0 Melissa Calusinski was back in a courtroom for a hearing that could decide if she goes free.  \u201cHow much is riding on this?\u201d Moriarty asked Zellner of the hearing. \u201cEverything,\u201d she replied. \u201cI hope that the judge sees the evidence that we\u2019ve gathered and rules in her favor,\u201d said Dr. Rudd. Doctor Rudd testified about Dr. Choi\u2019s admitted mistake and about finding that clear set of X-rays -- X-rays that he and other defense experts say show no skull fracture. X-rays that Melissa\u2019s original attorney says he never saw.\u00a0  \u201cYou never saw this prior to trial\u2026 during trial?\u201d Moriarty asked Deluca. \u201cNo, no,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that that was never turned over to us.\u201d At the hearing, Paul Deluca testified that the clear X-rays were crucial at trial.\u00a0 He says they directly contradict the prosecution who told the jury over and over again that Ben Kingan had a skull fracture.  \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t have been able to throw this term around that easily,\u201d he said.  Remember, the State gave him the three dark X-rays before trial.  \u201cAnd they said, \u2018these are illegible,\u2019\u201d said Deluca. \u201cSo the State handed you a disc, but told you right off the bat --\u201dMoriarty noted.  \u201cYou can\u2019t see anything on the disc,\u2019\u201d said Deluca. But prosecutors now put the blame on Deluca, saying the disc they gave him had software that would enhance the X-rays and he simply didn\u2019t do enough to brighten them.\u00a0 Deluca says he couldn\u2019t open the software.  \u201cWe tried every icon \u2026 nothing else opened up,\u201d he explained. The State says Deluca could have sought more help. To make the point, prosecutors called technician Eric Stauffacher, who works for the software company.\u00a0 He showed how the images could have been brightened. \u00a0  But Zellner says no matter what Deluca did, his X-rays were inferior to the ones in the coroner\u2019s computer, because she believes Deluca\u2019s X-rays were deliberately Photoshopped.\u00a0  To support that charge, she brought in Jeff Mueller, a software developer and imaging expert.  \u00a0\u201cSo I\u2019ll go to adjustments and I\u2019ll go to levels. And then I\u2019ll go ahead and darken this thing until voila, we\u2019ve got the image that looks like the Deluca image,\u201d Mueller demonstrated for Zellner and Moriarty. \u201cWait a minute, you\u2019re saying that someone took this image -- took it off the Coroner\u2019s computer, put it on his or her own, Photoshopped it? Changed it?\u201d Moriarty asked in disbelief. \u201cRight,\u201d Zellner affirmed. \u201cYes,\u201d Mueller replied. But if so, why? \u201cWhat makes this case a homicide is the skull fracture. So if a skull fracture does not exist, there is no homicide. The case collapses. So a tremendous amount of effort went into the manipulation of these images to obscure the fact that there is not a skull fracture. Never was a skull fracture,\u201d Zellner explained. At the hearing, prosecutors challenged Jeff Mueller\u2019s expertise and denied that anyone had manipulated the images. But Zellner had another witness with information about those X-rays.  \u201cI have a very good memory with most cases, but especially when it comes to children,\u201d said Paul Forman, who was the deputy coroner during both of Ben Kingan\u2019s autopsies in 2009.\u00a0  \u201cAs a father of four children, I thought to myself \u2026 \u2018Why? Why? Why did this happen to this child?\u2019\u201d he told Moriarty.  Forman is actually the person who took the original X-rays.  \u201cHow clear were the X-rays that you took of Ben Kingan?\u201d Moriarty asked Forman. \u201cThe X-rays of Ben were good quality,\u201d he replied \u201cThey were clear.\u201d \u201cAre you the one who made that anonymous phone call?\u201d Moriarty inquired. \u201cNo, I did not,\u201d said Forman. \u201cI mean will you swear to me you weren\u2019t the caller?\u201d Moriarty pressed. \u201cA lot of people might think I made that call,\u201d Forman replied. Paul Forman\u2019s testimony was important for Melissa, but no one ever imagined how important he would turn out to be. Attorney Kathleen Zellner believes Melissa Calusinski is innocent of murder, but she wasn\u2019t totally confident she could convince a judge.\u00a0  \u201cUntil you talked to Paul Forman,\u201d Moriarty noted to Zellner.  \u201cUntil I talked to Paul Forman,\u201d she affirmed. \u201cDid you ever expect that he would just hand you a bombshell piece of evidence?\u201d Moriarty asked. \u201cWell, I did not because he didn\u2019t know he was handing me a piece of bombshell evidence,\u201d said Zellner. Former Deputy Coroner Paul Forman had information that Zellner says calls into question the testimony of one of the most important witnesses at Melissa\u2019s trial: Dr. Manny Montez. Montez was the State\u2019s last witness who gave that damning testimony about examining Ben Kingan\u2019s head.  \u201cBottom line is Montez said, \u2018There was a skull fracture \u2026 I touched the skull. I manipulated it, I opened the skull up, I looked at the fracture line,\u2019\u201d said Zellner.  But Forman shocked Zellner with a very different story. He says Montez never physically examined Ben\u2019s body or touched the child\u2019s skull.  \u201cDid he lie to the jury?\u201d Moriarty asked Forman. \u201cYes, he did,\u201d he replied. Forman testified Dr. Montez only viewed the file and autopsy photos and never went into the autopsy room where the child\u2019s body was kept.  \u201cCould he have somehow gone in and looked at Ben\u2019s body, examined the body without you knowing?\u201d Moriarty asked Forman. \u201cNo, I was with him from the moment he came in the door to the moment he left,\u201d he replied. But the State tried to discredit Paul Forman as a witness by questioning his memory as well as his mental health. \u00a0Forman told \u201c48 Hours\u201d he\u2019s been treated for bipolar disorder and depression, which is part of the reason he left the Coroner\u2019s office before Melissa\u2019s trial. \u00a0  \u201cWell, it was a personal attack,\u201d said Forman. Another defense witness raises questions about Dr. Montez\u2019s testimony that there was a skull fracture that could be felt. Dr. Robert Zimmerman, a renowned pediatric neuro-radiologist, testified that it would have shown up on X-rays.  \u201cIt wasn\u2019t there on the X-ray, so I don\u2019t think he could\u2019ve actually seen it,\u201d Dr. Zimmerman told reporters outside the courthouse. \u201cDo you think this was a wrongful conviction?\u201d a reporter asked. \u201cI suspect that it was,\u201d Zimmerman replied. Did Dr. Montez lie to the jury at Melissa\u2019s trial?\u00a0 Doctor Montez never responded to \u201c48 Hours\u201d\u2019 multiple requests for an interview.\u00a0 Prosecutors would not agree to a new interview, either. But in court they said they still stand by their trial witnesses, like Dr. Montez and Dr. Choi, who said there was a skull fracture. \u00a0 As the three-day hearing comes to an end, the waiting begins. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna be hopeful and pray about it,\u201d Melissa said. \u201c\u2026and just hope for the best.\u201d  On Sept. 30, 2016, two weeks after the conclusion of the hearing, Judge Shanes comes back with his decision. Melissa\u2019s petition to overturn her conviction is denied.\u00a0  In his ruling, Judge Shanes stated that he didn\u2019t find Paul Forman\u2019s testimony credible. He pointed out that he observed Dr. Montez at trial and found him truthful and does not believe he perjured himself. The judge concluded the X-rays were not manipulated. What\u2019s more, he agreed with the State that there was just one set of X-rays and that Paul Deluca had the means to brighten them.  Zellner says she wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cI totally expected it. We\u2019re in Lake County,\u201d she replied during a press conference. \u201cThey never admit they\u2019re wrong.\u201d  But Zellner vows the fight isn\u2019t over. The next battleground will be at the State Appellate Court.\u00a0  \u201cDid you ever think you\u2019d be sitting here at age 30?\u201d Moriarty asked Melissa. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, becoming emotional. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d  And it hasn\u2019t been easy for some of Melissa\u2019s supporters, either. Doctor Rudd, who is an elected official, has been accused by the State of being politically motivated in his actions. \u00a0  \u201cI\u2019ve got a bull\u2019s eye on me right now, OK. They do not want me in this office,\u201d said Dr. Rudd. And there\u2019s this: after Paul Forman testified, he was served with a grand jury subpoena. But is it real? It doesn\u2019t contain key information it\u2019s supposed to have, like the case number or name of the prosecutor handling the case. Also unusual, Forman received voicemails from a State\u2019s Attorney investigator reminding him to drop by.  Voicemail from Investigator Biang: Hey Paul \u2026 Just wondering if you\u2019re planning on coming in. It\u2019s 10:00 almost on Wednesday morning. Remember we had the grand jury subpoena. Hoping you can still make it.  Complying with a grand jury subpoena is mandatory, but on the advice of his attorney, Paul Forman didn\u2019t go. Forman and his attorney believe the subpoena was a ruse intended to rattle him.\u00a0 But, on Dec. 16, 2016, the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office contacted \u201c48 Hours\u201d claiming the subpoena was real and denied there was an attempt to intimidate Forman. He continues to stand by his testimony. \u201cMy motivation is we have to find out what happened to Benjamin,\u201d Forman told Moriarty. \u201cI don\u2019t think we made the right accusation in this one.\u201d It\u2019s now been almost eight years since Benjamin Kingan died. Not only have Ben\u2019s parents had to grieve their son\u2019s death, but they have also had to suffer through years of hearings and publicity about the case.\u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0\u201cWe\u2019ve got these poor parents who are reliving the death of their son probably every day \u2026 And now you have all of these facts coming out over these last couple of years that raise questions,\u201d Forman said. \u201cYou know what? That bothers me. \u2026This is not right to either family.\u201d Melissa says she still thinks about Ben and his parents all the time.  \u201cI had nothing to do with it. And I want them \u2026 I want them to see that,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cThey need to know the truth about Ben.\u201d  Doctor Thomas Rudd is no longer Lake County Coroner. He lost the election in November Kathleen Zellner will file Melissa\u2019s latest appeal in January. Correspondent, \"48 Hours\"",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Reaching deep into conservative territory, President-elect Donald Trump chose Georgia Rep. Tom Price to oversee the nation\u2019s health care system on Tuesday, picking a fierce \u201cObamacare\u201d critic who also has championed efforts to privatize Medicare. Trump selected another veteran Republican, Elaine Chao, to lead the Department of Transportation. Both have long ties to Washington. Price, picked to lead the Department of Health and Human Services after more than a decade in Congress, helped craft House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s plan to privatize Medicare - a position Trump opposed in the campaign. Chao, who was the first Asian-American woman to serve in a president\u2019s Cabinet, is married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump announced his choice of Price, while the selection of Chao was confirmed by a person with knowledge of the decision but not authorized to speak publicly. The selections came as Trump spent another day with advisers in his Manhattan skyscraper, racing through meetings with prospective administration hires as high-profile vacancies loom - none bigger than secretary of State. As conservatives largely praised Tuesday\u2019s picks, Price\u2019s selection raised questions about the incoming president\u2019s commitment to Medicare, among other popular entitlement programs he repeatedly vowed to preserve before the election. The Georgia congressman led GOP efforts on Capitol Hill to transform Medicare into a voucher-like system, a change that if enacted, would likely dramatically reduce government spending on the health care program that serves an estimated 48 million elderly and another 9 million disabled people. Trump did not address Price\u2019s position on Medicare in a statement released by his transition team. The team did not respond to subsequent questions about it. \u201cChairman Price, a renowned physician, has earned a reputation for being a tireless problem solver and the go-to expert on health care policy, making him the ideal choice to serve in this capacity,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe is exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare and bring affordable and accessible health care to every American.\u201d Trump, in a 2015 interview promoted on his campaign website, pledged not to cut expensive entitlement programs that Republicans have fought for years to cut to help reduce the federal deficit. \u201cI\u2019m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican. And I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid. Every other Republican\u2019s going to cut,\u201d Trump told the Daily Signal. He later changed his mind on Medicaid, embracing the GOP concept of turning the program over to the states with a fixed amount of federal \u201cblock grant\u201d funding. Like any Cabinet official, Price would carry out the wishes of the president. And a sweeping Medicare initiative would have to go through Congress with some Democratic support, which would be unlikely. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., a leading Democratic voice on health care, called Price a leader of the movement to privatize Medicare. She said his selection \u201cwill result in the complete undermining of our nation\u2019s health care system.\u201d Like Price, Chao is well-known in Washington, having led the Department of Labor for several years under Bush. Her record at the Labor Department suggests she would bring a light hand to safety enforcement as transportation secretary. Under Chao at Labor, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration didn\u2019t issue a single significant new safety regulation for four years. Mine safety inspectors were cut and inspections reduced. Whether it\u2019s integrating drones into the national airspace, deploying self-driving cars or \u201csome other new technology, she\u2019s not going to be especially inclined to second guess the industry when they say that this will be safe,\u201d said Thomas McGarity, a University of Texas law professor and author of \u201cFreedom to Harm,\u201d a book about the Labor Department that includes Chao\u2019s tenure. Both Price and Chao would require Senate confirmation. Major Cabinet vacancies remain. The president-elect summoned former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney to New York for dinner Tuesday night to discuss the secretary of state job for a second time. He was also meeting with Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who is getting new attention from Trump\u2019s team. On Monday, Trump spent an hour with former CIA director David Petraeus, another contender. Transition aides said Trump was likely at least a few days away from a decision. Even as he weighed crucial Cabinet decisions, Trump appeared distracted by outside issues - or eager to create distractions himself. He took to Twitter early Tuesday to declare that \u201cnobody should be allowed to burn the American flag.\u201d He warned that those who do should face \u201cperhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail!\u201d Trump offered no context for his message. The Supreme Court has ruled that flag burning is protected by the First Amendment, and Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Tuesday he doesn\u2019t support Trump\u2019s approach. \u201cI support the First Amendment,\u201d he said. The president-elect spent the weekend tweeting his opposition to recount efforts in up to three states led by Green Party candidate Jill Stein and joined by Hillary Clinton\u2019s team. He also falsely claimed that millions of people had voted illegally in the presidential election and provided no evidence. Trump\u2019s team also announced that Seema Verma has been chosen to be administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that Democrats could find common ground with President-elect Donald Trump for some policy issues -- but the party will draw the line when it comes to privatizing Medicare and the VA.  \u201cWe first of all respect the office that he holds and the people who elected him to the office,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe will engage where we can, and we will oppose where we cannot.\u201d  On those policies that the Democrats could engage with the Republican president-elect, Pelosi pointed to infrastructure, child care, and early childhood education.  \u201cWe won\u2019t work with him and this on privatization of Medicare and privatization of the VA,\u201d said the minority leader, recently re-elected to her post. On voucherizing Medicare, which Pelosi said is a \u201ccentral\u201d part of House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s budget, she criticized it as a future \u201ctremendous loss.\u201d Pelosi also addressed recent criticism from some members that the Democratic party needed to reflect on taking a new direction, following an election that resulted in GOP control of Congress and the White House.  \u201cI don\u2019t think people want a new direction,\u201d Pelosi sad. \u201cOur values unify us and our values are about supporting America\u2019s working families. That is one that everyone is in agreement on. What we want is a better connection of our message to working families in our country. \u00a0And that clearly in the election showed that message wasn\u2019t coming through. But we are united in terms of security of our country which is our first responsibility.\u201d  Of the recent streak of Democratic losses in the House -- and the backlash from its own prominent members -- Pelosi said she was more \u201coptimistic about the strength of the Democratic party.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about policy. It\u2019s not about politics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about politics for some, but for us it\u2019s about protecting Medicare, social security, good paying jobs for America\u2019s workers, protecting women\u2019s rights to choose, issues that unify us.\u201d\u00a0",

            "article_content": "My favorite food on the campaign trail is the spicy chicken sandwich from Wendy\u2019s. I ate one last week in Toledo after a Joe Biden campaign rally. Over the past year, I\u2019ve eaten at Wendy\u2019s all across America: In airports and small towns, at all hours of the day, between sprints to campaign events for the presidential candidates I\u2019ve been tasked to cover over the past 500 days. But my favorite Wendy\u2019s sits at the crest of a two-lane road in upstate New York, across from a Greek restaurant and a firehouse. It\u2019s a highway exit away from a school and residential facility my older sister Ellen has called home since she was 14-years-old. She was born with cerebral palsy. Over the years, the fast food stop became a family staple, enjoyed together during our weekend visits. My sister can eat her favorite order, a broccoli-and-cheddar baked potato and a cheeseburger, with a fork and knife, but her motor skills are seriously impaired. Ellen suffered from severe brain damage in my mother\u2019s womb, shortly before she was born in 1985. Thanks to the support she receives at school and in her home, Ellen lives a purposeful and happy life. She works the local farm, has friends, and even attended prom when she turned 18. Forget the word \u201cdisability\u201d -- thrown around with nonchalance by both presidential candidates this election year -- Ellen makes everyone she touches better, more patient and more present. She forces people to consider those who might not be able to speak for themselves. Ellen is the reason I am a journalist. My sister works harder in her most mundane hours than most of us do inside our campaign bubble, spending our days grousing about travel, tweeting minutiae and pontificating about the 2016 race from the catered comforts of a network greenroom. So much of this election has unfolded with my head buried in my iPhone, reading about an election that often feels disconnected from the lives of ordinary people. In that Wendy\u2019s in upstate New York, where families take their disabled relatives out for a special lunch, cable coverage of the campaign does not blare over people\u2019s meals. It is irrelevant. Before anything else, there is a pervasive concern for the future of those who can\u2019t plan their own, or even plan their next day. There is a single dominant image of the disabled in this campaign: Donald Trump\u2019s November 2015 mockery of Serge Kovaleski, a New York Times reporter who refuted Trump\u2019s November 2015 claim that he had seen \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d of Arabs in New Jersey cheering as the World Trade Center buildings collapsed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I said -- uhhhh -- I don\u2019t remember,\u201d Trump said, with his arms flailing from the elbow at an odd angle in what was seen as an imitation of Kovaleski\u2019s disability. He was born with arthrogryposis, a condition that affects his joints.\u00a0 That clip of Trump has been replayed an untold number of times, on news shows and in an avalanche of advertisements funded by Hillary Clinton and her allies, all designed to maximize the shock of seeing what Trump\u2019s flailing arms and mockery look must look like to children and to the disabled who watch him on screen. But as is the case with much of Trump\u2019s disparaging rhetoric this cycle, some voters and experts say it\u2019s taken the conversation about disabled people in the wrong direction. \u201cIt has definitely undone a lot of people\u2019s work to mainstream people with special needs, and not view them differently,\u201d said Sandra Clark, a Cleveland voter who stood in the crowd at Bill Clinton rally last weekend. \u201cWe have a lot of special needs in our family and it\u2019s very discouraging.\u201d Clark attended Clinton\u2019s rally in Cleveland with her two special-needs children in tow. She had recently picked up her life in Kansas and moved to Cleveland to take care of her nephews, because her ailing sister has Alzheimer\u2019s. Clark came to the event on Saturday, she told me, because she was seeking information she hadn\u2019t heard from the media. \u201cIt\u2019s all about he-said she-said, and it\u2019s nothing about the issues,\u201d Clark said. When we talk about people with disabilities in this election, we are simply talking about name-calling. To people like Clark, no one in the campaign is articulating how we can improve the lives of the 57 million Americans with special needs, many who will be voting themselves. \u201cWhat Trump has done is give license to say that people with disabilities are not worth as much as the rest of us,\u201d said Sue Constantino, the CEO of the Cerebral Palsy Association of New York State. \u201cWe have made such great strides in our world over the last 20 years in terms of the acceptance of people with disabilities. Something like this, even if he doesn\u2019t mean it, can really set us back.\u201d Those who work in the disability field would prefer to be discussing more granular policy matters. For instance, how the federal government can work more closely with states to provide better, more individualized care and invest in more research going forward. But that\u2019s not happening. Trump has not mentioned a plan for research or improved care for the disabled, and there is nothing on his website on this issue. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has a history of relationships with people with disabilities; she has incorporated people with disabilities into her campaign and given them featured speaking spots during her nominating convention. Clinton also has a detailed plan to help families struggling with autism. Her campaign also points out that there are ASL (American Sign Language) signers at every event, and it has even made its campaign buttons in Braille. Overall, though, there has been little actual discussion on the campaign trail, or in the press, about what either of the candidates would actually do to help disabled Americans. Last year, the country celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a landmark civil rights law to fight discrimination against people with special needs. But there remains a shortage of funding and research that prevents schools and facilities from caring for disabled Americans in the most appropriate, case-by-case way. \u00a0 Where my sister lives in New York is a bright spot. Set on sprawling bucolic farmland, the adult and pediatric rehabilitation facility offers a variety of state-of-the-art programs and residential services along with robust research initiatives. But she and my family are lucky. Access to such highly specific treatment and support is rare. \u00a0 New York has been able to establish more sophisticated programs for people with special needs, but expert say systems in most states are dramatically underfunded. Block granting Medicaid funding into the hands of state governments, as Trump intends to do, would be \u201cvery troublesome,\u201d according to Constantino. Budget cuts by state leaders trying to trim costs could have serious consequences for the majority of disabled people who depend on Medicare and Medicaid. \u201cWe are really quite frightened about that,\u201d Constantino added. Overall, the process of navigating the byzantine rules and regulations set by the government to obtain personalized support or treatment can be prohibitive. But the conversation is about more than just policy prescriptions. The Supreme Court, with one glaring vacant seat, will decide on several disabilities-focused court cases in the coming years. Clinton or Trump will appoint the justices who will rule on them. When it comes to the law, Trump has run afoul of the Americans with Disabilities Act repeatedly over the years, having been sued for violating requirements that public places offer accessibility to those with special needs. He attempted to fight several of the violations and eventually settled; in only two of the cases did he actually make adjustments to the building. Meanwhile, it was recently reported that Trump routinely called a former deaf contestant on The Apprentice, Marlee Matlin, \u201cretarded,\u201d while filming the reality TV show. \u201cThe term is abhorrent and should never be used,\u201d the actress wrote in a response to Trump on Twitter. \u201cThe fact that we are talking about this during a very important moment in American history has upset me deeply.\u201d That Trump allegedly has the capacity to talk in such a way -- and that he has never mentioned his personal connection to cerebral palsy in the form of his great nephew, William Trump, who was born with the condition -- might speak to the lingering stigma of shame and weakness associated with disabilities. Looked at another way, though, what Trump has said could wind up helping people.\u00a0 \u201cThe conversation about how people with disabilities are disparaged, and that it should not be tolerated, has been a very positive event,\u201d Michael Kirkman, the Executive Director at Ohio Disability Rights Law and Policy Center, told me. \u201cIt\u2019s empowered my friends with disabilities, who now feel really motivated to go be part of the electoral process.\u201d And when they do vote in November, I\u2019m hoping they stop at a place like Wendy\u2019s on the way home, and think of people like Ellen.",

            "article_content": "Now that the presidential election is over, now is a good time for near-retirees and retirees to review personal financial plans and explore some practical issues that might arise under a Donald Trump administration. You\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re prepared to deal with possible future changes. Here are four issues older Americans should keep an eye on: Repeal of the Affordable Care Act Trump has repeatedly pledged to repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as a high priority, and the Republican-led Congress is likely to agree. So far, details about any possible replacement program are scant, if there will even be a replacement.  Currently, the ACA allows pre-Medicare retirees to purchase medical insurance without exclusions for pre-existing conditions. Retiring before age 65 without medical insurance is a deal-breaker for most people. As a result, if you\u2019re thinking of retiring in the next year or two and you\u2019re under 65, you\u2019ll want to make sure you can obtain medical insurance in case the ACA is repealed without a replacement.  Here are some possibilities: None of these strategies are ideal, however, so you\u2019ll want to investigate all your options to determine the best fit for you. If you\u2019re planning to retire before age 65 in the next few years, you\u2019ll want to carefully follow any ACA developments. In any event, you\u2019ll want to have a strategy in place for bridging the coverage gap until you\u2019re eligible for Medicare at age 65. Your asset allocation If you\u2019re unsure of the possible impact a Trump presidency could have on your investments, you may want to revisit your asset allocation. Stocks have been rising in recent years, so you may have more allocated to equities now compared to a few years ago. See if you\u2019re still comfortable with the amount you\u2019re currently devoting to stocks.  Here\u2019s one way to look at it: Keep any savings you absolutely need to cover your basic living expenses in investments that don\u2019t drop when the stock market crashes, including money market funds, stable value funds, bonds and annuities. You should be able to afford to lose 50 percent of the amount you invest in stocks without it ruining your life. If we have a repeat of the 2008-2009 crash, your stocks could drop by 50 percent. Thinking about the asset allocation that works for you, and rebalancing if necessary, is something you should be doing every year in any case, not just as a reaction to the election. Social Security and Medicare On the campaign trail, Trump promised not to reduce Social Security or Medicare benefits. This position isn\u2019t in alignment with the Republican party\u2019s platform, which says changes to Social Security are needed, although it makes no specific recommendations other than to reject tax increases. The party\u2019s platform position would change Medicare into a voucher program for workers under age 55.  Both Medicare and Social Security have funding problems, and there are only two ways to put these programs into financial balance: increase taxes or cut benefits. Given the Republicans\u2019 aversion to tax increases, it seems likely they\u2019ll look for ways to reduce benefits.  Chances are very good chance that they wouldn\u2019t reduce Social Security benefits for retirees or for people within a few years of retirement, but they could taper future cost-of-living increases to help Social Security\u2019s finances. Medicare expenditures could be cut several ways, including by increasing deductibles, co-payments and monthly premiums, or restricting your choice of providers.  You\u2019ll want to carefully follow any developments regarding both of these critical programs. The Department of Labor\u2019s fiduciary rule Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Labor issued regulations that require financial advisers and institutions to act as fiduciaries when giving advice on retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans and IRAs. That means they must act in the best interests of their clients. These new rules have been met with fierce resistance from the financial industry, and some groups are calling on Trump to rescind them. Regardless of the outcome, you can still act as a smart shopper and ask potential advisers or institutions if they\u2019ll act in a fiduciary capacity for you. Ask how they\u2019re paid and if their compensation results in financial conflicts of interest. Some firms, such as Merrill Lynch, are revising their compensation practices to eliminate these conflicts. Others, such as Financial Engines and Garrett Planning Network, don\u2019t currently have conflicts of interests and will act as a fiduciary on your behalf. The bottom line: To the extent possible, take savvy action steps so that your financial security and happiness don\u2019t depend on the outcome of any election or other events that are beyond your control.

The incident bears a striking similarity to the attack on Bastille Day revelers in Nice, France earlier this year -- a type of attack ISIS has urged its followers to replicate. Russia is praising Turkey\u2019s response to the assassination of Moscow\u2019s ambassador in Turkey. Andrey Karlov was shot from behind at an art exhibit in Turkey\u2019s capital. Russia and Turkey say this assassination was an attempt to disrupt their relationship -- but it looks a lot like an act of retribution for Russia\u2019s bloody air campaign in Syria. The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) has launched a \u201cpreliminary evaluation\u201d of approximately one million Dodge Ram pickups and Dodge Durango SUVs following 43 complaints alleging roll-aways when the vehicles are in the parked position. The incidents have resulted in at least 25 crashes and nine injuries to date, according to NHTSA.  Moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was one of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign promises, and his top aide\u2019s recent remarks -- in addition to his appointment for U.S. ambassador in Israel -- suggest he may be serious. Middle East experts, former U.S. diplomats and Palestinian officials are warning of serious consequences if he follows through. A Texas family living near a fracking site has installed a $30,000 water filtration system in their Dallas suburb home. The reason? They say they had their water tested and it came back with chemical levels higher than the EPA recommends. When President Obama entered the White House in 2009, the U.S. faced an economic crisis of epic proportions. Eight years later, the recovery remains incomplete. So what do officials in the outgoing administration see as the main economic challenges for Mr. Trump\u2019s team?  Millions of U.S. workers grapple daily with erratic schedules, crimping paychecks and often wreaking havoc on family life. Now workers are pushing back. In the latest skirmish with employers over labor rights, major cities are enacting laws to give employees greater certainty over their their working lives.

            "article_content": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday blasted President-elect Donald Trump for his Cabinet picks thus far, saying it is shaping up to be a \u201cCabinet of billionaires.\u201d \u201cI guess they have a few poor millionaires on it, but, mostly, it is billionaires,\u201d Sanders told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cAnd this is coming from a candidate for president, Mr. Trump, who told us he was going to take on the establishment. Well, maybe I am not seeing something here, but you don\u2019t appoint the head of ExxonMobil to be secretary of state. That is not quite taking on the establishment.\u201d The net worth of Mr. Trump\u2019s Cabinet selections thus far, according to estimates from Forbes and other outlets, is a combined $14 billion: several, including deputy commerce secretary pick Todd Ricketts, education secretary pick Betsy DeVos, commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and Small Business Administration pick Linda McMahon, are each worth more than $1 billion. Sanders said there are \u201ca lot of very important questions\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees need to be asked. That said, he added that he does not regret Democrats\u2019 decision to implement the nuclear option -- even though it could help Mr. Trump pass his Cabinet nominees without the possibility of a filibuster in the Senate. \u201cWe did that because Republicans were denying -- obstructing President Obama in every way, making it impossible to appoint federal judges, district judges, and really paralyzing the judiciary branch,\u201d he said. \u201cMany, many people there were not just getting the hearings they needed. We had to move forward.\u201d He called on Mr. Trump to publicly announce he would keep several of his campaign promises -- including avoiding cuts to entitlement programs and to reduce the price of prescription drug costs. \u201cHe said: I, Donald Trump, am not going to cut Social Security. I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare. I\u2019m not going to cut Medicaid,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd yet we are seeing Republicans in the Congress coming forward with devastating plans to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare. And I challenge Mr. Trump, today, tell the American people you are going to keep your campaign promises.\u201d Sanders also said the United States needs to take a \u201chard look\u201d at Russia\u2019s role in influencing the election, just days after multiple news reports confirmed that Russia was actively trying to promote Mr. Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201cI think when you have the intelligence agencies saying that that happened, when you have John McCain, when you have Democrats, when you have a bipartisan effort saying that we need an investigation, because this is very serious stuff, I think we go forward,\u201d he said.  He said he was confused by Mr. Trump\u2019s response to the reports.\u00a0 \u201cFor Donald Trump to summarily dismiss all of this makes no sense to me at all,\u201d Sanders said. Sanders said the first step is to \u201cget the facts,\u201d which is what the bipartisan investigation is intended to do -- but also that the U.S needs to send a clear message to Russia that interference will not be tolerated.  \u201cThe word has got to go out to Russia, any other country on Earth, that we are going to protect our democracy, that cyber-security is very, very dangerous stuff, and we will not tolerate other countries interfering in the democratic process in this country,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is proposing changes to the House Democratic caucus that would allow for an expansion in elected positions and limits to those who hold leadership positions.  In a letter to her Democratic colleagues, the California Democrat said that a group of members helped come up with the changes, which signal an openness to promoting younger members. The first would require each committee to create a vice chair or ranking member position that would be filled by someone who has been a committee member for no more than four terms. The second change would make the assistant Democratic leader position an elected position that could only be filled by a member who has served fewer than three terms.  The third change would make the Democratic Policy and Communications Chairmanship an elected position that could only be filled by a member who has served fewer than five terms. The last change would create five regional vice chairs, who would be elected by members of their region, to serve at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  Pelosi also said it\u2019s \u201cessential\u201d that Democrats take advantage of their power on congressional committees to \u201censure a full disclosure of the impacts of legislation, executive actions and regulatory decisions by Republicans\u2026\u201d She also warned that Democrats wouldn\u2019t agree to an infrastructure bill that President-elect Donald Trump wants if it is a \u201ccorporate tax break disguised as an infrastructure bill.\u201d Responding to hints from Republicans that might try to target Medicare under the new Trump administration, Pelosi said Democrats must stay unified and stop them. \u201cIf Speaker Ryan presses forward with his plans to end Medicare as we know it, we will stand firmly and unified to stop him \u2013 just as we did in 2005 when President Bush tried to privatize Social Security,\u201d she said.  Pelosi is running to serve as Democratic leader again, but she faces a challenge from her colleague Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, who announced his bid last week.  House Democrats are scheduled to hold their leadership elections after Thanksgiving on Nov. 30. Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0-- Only about one in four Americans wants President-elect Donald Trump to entirely repeal his predecessor\u2019s health care law that extended coverage to millions, a new poll has found. The post-election survey released Thursday by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation also found hints of a pragmatic shift among some Republican foes of \u201cObamacare.\u201d While 52 percent of Republicans say they want the law completely repealed, that share is down from 69 percent just last month, before the election. And more Republicans now say they want the law \u201cscaled back\u201d under the new president and GOP Congress, with that share more than doubling from 11 percent before the election to 24 percent after. Kaiser CEO Drew Altman said the foundation\u2019s polling experts aren\u2019t quite sure what to make of that finding, and will continue to track the apparent shift in future polls. The organization is a clearinghouse for information and analysis about the health care system. It could be that some Republicans \u201cgot a protest vote off their chests, and they\u2019re done with that,\u201d Altman said. \u201cThey now have a more moderate position.\u201d After branding the Affordable Care Act a \u201cdisaster\u201d during an election campaign that saw big premium hikes unveiled in its closing days, Mr. Trump has been saying he\u2019d like to keep parts of the law.\u00a0 And indeed, its popularity only seems to be gaining among Americans: The day following the election, HealthCare.gov notched 100,000 signups, the highest single-day number since open enrollment began.\u00a0 On Capitol Hill, Republican leaders are trying to choreograph a legislative dance that would let them quickly repeal \u201cObamacare,\u201d then allow an interlude to segue to a replacement. The complex undertaking is fraught with political risk, because success is not guaranteed. It could disrupt coverage for millions by destabilizing the law\u2019s already fragile health insurance markets, such as\u00a0HealthCare.gov. The poll found some skepticism about that approach. Forty-two percent of those who want the 2010 health care law repealed said lawmakers should wait until they figure out the details of a replacement plan before doing so. A senior administration official expressed concern over this possibility, telling CBS News that \u201crepeal and delay replacement is repeal.\u201d Such an option could force insurance companies out of the marketplace if they are unsure what the future looks like. The official noted that six years of Republican promises for a replacement have yielded few viable replacement plans. A full repeal with no replacement, the official emphasized, could then result in the loss of 20 million people\u2019s insurance coverage, including young adults under 26 who are on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans. Among other effects of an ACA repeal: Women would have to pay for contraception, seniors\u2019 drug prices could rise, preventative visits and routine screenings would no longer be free, and annual and lifetime coverage limits would disappear.\u00a0 Americans were divided on next steps for President Barack Obama\u2019s signature law. Overall, 30 percent said the new president and Congress should expand what the law does, and another 19 percent said it should be implemented as is. On the other side, 26 percent said the law should be entirely repealed and 17 percent called for it to be scaled back. Among Trump voters, 8 in 10 viewed the health care law unfavorably, and half wanted it entirely repealed. Georgia Rep. Tom Price,\u00a0Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for HHS secretary, has already outlined a plan to replace the ACA, but the current administration is wary of its implementation. According to the senior administration official, there are several negative effects of Price\u2019s proposals, including a cap of employer tax benefits, dumping in the employer market, and elimination of mental health coverage in the ACA.\u00a0 As Republicans start to make changes in health care, potentially revamping Medicare and Medicaid as well, the politics of the issue could turn against them, Altman said. \u201cThey are going to go from casting stones to owning the problem,\u201d he said. The poll found majorities across party lines support many of the health care law\u2019s provisions, but not its requirement that individuals have coverage or risk fines, and its mandate that medium-to-large employers pay fines if they don\u2019t offer health insurance.\u00a0 Among the provisions with support across party lines: The senior administration official noted to CBS News, however, that keeping the popular provisions (including those ensuring people with preexisting conditions can keep their insurance and guaranteeing that children can stay on their parents\u2019 plans until the age of 26) will be difficult to do without the less popular provisions like the individual mandate.\u00a0 The telephone poll was conducted from Nov. 15-21 among a nationally representative random digit dial sample of 1,202 adults, including people reached by landlines and cell phones. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the full sample. For subgroups, the margin of sampling error may be higher.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON - Taxpayers will fork over nearly $10 billion more next year to cover double-digit premium hikes for subsidized health insurance under President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, according to a study being released Thursday. The analysis from the Center for Health and Economy comes as the Republican-led Congress is preparing to repeal \u201cObamacare\u201d and replace it with a GOP alternative whose details have yet to be worked out. With incoming President Donald Trump likely to sign such legislation, historic coverage gains under the 2010 health law are at stake. The study estimates that the cost of premium subsidies under the ACA will increase by $9.8 billion next year, rising from $32.8 billion currently to $42.6 billion. The average monthly subsidy will increase by $76, or 26 percent, from $291 currently to $367 in 2017. Currently more than eight in 10 consumers buying private health insurance through HealthCare.gov and state markets receive tax credits from the government to help pay their premiums. Those subsidies are designed to rise along with premiums, shielding consumers from sudden increases. But the bill ultimately gets passed on to taxpayers. Shortly before Election Day, the administration revealed that premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan on HealthCare.gov would jump by an average of 25 percent next year. Administration officials are touting the premium subsidies as they race to sign up as many people as possible before open enrollment ends Jan. 31, about a week after Obama leaves the White House. Upbeat, carefree ads for HealthCare.gov say most consumers can find subsidized coverage for as little as $50 to $100 a month. Republicans are planning a multistep process to first repeal the health law and replace it later. The new study is unlikely to affect the \u201crepeal\u201d part of the debate. However, the findings could affect how Republicans design future subsidies that would be part of their replacement legislation. Some kind of limit on assistance is more likely to appeal to them. Under current law, \u201cyou get a premium increase, you pour more money in,\u201d said economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, founder of the Center for Health and Economy. \u201cThe concern is that will feed more premium increases.\u201d He predicted that Republicans would take a different approach. Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director, is also a longtime GOP adviser. However, the center functions as a nonpartisan research organization, and its work is overseen by a board of experts that spans the political spectrum. The Associated Press requested the center\u2019s new estimate. After reviewing the study, the Obama administration said that despite the increase in premiums, the health care law is still helping reduce federal deficits and keeping the program affordable for taxpayers. The law also raised taxes and cut Medicare spending. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is covering 20 million Americans, and 2017 marketplace premiums remain on par with the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s November 2009 projections,\u201d spokesman Aaron Albright said. A health economist who also reviewed the study said it shows that the law is working as designed. \u201cSince the premiums for 2017 are a lot higher than for 2016, it\u2019s no surprise that premium tax credits would go up as well,\u201d said Paul Ginsburg, who directs the Brookings Institution health policy center. \u201cThe premiums in 2015 and 2016 appear to have been unduly low.\u201d Obama\u2019s law has helped drive the nation\u2019s uninsured rate to a historic low of about 9 percent. It offers subsidized private health insurance to people don\u2019t have access to job-based coverage, along with a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income people. Insurers say the spike in premiums is due to lower-than-projected enrollment, patients who turned out to be sicker than expected, people gaming the system to get coverage only when they need medical care and a premium stabilization system that has not worked as intended. The administration says the higher premiums are a one-time market correction and not a sign that the law\u2019s insurance markets are slipping into a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d of rising premiums and declining enrollment. Although Congress will begin the repeal debate soon after it convenes in January, immediate changes that would affect coverage for 2017 appear to be highly unlikely. Republican leaders have said they want a smooth transition to the new system. Thursday is expected to be a big day for HealthCare.gov because Dec. 15 is the last day consumers can sign up or make changes to existing coverage and have them take effect on Jan. 1.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0-- Republicans\u2019 grip on all levers of power stands as a mandate to the GOP-led Congress, which will move swiftly to try to undo eight years of outgoing President Barack Obama\u2019s agenda. With Republican President-elect Donald Trump weeks away from assuming office, GOP lawmakers plan to open the 115th Congress on Tuesday and immediately take steps to repeal Obama\u2019s health care law. Beyond that, they\u2019ll look at a tax overhaul, reversing Obama-era environmental regulations and other conservative priorities. Republicans will face some obstacles. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says Democrats \u201cstand ready to fight vigorously\u201d to protect health care and other priorities, and Republicans will have to compromise with Senate Democrats to move major legislation through that chamber. A look at what the 115th Congress will be up to in 2017: --- NEW MEMBERS New members of the House and Senate will be sworn in on Tuesday, the first day of the new Congress. In the Senate, five Democrats and two Republicans will be sworn in for the first time, joined by returning members who won re-election in 2016. After those members are sworn in, there will be 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. The House will have 52 new members - 27 Republicans and 25 Democrats. There will be 241 Republicans in the House and 194 Democrats. --- CONFIRMING A NEW CABINET Mr. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, and Republicans in the Senate will spend the first days and weeks of his presidency pushing to confirm his Cabinet picks. Democrats changed the rules and curbed the filibuster in 2013, making it easier for Republicans to move nominations. But even though they won\u2019t be able to block Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees, Democrats have pledged to fight many of them anyway, highlighting what they say is the hypocrisy of Mr. Trump\u2019s populist message and his wealthy, corporate-favoring nominees for several posts. --- REPEALING OBAMA\u2019S HEALTH CARE LAW The Senate plans to begin repealing Obama\u2019s health care law on Tuesday, Congress\u2019 very first day, with consideration of a procedural measure that will shield from Democratic filibusters legislation annulling much of that statute. Lawmakers will then spend the next few months working on legislation canceling broad swaths of the law. Likely to go are its mandate that people buy health insurance or face IRS fines, and its expansion of Medicaid coverage to more lower-earning Americans. Some elements of the repeal likely wouldn\u2019t go into effect for two to four years. Republicans will then begin the more complicated task of building a new system. The GOP will have to craft new programs for the nation\u2019s $3 trillion health care system and make sure insurance markets don\u2019t collapse while the transition is under way. --- TAX OVERHAUL Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, and Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, want a massive overhaul of the tax system with the goal of simplifying a complicated tax code that rewards wealthy people with smart accountants as well as corporations that can easily shift profits and jobs overseas. It would be the first major tax overhaul in 30 years. Mr. Trump has also advocated a tax overhaul, but with fewer details. He promises a tax cut for every income level, with more low-income families paying no income tax at all. --- SUPREME COURT Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died 11 months ago, but the Senate still hasn\u2019t considered a replacement. That\u2019s because McConnell blocked consideration of Obama\u2019s nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, saying the next president should make the pick. The strategy paid off, and the Republican Senate will consider whomever Mr. Trump nominates. --- MEDICARE CHANGES Ryan is the most powerful advocate in Washington for an overhaul of Medicare and a premium-support approach that would, over time, remake it into a voucher-like program that could force some seniors entering the program to buy health insurance on the open market instead of getting coverage through the traditional open-ended program. But his ideas likely will run into a political reality. Mr. Trump said on the campaign trail that he wouldn\u2019t cut the program, and Senate Republicans haven\u2019t been as enthusiastic either. Candidate Trump also initially promised not to cut Medicaid - the federal-state health insurance program for low-income and severely disabled people. During the campaign, Mr. Trump seemed to shift, backing \u201cblock grants\u201d that limit federal funding. --- SOCIAL SECURITY Like Medicare, some House conservatives have said they want to overhaul Social Security and slow the program\u2019s growth to curb spending. But Mr. Trump has said he doesn\u2019t want to touch those programs, and Ryan told CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in December that he has no plans to change Social Security. --- REVERSING REGULATIONS Republican leaders have complained throughout Obama\u2019s presidency about burdensome regulations, a theme Mr. Trump used frequently during the campaign as well. GOP lawmakers now want to undo some of Obama\u2019s regulations and executive orders using the Congressional Review Act, a rarely invoked procedure. Many of the regulations they are targeting are environmental rules put in place by the Environmental Protection Agency, including the Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants, a clean water rule that has drawn the ire of farmers and another rule imposed in December to protect nearby streams from coal-mining debris. --- INFRASTRUCTURE Mr. Trump made rebuilding the nation\u2019s aging roads, bridges and airports a major part of his job-creation strategy in the presidential race. But those plans appear to have fizzled, somewhat, as GOP leaders have questioned the spending.",
