            "article_content": "2020 Democratic hopeful Sen.\u00a0Kirsten Gillibrand\u00a0spent Thursday and Friday pitching herself to Rust Belt voters by focusing on President Trump and not her\u00a024 Democratic\u00a0challengers. But her standout moment came when she told a white voter \"institutional racism is real.\" \u00a0 In Youngstown, Ohio, on Thursday, a white woman asked Gillibrand why Democrats talk about \"white privilege\" when black and white residents of the area have been devastated by job loss and the opioid crisis. The voter expressed a feeling of being left behind, the same sentiment that became an emblem of Mr. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Gillibrand took a pause, then replied that \"institutional racism is real.\" \"It doesn't take away your pain or suffering,\" she said. \"It's just a different issue. Your suffering is just as important as a black or brown persons suffering but to fix the problems that are happening in a black community you need far more transformational efforts that are targeted for real racism that exists every day.\"\u00a0 The crowd, approximately two-thirds white, gave her robust applause. Gillibrand is hoping to push her message to working-class Americans struggling to feel supported by the government that the remedy is to replace Mr. Trump with her. \u00a0\"I'm not blaming President Trump for all the problems. What I'm saying is that he lied to [voters],\" Gillibrand said in an interview with CBS News. From Pittsburgh, to Youngstown, Ohio, to Cleveland on the first day, to the Detroit suburbs, Flint and Lansing, Michigan on Day Two, Gillibrand paid no mind to her fellow Democrats. The senator argued she would defend blue-collar, working class voters \u2013 the same group that some Democrats believe swung 2016 into Mr. Trump's hands -- in the same states Gillibrand visited. \"I really want to lift up the broken promises, the lies [Mr. Trump] told to the American people, because the truth is they might not have connected the dots yet, but when they realize he said he'd do all these things and hasn't, then they'll at least know he's not their champion. And I wanted to share my vision because I will be their champion,\" Gillibrand said. If voters haven't connect \"those dots\" yet, will they ever? It's a risk Gillibrand is taking for a candidate who has struggled to put up a crooked number in national polls. When asked why her focus wasn't on her primary competition, Gillibrand called other Democratic candidates \"friends\" and \"amazing public servants.\" \"I really don't feel I have to compete with other Democrats,\" she said. \"When I talked to Democrats, the number one thing they want is someone who could beat Trump.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 It's a position she believes she is uniquely able to fill. At every campaign stop, Gillibrand tells crowds how she won her 2006 election to the House of Representatives in a district that had two Republicans for every Democrat and won 18 counties won by Mr. Trump in her 2018 Senate reelection. \"I'm answering their question: What are you going to do to beat Trump? What will you do differently? How will you access the voters that went for Trump as opposed to Hillary? I'm showing them how I would do it,\" Gillibrand told CBS News. \"This is how you do it. I'm showing them with my words, my deeds, where I spend my time, this is how you beat Trump.\" But those numbers have not yet proven that voters buy what Gillibrand is trying to show them. Democrats leading the pack, such as former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, have consistently beat Mr. Trump in match-up polls while Gillibrand has failed to do so. In last week's Washington Post/ABC News poll, 0 percent of respondents choose Gillibrand when asked which of the Democratic candidates have the best chance of defeating the president next November. Face-to-face, Gillibrand was received well on her tour. Her largest and most energetic crowds showed up in Lansing and Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. The roughly 100 person crowd in Bloomfield Hills, a wealthy Detroit suburb, gave Gillibrand multiple standing ovations. Gillibrand spoke to the Oakland County residents about gun violence protection. The county\u00a0supported\u00a0Hillary Clinton in 2016, with the former Secretary of State beating Mr. Trump by 8 points. The nearly 30 person crowd in working-class Youngstown, Ohio, discussed trade and job outsourcing with the senator. Youngstown is part of Ohio's northeast Mahoning County where Clinton\u00a0won\u00a0by three points in 2016, a near upset after President Barack Obama took the county by more than twenty-eight points in\u00a02012. On Friday, Gillibrand became the second presidential candidate to visit Flint, Michigan this cycle after Obama Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro toured the city last month. Gillibrand did the same, not holding a public event, but instead surveying the city and water facilities with Flint's mayor. On each stop of the tour Gillibrand took direct aim at Mr. Trump. Over the two days, he was only brought up once by name when a man in Bloomfield Hills asked about Congressional Democrats' handling of the Mueller investigation. A woman in downtown Cleveland asked not about Mr. Trump, but about the senator herself. \"My question is actually a little bit more political or pragmatic. How are you going to get out there? I mean, how are you? It's great that you're speaking to thirty people in Cleveland, Ohio, but how are you going to get your name out there?\" the woman asked. \"So the reason why I'm [on this tour] is because every Democrat I know wants to know, 'Who's going to beat President Trump?'\" Gillibrand replied. \"Watch what I do.\" CBS News reporter covering climate change and energy.",

            "article_content": "Mayor Pete Buttigieg, one of the two-dozen Democrats running for president, believes hesitation by some white Americans to speak frankly and openly about race and socioeconomic privilege is a major roadblock in elusive efforts to enact comprehensive criminal justice reform and address racial disparities in the U.S.\u00a0 \"I think the challenge for white America is to realize that we can't be defensive about this,\" the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, told CBS News in an interview Sunday. \u00a0 \"When somebody is saying that we are benefitting from living in a system that creates privileges associated with systemic racism, we can't kind of retreat into this idea that, 'We're being personally attacked, so we're not going to want to talk about that.' Or that, 'Hey these were distant historic problems, we can't be held accountable for dealing with that,'\" he said. \"No.\"\u00a0 Buttigieg said he's concerned about the long-term effects of inaction when it comes to racial inequality in America.\u00a0 \"I am worried that in different ways we may not be able to imagine, in the 21st century, if these inequalities keep getting worse, then that could once again threaten to unravel the American project,\" he said.\u00a0 The millennial mayor and veteran of the war in Afghanistan also weighed in on President Trump's widely condemned racist\u00a0tweets\u00a0about four progressive congresswomen of color. \"It's racist and it fundamentally misunderstands America,\" he said.\u00a0 Despite impressive fundraising numbers, the openly gay Midwestern mayor has struggled to make significant inroads among communities of color \u2014 a key constituency in Democratic primaries. In an effort to appeal to those communities, he recently released \"The Douglass Plan,\" an ambitious proposal named for the famous 19th century abolitionist to invest in communities of color and try to dismantle systemic racism.\u00a0 Back home in South Bend, several events have strained Buttigieg's relationship with the city's African American community. He still faces tough questions for firing the city's African American police chief in 2012, and last month he was strongly criticized by some of South Bend's minority residents for his handling of an incident in which a city police officer killed an African American man. That officer, Sgt. Ryan O'Neill, resigned on Monday. During the first Democratic debate, Buttigieg conceded he has not done enough to diversify the city's police force. The following transcript of the discussion between Buttigieg and CBS News political correspondent O'Keefe on race and criminal justice has been lightly edited for length and clarity. ED O'KEEFE: Thank you Mr. Mayor for doing this. Let's talk about some stuff that's going on today or that's in the news right now. I imagine you've seen what the president tweeted earlier today some of your Democratic colleagues in Congress today saying essentially they should go home to where they came from. Obvious outrage from a lot of Democrats about that but curious your reaction to his decision to once again interject in party politics and to say what he said. BUTTIGIEG: Well, it's wrong, it's racist and it fundamentally misunderstands America. One of the reasons we set up this country, one of the things we celebrate in freedom and democracy of the United States is you can criticize your president. You can criticize the ways in which the country falls short of its values. And that makes you more, not less, loyal to this country whether we're talking about naturalized citizens or many of the people he was talking about who were born right here in the U.S. When you become a citizen, you are an American and questioning somebody's Americanness because they disagree with you \u2014 is about one of the most un-American things I can think of. ED O'KEEFE: In the plan you released last week \u2014 the Frederick Douglass Plan \u2014 you had alluded to that white Americans especially have to talk about systemic racism. BUTTIGIEG: That's right. ED O'KEEFE: President may have just presented you a great opportunity to do so, but why is that conversation perhaps more important for white people to have? BUTTIGIEG: Well, for too long this has been talked about as a kind of specialty issue, something that people of color talk about and something that white politicians talk about with people of color and not the rest of the time. Systemic racism is something that diminishes all of us.\u00a0 Of course its worst effects are for its victims, but our entire country is held back through the inequality and the mistrust that it creates. The mistrust of institutions. The mistrust of a country that has not served everyone equally, and I am not just talking about far off historic harms like slavery. I'm talking about housing, unemployment and criminal justice discrimination that is taking place in our lifetimes, in living memory. And I think the challenge for white America is to realize that we can't be defensive about this. When somebody is saying that we are benefitting from living in a system that creates privileges associated with systemic racism, we can't kind of retreat into this idea that, \"We're being personally attacked, so we're not going to want to talk about that.\" Or that, \"Hey these were distant historic problems, we can't be held accountable for dealing with that.\" No. The force that has come closest across American history to actually ending America was white supremacy. That was the Civil War. And I am worried that in different ways we may not be able to imagine, in the 21st century, if these inequalities keep getting worse, then that could once again threaten to unravel the American project. The levels of inequality we're seeing \u2014 much of it driven by racial inequality \u2014 are something that very few countries can survive intact.\u00a0 And if we don't all come together to deal with this \u2014 not as an issue for some, but as an issue for us all \u2014 then I worry that the entire American project will be weighed down. ED O'KEEFE: You say that this is a conversation that white people need to have and not be defensive about it. That's going to be music to the ears of black, Latino, Asian people in this country who, as you said, you know, obviously want to hear about this and believe it to be true.\u00a0 It's going to be a tougher sell though among white Americans who think things are fine. Or, why are they talking about this again? Or the gentleman that you had an interchange with a few weeks ago who suggested that if black people just stop committing crimes, there won't be a problem. I mean, that's what you're up against if you try and have this conversation. BUTTIGIEG: But we've got to have this conversation because time's running out. The reality is we can't separate the chaos of our politics, the division, the wrongfulness coming from the White House but also through our communities from all the pernicious effects of systemic racism. As long as this is two different countries for people of different races, which, if you look at the statistics on things from life expectancy to income to experiences, even for the exact same offense with the criminal justice system, it really is like two countries. As long as that happens, then we don't have the strength of being one country. And if you want to know whether this impacts you, white or not, think about the fact that foreign adversaries are now using racial inequality and division as a national security weakness, pitting Americans against each other over this and treating it as a wedge that can weaken America. And they're right, this is a deep weakness in an otherwise strong, and robust American system. It's why we got to deal with it in our lifetime. And what we've learned the hard way is just taking a racist law and replacing it with a neutral one is not enough to bring about equality. These things don't wash themselves out of the system without intentional action. They actually get worse. For the same reasons that a dollar saved because of interest grows over time, so does a dollar stolen. And many of these wrongs that started a long time ago are only going to get worse with time if we don't make the investments in home ownership, in education, in health equality, in a better criminal justice reform system, in helping with entrepreneurship to create more jobs, and by the way, if black entrepreneurs are thriving, they're creating more jobs for people of color and more jobs for all of us. [...] ED O'KEEFE: You released this Douglass Plan. And you know that a lot of the chatter has been, \"Well, interesting guy, raised a lot of money, doing well in the polling, but struggling to win over black and brown voters.\"\u00a0 So you release this plan, and then what? What happens next? How do you build up that support? BUTTIGIEG: Well, first of all I've got a responsibility to communicate about that plan. I believe it is the most comprehensive plan put forward in this campaign on how to make sure we lift up the conditions and opportunities for black Americans. But it's still my job to go out and share that idea. There's a broader issue though, which is that I still need to work to get known in a lot of communities. And that's certainly true when you're new on the scene and you are not yourself from a community of color. It's certainly true in reaching out to black and brown voters who often want to know what you're made of in a way that takes time to explain. But I'm committed to doing that work, that's why we're reaching out to various groups, both in terms of big public appearances. And when the cameras are off, having smaller conversations with activists, with pastors, with residents. Making sure that in the same way that it worked at home. For me to put in the quantity time that got the kind of support I needed to get reelected with help from the black community in South Bend. That that will serve me well winning the nomination too. [...] ED O'KEEFE: One of the aspects of your Douglass Plan, I meant to ask about. You're essentially, correct me if I'm wrong, pushing to reduce incarceration rates by 50 percent. BUTTIGIEG: That's right. ED O'KEEFE: There are some studies that have looked into what you are proposing, others have suggested this as well, that means you'd either have to release violent offenders or you're somehow tabulating state and local incarcerations which wouldn't be under federal control. So how do you get to 50 percent? BUTTIGIEG: So I believe that federal leadership can reduce those incarcerated at the state level and local level pretrial as well as what's happening federally. And we've got to do all of the above in order to meet this goal. The bottom line is, research tells us that we can and should have lower incarceration and that that will not be associated with an increase in crime. After all, if incarceration made everyone safe, we'd be the safest country in the world because we're pretty much the most incarcerated. But it does mean that we work with states and localities, by the way, many of which are trying to do this, but don't have the resources. And again, we see this in my area of the Midwest, where you have highly successful, very promising programs for alternatives to incarceration. Drug diversion programs, for example. But there are long waitlists and backlogs because they don't have the resources to do it. The Federal Government should be helping because there's also a return to investment in making sure people are not incarcerated and when they leave, reintegrated successfully. We have learned that it is simply false that a tax cut for the wealthy will pay for itself. But it is absolutely true that having fewer people incarcerated pays for itself in the long run.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 A federal judge's decision on Monday means more ex-White House officials may have to testify in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump. U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson ruled that former White House counsel Don McGahn must comply with a subpoena to appear before the House Judiciary Committee. The Justice Department, however, said it will appeal the ruling and seek a stay pending the appeal. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said the ruling \"contradicts longstanding legal precedent established by Administrations of both political parties.\" In her opinion, Jackson wrote that \"this Court holds that Executive branch officials are not absolutely immune from compulsory congressional process \u2014 no matter how many times the Executive branch has asserted as much over the years \u2014 even if the President expressly directs such officials' non-compliance.\" She continued, \"That is to say, however busy or essential a presidential aide might be, and whatever their proximity to sensitive domestic and national-security projects, the President does not have the power to excuse him or her from taking an action that the law requires.\" Jackson did, however, open the door for McGahn to \"invoke executive privilege where appropriate\" during his testimony. McGahn's lawyer said he will comply with the ruling unless it is stayed.\u00a0 \"Now that the court has ruled, I expect him to follow his legal obligations and promptly appear before the Committee,\" said Jerry Nadler, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in a statement. House Democrats\u00a0sued McGahn in August after he followed White House orders to not testify about his involvement in the Mueller investigation. The White House claims that Mr. Trump's senior advisers have \"absolute immunity\" from congressional subpoenas. Other former administration officials have ignored requests to testify in the impeachment inquiry, notably, John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, and Charles Kupperman, Bolton's deputy. The House Judiciary Committee had requested an expedited ruling from Brown, arguing there was an \"urgent need\" for McGahn to testify in the impeachment inquiry, which is \"quickly progressing.\" The committee also said that \"recent evidence produced in the criminal proceedings against former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone indicates that President Trump may have provided false statements in his written answers to the Special Counsel's office.\" Special counsel Robert Mueller investigated Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and listed in his report earlier this year instances when Mr. Trump might have obstructed justice, although he did not make any determinations about whether the president had actually committed obstruction. For instance, Mr. Trump directed McGahn to fire Mueller. He refused.  Because the case was expected to be appealed, it's unclear whether the House will wait for testimony from McGahn, Bolton and Kupperman. On Sunday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff told CNN that the House is \"not willing to ... stall this proceeding when the facts are already overwhelming.\" He said, \"we're going to continue our investigation.\" Furthermore, many Democrats want to wrap up the impeachment inquiry before the presidential primaries begin in February.\u00a0 In recent weeks, the public watched 12 witnesses appear before the House Intelligence Committee. Now, the House Judiciary Committee must decide whether there's sufficient evidence for a full House vote to impeach Mr. Trump. The decision about whether to remove him from office, however, is up to the Senate, which would hold a trial overseen by the Supreme Court's chief justice. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell doesn't expect a potential trial until\u00a0after Christmas. \u00a0 The impeachment inquiry was launched by House Democrats after Mr. Trump allegedly pursued a politically charged quid pro quo. He is accused of withholding U.S. military aid and a White House visit from Ukraine, unless Ukraine's president announced investigations into his political rivals. Earlier this month,\u00a0the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel\u00a0argued that Mr. Trump's closest advisers \"serve as his alter egos,\" so compelling their testimony would \"undercut the 'independence and autonomy' of the Presidency.\" In the week after the Justice Department drew that conclusion, the number of witnesses who refused to testify in the impeachment inquiry more than tripled.

            "article_content": "A federal watchdog has recommended that President Trump remove White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, one of his top advisers, from federal service due to her repeat violations of the Hatch Act, which prohibits government employees from making political statements while acting in an official capacity. The Office of the Special Counsel \u2014 the ethics office for the White House, which is unrelated to former special counsel Robert Mueller \u2014 sent a report to the president Thursday finding that Conway had violated the act \"on numerous occasions\" by criticizing Democratic presidential candidates in TV interviews and on social media. While the president and vice president are exempt from the Hatch Act, that privilege does not extend to federal employees. \"Ms. Conway's violations, if left unpunished, would send a message to all federal employees that they need not abide by the Hatch Act's restrictions. Her actions thus erode the principal foundation of our democratic system \u2014 the rule of law,\" the OSC said in the letter to Mr. Trump, calling Conway a \"repeat offender.\" The White House was quick to defend Conway. \"The Office of Special Counsel's (OSC) unprecedented actions against Kellyanne Conway are deeply flawed and violate her constitutional rights to free speech and due process,\" White House deputy press secretary Steven Groves said in a statement. \"Others, of all political views, have objected to the OSC's unclear and unevenly applied rules which have a chilling effect on free speech for all federal employees. \u00a0Its decisions seem to be influenced by media pressure and liberal organizations \u2013 and perhaps OSC should be mindful of its own mandate to act in a fair, impartial, non-political manner, and not misinterpret or weaponize the Hatch Act.\" An OSC report from March 2018 also found that Conway violated the Hatch Act by advocated for and against certain candidates in the 2017 special Senate election in Alabama. However, Conway has scoffed at the significance of these violations, saying in May that \"if you're trying to silence me through the Hatch Act, it's not going to work.\" \"Let me know when the jail sentence starts,\" Conway retorted. The report said that Conway has ignored multiple opportunities pointed out by the OSC to come into compliance with the Hatch Act. \"Ms. Conway's actions and statements stand in stark contrast to the culture of compliance promised by your White House Counsel and undermine your efforts to create and enforce such a culture,\" the letter to Mr. Trump said.

A source familiar with the matter told CBS News that White House lawyer Emmet Flood made the request, which McGahn did not comply with. \"We did not perceive it as any kind of threat or something sinister,\" said McGahn's attorney, William Burck. \"It was a request, professionally and cordially made.\"\u00a0 McGahn has told special counsel Robert Mueller's investigators he believed Mr. Trump did not obstruct justice, but has not spoken on it publicly,\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0reported. In Mueller's long-awaited report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, Mueller did not make a judgment on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice. But Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein have cleared the president. Mueller's report, though, detailed 10 instances of possible obstruction by Mr. Trump, including by unsuccessfully ordering McGahn to fire Mueller\u00a0in the summer of 2017. According to the report, Mr. Trump backed off the request when McGahn refused.\u00a0 Mr. Trump tweeted Saturday night he never wanted to fire Mueller. \"Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!\" Mr. Trump wrote.\u00a0 I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration. Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan! \u00a0House Democrats want McGahn to testify before Congress, but Mr. Trump has indicated that the White House would try to block the former counsel's appearance, saying McGahn has testified for enough time before the special counsel. \"I've had him testifying already for 30 hours and it's really \u2014 so I don't think I can let him and then tell everybody else you can't,\" Mr. Trump said last week in an interview with Fox News. House Judiciary chairman\u00a0Rep. Jerrold Nadler\u00a0also threatened Tuesday to hold McGahn in contempt if he didn't respond to a congressional subpoena for Mueller's documents. Democrats are also trying to get Mueller to testify, but have not yet agreed on a date for him to appear.

Law clerk for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. And then you start a career the Justice Department. LISA MONACO: That's right. MICHAEL MORELL: Why public service? You know, why not a high paying job at a law firm? Why did you choose DOJ? LISA MONACO: Well, I think it began really with my time working on the Hill at the Senate Judiciary Committee. For then, the committee was led by then Chairman Joseph Biden. MICHAEL MORELL: Yes. How about that? LISA MONACO: And this is before law school. So I didn't go in there thinking, \"Oh, I want to go be a lawyer. I want to be a prosecutor.\" But I did get the law and policy bug when I was there because I saw really committed folks who had actually left law firms, took a big pay cut to come to the Hill to work on big issues of public policy. Things like the Violence Against Women Act that I was privileged to work on and the crime bill and nominations to the Supreme Court and to the Justice Department. So I think I saw what you could do with a law degree spanning a whole bunch of issues. MICHAEL MORELL: So did you want to go to law school when you went there? LISA MONACO: No. MICHAEL MORELL: No? So this was something-- LISA MONACO: No. MICHAEL MORELL: --that grew out of that. LISA MONACO: That's right. I had been working at a healthcare policy consulting firm and then got this job on the Judiciary Committee staff and that's really when I got exposed to the wide panoply of things that you could do with a law degree that are outside the private practice of law. MICHAEL MORELL: So as a prosecutor you worked on the Enron case prosecuting Enron executives. What did you learn from that experience? LISA MONACO: I learned that as complex as the fraud was -- and it was a very complex accounting fraud case and it impacted an entire community in Houston and beyond. It was at the time, in December 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, it was the largest bankruptcy ever in corporate America. As complex as the case was in putting it together, at bottom it was about greed and it was about arrogance, the arrogance of the men who led Enron and really, through their lies to the shareholder community and their investors, really ruined a lot of people's lives. MICHAEL MORELL: Those two things, right, greed and arrogance, those cause a lot of problems in a lot of-- LISA MONACO: They do. MICHAEL MORELL: --different cases, don't they? LISA MONACO: Nothing ends well swhen those two are present. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. And then you end up working on national security. LISA MONACO: Uh-huh (AFFIRM). MICHAEL MORELL: All right. So how did that transition go from prosecutor to a focus on national security? LISA MONACO: You know, it's interesting. Before I worked on Enron, I was a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in Washington D.C., which people may not know is the only U.S. attorney's office, the only federal prosecutor's office around the country that also serves as the local prosecutor. And so the junior prosecutors in the office, the youngest ones, the newest ones do basically local crime. Small scale shoplifting. MICHAEL MORELL: Because it's Washington D.C. LISA MONACO: Because it's Washington D.C. and because of the, kind of, peculiar governmental structure here. So the U.S. attorney's office does local crime as well as the federal crime. And so you have to, kind of, work your way up through the system. And so I got exposed early on to the criminal justice system, to frankly the power of a prosecutor and how important it is to be an ethical prosecutor. It's your job in the unique role of a prosecutor is to do the right thing. Your job isn't to get a conviction. It's to do justice. And when I was in the Justice Department, I was-- I did not know Bob Mueller at the time, but he had a kind of legendary reputation. And so when I was leaving the Enron task force, I actually had the opportunity to go work for him at the F.B.I. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. Right. LISA MONACO: And this was during a time pretty soon after 9/11 where he was engaged in an effort to basically transform the F.B.I. after 9/11 into a national security organization focused on preventing the next terror attack, not solely on prosecuting crimes that have-- MICHAEL MORELL: A lot of pressure on the bureau at that time. LISA MONACO: Huge amounts of pressure to really transform itself, to create a much more robust intelligence capability, and to never let something like 9/11 happen again. And working with him there, I got immersed in the top threat of the time, which was of course the terrorism threat. And you were exposed to it because you were at the agency at the time. MICHAEL MORELL: And because Director Mueller was so focused on transforming the F.B.I. and sending the signal that counterterrorism was now its top priority as well as counterintelligence and cyber threats, he spent basically -- and those around him -- spent the first three hours of every morning, usually start about 6:30 in the morning, focusing on the threats to the nation that had come in overnight. And so I just was consumed with that as he was and that's really when I spent the next decade plus working on national security issues. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So I had a similar experience because I had been an East Asian analyst until I went to work for George Tenet in 1988. And I had not even heard of al-Qaeda before. And then I get to George Tenet's office and it is all terrorism. Right? LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: The entire focus of the office is terrorism and I had a similar experience. LISA MONACO: It's interesting. Before I became a prosecutor, it was my first job after law school, my clerkship I worked as counsel to the attorney general who was at the time Janet Reno. And this was shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing. So it was obviously the terror threat -- and during my time working for Janet Reno was during the change and the millennium threat. And we began to-- obviously we'd seen the Cole bombing. So what was interesting is that early on in my career, al-Qaeda was out there and it was part of what we were seeing quite obviously at around 2000 to 2001. But I had no way of knowing how big a part of my life and what my focus would be in the ensuing ten to 15 years. MICHAEL MORELL: [The case] for a lot of people, right? LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: Just one more career question, Lisa. You ran the National Security Division at the Department of Justice. What do the lawyers there do every day? LISA MONACO: The National Security Division at the Department of Justice is one of the reforms post-9/11 -- it was created after 9/11 within the Justice Department to bring the lawyers who focus on intelligence matters and who represent the intelligence community before the FISA court and who work on national level counter-terrorism and espionage and cyber prosecutions from nation state, cyber threat actors. They bring all those prosecutors together with the intelligence side of the house, so to speak. So everyone knows the phrase before 9/11 the failure to, quote, \"connect the dots.\" And that was because of a perception that the intelligence should not talk to the criminal prosecutors and that was completely blown up after 9/11. And we said we needed to share that information across that divide. And so the National Security Division was really created to integrate the lawyers and prosecutors and intelligence analysts and to bring that together under one roof quite literally in the Justice Department. MICHAEL MORELL: And how do the prosecutors in the National Security Division lash up to the prosecutors in U.S. attorney's offices? How does that work? LISA MONACO: So what's interesting about the Justice Department is the U.S. attorney's offices around the country, some 94 of them, are really the people bringing the cases around the country. But the national security cases -- again, this is a reform after 9/11, there was a view after 9/11 that the national security cases that were brought around the country needed to be done from a national perspective. There needed to be visibility across the nation as to what was going on. And so terrorism cases, espionage cases, nation state cyber cases, those are the only cases in the Justice Department that actually have to be signed off on back by the assistant attorney general for national security, the job I had, so that there is visibility and there's a national comprehensive approach to these issues. So what my lawyers would do in that, in the National Security Division, is work hand in glove with the prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's offices around the country and as a team bring those cases. MICHAEL MORELL: Let me go back to something you mentioned earlier which is this ethic, right, of prosecutors to get to justice, not to a conviction. How do you make sure that happens? How do you make sure that you don't drift towards 'how many notches can I get on my belt?' LISA MONACO: It ought to be drummed into you very early on as it was to me and to my colleagues when we were trained. You learn to focus on doing justice to present your ethics. And the rules are designed to have you basically present your case, warts and all, to the judge. You're duty bound and ethically bound to present the evidence that is counter to your case called-- it's called Brady material. And there is a long line of Supreme Court cases and rules of criminal procedure that require prosecutors to present that evidence and to share that with the defense. Now, which is not to say there aren't healthy disagreements of what falls in that bucket. MICHAEL MORELL: Sure. LISA MONACO: But prosecutors are trained to abide by those rules and judges, the good judges, hold them to it. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. I'm just making a comparison in my mind here to intelligent analysts, who have this ethic of being objective, right-- LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: --in their analysis, and 'politics and policy be damned' sort of thing. LISA MONACO: Yep. MICHAEL MORELL: And I'm just sitting here thinking it might be healthy if analysts had to tell policymakers, \"Here's the evidence I have that actually doesn't fit-- LISA MONACO: Right. MICHAEL MORELL: --with my argument,\" right? LISA MONACO: Well, you and I dealt with some of that, right? I mean, we'd sit around the situation room table and I would regularly get assessments from the agency and the rest of the intelligence community that say, you know, \"Our assessment is X, but the reason it's not higher is because we have this other information-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right. Right. LISA MONACO: --which either runs counter to it-- MICHAEL MORELL: Confidence levels. LISA MONACO: --and you apply confidence levels. And then the other thing, I think, that is similar in the intelligence community is this notion of red team analysis. Right? Say, assign a group of analysts to another view really and to challenge-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right. LISA MONACO: --the assumptions that have come out-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right. Right. LISA MONACO: --in the piece. And-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right. LISA MONACO: --I think there's something very healthy about that. It aids. I know it aided me as a policymaker when we were wrestling with very tough issues. You know, I actually-- I've made the same comparison in my head, too,\u00a0 as-- MICHAEL MORELL: Oh, interesting. LISA MONACO: --I proceeded in my career and focused more and more on intelligence issues and literally left being a lawyer when I went to the White House. Right? Because when I was at the White House, I was not-- MICHAEL MORELL: You were a policymaker. LISA MONACO: I was policymaker. Didn't have any role as a lawyer. You can't help when you're trained that way, as I know you know as an intelligence analyst. You can't help but see things through those lenses. But I saw a lot of parallels and I actually think the F.B.I., obviously, where I was privileged to serve a number of years, has a similar role. And, you know, as you pointed out in the intelligence community in the sense of speaking truth to power, being clear about what the facts are, being guided by the facts. You know, the intelligence community makes its assessment based on facts only. Doesn't let politics creep in. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. LISA MONACO: And it's the same ethos. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. Okay. Some policy issues, Lisa. First, terrorism. LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: So where do you think we are today in terms of the terrorism threat? How do you think about that? LISA MONACO: So I see it as a little bit of a good news, bad news story, which is a bit surprising, actually, for you and I to be sitting here looking at each other and be able to say that. The good news is that, you know, the threat as we saw it post-9/11, of command and control, complex, foreign directed attacks is greatly diminished. And that is owing to the tremendous professionalism and hard work across multiple administrations going back now 17, 18 years.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Both in terms of defending the homeland and then also when somebody develops the capability to reach out and harm us, we take the fight to them. LISA MONACO: That's exactly right. And-- MICHAEL MORELL: Both offense and defense. LISA MONACO: And that's a story of continuity across administrations up to and including the one we're in right now. And that's good. Right? We have not had a successful attack from a foreign terrorist organization on this country since 9/11. And ISIS, the, you know, most recent incarnation of foreign terrorist organizations that we've been most concerned about has been rolled back substantially, does not occupy the land that it did, which was one of its distinguishing factors. So all of that is good news and, you know, lots of reasons for that that we can go into. The bad news is that the conditions that made it possible for al-Qaeda to take root, that made it possible for ISIS to expand and occupy the territory to recruit and radicalize, all of those things still exist in the Middle East, in other regions. And those things are not going away. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. LISA MONACO: In fact, they're getting worse-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right. LISA MONACO: --if you look at places like Yemen. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. LISA MONACO: And if you look at the increasing tensions in the Gulf and the Sunni Shia-- MICHAEL MORELL: What's left in Syria for example. LISA MONACO: What's left in Syria. Exactly. And so that story is not good and I think it's getting worse. And then here at home the sources, our political divisions, the ability for individuals to radicalize online, whether it's ISIS inspired, whether it's far right ideology, whether it's far left ideology, all of those conditions also still exist and I think also are getting worse. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. In fact, you wrote and with Ken Weinstein who had your job in the Bush administration-- LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: --an op-ed. And the title was, \"We've declared war on foreign terrorism. Why not do the same on domestic terrorism?\" LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: What was that all about? LISA MONACO: So actually we didn't choose the title. MICHAEL MORELL: And people should know that op-ed writers do not choose the title. LISA MONACO: Exactly. (LAUGH) The point of the piece, and Ken and I felt it was important for us both to say it not only because we both agree with it, but because I think it's important now more than ever that there be bipartisan voices on these issues. The point of the piece was to say-- and this happened-- we wrote this piece after the horrific week of attempted pipe bombs against critics of the president, the horrific slaughter at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, and the killing of two individuals in Kansas. You know, the point of the piece was to say that the domestic terrorist issues, and by that I mean terrorism visited upon us by individuals here at home with no foreign terrorist nexus who are radicalized by ideologies outside of jihadist violence, that we are not equipped today to deal with those and we're not appropriately focusing on it as a government. And indeed what we've seen is a diminution in focus both on the terrorist issue in its domestic manifestations and in work with communities, for instance, that could help us combat it. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. And we just have to remember the Oklahoma City bomber. LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: So you get an idea of how much damage can be done. LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: You talked about the continuity in counterterrorism policy. Are there things that this administration is doing that concerned you on the terrorism front? LISA MONACO: There are. So return to the theme we just had, which is focus. Right? So the role that I had as homeland security counterterrorism adviser and as assistant to the president with direct and immediate access to the president. I met with the president every morning on these and other issues.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: And you could walk into the Oval Office any time you wanted if you needed to see him? LISA MONACO: I could and did. And unfortunately, I usually had bad news which is why he had a nickname for me, which was Dr. Doom. (LAUGH) But it was very important particularly after 9/11, particularly as the threats against our homeland have expanded beyond terrorist threats to cyber threats to pandemic disease and a whole panoply of issues. So that role that I occupied that Ken Weinstein had, that John Brennan had, that Fran Townsend had was because the president from George W. Bush through Barack Obama knew that we needed and they needed one person who woke up every day focused 24/7 on this issue. Today that person does not exist. That role has unfortunately been, kind of, downgraded. And I think that's a problem because I know I was pretty busy as were my predecessors. And so I wonder about the focus in the White House on these issues. Secondly, the-- if you look at the counterterrorism strategy that the administration has produced, I think you and I could've written strategy. There was a lot of continuity in themes. It talked about keeping pressure on safe havens where terrorists talked about working in partnership with other governments. It talked about hate fueled ideologies beyond Islamic extremism. But it does-- there's a real mismatch with that strategy in what we're seeing in terms of rhetoric and actions. So I talked about the diminished focus in the White House. Things like the travel ban or I think run directly counter to things like that are in that national strategy. It sends an isolating message and fuels the ISIS recruiting when it comes to sending a message that we don't want to work with Muslim countries. MICHAEL MORELL: Allows them to say, \"See? They're against us.\" LISA MONACO: That's exactly right. I mean, as you know, they recruit people. Al-Qaeda, ISIS, others recruit based on the theory that there's a clash of civilizations, that the West and America in particular is aligned against all of Islam. And so we feed that narrative when we do things like the travel ban, when we criticize our NATO allies, and when we talk about retreat from multilateral organizations and agreements. All of that, I think, isolates us from our partnerships that are so, so critical to being able to take the fight to the terrorists abroad before they come here and to work with communities here who are so vital to our being able to defend against inspired attacks here at home. MICHAEL MORELL: In terms of the actions that the Obama administration took against terrorists when we couldn't capture them, so that the actions to remove them from the battlefield, we had the highest standard possible with regard to collateral damage. Right? LISA MONACO: We did. MICHAEL MORELL: There was no higher standard you could get to. LISA MONACO: No. MICHAEL MORELL: This administration says that they have not lowered that standard, but there seems to me to be more collateral damage. LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: What's your sense?\u00a0 LISA MONACO: That's what I'm reading. I obviously don't have access to the intelligence anymore, but that tracks with what I've read in terms of the non-governmental organizations that track these issues. I think interestingly, you know, Michael, as you know, in the last couple of years of the Obama administration, we tried to put a lot more transparency around the use of force in conflict zones and in areas outside of what we called hot battlefields and in the use of terrorism strikes. And we made a decision to publish those numbers including the numbers of civilian deaths that were a result of those efforts and issued an executive order to require the national security community to publish those numbers every year. To my mind, that hasn't continued. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. And President Obama's logic, as I remember it, you'll know better than I, was that look, this is something that we're going to have to do for a long time. LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: And we're going to need domestic acceptance of it, domestic support for it, and at least international acquiescence. Right? LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: If not more. And so we got to be able to talk about this more. Our successes and our failures. LISA MONACO: That's exactly right because look, there's a lot of discussion about transparency and the reasons for it and the challenges between striking a balance between secrecy and security. But the reality is transparency is important for the legitimacy of the actions that we take as a government, as a national security community. And if we don't have the support and the confidence of the American people that we're doing these things in good faith and that we address mistakes where we make them, we won't retain that confidence and we won't have legitimacy. And we are going to need to be able to use these tools for a long time to come. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. And the extent we don't, we also hand a propaganda victory to the adversary. LISA MONACO: Absolutely. And we've seen our adversaries use that against us. MICHAEL MORELL: Okay. Cyber. Give me your view of the threat. LISA MONACO: The threat, I think, is one-- I've described it this way. The cyber threat is more diffuse than ever before in terms of the number and the types of actors. I mean, nation states, non-state actors, criminals and hacktivists, right? Cyber actors who just want to make a political point. So it's more diffuse than ever before. It is more sophisticated than ever before. And you think about the tools those actors are using. Things like ransomware, like denial of service attacks, destructive attacks like we saw in the Saudi Aramco attack, the Sands Casino attack, the Sony attack, and it is more dangerous than ever before. It's more dangerous because those tools are having destructive effect. They're also attacking the very kind of things that undergird our democracy like our elections. And there's potential to be more destructive when you think about how expansive the target area is or the attack surfaces when you think about the internet of things and how vulnerable we all are. So the threat, I think of it in those three ways. And if I think about the most dangerous actors, it is as it was I believe when I left the government, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea -- in that order. MICHAEL MORELL: And then some of the criminal groups who take advantage of being in those countries where somebody works for-- LISA MONACO: Acting as proxies. Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: --the government during the day and they work for a criminal organization at night bringing the same skills to the table. LISA MONACO: And we saw that, actually. We saw that in-- when I was head of the National Security Division, we began the investigation against the five members of the People's Liberation Army in China who ultimately were indicted in 2014-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right. LISA MONACO: --for cyber enabled economic espionage directed by the Chinese government. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. LISA MONACO: And some of those actors were basically doing it in their off hours too. MICHAEL MORELL: So where is U.S. government policy with regard to cyber at the moment and then where does it need to be? And how far away are we from where it needs to be? LISA MONACO: So I think it's similar to how I described the counterterrorism policy, which is you can see lots of points of continuity, I think, if you look at the doctrine here or what is the stated policy. Lots of focus, I think, on working with the private sector. That's good on shoring up our defenses. Lots of work on trying to set standards for internet of things devices, et cetera. But there also, I think, has been some very dangerous departures. Things like, again, a lack of focus. There's no longer a cyber security coordinator in the White House.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: There was.\u00a0 LISA MONACO: There was a long time career official named Rob Joyce who's an expert at the National Security Agency who's gone back there. He was, I think, a tremendous force and good resource as cyber security coordinator in the White House. So I think it doesn't make sense to not have that point of focus in the White House. I mean, think of it this way. In 2012, the Director of National Intelligence said for the first time that cyber threat is the top threat facing our nation. It was the first time since 9/11 that it had leaped-- MICHAEL MORELL: Switched. Yeah. LISA MONACO: --ahead of terrorism. It has occupied that top spot in the threat list ever since. And so to not have one person who's waking up 24/7 with access to the president focusing on it, I think that's a mistake. I think that the focus on bilateral to the exclusion of multilateral agreements in the cyber realm to try and establish norms of behavior is something that is a departure from past approaches and past administrations, again, crossing the political spectrum. This is-- and it shouldn't be, I should say, Michael, this should not be a partisan issue. We really-- MICHAEL MORELL: And why is multilateral better for you-- LISA MONACO: Well, I think-- MICHAEL MORELL: --how people think about that? LISA MONACO: It's not exclusively so. Right? I mean, obviously we had President Xi and President Obama engaged in very healthy debates and arrived at an agreement that has now I think fallen by the wayside. But so there is a place for bilateral agreements. But if we do not work, if the U.S. is not leading and if the president is not leading the international community to come together to say, \"Here's a set of activities that are acceptable in cyberspace and here's what we as an international community believe ought to be outside the bounds,\" -- we can't hope to isolate bad actors. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. LISA MONACO: Right? You have to be isolating them from something. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. Right. Right. LISA MONACO: And that means an international community. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. How do you think about the offensive use of cyber for defensive purposes?\u00a0 LISA MONACO: So I think it has a place, but I think we have to be very careful in this, which is to say, you know, there's a lot of debate about, you know, I used to get the question and in response to the Sony hack, \"Well, why didn't we zap them back?\" And that's the level of the question I would get. Zap them back, right? You know, one, you have to figure out how effective are you going to be to turn out the lights by cyber means in North Korea is-- MICHAEL MORELL: There aren't any lights to begin with.\u00a0 LISA MONACO: There aren't any lights to begin with. And it would, you know, not exactly have a tremendous effect. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. LISA MONACO: To escalate a series of cyber actions with an adversary where you're not quite sure where you might be more vulnerable-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right. LISA MONACO: --which, you know, the United States is the most connected nation, ironically is also the most vulnerable-- MICHAEL MORELL: Right. LISA MONACO: --to cyberattacks. So I think you have to be very careful-- MICHAEL MORELL: Glass house. Glass house argument. LISA MONACO: Yeah. Exactly right. And so you have to be very careful about that, which is not to say that we don't have tremendous capabilities. We do. And we can and should use those capabilities. But we have to do it in the context of understanding what the impacts are and that's something, you know, that you and I would rely on the intelligence community for when we were in government to really set out that full context to try and understand. MICHAEL MORELL: Right. Right. Lisa, you have been absolutely terrific with your time. I wanted to ask you two more questions. LISA MONACO: Sure. MICHAEL MORELL: I'm sure that one of the things that I mentioned in the intro and then you mentioned later caught people's attention, which is the fact that you worked for Bob Mueller very closely for a period of time when he was director of the F.B.I. And with all of the politics swirling around the investigation that he's leading, I was hoping you could just give us a sense of Bob Mueller, the man, who he is, you know, how he thinks, how he works. Just walk us through who Bob Mueller is. LISA MONACO: Sure. First of all, it was a tremendous privilege to be able to work with him both when I was chief of staff at the F.B.I. for three years and then in the other jobs that you mentioned that I've had. I continued to work with him until he left government in 2013. So look, he is a man-- I think by now folks know he is a long-time career prosecutor. A Republican, but a Marine and a prosecutor first and foremost. He is somebody who served his country repeatedly. He served in Vietnam. He volunteered to go when he didn't have to and earned a number of commendations for doing so. Came back. Was a prosecutor for many, many years, led the F.B.I. Little known fact, he led it for ten years and then the Congress passed a statute, a special statute 98 to zero to have him serve for an additional two years. He is somebody who is a product of the institutions that I think have formed him most. One is the Marines where he had an ethic of service and-- MICHAEL MORELL: Sacrifice. LISA MONACO: --sacrifice. Tremendous service and sacrifice, and the other is the Department of Justice and the rule of law and doing the right thing, being guided by the facts come hell or high water. Look, he is a tough, relentless prosecutor, but he is somebody who doesn't shade, does not-- his ethos, I think, is truth and integrity. He doesn't shade. He doesn't embellish. It's about the work first and foremost. MICHAEL MORELL: And then second -- and I don't want to embarrass you here, but when people make lists of future F.B.I. directors, your name shows up on it. And with that in mind, I'm wondering how you think about how the bureau has become a political football in the last two years and what that must mean for the people who work there. LISA MONACO: I think that it's tremendously unfortunate that it has become drawn into politics. It is a tremendously powerful institution, but it is one that needs to retain the confidence and legitimacy in the work that it does, precisely because it is so powerful. I think that the men and women who work there do not like to be drawn in to the politics and will keep their head down and continue to do the work in front of them, whether it's terrorism investigations, whether it's white collar fraud investigations, whether it's national security cyber investigations. They will continue to do that work. But the danger of the politicization of this and of the attacks on the F.B.I. is that the people in the United States lose confidence. Right? And that has a direct impact. I mean, people talk a lot about very abstract concepts of norms and institutions. But what does that mean? What it means is F.B.I. agents going to court every day, raise their right hand and swear to tell the truth and rely on juries to believe them. F.B.I. relies on families of victims to come forward to work with them to help them solve crimes, to help them prevent terrorist threats. You name it. We rely on the citizenry to have faith in the job that institutions like the F.B.I. do. And if we don't have faith and confidence in those institutions and the people who operate in them, then we hurt our democracy and we hurt our safety. MICHAEL MORELL: And we're going to pay a cost. LISA MONACO: Yeah. MICHAEL MORELL: Lisa, thanks for being with us. LISA MONACO: Thanks for having me. * * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "A rising number of Democratic lawmakers have begun to call for an impeachment inquiry -- a sign of increasing frustration with their inability to obtain interviews with and information from Trump administration officials following the release of the special counsel's report.\u00a0 On Monday, the Office of Legal Counsel released an opinion stating that Congress could not force former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify, overriding a subpoena by the House Judiciary Committee.  This follows White House's recent invocation of executive privilege to stop Attorney General Barr from releasing the entire Mueller report on Russia's election interference and on obstruction.\u00a0 In letters denying congressional requests, White House lawyers argued that the Democrats' investigations lack legislative purpose. They did so just this week, when the administration blocked McGahn from testifying. He had been subpoenaed by the House Judiciary Committee to appear Tuesday.\u00a0 Some House Democrats wonder if an impeachment inquiry might improve their case -- Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Veronica Escobar tweeted in support of initiating an inquiry as another avenue to access the information and witnesses they seek. \"We are now at the point where we must begin an impeachment inquiry. I don't say that lightly. We've taken every step we can w/subpoenas and witnesses. Trump obstructs everything. A president who thinks he's king, accountable to nobody & above the law is absolutely unacceptable,\" wrote Jayapal.\u00a0 I personally feel like we cannot tolerate this level of obstruction, that if we do, then we have lowered the bar to the point where any criminal can be president of the United States and that should be unacceptable to all of us.I believe we need to begin an impeachment inquiry. \"I personally feel like we cannot tolerate this level of obstruction, that if we do, then we have lowered the bar to the point where any criminal can be president of the United States and that should be unacceptable to all of us. I believe we need to begin an impeachment inquiry,\" agreed Escobar. Pennsylvania Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, also tweeted her support to launch an inquiry.\u00a0 No one is above law. It's time to start an impeachment inquiry. Having the courage to think about the long-term consequences of this administration, including the foundation of our republic, should not be partisan. It is the courage that we as Americans must have, together. pic.twitter.com/nYptX091F0 \"No one is above the law,\" she wrote. \"Having the courage to think about the long-term consequences of this administration, including the foundation of our republic, should not be partisan. It is the courage that we as Americans must have, together.\" Freshman Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who already supported impeachment, said the decision not to impeach could be construed as \"politicized.\" It is just as politicized a maneuver to not impeach in the face of overwhelming evidence as it is to impeach w/o cause.Congress swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. That includes impeachment.We have a duty to preserve our institutions + uphold the rule of law. https://t.co/oqguoDLUVC \"It is just as politicized a maneuver to not impeach in the face of overwhelming evidence as it is to impeach w/o cause.  Congress swore an oath to uphold the Constitution. That includes impeachment,\" she wrote.\u00a0 While some Democrats oppose impeachment proceedings, many appear to agree that an inquiry would give them a better argument in seeking documents and interviews from the Trump administration.\u00a0 Democrats have stopped short of supporting a vote to impeach Mr. Trump -- for now, their discussion is largely limited to filing an inquiry or investigation to further explore possible claims of wrongdoing. An inquiry is the first step in the process of an impeachment vote in the House. House members may make impeachment resolutions, which would then be turned over to the House Judiciary Committee. The committee decides whether the resolution and its allegations of wrongdoing by the president merit a referral to the full House for a vote to launch a formal impeachment inquiry. Then, the House would vote for or against the inquiry. If a majority of members vote to proceed, the House Judiciary Committee would conduct an investigation to determine if there is enough evidence to warrant articles of impeachment against the president.\u00a0 CBS News' Rebecca Kaplan reports there's acknowledgment -- even from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- that formally opening an impeachment inquiry could strengthen Democrats' argument in their court fight with the president because it would enable Democrats to declare that they have a legitimate and specific legislative purpose, rather than broad oversight.  \"One of the purposes the constitution spells out for investigations is impeachment,\" Pelosi told reporters last week. \"So you can say...we need this information to carry out our oversight responsibilities and among them is impeachment. It doesn't mean you are going on an impeachment path, but it means if you had the information, you might.\" \"I isn't about impeachment; it's about impeachment as a purpose, a constitutional purpose and justifying constitutionally and court-wise a path,\" she added.\u00a0 There is also one House Republican who doesn't think impeaching President Trump should be ruled out.\u00a0Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan became the first GOP lawmaker to say President Trump had \"engaged in impeachable conduct.\"\u00a0 In a series of tweets on Saturday, Amash wrote he had read the full Mueller report and had concluded the president's conduct met the \"threshold for impeachment.\" Tuesday morning, Amash was telling students visiting the Capitol that impeachment proceedings should begin, CBS News' Bo Erickson noted. Wow: @justinamash is NOT backing down. He is now talking to a school group on steps of the Capitol about why Trump impeachment proceedings should begin. \u201cReally dangerous for our country\u201d when ppl don\u2019t tell the truth pic.twitter.com/JYhKMtjhuk Amash's comments were rejected by Republican leadership, including Minority Whip Steve Scalise, who called his assessment \"dead wrong.\"\u00a0 \"I think if you look at the Mueller report, it was very clear there was no collusion and no corruption. And how somebody \u00a0can read it and find something different, I think maybe they were just looking for something that is not there. He is wrong about it. And his reading is just way off base,\" Scalise added.\u00a0 House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Amash's outlook was just \"one person with one opinion\" and slammed his comments as being \"out of step with this conference\" and \"out of step with America.\" Across the aisle, House Speaker Pelosi told reporters that Amash's tweet \"speaks volumes about the absence of any sound from the Republicans on the unethical behavior of the Trump administration.\" According to a Democratic aide, Pelosi has called a meeting for Wednesday morning to provide the caucus with an update on oversight and investigations.

            "article_content": "In \"The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience\"\u00a0(published by Simon & Schuster, a division of CBS), former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, write about the lives of women in history who have made a difference, ranging from social activists and political figures to writers and Olympians. One of the women they highlight is the trailblazing Representative and Senator from Maine, Margaret Chase Smith, who denounced Sen. Joe McCarthy and became the first woman to seek a major party's presidential nomination.  Read the excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea Clinton on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" September 29!  When I was a little girl, my family subscribed to Life magazine, which came to our house every week on Friday. When I came home from school, I'd eagerly grab it and lie down on the floor in our living room to read it before I had to set the table for dinner. It was in those pages that I first encountered Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who was the first example I ever remember seeing of a woman elected official. Following her career\u2014from the campaigns that led to her becoming the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress to her history-making candidacy for president of the United States in 1964\u2014shaped my understanding of politics and public service. She embodied the thrill of breaking barriers\u2014and the challenges that come with being \"the first.\" Born and raised in Maine, Margaret discovered a passion for politics when her husband, Clyde Harold Smith, was elected to Congress. She campaigned for him and, after he was elected, joined him in Washington. During his first term, he became gravely ill, and Margaret stepped in to fill as many of his obligations as she could. She traveled back and forth between Washington and Maine, appearing at events on behalf of her husband. With Margaret's help, Clyde was reelected in 1938. His health, however, declined quickly. In the spring of 1940, he put out a statement urging his friends and supporters to stand behind Margaret if he could not run in the upcoming election. \"I know of no one who has the full knowledge of my ideas and plans or is as well qualified as she is, to carry on these ideas and my unfinished work for my district.\" He died the next day. Margaret easily won the special election to serve out her husband's unexpired term. At the time, most of the few women who served in office had been elected or appointed to fill a seat vacated by a husband or father. It was so common it even had a name: \"the widow's mandate.\" Though she had never planned on it, Margaret was now the state's first woman member of Congress. (\"Mrs. Smith Goes to Washington,\" read one headline.) Taking office was one thing, but, as Margaret soon found out, staying there was another. The primary election for the next term was under way within a week of her taking office. She faced off against four male opponents, one of whom argued that, against a backdrop of the war in Europe and questions of America's role at home, there was just too much at stake to elect a woman to Congress. A local newspaper columnist agreed, sniping that the primary was at risk of hinging on a \"question of sex\" rather than \"ability.\" But Margaret had already proved herself to the people of Maine, and she won. Throughout her life, Margaret dismissed the idea that she was a feminist. She was a moderate, not a radical, and resented the idea that she or any woman should be treated differently because of their gender. \"I never asked for any special privileges,\" she said later of her time in Congress. \"And I can assure you I never got any.\" Still, she was a quiet and steadfast champion of policies advancing women's rights, equality, and dignity; I think she was a feminist even without claiming the label. Margaret voted again and again for the Equal Rights Amendment, even cosponsoring it in 1945. (What would she say about the fact that we still haven't passed it more than seven decades later?) Despite the critics who doubted that a woman could play a role in foreign policy, Margaret eventually served on the House Naval Affairs Committee. At the time, women who were part of the armed services were considered \"volunteers\" and didn't receive any benefits. Her signature piece of legislation was the Women's Armed Forces Integration Act, which led to the extension of benefits to all uniformed women in the military. After eight years in the House, Margaret launched her campaign for the United States Senate. The Maine Republican Party was less than thrilled by her many votes across party lines, and they opposed her candidacy. Her opponents denigrated her in the press, suggesting that \"the Senate was no place for a woman.\" She ran proudly on her experience in Congress, using the slogan \"Don't trade a record for a promise.\" Right before the election, she was the victim of a smear campaign accusing her of being a Communist because she had supported the New Deal, the United Nations, the Truman Doctrine, and the Marshall Plan. With the help of a dedicated cadre of women volunteers who were the backbone of her shoestring campaign, Margaret Chase Smith won her election in a landslide. When she entered the Senate, Margaret was clear-eyed about the reality of her humble position: She was a junior member and the only woman alongside ninety-five men. That didn't stop her from standing up for what she knew was right\u2014even if it meant standing alone. When Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy used his position to launch a broad investigation of government employees and other Americans to root out Communists, whom he saw in every corner, Margaret was one of the first to sound the alarm over what she saw as dangerous demagoguery. His persecutorial tactics destroyed reputations and lives. Yet it became painfully clear that no other senator was going to speak out against him. On the morning of June 1, 1950, she ran into Senator McCarthy on the \"little Senate subway train\" that would take her to the floor. She would remember their exchange for the rest of her life. Catching sight of her determined expression, McCarthy commented: \"Margaret, you look very serious. Are you going to make a speech?\" \"Yes,\" she answered. \"And you will not like it!\" In her groundbreaking speech that day, she called out his hate and character assassination and the tactics he was using that became known as \"McCarthyism.\" \"Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly and simply about a serious national condition,\" she began. \"It is a national feeling of fear and frustration that could result in national suicide and the end of everything that we Americans hold dear.\" She eviscerated McCarthy and called out her colleagues for their lack of courage in standing up to him. \"I don't want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the Four Horsemen of Calumny\u2014Fear, Ignorance, Bigotry, and Smear.\" She and six other Republican senators signed a statement expressing their concerns known as her \"Declaration of Conscience.\" (McCarthy later mocked her and her cosigners as \"Snow White and the Six Dwarfs.\" He would have been a natural on Twitter.) She continued to oppose McCarthy at personal and political cost for four more years, until 1954, when the Senate finally censured him for his conduct and ended his career. With her seminal speech, Margaret captured the national spotlight. Reporters and prominent figures in Washington wondered whether she could run for vice president\u2014or even president. Yet, as one reporter bemoaned, \"It is considered doubtful that the country will see a woman head of state in the near or even distant future.\" (Unfortunately, they didn't know how right they were.) Speculation mounted as to whether Margaret might launch an unprecedented run\u2014would she or wouldn't she? In January 1964, her campaign manager drafted a speech to the Women's National Press Club with two endings: one announcing that she was in, one declaring she was out. In her speech, she dryly detailed the reasons she had heard about why she should not run. \"First, there are those who make the contention that no woman should ever dare to aspire to the White House\u2014that this is a man's world and that it should be kept that way\u2014and that a woman on the national ticket of a political party would be more of a handicap than a strength,\" she said that day. \"Second, it is contended that the odds are too heavily against me for even the most remote chance of victory\u2014and that I should not run in the face of what most observers see as certain and crushing defeat. Third, it is contended that as a woman I would not have the physical stamina and strength to run.\" (Ah, memories!) She concluded with a twinkle in her eye: \"So, because of these very impelling reasons against my running, I have decided that I shall.\" That day, she became the first woman to seek a major party's presidential nomination. From the beginning, Margaret ran a scrappy, upstart campaign. Reporters were not kind to her: They commented on her hair, her figure, and her age. \"Since my candidacy was announced, almost every news story starts off 'the sixty-six-year-old senator.' I haven't seen the age played up in the case of the male candidates,\" she pointed out. At that year's Republican National Convention, she became the first woman to have her name put in nomination for the presidency. That night, delegates in the convention center carried signs reading \"Smith for President\" and \"The Lady from Maine.\" Though Senator Barry Goldwater ultimately clinched the nomination, she sent a resounding message that resonated for many women, including me. Chelsea writes: One of my favorite fun facts about Margaret is that she wore a red rose in her lapel every day, gave them to her colleagues, and fought for years to have the rose declared the official flower of the United States. She faced staunch opposition from Senate Republican Leader Everett M. Dirksen, who argued that it should be the marigold. In 1987, long after her retirement, Margaret won this battle, and Congress designated the rose as the national flower. \u00a0 Margaret lived to be ninety-seven years old. I included her in the video called \"History Made\" that played at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on June 7, 2016, when I reached the 2,383-delegate mark to become the Democratic nominee for president. I wanted more Americans to know about her. She has been on my mind even more than usual recently. I think often of her public example of courage in this time when her party seems to have lost its way. I can't help but think how much better off the Republican Party\u2014and our country\u2014would be if there were more like Margaret in public office today.

            "article_content": "Former Texas U.S. Representative Pete Sessions could potentially find himself in the middle of the indictment of two Soviet-born businessmen linked with helping Rudy Giuliani investigate Joe and Hunter Biden. The indictment refers to a \"Congressman-1,\" and while it does not name or charge the individual, it does lay out references to donations and activities that align with Sessions' contact with the two indicted businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. \u00a0 According to a now-deleted Facebook post by Parnas, then-Representative Sessions met with the two businessmen in May 2018. The indictment alleges the two were lobbying Sessions to call for the dismissal of the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. Sessions wrote a private letter asking for the removal of Yovanovitch to Secretary Mike Pompeo that same month and said in a statement today that he wrote the letter \"after several congressional colleagues reported to me that the current U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine was disparaging President Trump to others as part of those official duties.\" In his statement, he said his May 2018 meeting was about the \"need for Ukraine to become energy independent\u2026There was no request in that meeting, and I took no action. Over time, I recall that there were a couple additional meetings. Again, at no time did I take any official action after these meetings.\"\u00a0 CBS News Political Unit Broadcast Associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0found FEC records showing $5,400 in donations from Parnas and Fruman for then Rep. Sessions' re-election campaign in June of 2018, months after the meeting with Parnas and Fruman. \"The defendants concealed the scheme from the candidates, campaigns and federal regulators. Therefore, if I am 'Congressman One', I could not have had any knowledge of the scheme described in the indictment or have involvement or coordination of it,\" Sessions wrote. Sessions launched an effort to reboot his Congressional career earlier this month for Texas' 17th congressional district, a seat that became open after Congressman Bill Flores announced his retirement. Sessions previously served more than 20 years in Texas' 32nd District in the Dallas area but was beaten by Democrat Colin Allred in 2018. \u00a0Sessions did not reply to CBS News request for comment. MICHAEL BENNET Colorado Senator Michael Bennet unveiled his\u00a0plan\u00a0today to combat what he calls \"America's housing affordability crisis.\" In a statement Bennet said, \"A home is a platform for stability and upward mobility in America, but for too many families, owning a home is out of reach and the high cost of paying rent has pushed them to a breaking point.\"\u00a0 CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says Bennet's plan proposes building, preserving or refurbishing nearly 4 million affordable housing units. Bennet says combining that with an effort to push communities to eliminate zoning laws that block affordable housing could eliminate the shortage of 7.2 million affordable homes.\u00a0 The plan would addresses rising transportation costs by investing in \"major mass-transit projects,\" such as commuter rail and rapid transit buses. The plan also aims to help middle class families by fully funding voucher programs, providing down payment assistance and making changes to the tax code \"that currently provide a disproportionate benefit to high-income taxpayers.\" JOE BIDEN While the main focus of Joe Biden's two New Hampshire speeches yesterday was his embrace of an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, he also sniped at a feature of his Democratic primary race: plans. The former vice president said that while \"plans are important\" they're \"not enough.\" Biden jabbed,\"We're not electing a planner!\"\u00a0 The comment could potentially be seen as a swipe at Sen. Elizabeth Warren and her \"I've got a plan for that\" mantra. Even if Biden did not intend to invoke Warren, attendees in line at his Rochester, New Hampshire speech a few hours earlier were openly opining about their Senator-next-door. As Warren continues to rise in the polls, she keeps pitching overturning systems of government like they're a cart full of rotten apples. Biden continues to maintain his front-runner status while embracing his own plans\u2014with some of his marquee ideas attracting fans simply because they are not as free-spending as Warren's. But even as it seems Biden and Warren at times represent the tug-of-war between factions of the Democratic Party, their supporters in this week's\u00a0Morning Consult\u00a0poll most frequently cited one another as their preferred second pick. Could their supporters have their pie and eat it, too? Elaine and David Ahearn from Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, who said they hosted Delaware Senator Chris Coons and other Biden supporters at their home on Tuesday evening, certainly hope so. \"I would love a Biden and Warren ticket,\" Elaine told\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0when asked about the race. \"Everywhere we go people are talking about those two together.\"\u00a0 She added that many New Hampshire Democrats want to \"see a woman on the ticket\" too. \"Could they compromise with each other and compromise with the country? I think they have the potential,\" Karen Chandler said as she debated the potential ticket to herself. \"I love it!\" she declared. \u00a0 Former Rochester Mayor T.J. Jean, a Biden supporter, also endorsed the combo. \"Now, are you going to ask me which one is on top?\" Jean asked, pondering whether Biden would accept Warren's #2 spot if the primaries go her way. \"I wouldn't blame him if he passed on it but regardless having him part of some administration in some form or fashion would only benefit the country.\"\u00a0 Sitting in the last row for the Biden speech, Elizabeth Ejarque said, \"I think Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren would be a great team. Wouldn't it be wonderful?\" But Ejarque also had another idea that excited her. \"Wouldn't it be wonderful if Elizabeth Warren picked another woman?\" CORY BOOKER New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who played football at Stanford University, released a\u00a0plan Thursday morning\u00a0to reform college and professional athletics, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Jack Turman. At the collegiate level, Booker's plan would call for the creation of a commission that would address economic justice issues and the health and safety of student athletes.\u00a0 \"For too long, we have allowed exploitative practices in professional and college sports to fester \u2014 somehow treating sports as different from our broader economy,\" Booker said in a statement. \"But sports at these levels is a multi-billion dollar business. Just as we shouldn't accept collusion, wage theft, and a massive gender pay gap in any other industry, we shouldn't accept them in sports.\"\u00a0 Under his plan, student athletes would be able to unionize and profit from the use of their \"name, image, and likeness (NIL) rights.\" Booker also outlines ways to advance pay equity for female athletes and includes labor protections for NBA dancers and NFL cheerleaders. PETE BUTTIGIEG South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg released a\u00a0plan\u00a0Thursday aimed at protecting and advancing LGBTQ+ rights, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Jack Turman. Buttigieg's plan indicates that if elected president, he will sign the Equality Act into law, which he has mentioned on the campaign trail. The plan also aims to expand health care access for every LGBTQ+ person through Buttigieg's major health care proposal, named Medicare for All Who Want It.\u00a0 \"Twenty years ago, an awkward teenager at St. Joe High, who didn't know a single out LGBTQ+ student there, never would have imagined how far we would come,\" Buttigieg said in a statement. \"And yet discrimination and the ever-present fear of it continue to govern aspects of LGBTQ+ people's lives who question if they can be who they are and keep their job, or come out at school knowing they might be bullied for it. When I'm President, we will implement solutions bold enough to meet the challenges the LGBTQ+ community faces while bringing the American people together to understand that our freedoms are bound up in each other.\"\u00a0 Buttigieg's plan includes ending \"conversion therapy\" and ending the blanket ban on blood donations by gay and bisexual men. The plan states that the ban would be replaced with a science-based approach with funds allocated to the Food and Drug Administration. TULSI GABBARD Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard\u00a0tweeted\u00a0a video saying she is \"seriously considering\" boycotting the Democratic debate on October 15th, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Jack Turman. Gabbard, who qualified for the debate, said the DNC and the corporate media are \"rigging\" the election against voters in the four early voting states. \"They're holding so-called debates which really are not debates at all, but rather commercialized reality television meant to entertain, rather than to inform or enlighten,\" she said. Gabbard said she is going to announce her decision over the next few days. KAMALA HARRIS CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim\u00a0Perry\u00a0has learned\u00a0exclusively\u00a0that tonight Sen. Kamala Harris will announce her commitment to establish a chief advocate for LGBTQ+ affairs in the White House.\u00a0 This position would \"ensure a whole of government approach and strategy\" in partnership with the LGBTQIA+ community to address specific issues facing the community.\u00a0 In addition Harris will also commit to appointing LGBTQ+ people to leadership roles including cabinet-level positions and the federal bench.\u00a0 During a recent swing through Iowa, Harris called LGBTQ+ rights \"one of the biggest civil rights fights of our time.\"\u00a0 She will make these announcements tonight during the HRC Town Hall. AMY KLOBUCHAR Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar's campaign announced she'll be doing a three-day bus tour through eastern and central Iowa Friday October 18 through Sunday October 20, according to\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Adam Brewster. \"During her 'For All of America' bus tour, Senator Klobuchar will meet with caucus-goers from all backgrounds - in liberal, conservative and independent parts of Iowa - to make the case that she will be the president to bring our country together and focus on the issues that affect us all,\" Klobuchar's Iowa State Director Lauren Dillon said in a statement.\u00a0 Part of Klobuchar's visit will take her through four Obama/Trump counties in Iowa, including Louisa, Dubuque, Cerro Gordo and Jasper counties. ELIZABETH WARREN Elizabeth Warren's campaign announced Thursday\u00a0two new backers\u00a0in Nevada: Chris Giunchigliani, a former gubernatorial candidate who served as president to both of Nevada's largest teachers unions, and Alex Goff, the state's DNC National Committeeman and a labor activist in northern Nevada. \"I made up my mind for who I was going to caucus for last month or the month before,\" Goff tells\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin, citing the Massachusetts senator's work addressing labor issues.\u00a0 \"Sen. Sanders, I think in 2016, gave a lot of people a different option than Hillary Clinton which was much needed at the time,\" says Goff,\u00a0who had served as\u00a0an alternate delegate for Sanders. \"I decided to go with Elizabeth Warren because I thought her plans were really impressive and she's speaking to the issues that are important,\" adds Goff. IN THE SENATE Kentucky Senate candidate Amy McGrath is amassing an impressive campaign war chest as she faces an uphill challenge to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, reports\u00a0CBS News Political Unit Associate Producer Sarah Ewall-Wice. The retired Marine combat pilot's campaign announced Thursday it raised $10.7 million in the third quarter of 2019. This comes after McGrath\u00a0raised $2.5 million\u00a0in the first 24 hours after announcing her bid in July. The $10.7 million comes from some 299,000 contributions, but it's unclear how much of that cash was donated by Kentucky voters. According to the campaign, the average donation was $36. McGrath previously ran an unsuccessfully House race in 2018, and Cook Political Report currently rates the Kentucky Senate race as likely Republican, but McGrath's massive cash haul signals this will be an expensive race. McGrath even raised more than a number of presidential candidates. \u00a0Neither McGrath or McConnell have filed their third quarter numbers yet with the FEC, but McConnell raised more than $3 million in the second quarter of the year and finished June with more than $7 million cash on hand. Read more about it here, in CBSNews.com political reporter Grace Segers' story.\u00a0 IN THE HOUSE Democratic Congresswoman Nita Lowey, the chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee and an ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi,\u00a0announced\u00a0that she is not running for reelection on Thursday.\u00a0CBSNews.com political reporter Grace Segers\u00a0says Lowey, 82, has served her New York City area district since 1989. \"It is my deep honor and privilege to serve my community and my country, and I will always be grateful to the people of Westchester, Rockland, Queens and the Bronx who have entrusted me to represent them during my tenure in Congress,\" Lowey said in\u00a0a statement.\u00a0 Lowey, the first woman to serve as chair of the Appropriations Committee, was first elected in 1988. She has been a staunch supporter of Pelosi. The New York representative would have faced her first primary challenge since that election in 2020, from 32-year-old Mondaire Jones who planned to run against Lowey from the left.",

            "article_content": "Senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday released an\u00a0attack ad\u00a0aimed Mike Bloomberg that her campaign said would run on the billionaire's own cable television network in the New York City media market. \"Now some people have figured out it'd be a lot cheaper to spend a few hundred mil just trying to buy the presidency than paying that wealth tax,\" the ad shows Warren saying with cuts to video clips of Bloomberg, a former New York mayor.\u00a0 The line has found a consistent place in Warren's stump speech over the past week as Warren has used Bloomberg's largely self-funded presidential run as an example of the unfair role money plays in politics. Warren has embraced attacks from billionaires, even selling a \"billionaire tears\" mug in her online store after investor Leon Cooperman, who also appears in the ad, teared up talking about Warren in a CNBC interview in November. But\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak\u00a0says her attacks on Bloomberg stand out because Warren has generally avoided direct contact when she has gone after fellow Democrats this race.\u00a0 Bloomberg joined the race less than two weeks ago, but Warren has already focused more direct attacks on Bloomberg than any other candidate in the field. As her poll numbers have slipped, however, Warren has shown in recent weeks a new willingness to contrast herself with other candidates, such as South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\u00a0 Warren is slated to appear on Bloomberg TV's Daybreak later this evening.\u00a0 AMY KLOBUCHAR Senator Amy Klobuchar is quickly ramping up her ground game in Iowa with less than two months to go until the first-in-the-nation caucuses. CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Adam Brewster\u00a0say Klobuchar announced the hiring of Norm Sterzenbach as a caucus adviser, one of the most significant hires of a staffer from a now-defunct campaign. Sterzenbach previously served Beto O'Rourke's Iowa State Director and is a veteran Iowa political operative with deep knowledge of the caucuses.\u00a0 In a statement, Sterzenbach said he is thrilled to be joining Klobuchar's campaign. \"Amy Klobuchar has built an impressive grassroots campaign equipped to turn out Iowans of all backgrounds from across the state,\" Sterzenbach said. \"She knows what it takes to win in the Heartland and beat Donald Trump.\" Klobuchar now has more than 60 staffers on the ground in Iowa and after opening five new offices recently, she has 15 field offices across the state. A campaign source says an increase in staff and offices will continue.\u00a0 TRUMP CAMPAIGN Vice President Mike Pence spent Wednesday on a three stop bus tour through Michigan, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. Pence met with Michigan faith leaders at Valley Family Church in Portage, then made a stop at Hope College in Holland to hold a round table with Michigan community leaders before giving remarks at a \"Keep America Great\" rally in Holland.\u00a0 Michigan is one of the states that clinched Mr. Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016, but less than a percentage point of the votes separated the two candidates, making the state a focus point for the campaign in 2020. KAMALA HARRIS California Senator Kamala Harris came to South Carolina on Wednesday for her sixteenth visit since launching her now-suspended campaign. But on this occasion there wasn't a press release to announce her arrival or news outlet cameras crowded onto a press riser. Instead, early backer and outspoken surrogate JA Moore told\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0that it was a \"joyous\" reunion with Harris and her South Carolina team that felt more like an 'I'll see ya soon' than a farewell.\u00a0 \"The word isn't sadness, it's just untapped potential. However you express that emotion is I think, how people felt,\" said Moore, a state representative, when describing the sentiment of the visit. \"I think everybody that was in that room today wholeheartedly believed that Kamala Harris was the only\u2014and continues to be the only person\u2014that could defeat Donald Trump and move the country forward.\"\u00a0 Harris, who had visited the first-in-the-South primary state more than any other Democratic presidential candidate, had hoped that South Carolina would be a lynchpin of sorts for her campaign. From her early days on the trail, CBS News\u00a0reported\u00a0that South Carolina was the first early presidential primary state that she stumped through, just days after announcing her presidential bid. By July, Harris' South Carolina operation had the most paid staffers on the ground of any candidate, and a CBS News Battleground\u00a0tracker\u00a0from the same month had her tied for 3rd place among likely Democratic primary voters in the state.\u00a0 But by\u00a0November, Harris had dropped to 5th and was polling at 5% with Democrats in the state. During Harris' first visit to the state, CBS News reported that she told attendees at an event hosted by her sorority \u2014 Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. \u2014 that her campaign's success would, in part, be successful if it \"energizes and empowers people to actually participate and see themselves in the process.\"\u00a0 Moore said Harris' departure from the field will be a loss of representation for the entire party. \"I think we lost the representation of the heart and soul of the Democratic Party\u2026Kamala Harris was the true representation of the majority of the people\u2014especially here in South Carolina\u2014that will be voting on February 29th,\" said Moore. \"She's a black woman\u2026black women have been the foundation of the Democratic Party for generations now, so that's going to be a huge void.\"\u00a0 NEVADA Nevada's powerful Culinary Union\u00a0has announced\u00a0it will question Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Joe Biden next week in Las Vegas. The labor group says these town halls will be their last such events with White House hopefuls before the new year.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says then-candidate Kamala Harris\u00a0was the first\u00a0to answer questions from the UNITE HERE local's membership, which counts as one of Nevada's\u00a0most hotly-coveted endorsements. Her praise of the\u00a0labor group's health fund\u00a0\u2013 and her pledge to \"not take that away\" \u2013 earned cheers last month. \"What can you do to ensure that we can keep that insurance? Because I like our insurance. Insurance should be a right not a privilege. So I like mine, but everybody else should have insurance,\" Culinary Union member Mario Sandoval, a food server at a Las Vegas casino,\u00a0had asked Harris.\u00a0 SOUTH CAROLINA CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0reports that the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary filing period has closed and the party confirms that Kamala Harris \u2014 who\u00a0suspended\u00a0her campaign Tuesday \u2014 will not be on the state's presidential primary ballot in February, per her team's request.\u00a0 The other person missing from the list of 14 Democratic contenders who will be on the state's ballot is billionaire Mike Bloomberg. When\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0spoke\u00a0with voters last week about Bloomberg's run, one mentioned that he should still visit the state even though he doesn't intend on actively campaigning here.\u00a0 South Carolina Democratic Party chair Trav Robertson says that while the party is \"obviously\" disappointed by Bloomberg's decision not to file, there are 14 other candidates that did and have spent extensive time in the state.\u00a0 \"There's a potential Bloomberg would've brought moderate Republicans into the South Carolina Democratic primary but I'm not going to begrudge a candidate or campaign for making a strategic decision,\" said Robertson. \"He's trying to win a primary and he has strategy and I'm not going to criticize his strategy.\" According to a press release from the SCDP, the state party's executive council will vote to certify the state ballot on Friday and the certified candidates will be submitted to the South Carolina Elections Commission. South Carolina's Democratic primary will take place in 87 days.\u00a0 IN THE SENATE Georgia Governor Brian Kemp officially\u00a0announced\u00a0financial executive Kelly Loeffler as his pick to fill Senator Johnny Isakson's seat after he steps down at the end of the year. Kemp praised Loeffler as a strong conservative who \"like Ivanka Trump\" is a savvy businesswoman and \"like Donald Trump\" is a political outsider, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\u00a0 Kemp has faced criticism from allies of Mr. Trump for not choosing Congressman Doug Collins of Georgia, who has been a vocal defender of the president, especially on Wednesday during the first impeachment hearings before the House Judiciary Committee.\u00a0 Loeffler, who joined Kemp at a press conference Wednesday morning, vowed to support the conservative agenda. \"I haven't spent my life trying to get to Washington. But here's what folks are gonna find out about me: I'm a lifelong conservative. Pro-Second Amendment. Pro-military. Pro-wall. And pro-Trump,\" Loeffler said. \"I make no apologies for my conservative values, and will proudly support President Trump's conservative judges.\" IN THE HOUSE Washington Democrat Denny Heck\u00a0announced Wednesday\u00a0that this term would be his last. The fourth-term Congressman said in his initial announcement, via\u00a0Medium post, the \"countless hours\" spent on the impeachment inquiry and investigating Russian election interference \"rendered my soul weary.\" \"I will never understand how some of my colleagues, in many ways good people, could ignore or deny the President's unrelenting attack on a free press, his vicious character assassination of anyone who disagreed with him, and his demonstrably very distant relationship with the truth,\" he wrote.\u00a0 The Washington Democrat was first elected in 2012, and is the sixth House Democrat so far to announce they'd retire in 2020. Four others have either resigned or are running for higher office. By comparison, more than 20 House Republicans are retiring, running for another office or have resigned. Political analysts are not expecting his western Washington district to be competitive next year. It has been represented by a Democrat since it was created after the 2010 U.S. Census, and\u00a0the Cook Political Report\u00a0says it remains \"Solidly Democratic.\" Meanwhile, California Assemblywoman Christy Smith is racking up Democratic endorsements ahead of her race for Katie Hill's old seat in California's 25th Congressional District. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports that Representative Adam Schiff announced his support for Smith this morning. California Governor Gavin Newsom and Senators Kamala Harris and Dianne Feinstein also recently endorsed Smith.\u00a0 Three other Democrats and six Republicans have filed to run for the seat, including former district Representative Steve Knight and ex-Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos. Hill resigned from Congress last month after admitting to having a romantic relationship with an aide.\u00a0 In Florida, Republican Candidate George Buck was removed from the National Republican Congressional Committee's \"Young Guns\" list after his campaign sent a November fundraising email suggesting Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar should be hanged. The\u00a0Tampa Bay Times reported\u00a0this week that Buck's campaign sent out an email baselessly accusing Omar of working for Qatar and adding \"We should hang these traitors where they stand.\" Similarly, in Omar's own district, Republican challenger Danielle Stella\u00a0got her Twitter account suspended\u00a0for saying Omar should be tried for treason and potentially hanged for working for Qatar,\u00a0an unfounded allegation.\u00a0 Stella is not on the NRCC's \"Young Guns\" list of 2020 candidates. Buck is running to unseat Democrat Charlie Crist in the state's 13th Congressional District.",

            "article_content": "On this \"Face the Nation\" broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan: Click\u00a0here\u00a0to browse full transcripts of \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. This week on FACE THE NATION, friends and family say the President is pumped and energized following his impeachment, but publicly he questions whether he really was impeached, as plans for a Senate trial get bogged down in politics. Congressional Democrats' push for a speedy impeachment came to a screeching halt just moments after the vote was announced. Next stop, the Senate, at least according to the constitution. But the founding fathers had no way of knowing just how partisan politics would become by 2019. Hear Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. MITCH MCCONNELL: In a highly unusual step, speaker of the House continues to hem and haw about whether and when she intends to take the normal next step and transmit the House's accusations over here to the Senate. I'm not sure what leverage there is in refraining from sending us something we do not want. MARGARET BRENNAN: But Speaker Nancy Pelosi wants to know what the Senate trial plan is before she acts. NANCY CORDES: Do you run the risk, as some Republicans have said, of looking like you're playing games with impeachment if you hold on to these articles for too long. NANCY PELOSI: I said what I was going to say, Nancy. We don't know the arena that we are in. Frankly, I don't care what the Republicans say. MARGARET BRENNAN: Adding to the confusion, the President's interpretation of the situation. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: They have nothing. There's no crime. There's no nothing. There's no impeachment. What are we doing here? The world is watching. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll get the latest from two senators, Republican Roy Blunt and Democrat Chris Van Hollen. Then we'll talk with Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar. She's one of five senators running for President and making plans for a lot of round-trip travel between Iowa and Washington next month. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Let me be honest, Ed. Maybe if the impeachment proceeding wasn't there, I would not be doing twenty, whatever it is, twenty-three, seventy-seven counties in three days, but such is life. I am a mom. I can do two things at once. MARGARET BRENNAN: All that and more, is just ahead on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. We begin today on that impasse between the House and the Senate. And there's also one between Republicans and Democrats. Missouri Republican Senator Roy Blunt is here, as is Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. Good morning to both of you, gentlemen. Senator Blunt, first off to you. Do you agree with the President's declaration that he hasn't actually been impeached? SENATOR ROY BLUNT (R-Missouri/@RoyBlunt/Intelligence Committee): Well, I-- I've actually heard some constitutional scholars suggest you're not impeached until the House sends the articles over. I don't know that it's a distinction worth arguing about. The House will send the articles over. We are going to hear this case both from the House managers and the President's counsel. I-- I would argue with the President's counsel for the first time, they get a chance to make their case. And I believe we'll be doing that in January. MARGARET BRENNAN: So there's no question for you that Speaker Pelosi will transfer these articles? SENATOR ROY BLUNT: You know I-- I actually think this is a mistake for the speaker to continue to dwell on this issue. I don't think it's worked out that well for them politically. I actually don't think the speaker, who has great power in a lot of cases, has the power to decide not to send over-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --determined will of the House of Representatives. They have voted. They have voted on two articles. They need to come and defend those two articles. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, back during the Clinton impeachment trial, Republican and Democratic leaders sat together and planned out in a bipartisan way how the trial would take place. Why can't that happen this time? SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Well, you know, I think we-- because of that, we have the-- the-- the plan out before us that worked before. It probably wasn't quite as easily achieved last time as it seems like it was but it seemed to work last time. And my guess is, eventually, that's the plan we pursue. That we start, that we let the-- the House managers have the time they need to present their case against the President. And the President has that-- his-- his counsel has the time they need to present the reason they don't think that case adds up and then we see what happens next. MARGARET BRENNAN: So why can't you commit now, then to calling witnesses? What you're suggesting is that there would then be a vote-- SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: --on whether to approve having witnesses. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Which is what happened last time.  MARGARET BRENNAN: This time Democrats are arguing the trial needs to be fair, and that includes the certainty of hearing from witnesses. How can you have a credible trial without that? SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Well, every one of the Democrats that were in the Senate the last time that are here now voted against witnesses the last time. So this is-- you know, this is a political process, no matter how you describe it. You can call it a trial, but it's a trial where half of the jurors can decide that the chief justice is wrong-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --and we're going to go in a different direction. It is-- it's a political process. It always has been. It always will be. One of my concerns, Margaret, is that in a hundred-- the first hundred and eighty years of the history of the country, we went to presidential impeachment exactly one time. And here in the last forty-six years we've gone to it three times and never with a result that removed a President-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --because of the impeachment itself. And I-- I think it's a mistake to take this lightly or to act like you can send a half-baked case over to the Senate. And then it's the Senate's job to try to figure out how to do what you didn't do. MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you-- SENATOR ROY BLUNT: There is nobody the Senate could call-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --that the House couldn't call. There is no privilege. That the Senate-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But there is a Republican majority in the Senate. And-- SENATOR ROY BLUNT: And? MARGARET BRENNAN: --this is where the President has argued he wants to hear his case and get a fair shake. He complained about not getting in the House-- SENATOR ROY BLUNT: And we want to hear his case-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So-- but-- but-- he-- SENATOR ROY BLUNT: But I think what you don't want to do-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --wants witnesses. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: What you don't want to do-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you persuaded the President not to push for that any longer? SENATOR ROY BLUNT: I don't know that the President's persuaded not to push for that. And there may be a time when we decide that witnesses are essential but the witnesses that the House didn't call would have the same privilege in the Senate that they had in the House. I think the House sending over a very vague two charges to the Senate and then assuming it's the Senate's job to try to make something out of that, takes a process we're already taking too lightly, impeachment--three times in forty-six years-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --and taking it even more lightly. The-- the world we live in now is more certain, more likely than not, that a President will always have a House, at some point in their presidency-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --controlled by the other party, a majority of that-- of the other party can send articles of impeachment over. I think we need to be sure that we set a standard where they have to make sense before they are sent over, not leave it up to the Senate to try to make sense out of a case that the House says they clearly made. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: And now they say, well, we clearly made this case with absolute certainty, but now we need to have the Senate find more information. MARGARET BRENNAN: Your former Republican colleague Jeff Flake put out an op-ed where he wrote this as an open letter to senators like yourself, saying, essentially, the entire body is on trial, not just the President. And you said, don't be complicit. Quote, \"You might also determine that the President's actions do not rise to the constitutional standard required for removal. But what is indefensible is echoing House Republicans who say the President has not done anything wrong. He has.\" Does Roy Blunt, potential juror, believe that the President's phone call was perfect? SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Well, I think the people that listened to it that should know and hear a lot of these calls have generally said there was nothing wrong with the call. MARGARET BRENNAN: But what do you believe? SENATOR ROY BLUNT: But I think that's not-- here-- here's what I believe from Jeff Flake's letter, or Jeff Flake's editorial. He also said, \"Would you reach the same conclusion if Barack Obama had done exactly the same thing?\" And the answer is, \"Yes, I would reach the same conclusion.\" We were constantly asked for eight years-- MARGARET BRENNAN: If Barack Obama, on a phone call with another world leader, suggested an investigation into someone who also happened to be the frontrunner from the opposing party, you would be-- your party, you would be fine with that? SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Well, I will tell you that for eight years we were constantly challenged on my side. The President should be impeached for this, the President should be impeached for withholding records with Fast and Furious; the President should have delivered-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: --the-- the-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But on this particular parallel. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Yeah. Let me-- let me make my point here. And-- and I resisted that. And I understand what our Democrat friends have heard for three years now on this topic, because we heard it for eight years. One of the articles of impeachment is the President resisted giving information to the Congress, which is exactly what President Obama did. It's what President Clinton did. It's what President Bush did. Every President's done that. I-- I wouldn't have been for impeaching any of them, for asserting their privilege to make you go to court to prove that you really needed the information the President had. That's one-- that's one half of the cases of impeachment right there. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blunt, thank you very much for your time. SENATOR ROY BLUNT: Great to be with you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we now turn to the other side of the table, literally and figuratively. Maryland Democratic Senator, Chris Van Hollen. Good to have you here. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-Maryland/@ChrisVanHollen): It's good to be with you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: You just heard Senator Blunt lay out his position. You are one of the first senators to publicly float at least this idea that the speaker hold on to those articles and not immediately transfer them. Can you explain the strategy? What do you-- what is this leverage? SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Sure. Absolutely. And, first, just to be clear, the-- the conduct we're talking about from President Trump has no parallel in the conduct of anything that President Obama or President Bush did. And his claim of absolute immunity is unprecedented. No president's ever claimed that. So Speaker Pelosi is doing exactly the right thing. She is focusing a spotlight on the need to have a fair trial in the United States Senate. And it's especially necessary when you have Mitch McConnell, Senator McConnell, who you quoted earlier, saying publicly that he's not going to be an impartial juror-- MARGARET BREBNNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: --even though, that's what the oath will require, that he's going to work in lockstep with the President, who's the defendant in this case, and that he's already said no to calling fact witnesses that have direct knowledge of what's at stake in this impeachment. MARGARET BREBNNAN: So you're trying to divide the Republican caucus over these two weeks? SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: We're-- we're trying to engage, first of all, the public in a conversation, because almost every American would agree that to have a fair trial you need to have witnesses. I mean what's a trial without each side being able to call their witnesses? And, yes, they're going to be a number of Republican senators who are going to have to decide on whether or not to call these witnesses. And after all, as you indicated, President Trump says he wants witnesses. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Now, I don't know if he's trash-talking or not, but let's have some witnesses. If it was such a perfect phone call, then send on Mick Mulvaney down to talk about that perfect phone call. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Send down John Bolton. What are they afraid of? MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Democrats will get on board with what Senator Blunt laid out, which is that the, quote, unquote, \"Clinton model of having debate, then voting on witnesses?\" SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I think Democrats want assurances upfront that this is going to be a fair trial and that you're going to be able to call witnesses. There were witnesses called in all the prior trials, most recently, the-- the Clinton impeachment, and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is Speaker Pelosi in lockstep with Schumer on that one, that the articles won't be transferred until there is a promise of witnesses? SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Look, I think we have to take this day by day. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I think what Speaker Pelosi is doing is focusing attention on the need for a fair trial, and a fair trial means you get to call your witnesses. Every American knows that that's what a trial is all about. How can it be a fair trial if you can't put on the rest of your case? There's over-- already over-- MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you haven't decided how you will vote-- SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: There's overwhelming evidence-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --as a juror yourself? SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I will wait to hear all the evidence. MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I think that the House has made a very strong case for impeachment, but I will reserve final judgment until all the evidence is-- is in. The President says he wants to put forward his case. I don't know why, you know, others aren't saying, okay-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: --Mister President, send down your witnesses. That's what we want. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, for people at home, though, they-- they see and hear the math on this that it takes sixty-seven votes to actually remove--eject the President from office. And it is incredibly unlikely that those votes will exist, right, at this point, looking at the math as it stands. So given all that, what is the purpose of the standoff over how the trial is conducted, if you know the outcome? SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the reason that Republicans are so deathly afraid of sending down these fact witnesses is because after they testify under oath they'll have to raise their right hand, just like all the witnesses in the House did, and testify under penalty of perjury--it's going to be much harder for Republicans to hide behind this myth that this was a perfect phone call. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: And it will make it harder for those senators to vote for a quit-- acquittal. And that is why they're so afraid of having witnesses called. I mean why else? Why-- why wouldn't you send your witnesses down to-- to tell the truth under penalty of perjury? MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to also ask you about something you were working on that was tucked inside a-- a bill that the President just signed off on. And this includes giving him more abilities to put different kind of sanctions on North Korea. We know U.S. intelligence is watching and preparing for the possibility of an upcoming long-range missile test by North Korea. Do you believe the President will actually use the sanctions you gave him the authority or is this-- so, I mean you have no way to force the hand here? SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, we need to tighten the sanctions regime on North Korea. The United Nations has documented the fact that it's kind of like Swiss cheese. There's a lot of leakage in this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: And so this legislation will require the President to put in secondary sanctions. So if you're a company, you're a bank in China-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: --you will now face U.S. sanctions if you keep doing business with North Korea. He's required to do that in a hundred twenty days. Now, he can exercise a national security waiver. We have said on a bipartisan basis it would be totally wrong to use those waivers and let North Korea off the hook unless you can show us measurable progress toward reaching our goal of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. The time for photo op summits is over. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: It's time to be serious and let the North Koreans know that we're going to tighten these sanctions. MARGARET BRENNAN: And what we know is to date the diplomacy has not resulted-- SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: That's right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: --in any of what you just laid out as a premise for suspending or not enacting these sanctions. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think, basically, it is inevitable that these new sanctions are going on North Korea in the next few weeks? SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes, I do. I think within a hundred and twenty days these will be imposed on North Korea and we're-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the question is if they carry out long-range missile tests, we don't know what the Trump administration will do other than go to the United Nations. Do you think that this time clock on diplomacy is ticking? SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Look, the clock is clearly ticking right now. It's been ticking for some time now. You have North Korea now engaged in their saber rattling once again, as-- as has been the case from the beginning, we need to engage China. During this period where we've had these summits with North Korea, the President has, essentially, allowed China to go ahead-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: --and allow trade to go back and forth between China and North Korea and-- and Chinese banks. So this will put an end to that. It will tighten the sanctions. And I think that's necessary in order to really get a serious negotiation at the negotiating table. If I could just-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: --really briefly say-- MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to-- SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: --with respect to the-- the trial. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: If it's not fair, there's going to be no way that Trump's-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: --going to be able to go around and say he's exonerated. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll have plenty of debate over what fair means in the rest of the show-- SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks to both of you, Senators. SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be back in one minute with another Democrat, Senator Amy Klobuchar from Iowa. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) WOMAN: The Senator from Minnesota, Amy Klobuchar. RACHEL DRATCH: Hair is glued girlfriend. And tonight my voice will be as solid as my carefully rehearsed Midwestern mom jokes. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know we're coming up on a presidential election year when Saturday Night Live starts their show with a primary debate. Right now the real Senator Amy Klobuchar joins us from Council Bluffs, Iowa. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minnesota/@amyklobuchar/2020 Democratic Presidential Candidate): Good morning, Margaret. I think Rachel Dratch does a pretty good job of playing me, I enjoy it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you came out swinging at this last debate. You got a lot of attention. Do you think this is a more aggressive but still moderate Amy Klobuchar? SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I have been the same since the very beginning when I announced my candidacy in the middle of that blizzard in the Mississippi River. I think it's really clear we need someone leading this ticket who's going to bring people with them instead of shutting them out. And the point I made in the debate is that I have been consistent in my views. I have passed over a hundred bills in the United States Senate during a really difficult time. And I have won in the reddest of red districts and won with suburban and rural voters and Republicans and independents and a fired up Democratic base. I think that's a good case-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: --to be made. And I think the other thing I did in this debate was just make the case of how I want to be the one debating Donald Trump. And I think it is more than just the nitty-gritty of policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: It's also a value statement because so many people want a values check on this President. They want someone who gives them a decency check, a patriotism check. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well-- well, and-- and there is the very real check that you as a senator may have to deliver in this impending Senate trial to continue the impeachment process. But you've said your campaign's not going to get in the way of your job as a senator. You can't be in two places at once, though. And Iowa is really make it or break it. How is the impeachment trial going to impact your campaign? SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, look at what I've just done. I finished that L.A. debate. We had a little after party, got up at 4:00 AM, did the shows, got to Iowa, went on a bus tour. And we've already done fifteen counties in a day and a half, ending last night at midnight and had record crowds at every little town that we went to. That's how I am going to do it. I don't need a lot of sleep. I work really hard. And I also have endorsements of more electeds and former electeds than anyone in this race, in this primary field. So we're going to have-- in the state of Iowa, so we are going to have so many people showing up to help me if I'm doing my constitutional duty, which comes first as a U.S. senator. And my husband was just in Nevada. My daughter, I've got the governor and lieutenant governor of Minnesota. Everyone's volunteered to help out because they get that we're going to need some help and I'll have to Skype in for town hall meetings. There is modern technology. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I think we're going to find a way to do this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, skyping in for a campaign, that's-- that's an interesting choice because of what you're juggling here. But is-- is your campaign going to ask the DNC to reschedule the upcoming debate? It could fall right in the middle of that trial. SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, my first belief is we have to have the debate. And if for some reason it doesn't work, sometimes there's breaks in the trial and even when you looked at past impeachment trials, there were breaks in the day so we could get there. If that day doesn't work, there's plenty of other days. We know we don't have Sundays when we are doing this and there's going to be other days after that. We may just have to have the debate closer to the Iowa caucuses. But we have to have an Iowa debate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that being discussed right now? SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I don't know I have made it very clear that there should be no excuses. I am ready to debate at midnight if that's what we have to do. We have to have a debate before the Iowa caucuses. That would be to my advantage if it was at midnight. I'd be happy.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Schumer has asked Leader McConnell to allow witnesses at this upcoming trial. And we know the decision on what the-- the outlines of this are going to look like are still an open question. How do Democrats force witnesses to be allowed, people like Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Pompeo? SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, some of this is going on right now where Speaker Pelosi is trying to get some sense from the majority leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, about what's happening, and I know Senator Schumer had a meeting with him. I'm not sure it went that well. But, in the end, Mitch McConnell is going to think about it over the holidays. Look at what we're dealing with. I couldn't believe the number of people that came up to me about this. First, they were focused, of course, on the investigation and the impeachment, but now they're saying, why wouldn't we have witnesses at a trial? You know they're thinking like law and order. The first half, there's an investigation and then you have a trial. And if the President is so innocent and claims he's innocent, why would he not allow, just like Richard Nixon did, the people that were closest to him to testify? And I think we have some-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Is-- is that the-- SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: --pretty shocking news, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is that the Democratic strategy to take these two weeks of break, to put pressure on the Republican caucus to-- to back away and allow witnesses? SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I think it-- it's not a strategy it is a fact. It is a, you can't have a trial if you don't have the key witnesses. You can at least have a thorough trial. Look at what we just learned on Friday from a document request. And that's-- it's this guy named Michael Duffy, who worked for Mick Mulvaney over at OMB. He's the one that sent the e-mail to a bunch of people and said to withhold the aid to Ukraine. He sent this e-mail, I have it in my hand, ninety minutes after the President of the United States talked to president of Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: And this is what he says: he says, \"Given the sensitive nature of the request, I appreciate your keeping the information closely held to those who need to know. What does that mean? What a great question. That's a question I want to have answered. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the way aid was on hold-- SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: So if you don't allow-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --before that date, though. What do you think that shows you? SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But the point is why did he send this e-mail just ninety minutes after the President made this call? Why would this e-mail go? If the President is so innocent and shouldn't be impeached, why is he afraid to have these people come forward? That's what people are asking me when I am at these town hall meetings. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Klobuchar, thank you. And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: The news this year has for the most part revolved around divisions between the two parties. Next week we'll take a look at the spirit of bipartisanship and the good that can be accomplished when political foes work together. We'll talk with Democratic Senator Chris Coons and Republican Senator James Lankford, and then a conversation with adviser to the President, Ivanka Trump. That's next week on FACE THE NATION. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including a look at a scathing rebuke of President Trump from the evangelical community. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. Joining us now is Mark Galli. He's editor in chief of the evangelical magazine Christianity Today. He called for President Trump to be removed from office, raising questions about whether evangelical support remains rock solid. And he joins us now from Chicago. Mister Galli, as you know, your editorial has gotten a lot of attention. And I want to highlight some of what you said here. You argue that evangelicals, like yourself, may like the President's platform, but you think he's grossly immoral. You described him as a near-perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused. He's abused his authority for personal gain, betrayed his constitutional oath. Other members of the evangelical community, including Billy Graham, your founder's grandson--or son, have-- have denounced this. MARK GALLI (Editor in Chief, Christianity Today/@markgalli): Yeah, that would be Franklin Graham, yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, Billy-- right. Billy Graham founded, as we point out here, your publication, which is why it was so significant to have Franklin Graham rebuke you. Is the call for President Trump's removal growing? MARK GALLI: I don't know, I mean, in one sense, my-- my call for his removal was on the order of hyperbole in this regard. The odds of that happening either by election or Senate are actually probably fairly slim at this point. What I am really arguing in the piece, fundamentally, is that the President is unfit for office. Now, there is-- that may be a difference without-- a distinction without a difference. But the point is and I'm not really speaking politically--making a political judgment about him, because that's not our expertise at Christianity Today. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARK GALLI: I am making a moral judgment that he is morally unfit, all right or, even more precisely, it's his public morality that makes him unfit because all of us, anybody in leadership has--none of us are perfect. We're not looking for saints. We do have private sins, ongoing patterns of behavior that reveal themselves in our-- in our private life that we're all trying to work on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARK GALLI: But a President has certain responsibilities as a public figure to display a certain level of public character and public morality. And my-- the point of my argue-- argument is not to judge him as a person in the-- in the-- in the eyes of God. That's not my job. But to judge his moral-- his public moral character and-- and ask, has he gone so far that the evangelical constituency that we represent, can we in good conscience do the tradeoff anymore? MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MARK GALLI: He gives us what we need on pro-life, but he's got this bad character. And my-- the fundamental argument I am making is we crossed a line somewhere in the impeachment hearings, at least in my mind, that no long-- that-- that balance no longer works. We're dealing with a person who we-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But when I-- when I raise these questions often to Republicans who consider themselves people of faith, what they say is God picks imperfect vessels, right? And that the transaction here is that he is delivering on those platform issues. Is it solely the abortion policy that keeps the evangelical community cemented in their support? Because our polling shows that-- that you, Sir, are an outlier. Seventy-nine percent of white evangelicals say President Trump is doing a good job as President. MARK GALLI: Yeah. I think the-- a-- the pro-life issue is just one of many. Religious freedom for Christians, overseas especially, would be another. You know there-- there have been books written about what's going on with the conservative evangelical support of Trump. So that's not something we can quite get into here. It does go fairly deep. I think what I am mostly concerned with is the fact that it's like-- like you've mentioned a previous guest, it's the unwillingness of my brothers and sisters in Christ. Again, I'm not-- I have no animus against them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARK GALLI: But it strikes me as strange that a-- for a people who take the word-- the teachings of Jesus Christ seriously, the teachings of the Ten Commandments seriously, that we can't at least say publicly and out loud in front of God and everybody, that this man's character is deeply, deeply concerning to us. And, in my judgment, has-- has crossed a line, and I no longer think he's fit to lead the United States of America. And I don't say that politically. I mean my job, our job as Christians, is to love our neighbor. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MARK GALLI: We want the-- we want the United States, everybody: left, right, black, white, of every variety of sexualities, we want them to prosper. And I'm saying that given the moral character, the public moral character of our President, that's not going to happen. It's-- it's likely to degenerate very radically over the next-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. MARK GALLI: --if-- it has already degenerated. And it's time for us to put a stake in the ground and say no more. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you see the next election as sort of a referendum on the moral fiber of this country? MARK GALLI: Well, I don't know that I would put it that way. I am-- I am saying to my evangelical brothers and sisters, take your interest in politics and put it aside for a moment and let's start thinking about morality, and do you really think that there is a balance to-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But if there's no other Republican running on these platform issues, if President Trump is the only person that on these issues you have laid out is so key to your community. Some Republicans just find it an impossible alternative to vote for a Democrat. MARK GALLI: Yeah. No, I-- I grant that. I grant that. Here, I'm saying what I think and I-- about the only person I represent is me and maybe my magazine, not for that much longer since I am retiring in a few days. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. MARK GALLI: You know what you do about the fact that he is morally unfit, there are a lot of political options for that. And I-- I don't really have a whole lot to say. Some are going to say work for his conviction at the Senate, some are going to say overturn him at the election. Others are saying that's all impossible we would need to figure out a third strategy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. MARK GALLI: I don't have a strategy. I'm not a pol-- pol-- political person. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MARK GALLI: You-- the questions you are asking people on your show, you guys are amazing how much stuff you know, and the nuances, you guys figure that out. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you are, of course, an influential voice within the evangelical community, as is your publication. So we wanted to get you to weigh in. Thank you very much for your time, Sir. MARK GALLI: Thank you for the time. I appreciate it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Our political panelists are on their way in. So don't go away. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with some analysis from our political panel. David Sanger is the national security correspondent and a senior writer for The New York Times, Seung Min Kim covers the White House from Capitol Hill for The Washington Post, Jamelle Bouie is a CBS News political analyst and a columnist with The New York Times, and Ramesh Ponnuru is a senior editor at the National Review and a columnist at Bloomberg Opinion. Ramesh, I want to start with you to pick up where we left-- left off with the Christianity Today editorial. And this quandary that's laid out of judging the President of the United States as someone who should be a moral leader, something that was talked about quite a lot during the Clinton impeachment as a failing of that President. Why aren't Republicans openly talking about this? I mean this editorial that was written caused a firestorm. I mean it really got a lot of attention. Why is this new that it's being talked about by Republicans? RAMESH PONNURU (National Review/@RameshPonnuru/ Bloomberg Opinion): Well, in some ways, we've been talking about nothing but the President's character for three years now and not just evangelicals, not just conservatives but all of us that in a way it's the central issue in American politics. And that's normal. MARGARET BRENNAN: Not many op-eds calling for his removal from office. RAMESH PONNURU: But that's-- that-- that's right. So we now have, of course, this impeachment controversy which has raised the stakes on the entire arguments. And there has been a huge evolution in these views. Evangelicals as late as 2011 in polling, white-- white evangelical Christians were saying the President's character is important; the President without sound character can't be a good President. That has completely changed over time. And we're now in a position-- we're now in a situation where the parties are so polarized around this particular person. People are switching parties on the basis of whether they support this person, not on the basis of any particular view, right? We've seen that in the Congress. We've seen that with Justin Amash, we've seen that with Jeff Van Drew. Van-- Amash leaving the Republican Party, Van Drew coming to the Republican Party just solely on the basis of what they think about President Trump. That is the number-one polarizing issue now. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, Jamelle, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend and-- and 2020 candidate, talked about this a little bit. And he has incorporated more sort of discussion of morality and religion in his own-- JAMELLE BOUIE (The New York Times/@jbouie/CBS News Political Analyst): Yep. MARGARET BRENNAN: --campaign rhetoric. Are-- are Democrats seeing an opportunity here because even Mark Galli said I don't know what to tell people to do politically in terms of, you know, this moral quandary? JAMELLE BOUIE: Vice President or former Vice President Joe Biden has made this, kind of, the central point of his campaign that he is running to restore dignity to the White House, right, to restore a sense of normalcy and also to get someone out who he views as immoral. And I think some Democrats, especially the more moderate candidates who are not trying to outbid each other with policy proposals, are-- are probably going to take this line more and more. I want to make one comment about, sort of, the relationship between Trump and white evangelicals. I think one thing that's important to note in this conversation is not just a sea change in opinion about how, what evangelicals view political leadership, but and this is detailed in the great book called The End of White Christian America\" by the Public Religion Research Institute's Robert Jones, that over the past five years, white evangelicals have come to see their position in society embattled, right, they have come to see themselves as being on the losing end of a culture war, on the losing end of a political change, a demographic change. And so in that context, President Trump may be vulgar and immoral, but he appears to be at least a defender of their perceived religious and ethnic interests if you're going to think of white evangelicalism as being sort of, like, not an ethnicity but sort like a national group, a kind of distinct demographic group within the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm. Seung Min, I mean New York Times did a very long read on fear and loyalty in the Republican Party. And it was acknowledging that there are these, sort of, private conversations that I'm sure you've been part of-- SEUNG MIN KIM (Washington Post/@seungminkim): Mm-Hm. MARGARET BRENNAN: --as I have I, of-- of dissatisfaction but fear of speaking out. And it plays off this same idea. SEUNG MIN KIM: It does because you've seen what happens to the Republican officials when they do speak out, Jeff Flake, the former Arizona senator, Bob Corker, the former Tennessee senator. I mean there is a reason why they are former United States senators, particularly, for Jeff flake when he was one of the most vocal critics of-- of President Trump and his conduct and his policies. His polling numbers just cratered and he knew he could not run for reelection again as a Republican without that base of support in his party. What-- what's going on now, the-- the President has such a lock on his party with-- and you talk to, I-- I believe Patrick Mc-- McHenry was also quoted in that article as saying he has this loyalty among the voters, which is why you've seen also Republican lawmakers take different political stances, too, on policy issues that they may not have had at other times. You've seen the Republican Party evolve on the issue of trade under Trump and Trumpism, if you will-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SEUNG MIN KIM: --on foreign policy. And I think a big question that we will be examining for years to come is whether Trumpism is kind of a blip on the radar of the history-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SEUNG MIN KIM: --of the Republican Party or if it's really fundamentally changing. MARGARET BRENNAN: David, one of the things that's unique to Trumpism is his approach on foreign policy and that he's been fine with breaking from China because it's necessary on this impossible challenge with North Korea. He'd take a meeting with Kim Jong-un, and virtually no other President would consider doing it, certainly, none in the best. He's now at this point where his centerpiece foreign policy issue is going to be tested in the coming days. What do you know about what North Korea is planning? DAVID SANGER (The New York Times/@SangerNY): Well, we don't know a whole lot of about what they're planning, but we know a lot about what they've made and we a lot about what it is that they're saying. What they've made is probably eight to ten new nuclear weapons or at least the fuel for those nuclear weapons in the eighteen months since the President had the signature trip. And, by the way, the signature trip, as you and I've discussed before, was a pretty brilliant idea to have a summit between these two leaders that had never happened before since the end of the Korean War. The problem is the President didn't prepare, and he didn't really have a plan for what he would do if Kim basically used this to play for time-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is what-- DAVID SANGER: --and that's exactly what had happened. MARGARET BRENNAN: --which is what has happened. And now we know that U.S. officials, they tell me, I know they tell you, they're taking this threat of ending the diplomacy seriously. They're hoping Kim Jong-un's year-end deadline isn't real. DAVID SANGER: You know what's surprising to me is that there really isn't a Plan B. I was talking to White House officials, intelligence officials for a big piece we have in-- in the Times today, and previous Presidents, George Bush, certainly President Obama, had considered plans to take out an ICBM on the pad. President Obama executed a-- a cyber operation against North Korea's missiles before they launched. It was only partially successful at best. But I don't see a whole lot of interest in the Trump administration in doing anything other than waiting for this to happen and then going to the United Nations. Well-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DAVID SANGER: --that's back to the same approach that the President used to complain was the failed policy of Obama, Bush, and-- and-- and others. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. And Seung Min, one of the things we talked about Senator Van Hollen is the idea that Congress is trying to give a few more tools here. There are a lot of things tucked into that NDAA the President just signed. What else do we need to know of? Because the perception in a lot of the country is that nothing happened in U.S. Congress other than impeachment but the President just signed a whole lot of things in the past twenty-four hours. SEUNG MIN KIM: He did. If you look-- if you set aside impeachment, which is very difficult to do, the President on the policy front actually had a pretty good couple of weeks. He got his long-desired space force, the sixth branch of the military. He-- he accomplished a major initiative that went a lot against Republican orthodoxy, which is the paid federal-- or paid family leave or parental leave for federal workers. He has a massive trade deal that had the support of Democrats and got the support of the AFL-CIO on board and it will get ratified by large margins in the Congress. But I think with all the political oxygen going towards impeachment, it's-- it is difficult for the President and his advisers to talk about his accomplishments. And you do see the President at campaign rallies and at other events try to talk up what he's done for the economy, what he's done on policy front. But it all goes back to this question of impeachment. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SEUNG MIN KIM: He is focused on it. He is obsessed with it. He is clamoring for that Senate trial so he could, in his view, perhaps exonerate himself. And that's going to be such a focus and it's going to be hard for the other policy messages to break out in the next couple of weeks. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a quick break here. And we'll take a break. Be back more with our panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We are back now with more from our political panel. As you can hear, I've got a little bit of a Christmas cold, too. Ramesh, one of the things that got a lot of attention besides impeachment this week, and it takes a lot to break through that news cycle, is what the President said at his rally in Michigan right after the impeachment vote when he, not for the first time, spoke ill of the dead, specifically this time John Dingell, the former congressman whose wife is a sitting congresswoman, Debbie Dingell. And he suggested that he was not in heaven looking down but looking up from hell, and mentioned a lack of perhaps thankfulness on behalf of his widow for the fact he flew flags at half-staff following his death of the longest-serving congressman. This-- this did get some attention, but is this another John McCain moment? I mean has this just become understood as this is the way President Trump will continue to be? RAMESH PONNURU: Well, the President's supporters sometimes laud the fact that he is willing to fight, and he seems most eager to fight with people who are dead and can't fight back. And whether that marks him as a strong leader is I suppose going to be a matter of opinion. But one of the reasons the President's numbers have been so much worse than the strong economy would suggest is precisely because of events like this in which he continually reveals a character that some people like but that most Americans recoil from. JAMELLE BOUIE: A separate thing about that event is that President Trump said, you know, Representative Dingell should be thankful that I flew the flags at half-mast. And that reflects, I think, something we've seen throughout this presidency, which is that the President doesn't-- is not able to be able to separate himself the person from the office of the presidency. And so it's not that a-- a lawmaker passes away and the country flies its flags at half-mast because of respects from between mutual institutions, but that's the way we do things, but because President Trump has personally said we're going to do this. SEUNG MIN KIM: And transactional. JAMELLE BOUIE: And transactional, right. That he cannot seem to-- and I think this-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. JAMELLE BOUIE: --plays into impeachment, right? Like, he-- he-- he seems in some regards genuinely bewildered by it all because for him it seems whatever he does, because he does it as the President-- President and the presidency is merged in his person, cannot really be wrong, right, it can't be some sort of offense. And so when he's challenged on it, when he's held accountable for it, it's not a sort of-- the reaction isn't, I guess, I shouldn't have done that, it's a genuine kind of, what does it even mean for me to have offended anything. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the President said just yesterday, well, what does it mean, because now he's claiming that he wasn't actually impeached, because Speaker Pelosi hasn't gone through the process of transferring the articles from the House to the Senate. You heard two Democrats explain some strategy there. What is the reality? SEUNG MIN KIM: Well, isn't the phrase if you're explaining, you're losing? So sometimes it's-- it has-- we've all kind of scratched our heads a little bit as to this latest tactic from Democrats, because it has been a little bit hard to explain. The-- one of the arguments that they're giving is that they're trying to exert more leverage to shape the Senate trial in terms-- in terms that they find favorable, especially as McConnell has been out there saying he's in very close coordination with the White House. When McConnell and Republicans have pointed out, so you're trying to get more leverage out of us by withholding something that we don't even want anyway, so, okay, go ahead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SEUNG MIN KIM: But some of the other-- some of the other explanations could be that they're trying to buy more time to make a public case that the Republicans are trying to do a sham trials and trying to build that public pressure on Republican senators to perhaps allow witnesses, allow the subpoenaing of documents. And also the other explanation that I have been told is to try and drive President Trump crazy in-- in hopes of maybe driving, you know, kind of working him up a little bit and then maybe having Trump pressure McConnell to get the trial going right away on his-- no matter terms, because we know for some time that the President has been really looking to the Senate trial, not only for an acquittal, but an exoneration. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SEUNG MIN KIM: And we've seen kind of the little pockets of irritation come out from President Trump recent days. Senator Lindsey Graham met with him on Thursday night, and he told reporters that Trump is, quote, \"mad as hell,\" that Pelosi is denying him the Senate-- this prom Senate trial. He complained at a rally last night that-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. SEUNG MIN KIM: --it was so unfair that Pelosi was doing this. So, clearly, what the speaker is doing is getting under the President's skin right now, but how that actually shapes how the Senate trial is going to be-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEUNG MIN KIM: --is very yet to be seen. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, David, we-- we heard from kind of not someone you would expect as a defender of the President in terms of helpful messaging, but Vladimir Putin himself at a year-end press conference echoed a lot of the very same talking points that Republicans say when it comes to characterizing this entire basis of impeachment. This is about Democrats trying to overturn the 2016 election, that this is all a political sham. DAVID SANGER: The most remarkable part about this was the President then tweeted out Vladimir Putin's statement on his own-- MARGARET BRENNAN: I know. DAVID SANGER: --Twitter feed, right? When was the last time you saw a President seeking the endorsement of an authoritarian running a-- a country that is the most significant adversary to the United States? MARGARET BRENNAN: Who he suggested and-- and alleged to have ever, you know, to have some odd relationship with. He seems to endorse it by, again, tweeting it. DAVID SANGER: That-- that's absolutely right. And then at the same time, you know, opposing in twenty-- in a twenty-two-page letter a bill that's going through the Senate right now, sponsored by Lindsey Graham that would put additional sanctions on Russia. So even in the midst of impeachment, they had-- they were tone deaf enough to basically oppose further sanctions. And, you know, this may get to the authoritarian issue that you were just discussing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DAVID SANGER: Because if the President's having a hard time separating himself from the office, it may be in part because the leaders around the world that he admires the most don't separate themselves from the office, right? JAMELLE BOUIE: Right. DAVID SANGER: Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Erdogan of Turkey, who he talks to a lot-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. DAVID SANGER: --all of them, the word of the President is basically goes unchallenged or you face a significant penalty. And that's pretty remarkable.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. DAVID SANGER: And that tells you a lot about how the President envisions the job. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. DAVID SANGER: And to many people, the concern is-- MARGARET BRENNAN: We got to-- DAVID SANGER: --what happens if he then survives this and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's-- DAVID SANGER: --use that more. Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that's a topic for a whole other panel. DAVID SANGER: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to leave it there, David. And we will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us. Thank you for watching. And we want to wish our viewers happy Hanukkah, which starts tonight and a very merry Christmas.

            "article_content": "Presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke made his name as a national Democrat in Texas last year when he nearly unseated Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. In an interview on \"60 Minutes\" days before the election, O'Rourke insisted he would not run for president in 2020. \"I don't wanna do it. I will not do it. Amy and I are raisin' an 11-year-old, a 10-year-old and a 7-year-old. And we spent the better part of the last two years not with each other, missing birthdays and anniversaries and time together. And we \u2013 we \u2013 our \u2013 our family could not survive more of that. We \u2013 we need to be together,\" O'Rourke told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Jon Wertheim. \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King asked O'Rourke about the shift, noting, \"I know everybody has a right to change their mind.\"  \"What changed for you and the family?\" King asked.  \"After the campaign that we ran for Texas and after election night, the best decision was made by my wife, Amy, where she said, 'There are lots of people who are talkin' about us doin' lots of different things. Let's instead of trying to figure that out right now, just spend some time as a family' \u2026 That's really what we did,\" O'Rourke said, adding, \"We were able to see just how resilient and strong our kids were. And as Amy and I came closer to making this decision, we didn't have a sit-down conversation with our kids. They just voluntary started offering advice. 'Hey, Dad, if you run, this is how I think you should do it. Or, 'Hey, Dad, you've gotta run because of this or that issue.' These were the conversations on the ride home from school or\u2014\" \"On their own they would encourage you?\" King asked. \"On their own,\" he said. \"Unsolicited. Really?\" \"Unsolicited. And I honestly did not expect that. But I think they're just as sensitive to what's going on in the world right now. They understand that they will inherit the consequences of the choices that you and I make at this moment. And they're counting on us to make the right ones,\" O'Rourke\u00a0said. King also asked about already facing criticism from President Trump. \"President Trump has already weighed in on your candidacy. He said this about you this morning. 'He's got a lotta hand movement. Is he crazy? Or is that just the way he acts?' You do have a lot of hand movement,\" King said. \"I'm not saying that's good or bad. But there are a lot of hand movements.\"  \"Yeah, I'm pretty \u2013 I'm pretty animated,\" O'Rourke said with a smile. \"I remember when we were campaigning in Texas. Someone pulled me aside and said, 'Hey, I just wanna give you some free advice. You move around too much when \u2013 when you talk.' I am who I am. And \u2013 and I really do think that we all want to get past the pettiness, the personal attacks. We've got some real big challenges in front of us and some extraordinary opportunities. Let's make the most of 'em. And let's do that together. Let's not put anybody down. Instead, let's lift each other up.\"  O'Rourke has been described as a \"star\" and \"loser\" in the same sentence, King noted.\u00a0 \"'Star' because look what he did in Texas with that race. You came within three percentage points in a deep red state. 'Loser' because at the end of the day he lost the race,\" King said. \"What do you say to that\u2026 'He couldn't win in his own state. How can he win the country?'\" \"Yeah. I lost that race. But in the process of running that campaign, we were able to help change the face of democracy in Texas,\" O'Rourke said, adding, \"So many young people who understand that their voice and their vote will make a difference in their future. So many candidates who were running along with us who won their elections that might not otherwise have been able to do so\u2026 In some way we part of some much larger victory \u2013 for our state, for our country. And now Texas counts.\"  \"So where's the loser part of that sentence?\" King asked. \"Well, I lost the race. And \u2013 and I tell you that at the end of the day, squarely that is on me,\" O'Rourke said. \"And it's a recognition that you can always do a better job. There's always the ability to learn from your mistakes. But in so doing, I don't wanna lose sight of the fact that we got to be part of a tremendous movement and community whose power still persists long after that election.\"  King also asked about the crowded Democratic field of candidates, with more women and people of color running than ever before.  \"Some could say it's the way the party is leaning that maybe the voters are signaling that's the candidate we want. Do you feel at a disadvantage as a white man \u2013 as a privileged white man, they say about you?\" King asked. \"I don't feel at a disadvantage. And at the same time, I feel extraordinarily grateful that the Democratic Party has produced so many extraordinary candidates, each of whom brings a different set of skills and life experiences and background,\" O'Rourke said. \"This is a great moment for America. It's a great moment for the Democratic Party. And I count myself so lucky to be a part of it.\" \"I really want to see, Beto, why you feel so strongly that you are the one,\" King said. \"When you really sat down in your heart of hearts and said, you know, 'I want this job.'\" \"Yeah. I'll tell you, this is very much a personal decision, one that I made with my family, with my wife, Amy. And when we think about what's going on in this country, and when we think about our kids and their future, we really do then look back at ourselves and our responsibility to do everything we can,\" O'Rourke said. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "A day after winning a court decision against the Trump administration, the House Oversight Committee filed a lawsuit\u00a0against Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for refusing a subpoena for documents related to the 2020 Census. On Monday, a federal judge sided with Congress\u00a0and ruled that former White House counsel Don McGahn must comply\u00a0with a subpoena to testify before lawmakers about the Mueller investigation into Russian election meddling. \"Executive branch officials are not absolutely immune from compulsory congressional process \u2014 no matter how many times the Executive branch has asserted as much over the years \u2014 even if the President expressly directs such officials' non-compliance,\" wrote U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson in her opinion.\u00a0 Echoing language used by Jackson, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney, the chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee, said in a\u00a0statement\u00a0Tuesday that \"President Trump and his aides are not above the law.\" She continued, \"I am filing this enforcement action today because the Trump administration's brazen obstruction of Congress must not stand.\" This represents Maloney's first official act as chairwoman since she was selected to replace the late chairman, Elijah Cummings, who died last month. McGahn's case is being appealed by the Justice Department and doesn't directly impact the census case. But it has given the House Oversight Committee confidence that it could win this fight in court.\u00a0 The committee opened an investigation earlier this year into the Trump administration's proposal to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census, a move that experts and advocates say would keep many immigrants from participating and could result in immigrant-heavy regions losing federal funding and political representation.\u00a0 Ross claimed the citizenship question was meant to help the Justice Department enforce the Voting Rights Act. But it was later revealed that the late GOP political consultant Thomas Hofeller pushed the Trump transition team to add the question after he concluded that it would benefit Republicans and white people during the redistricting process, which happens after every census. The Supreme Court blocked the citizenship question in June, and in July, the House voted to hold Barr and Ross in criminal contempt for refusing to comply with the House Oversight Committee's subpoenas for documents related to the matter. Maloney's lawsuit seeks \"critical evidence\" from Barr and Ross about the process of adding the citizenship question to the 2020 Census.\u00a0 Despite the court ruling and the contempt vote, Maloney said Barr and Ross have \"doubled down on their open defiance of the rule of law and refused to produce even a single additional document in response to our Committee's bipartisan subpoenas.\" A spokesperson for the Commerce Department, however, said the lawsuit \"lacks merit\" because the agency \"submitted hundreds of pages of additional documents since the Supreme Court's decision.\" But it wasn't the documents the House had requested.\u00a0 Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec called the lawsuit \"a political stunt\" and noted that \"many documents at issue were held privileged by a federal court.\"\u00a0 Both Barr and Ross have claimed executive privilege. In McGahn's case, the judge ruled that although he must comply with the subpoena to appear before Congress, he could \"invoke executive privilege where appropriate\" during his testimony.

            "article_content": "As President Trump continues to blast the ongoing probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential ties between his campaign and the Russian government as a \"political hoax\", former White House attorney Ty Cobb is defending Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, calling the FBI official an \"American hero.\" \"I don't feel the investigation is a witch hunt. I wish it had happened on a quicker timetable. But it didn't. And that's, you know, and that's unfortunate. But at the same time, it's not a real criticism of the special counsel that on the timing because there were a lot of surprises,\" Cobb told ABC News' \"The Investigation\" podcast in a wide-ranging interview.\u00a0 Cobb, who joined the White House counsel's office in July 2017\u00a0as a sort of in-house \"special counsel\" on the matter, announced his retirement in May 2018, telling CBS News' chief White House correspondent Major Garett at the time that working for the president's legal team had meant sacrifices \u2014 including putting off orthopedic surgeries and living in something akin to an attic, he said. The longtime lead lawyer representing Mr. Trump in matters related to the investigation was instrumental in getting the White House to cooperate with Mueller's team, sharing thousands of documents and making senior officials available for interviews with FBI investigators.\u00a0 Looking back on his time in the White House counsel's office, Cobb told ABC that he disagreed with criticism of Mueller's probe, specifically the president's current lawyer Rudy Giuliani's approach in \"ratcheting up the public's concerns about the investigation and its legitimacy.\"\u00a0 \"I object to that approach. But it's his choice. He's the President. And it's what \u2014 it's what Clinton did to Ken Starr,\" Cobb explained. Cobb said that in his first few months on the job\u00a0he was able to prevent Mr. Trump\u00a0from \"going on the attack against Mueller. But after Giuliani joined the legal team the president \"felt unleashed.\"\u00a0 \"He's found this very frustrating. It's particularly frustrated him in foreign affairs. He doesn't like the timing. He, you know, wants this over. But it's never gonna be over. I mean, this is gonna go for \u2014 this will go through 2020. And if the president's reelected, it'll go beyond that,\" Cobb said.\u00a0 Cobb also said he would not agree with sentiment expressed by another former Trump attorney, John Dowd, who described Mueller's probe as one of the \"greatest frauds this country has ever seen.\" \"I think Bob Mueller's an American hero. I think Bob Mueller's a guy that, you know, even though he came from an, arguably, privileged background, you know, has a backbone of steel. He walked into a firefight in Vietnam to pull out one of his injured colleagues and was appropriately honored for that. I've known him for 30 years as a prosecutor and a friend. And I think the \u2014 I think the world of Bob Mueller. He is a very deliberate guy. And he \u2014 but he's also a class act. And a very justice oriented person,\" said Cobb.\u00a0 Cobb described his role in the White House as an \"important\" and \"fascinating task\" that he's \"proud\" of taking on. He was adamant, however, about the distinction that his \"legal obligations\" were to the institution of the presidency and not the president personally.\u00a0 \"I'm not embarrassed, you know, for having worked there. And certainly the president, himself, is the White House de facto. So I really did work for him. But my legal obligations are \u2014 were to the institution,\" said Cobb. He called the Trump White House a\u00a0 \"challenging environment,\" describing his first day on the job as chaotic. \"I mean, within the first 15 minutes of my, you know, swearing in, [John] Kelly replaces Reince [Pribeus]. And [Anthony] Scaramucci gets fired. So I was a footnote on day one. And it was you know and it really never let up after that,\" Cobb recalled.\u00a0 Speculating on Mueller's final report as the special counsel's office prepares to submit its findings on the Russia probe after two years of investigation in the coming weeks, Cobb said the final assessment would be \"shorter rather than longer 'cause it's a pretty specific approach.\"\u00a0 He doubted, however, that the probe would yield a \"silver bullet\" to the Trump presidency, saying he didn't believe the American people would learn anything new from the report.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "On the eve of the impeachment vote, all but two of the 31 House Democrats who represent districts Mr. Trump won in 2016 have said they will vote \"yes\" on both impeachment articles this Wednesday. Their reasoning varies, but many kept the focus on Mr. Trump's actions in Ukraine. \u00a0 \"The fact that the president made a political request to a foreign leader of a troubled country with the intention for it to impact an American rival is beyond disappointing. In fact, it is unconstitutional,\" New York Representative Anthony Brindisi wrote in a\u00a0Syracuse.com op-ed. \u00a0 House Republicans have made clear that these 31 Democrats in Trump districts are on their target list, specifically the 13 districts that Mr. Trump won by 6 points or higher. Michigan Representative Elissa Slotkin is in a district Trump won by about 7 points, and on Sunday she said she'd vote for the articles. As far as political risks go, Slotkin told\u00a0CBS News' chief congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes\u00a0on Tuesday that if her decision was a \"political calculation\" then she wouldn't have voted for either the inquiry or articles.\u00a0 \"This is not something that you can do based on polls and based on what a political consultant tells you to do. And I feel firmly in that, and the voters will have a chance to decide next year. And the biggest honor of my life- to represent this district, but I am not going to compromise my integrity to do it,\" she said.\u00a0 Throughout the third fiscal quarter,\u00a0almost all Trump-district Democrats had a complete fundraising advantage, report\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0and\u00a0political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice.\u00a0Slotkin has more than $1.7 million in the bank, though all her GOP challengers filed past the FEC reporting deadline. Jared Golden of Maine, who is from a district Trump won by 10 points, revealed in a\u00a0Facebook post\u00a0he will vote \"Yes\" on the abuse of power article and \"No\" on the charge that Trump was obstructing the probe. He said the \"political decision\" to speed up impeachment proceedings has resulted the failure of subpoenas to key witnesses, such as John Bolton, Rick Perry and Mick Mulvaney.\u00a0 \"While I do not dispute that the White House has been provocative in its defiance and sweeping in its claims of executive privilege, I also believe there are legitimate and unresolved constitutional questions about the limits of executive privilege, and that before pursuing impeachment for this charge, the House has an obligation to exhaust all other available options.\" There are only two confirmed \"no\" votes \u2014 from Congressmen Collin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who is\u00a0reportedly switching over to the Republican party. Despite the emergence of two Democratic challengers, the latest being progressive Ashley Bennet, Van Drew told\u00a0CBS News Capitol Hill producer Kimberly Brown\u00a0that he \"hasn't announced any final decision.\"\u00a0 When asked how his constituents would respond to a party change, he said the \"majority of them\" will vote \"for people because of their individuality and because of how hard they work.\" Van Drew added, \"If they disagree with what I've done, then they will vote me out and that's something I would very willingly accept.\"\u00a0 Glouchester County GOP Chair Jacci Vigilante told the\u00a0New Jersey Globe\u00a0if Van Drew switches, he has to prove \"he is with us on more than just the issue of impeachment\u2026. A 100% rating from Planned Parenthood and voting with Nancy Pelosi over 90% of the time is a lot to overcome.\" Van Drew recently got some\u00a0Twitter support from President Trump, who said he was \"very popular in our great and very united Republican party.\" Trump also handed out endorsements for other House Republicans Tuesday afternoon, including\u00a0Kay Granger of Texas\u00a0and\u00a0Markwayne Mullin of Oklahama. CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0also says both Iowa freshmen representatives who flipped congressional districts in 2018 announced they will be supporting impeachment.\u00a0 \"When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect the Constitution and our Democracy,\" Representative Cindy Axne said in a statement. \"It's clear the President abused his power by using $400 million in taxpayer money for his own personal, political gain and obstructed justice by ordering his administration to refuse to testify or provide subpoenaed documents.\"\u00a0 Axne won her 2018 race by 2 points in a district that President Trump won by 3 points in 2016. \"Voters won't forget the cowardice Cindy Axne displayed when she chose to put Nancy Pelosi's sham impeachment inquiry over the will of her constituents. Axne's premonition about losing her seat is about to become a reality,\" Republican National Committee spokesperson Preya Samsundar said in a statement. \u00a0 \"I will be supporting both articles of impeachment and honor my duty to defend our constitution and democracy from abuse of power at the highest level,\" Representative Abby Finkenauer said in a statement. \"This decision is not, and never was about politics, and this shouldn't be about political parties or elections.\"\u00a0 Finkenauer, the second youngest woman elected to Congress, won by 5 points in 2018 after President Trump won her district by 3 points in 2016. \"Abby Finkenauer chose Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats' unhinged caucus over her constituents,\" Samsundar said in a statement \"Finkenauer has sealed her fate as a one-term congresswoman.\" MICHAEL BENNET This morning, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet's presidential campaign announced a $700,000 fundraising push by January 16, aimed at launching a new ad series introducing the candidate to New Hampshire voters. The campaign hopes to air the first ad \u2014 titled \"Opposite of Trump\" \u2014 on television and digital platforms throughout the state.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says Bennet recently vowed to hold 50 town halls in New Hampshire in the final 10 weeks run up before the primary.\u00a0 In a campaign memo to supporters, campaign manager Daniel Barash doubled down on the \"New Hampshire Investment Strategy,\" writing, \"As other candidates have left the race or stumbled in the last few weeks, Michael has doubled down and gained momentum. Now is our moment. We have planted our flag in New Hampshire, but we need your help right now to have the resources to compete there.\" Bennet returns to New Hampshire on Friday and Saturday to chip away at his pledge to the Granite State. JOE BIDEN As he promised in September, Joe Biden today released a summary of his\u00a0medical records\u00a0from a physical examination. Overall, the team of doctors concluded Biden is \"a healthy, vigorous, 77-year-old male, who is fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency, to include those as Chief Executive, Head of State and Commander in Chief.\"\u00a0 Biden is currently treated for A-fib (irregular heartbeats) which is currently asymptomatic, excess fat in his blood called hyperlipidemia and seasonal allergies. An interesting observation from the campaign trail is Biden's regular clearing of his throat\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson\u00a0notes, which his doctors in the report attributed to his \"gastroesophageal reflux.\"\u00a0 CBS News contributor Dr. David Agus reviewed the report's findings: \"Vice President Biden's physician has released an assessment of his present health with no red flags.\u00a0 VP Biden appears to be a healthy 77 year old with several manageable medical conditions that shouldn't affect his performance.\"\u00a0 The team of doctors, led by his former White House physician, also noted Biden's health lifestyle including working out \"at least five days per week\" and avoiding tobacco products and alcohol. \u00a0CBS News has inquired with the Biden campaign about two areas not reflected in the report: history of coronary artery disease and whether or not cognitive abilities were tested.\u00a0 BERNIE SANDERS Bernie Sanders' team\u00a0announced this week\u00a0a fourth co-chair for Sanders' Nevada campaign: Laurie Thom, currently the chairman of the Yerington Paiute Tribe in Northern Nevada, joins Zaffar Iqbal, Tick Segerblom, and Amy Vilela as top supporters of the Vermont senator in the state. Thom, who also backed Sanders in 2016, led his wife on a tour\u00a0earlier this month\u00a0of a\u00a0notorious local environmental clean-up. She says only a few campaigns, including\u00a0Juli\u00e1n Castro, Cory Booker, and Elizabeth Warren, had reached out.\u00a0 \"He's been fighting the environmental injustices across the country, speaking up for the minorities,\" Thom tells\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin. \"And instead of being just consulted with, that we actually have some form of consent. There's a difference between consultation and consent. And I believe that's what Bernie Sanders is going to be able to do for the tribes across the nation,\" she added. ANDREW YANG With the Iowa caucuses just seven weeks away, Andrew Yang is working hard reach new voters in the Hawkeye State,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0and\u00a0political unit associate producer Ben Mitchell\u00a0report. Yang recently wrapped up a five-day bus tour of Iowa where he held several events aimed at small business owners, women and families, including a discussion about families and autism.\u00a0 In the November\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker\u00a0poll, Yang was the top choice for just 1% of registered Iowa Democrats, although 10% said they were considering supporting him. Yang has just completed his 23rd visit to Iowa, although his campaign has largely focused on New Hampshire, a state that's historically friendly to underdog candidates, as his major breakout opportunity. \"I think we need to outperform expectations,\" Yang told CBS News, saying that most people still don't believe he will get \"any meaningful number of delegates.\"\u00a0 He did say that a top five finish in Iowa \"would surprise a lot people.\" Despite being the only person of color to take the stage on Thursday, he did not criticize the primary process in the way former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro has. Castro, a Mexican American, has repeatedly complained that the first two states to hold primary contests, Iowa and New Hampshire, are overwhelmingly white.\u00a0 The Democratic Party as a whole, meanwhile, is increasingly diverse and dependent on Hispanic and African American voters. Instead of knocking the process, Yang repeatedly tells voters in Iowa and New Hampshire that they have the \"power\" to turn his longshot presidential bid into a reality. He regularly refers to both states as \"magical\" places. \"We should be open to people suggesting improvements, but one of the things that I'd suggest is that it's not enough to say, 'Hey, I don't like what's currently going on.' You have to have concrete suggestions as to what could work better and what that could look like,\" Yang told CBS News.\u00a0 He also doesn't believe that the Democratic National Committee should be faulted for the fact that he's the only minority candidate qualified for this week's debate.\u00a0 \"I think the DNC did the best they could with a very difficult task which is set up objective criteria that would raise the bar over time,\" he said, noting that Harris had qualified before suspending her presidential campaign earlier this month. GAME ON After plans of a California union's picket line threatened to derail this week's debate at Loyola Marymount University, UNITE HERE Local 11\u00a0is thanking\u00a0the Democratic National Committee and its chair, former Obama Labor Secretary Tom Perez, for helping \"bring the situation to a positive resolution.\" With a tentative\u00a0agreement\u00a0in hand between the labor group and Sodexo, a food service contractor on campus,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says the stage is again set for Thursday's debate in a state where only three candidates \u2013 Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Joe Biden \u2013 have consistently\u00a0cleared 15 percent\u00a0in recent polls of the mammoth Super Tuesday contest. IOWA Three Democratic candidates rolled out new ads in Iowa today centered around President Trump. Joe Biden's campaign launched a new cable ad airing in Iowa and the other early states, featuring a speech Biden gave in Burlington, Iowa back in August denouncing the president.\u00a0 \"If Donald Trump is re-elected he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation,\" Biden says in the\u00a0ad, which is part of a $6 million buy in the early states.\u00a0 Pete Buttigeig's ad features a message of taking on Mr. Trump by focusing on issues.\u00a0 \"The more we're talking about him, the less we're talking about you. On the issues, people are with us. That's exactly why he needs us talking about him,\" Buttigieg says in the\u00a0ad.\u00a0 Amy Klobuchar's newest television advertisement highlights her record of legislative achievements and ability to win in the Midwest and opens with a clear message to Democrats.\u00a0 \"If we don't stop Donald Trump this time, shame on us,\" Klobuchar says in the\u00a0ad.\u00a0 CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster\u00a0says many Iowa statewide elected officials do a 99-county tour of the state every year to spend time talking to constituents and hearing their concerns. It's something Republican Senator Chuck Grassley has done for years, and Republican Senator Joni Ersnt wrapped up her fifth tour earlier this year.\u00a0 Some presidential campaigns talk about making the tour, but not everyone manages to do it. Former Maryland Congressman John Delaney has already visited all 99 counties once. Senator Amy Klobuchar is trying to complete the tour and has a jam-packed weekend, where she plans to stop in 27 counties, which will put her just a few shy of visiting all 99.\u00a0 \"I do think that going to all 99 counties is a positive thing to do,\" said Iowa State Auditor Rob Sand, a Democrat who just completed his 99-county tour on Tuesday. Sand acknowledged that it's more complicated for presidential candidates to visit all 99 counties and that doing so doesn't guarantee that someone will caucus for you. What is important, he said, is for Democrats to show they care about spending time in rural America.\u00a0 \"People do want to see that rural areas aren't forgotten and Democrats in states like Iowa, that is a purple state, want to see that every corner of that state gets attention from presidential candidates,\" Sand said. Buttigieg's campaign announced two new endorsements today from Iowa state legislators. \"It's time for a new generation of leadership in Washington,\" State Representative Brian Meyer said in a statement. \"Being from the Midwest, he deeply understands the challenges facing our communities in Iowa, and his ability to communicate his vision to people of all backgrounds makes him the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump in November.\"\u00a0 Buttigieg was also endorsed by State Senator Tony Bisignano, a longtime Biden supporter. \"I'm looking at someone that I think could energize the party,\" Bisignano told CBS News. He added that he believes Biden is \"well qualified,\" but said he believes Buttigieg is the right candidate to \"energize the younger voters.\" Biden also unveiled endorsements from 25 Iowa leaders today, including three current mayors, two former state legislators, a former Iowa Democratic Party chair and a current state senator.\u00a0 \"We live in divisive times and a dangerous world. America needs a new President, one who can heal the divisions at home, repair the trust and cooperation of our allies abroad, and regain respect for America and America's values from friend and foe alike,\" Iowa State Senator Herman Quirmbach said in a statement. \"We need a man of Joe Biden's character, a man of true warmth and compassion, a man who will restore dignity to the Office of President of the United States.\"\u00a0 NEVADA Pete Buttigieg's campaign today says it'll be up on the air in Nevada with its first statewide\u00a0television ad buy, as well as new radio and digital ads voiced by the South Bend mayor\u00a0in Spanish. Buttigieg is joined today by Joe Biden, who has also bought time on local cable\u00a0across the early states\u00a0with a second spot of his own.\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0notes only a handful of the other Democratic presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer (who is also advertising\u00a0on billboards in the state), have also purchased television or radio ads in Nevada so far. NEW HAMPSHIRE Congress omnibus federal spending bill grants substance abuse treatment providers nationwide greater flexibility in spending federal grant dollars. That's good news for New Hampshire \u2013 a state grappling with increased methamphetamine and cocaine use, according to the New Hampshire Office of the Medical Examiner.\u00a0 The bipartisan bill funding the federal government through next September permits providers to redirect state opioid response grants to patients hooked on other drugs. Previously, those dollars could only be funneled to clients addicted to opioids such as heroin, fentanyl or oxycotin.\u00a0 \"The substance use disorder epidemic we're facing today isn't the same one we were fighting a few years ago, so as this crisis evolves so should our response,\" U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen said in a statement released to\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga. \"By empowering treatment providers with the ability to use these federal grants for a broader range of substance misuse, we can help ensure more Granite Staters get the help they desperately need. It's so heartbreaking to see the devastation to families and communities from this crisis and we need to make sure treatment providers have the tools they need to save lives.\"\u00a0 ELECTION SECURITY The House of Representatives approved a spending deal that would provide $425 million for election security grants, reports\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. If the deal passes the Senate and is signed by the president, the funding would be the biggest step Congress has taken since the 2016 election to address election security concerns like paper ballots and cybersecurity support for local election officials.",

            "article_content": "Ty Cobb, the former White House lawyer who handled President Trump's response to Russia-related matters from 2017 to 2018, told CBSN's \"Red & Blue\" on Thursday that special counsel Robert Mueller could not \"have done a more thorough job\" in his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. \"I think the resulting report is professional, thorough. He has probably 10 times the tools, if 100 times the tools, to investigate as Congress does, and I don't think he could have done a more thorough job, with the thousands of interviews, subpoenas and the millions of documents reviewed and the 500 witnesses that they talked to,\" Cobb said. Attorney General William Barr released a redacted version of Mueller's report\u00a0Thursday morning. Cobb said he believed the report was accurately represented in a letter Barr sent to Congress on March 24, in which he summarized the main findings of the Mueller report. \"I think the initial summary compares very favorably with the report,\" Cobb said. He also said he thought it was appropriate for Mr. Trump's personal lawyers to review the report before it was released to the public. \"The law is very clear that under the Ethics and Government Act, somebody who is the subject of a report like this has the opportunity to review and comment in advance,\" Cobb said. He added it was \"highly unusual\" for Mr. Trump's current legal team to decide against invoking executive privilege, citing the move as evidence of Mr. Trump's desire for transparency. Cobb left the White House after announcing his retirement in May 2018. Mr. Trump declared victory Thursday, claiming the report exonerated him of any wrongdoing and confirmed there was \"no collusion\" and \"no obstruction.\" \"I'm having a good day too. It was called, no collusion, no obstruction,\" the president said at an unrelated event Thursday morning. While the special counsel's office found no evidence of collusion between Trump campaign officials and individuals associated with the Russian government, Mueller did not come to a determination as to whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice. However, the report did say\u00a0Congress could investigate obstruction of justice. Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein determined that Mr. Trump had not obstructed justice so based on the evidence presented in the report.

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina that aired Sunday, April 28, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, South Carolina's senior senator, Lindsey Graham. Senator, good to have you here in studio.\u00a0 SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We just heard about this tragic shooting. It was an AR-15 style semi-automatic weapon. Hate crimes seem to be on the rise in this country. What do we need to do to combat this, prevent it? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I think somebody interdicted the shooter, thank God, and it could have been worse, but in- I think in California you can't buy a gun until you're 21. So let's find out how this guy got the gun, what his motives were and I'm a big supporter of protective orders, allowing local law enforcement to go to a judge if there's ample evidence somebody is becoming a danger to themselves or others. About 15 states have such laws. I'm trying to get a national grant program to incentivize states to pass laws to allow local law enforcement to go to judges to take guns out of hands of people that are showing really disturbing signs or danger signs. And I think in Parkland that would have made a big difference, here I don't know.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll continue to follow the details as we learn more about what happened there, but I want to talk about what you are preparing for this week.\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: Right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Attorney General Barr will be answering questions for the first time really in detail about the Mueller Report. I know you've said you're done with it. SEN. GRAHAM: Pretty much.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But what is it that you're going to try to focus in on with this hearing? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, he gave a four page summary. Does the report support his summary? Does the report actually indicate there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians? I think the idea that this president obstructed justice is absurd. He turned over a million documents to the special counsel. Almost everybody around him testified. I can't think of one thing that President Trump did to stop Mueller from doing his job. He never claimed executive privilege. From my point of view, I've heard all I need to really know. Now I want to look and find out how all this happened. MARGARET BRENNAN: But on that point of attempting to obstruct justice or not, the president seems to want to continue to litigate this because he came out this week and said and denied that he had ever thought or told anyone-- SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, right.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --to fire Don McGahn, the White House counsel. But that directly contradicts sworn testimony-- SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --that was in the Mueller Report, where Don McGahn said he almost quit he was so pressured to fire the special counsel. SEN. GRAHAM: Well that's a-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Who do you believe?\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: I think it's just all theater. It doesn't matter. I don't care what he said to Don McGahn. It's what he did. And the president never obstructed-- MARGARET BRENNAN: It doesn't matter to you-- SEN. GRAHAM: Oh, God no, I mean-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --that the president is changing a version of events that perhaps some would say, lying. SEN. GRAHAM: If you're going to look at every president who pops off at his staff and you know, ask him to do something that's maybe crazy, then we won't have any presidents. MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the firing, this was Don McGahn, the White House counsel, being pressured to fire the special counsel. SEN. GRAHAM: But he didn't. MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- SEN. GRAHAM: And, I don't care-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But-- SEN. GRAHAM: I don't care what they talked about. He didn't do anything. The point is the president did not impede Mueller from doing his investigation.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: And it doesn't-- SEN. GRAHAM: Case closed. MARGARET BRENNAN: --trouble you that the president is changing his version of events? SEN. GRAHAM: I don't- I don't care what happened between him and Don McGahn. Here's what I care about. Did Mueller- was Mueller allowed to do his job? And the answer is yes. Name one thing that they did to stop Mueller from doing his job, and if you can't then there's no obstruction. MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you call him again to testify? SEN. GRAHAM: No- me? No. No, I'm- I'm done. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the special counsel? SEN. GRAHAM: I'm not going to re-litigate it. I don't know how clear I can be, Margaret. It's over for me. He didn't collude with the Russians, obstruction of justice in this situation is absurd. I fought hard as hell to make sure Mueller could do his job, I introduced legislation to make sure he couldn't be fired. It's over.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of this report, it was not just the obstruction of justice- that you seem to be saying you're over. All the details in here about Russia and what they tried to do, what they did succeed at doing in terms of-- SEN. GRAHAM: That's a-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --accessing computer systems. SEN. GRAHAM: --different conversation. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that worth-- SEN. GRAHAM: One hundred percent. MARGARET BRENNAN: --a- a conversation? I mean Senator Marco Rubio came out and said this week he went as far as to say that they had the ability there were in a position to alter Florida voter rolls back in 2016. SEN. GRAHAM: I think that that's the point. There's two things I'm going to look at: what did they do, and are they trying to do it again, and how do we stop them. I think that's something we all need to focus on. And how did this start.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the president focused on that enough, on that-- SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, he's got a good team around him-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --doing it again threat?\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, no, he's got a good team around him to make sure we harden our infrastructure. But what Marco said was a bit stunning I've never heard that before. So what I want to do is make sure that Intel and Judiciary and Homeland Security, the three committees are working together to harden the infrastructure against Russia or anybody else interfering in 2020. And Russia is still up to it. So the takeaway for me is that they were very involved in the 2016 election. They're coming at us again. I'd like to stop them. And one way to stop them is to make them pay a price. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about this with a level of seriousness that we did not hear from Jared Kushner, senior adviser to the president. I want to play for you some sound when he was speaking this week about the Russia probe when he said it was actually more damaging to have the Mueller investigation. Listen to what he said. *SOUND ON TAPE* MARGARET BRENNAN: Is he minimizing the threat to national security? SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I like Jared a lot, but he's leaving out a big detail: the Russians hacked into John Podesta's emails, the campaign manager for the Democratic candidate for president. The Russians hacked into Hillary Clinton's emails, the candidate for the Democratic Party. Can you imagine what we would be saying if the Russians or the Iranians hacked into the presidential team of the Republican Party? So, no, this is a big deal. It's not just a few Facebook ads. They were very successful in pitting one American against the other during the 2016 campaign by manipulating social media and they actually got into the campaign email system of the Democratic Party. An attack on one party should be an attack on all. The Russians are up to it again. And here's what I tell President Trump: everything we've done with the Russians is not working. We need more sanctions not less. MARGARET BRENNAN: More sanctions, now? SEN. GRAHAM: Now. Before 2020. Because clearly they don't have the message.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about some of the remarks you have made in the past because we know as Democrats start talking about the details of the Mueller Report, combing through it and already calling for impeachment proceedings to begin against the president the United States. Here's what you said back in January of 1999 when you were helping to lead the impeachment of President Clinton. *SOUND ON TAPE* MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you agree? SEN. GRAHAM: I was a lot younger.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like some of what you're characterizing here, saying everything in the Mueller Report, it may not be great but it doesn't reach the level of being able to prosecute.\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: Well a high crime-- MARGARET BRENNAN: That's different from what you described there, which was to say behavior of a president-- SEN. GRAHAM: Sure it does.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --the cleansing of an office-- SEN. GRAHAM: Well it- it-- MARGARET BRENNAN: --is important.\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: It's got to be a higher crime a misdemeanor not defined by the prosecution team but by a political body called the House of Representatives approved by the Senate. So there was an article of impeachment against President Clinton for lying under oath about having sex with Monica Lewinsky. I voted against that because I believe a lot of people would lie to protect their family if they were blindsided about an affair. So I didn't want that to become a high crime or misdemeanor. What President Clinton did was interfere in a lawsuit against him by Paula Jones and others, hide the evidence, encourage people to lie. So to me he took the legal system and turned it upside down. But it doesn't have to technically be a crime. What President Trump did here was completely cooperate in an investigation, a million documents, let everybody that the special counsel wanted to talk to be interviewed. Don McGahn was interviewed for 30 hours. I believe the president did nothing wrong. Whether you like him or not I'll leave that up to you but this-- MARGARET BRENNAN: But even the pressuring Don McGahn--\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: See but--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: --to fire this fellow. He may not have done it. SEN. GRAHAM: See that--\u00a0 SEN. GRAHAM: Okay, if you're going to let that be the standard of impeachment, that you have an interaction between a White House counsel and a president that- that you find uncomfortable then we'll have nobody serve. So here's the deal for me: you actually have to do something. Bill Clinton lost his law- law license for five years because he did something. But to my Democratic friends, if you agree with the 1999 statement I made, you think this office needs to be cleansed, impeach him. It's up to you. If you think Donald Trump deserves to be impeached, then impeach him. I don't. MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly before you go, I want to ask you about your old friend Joe Biden-- SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah. MARGARET BRENNAN: --the vice president throwing his hat into the ring, President Trump seeming to suggest he's too old. What do you think? SEN. GRAHAM: Well yeah that's up to the voters to decide. I think President Trump is very vibrant. And I know Joe- Joe Biden. If you travel with Joe Biden, you won't think he's too old. Here's the problem for Joe. Does he fit into the Democratic Party of 2020? I don't know, he's a good man. I like him a lot. I disagree with him on- on policy. I hope he doesn't apologize for the life he's led because he's led a good life. But if he starts apologizing for all the policy positions and decisions he's made throughout his life, that will be disappointing. I don't know how he fits in this party but I do know this. He's a good man and he would be a strong candidate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, thank you.",

            "article_content": "London -- President Trump has said he \"would not have minded\" at all serving in the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. \u00a0Mr. Trump avoided the U.S. military draft in place during the war by getting a medical deferment for bone spurs.  Before attending commemoration ceremonies in England and France marking the 75th anniversary of the World War II D-Day invasion by Allied forces, Mr. Trump was asked by British broadcaster Piers Morgan whether he wished he could have served in the Vietnam War. The president told Morgan he was \"never a fan\" of the war, calling Vietnam a country that \"nobody had ever heard of\" in 1960s America before the conflict began. But he said he would have been happy and honored to have served. \"I would not have minded that at all. I would've been honored, but I think I make up for it right now,\" Mr. Trump told Morgan. \"I think I'm making up for it rapidly because we're rebuilding our military at a level that it's never seen before.\" Mr. Trump's medical deferment from the draft came up repeatedly during his campaign for the White House in 2015 and 2016, and has resurfaced as a talking point among his Democratic challengers ahead of the coming election in 2020. South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg accused President Trump last month of using his \"privileged status to fake a disability\" to dodge the draft during the Vietnam War.\u00a0 \"This is somebody, who I think it is fairly obvious to most of us, took advantage of the fact that he was a child of multimillionaire in order to pretend to be disabled so that somebody could go to war in his place,\" Buttigieg said of Mr. Trump.  During the presidential campaign in July 2015, the Trump campaign said Mr. Trump had a \"medical deferment for bone spurs on both heels of his feet.\" The statement also said that Mr. Trump entered the military draft lottery and had received number 356 out of 365. \"When the draft occurred, they never got near his number, and he was therefore exempt from serving in the military,\" the Trump campaign said in a statement at the time. \"Although he was not a fan of the Vietnam War, yet another disaster for our country, had his draft number been selected he would have proudly served and he is tremendously grateful to all those who did.\" In\u00a0a C-SPAN interview in October 2017,\u00a0the late Sen. John McCain took a swipe at Mr. Trump over the deferment, saying it was \"wrong\" for him to have claimed to have bone spurs to avoid military service.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "The House Judiciary Committee kicked off a series of\u00a0hearings on the Mueller report with former Nixon White House counsel John Dean and former U.S. attorneys testifying Monday to offer their insights on President Trump's \"most overt acts of obstruction.\" Dean is best known for his bombshell testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities during the Watergate scandal, which paved the way for Nixon's dramatic resignation from office. Dean testified that there were \"exhaustive\" and \"remarkable\" parallels between special counsel Robert Mueller's report and the findings compiled in the wake of the Watergate scandal. He said \"events in both 1972 and 2016 resulted in obstruction of the investigations.\" Dean said he had served as an \"active participant\" in the Watergate cover-up, contrasting his role to that of ex-White House counsel Don McGahn, who Dean said \"was a critical observer\" of obstruction attempts in the White House. The nearly two-year long probe into Mr. Trump's alleged ties to Moscow came to an official close late last month after Mueller announced his resignation from the Department of Justice and the closure of the special counsel's office. The Judiciary Committee has already held two public hearings about the special counsel's report, and another on Democrats' ongoing concerns over possible abuse of executive authority. Committee chair Rep. Jerry Nadler said the hearings would further allow Congress to \"examine the findings laid out in Mueller's report so that we can work to protect the rule of law and protect future elections through consideration of legislative and other remedies.\" Nadler added in a statement that \"given the threat posed by the President's alleged misconduct, our first hearing will focus on President Trump's most overt acts of obstruction. In the coming weeks, other hearings will focus on other important aspects of the Mueller report.\" Committee chairman Jerry Nadler said his panel has an obligation to investigate \"who stood to benefit from the attack\" on the U.S. election system \"and the extent to which the Trump campaign welcomed it.\"\u00a0 He added that the committee has a responsibility to do this work, to follow the facts where they lead...and to craft legislation to make certain no president, Democrat or Republican can ever act in this way ever again.\" Nadler also noted the political divides the Russia probe has since created in Washington, saying that both parties should at least proceed with a common understanding that the U.S. was attacked.\u00a0 \"We were attacked by a foreign adversary.  President Trump's campaign took full advantage of the attack when it came. \u00a0The descriptions of obstruction of justice in Volume II go to the heart of our legal system. If we can agree on this common set of facts as our starting place, and agree to follow the facts and the law where they take us, I believe we can make a great deal of progress in this hearing today,\" he said.\u00a0 Nadler's Republican colleague Doug Collins of Georgia meanwhile argued that \"if we were attacked, then the priorities should be to go on the battlefields and not to the sideshow. He said Congress needs to worry about firming up the U.S. election process instead of rehashing the Russia investigation into the president. Collins went so far as to call Dean the \"Godfather\" of interference suggesting Russia had photos of Dean for inspiration on meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0 Can\u2019t believe they are bringing in John Dean, the disgraced Nixon White House Counsel who is a paid CNN contributor. No Collusion - No Obstruction! Democrats just want a do-over which they\u2019ll never get! At the outset of Monday's hearing, Mr. Trump remarked on Dean's testimony before Congress, saying he was in disbelief they would bring in the \"disgraced\" counsel. \"No Collusion - No Obstruction! Democrats just want a do-over which they'll never get!\" Mr. Trump added, a common refrain in his criticism of Democrats' ongoing attempts to investigate his administration. Dean said in his opening statement that McGahn should testify before Congress, saying he had an obligation to do so as a \"key witness in understanding the Mueller report\" and under his ethical obligation as an attorney. McGahn had declined to appear before the committee despite a subpoena, claiming executive privilege at the direction of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel. \"McGahn represented the Office of the Presidency, not Donald Trump personally,\" Dean argued. \"In short, McGahn's loyalty is to his client, the Office of the Presidency, not the occupant. He had only a limited attorney-client privilege when interacting with the president and advisors and the privilege belongs to the office in any event.\" Dean added that McGahn's assertion of executive privilege was waived \"regarding the material plainly set forth in the Mueller report.\" \"In addition, it has long been the rule there is no executive privilege attached to criminal or fraudulent activity. Accordingly, I sincerely hope that Mr. McGahn will voluntarily appear and testify.\" He later testified that the OLC opinion claiming \"privilege pushes the outer limit further than i have ever seen it pushed.\" He said that while the OLC even cites Dean in a memo \"in both those instances the witnesses did still appear.\" Joyce White Vance, the former U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Alabama, testified that \"no one is above the law,\" including Mr. Trump. Vance was one of numerous former federal prosecutors who signed an open letter saying Mr. Trump would face \"multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice\" if he were a private citizen. \"If anyone other than a president of the United States committed this conduct he would b e under indictment for multiple acts of obstruction of justice,\" said Vance. \"If you or I committed this same conduct we would have been charged by now.\" Former attorney Barbara McQuade also appeared to support that claim, testifying that the \"conduct described in the report constitutes multiple crimes of obstruction of justice. It's supported by evidence of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Barbara McQuade suggested in her testimony that the president was \"threatened\" by the special counsel exposing more potential crimes over the course of the investigation which compelled him to want to fire Mueller from the probe. While there were \"no findings of a conspiracy\" McQuade noted, Mr. Trump \"didn't know that would be the outcome\" at the time. \"There are things other than the crime the investigator is looking at that could motivate him to end the investigations and under the law they are equally prohibited,\" she added.

Her decision was first reported by the Washington Post. \"Ms. Hicks understands that the Committee will be free to pose questions as it sees fit, including about her time on the Trump Campaign and her time in the White House,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said in a statement Wednesday evening. \"Should there be a privilege or other objection regarding any question, we will attempt to resolve any disagreement while reserving our right to take any and all measures in response to unfounded privilege assertions.\u00a0 We look forward to her testimony and plan to make the transcript promptly available to the public,\" Nadler said. The Democratic-led Judiciary Committee is investigating whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by interfering in the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Hicks was interviewed by special counsel investigators. Hicks may refuse to answer some of the questions asked by Judiciary Committee members during the closed-door hearing because of the president's invocation of executive privilege over events that took place in the White House. A member of the White House counsel's office will be present for Hicks' testimony, which is scheduled to take place next Wednesday. The White House instructed Hicks and Annie Donaldson, the chief of staff to former White House Counsel Don McGahn not to hand over documents to the House Judiciary Committee last week, according to Nadler. Hicks did agree to turn over some records related to her time working for the campaign. The committee issued a subpoena last month to Hicks and Donaldson in light of revelations in special counsel Robert Mueller's report. Hicks left the White House in February 2018, shortly after admitting to the House Intelligence Committee that she had told \"white lies\" for the president.\u00a0 Rebecca Kaplan contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Reiterating that special counsel Robert Mueller found no evidence of President Trump's 2016 campaign colluding with Russia, Attorney General William Barr mounted a vigorous defense of Mr. Trump's actions in a preemptive press conference ahead of the release of a redacted version of Mueller's report, saying the president faced \"an unprecedented situation\" throughout the two-year investigation.\u00a0 \"As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as President, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates,\" Barr said at a Thursday morning press conference. Standing alongside Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the attorney general said Mr. Trump held a \"sincere belief\" that Mueller's investigation was hindering his ability to perform his duties as commander-in-chief.\u00a0 \"As the special counsel's report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents and fueled by illegal leaks,\" Barr added.\u00a0 Asked by CBS News' White House correspondent Paula Reid about his recognition of the president's emotions and claims by Democrats that he is acting as a spokesperson for the White House, the attorney general defended his statements and said his characterization of the Mueller report as \"unprecedented\" is warranted.\u00a0 CBS News' Paula Reid to AG Barr: \"Here, you have remarks that are quite generous to the president, including acknowledging his feelings and his emotions. What do you say to people on both sides of the aisle that you are trying to protect the president?\" https://t.co/2AcTw6G473 pic.twitter.com/Mri15UAf8A \"The statements about his beliefs, his sincere beliefs, are recognized in the report that there was substantial evidence for that,\" Barr added, referring to Mr. Trump. \"So I'm not sure what your basis is for saying that I'm generous to the president.\" In the press conference, Barr said the the White House \"fully cooperated\" with Mueller's probe and provided \"unfettered access\" to documents and testimony by senior administration officials. He added the president opted not to invoke executive privilege on any material on the redacted Mueller report when the Justice Department shared a copy with the White House on March 29. \u00a0\u00a0 \"The president confirmed that, in the interests of transparency and full disclosure to the American people, he would not assert privilege over the special counsel's report,\" Barr said.\u00a0 In his nearly two-year investigation, Mueller probed whether the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in Moscow's sophisticated campaign to meddle in the 2016 election, as well as possible obstruction of justice offenses committed by the president while in office.\u00a0 \u00a0 In what the White House claimed as a \"total and complete exoneration\" of Mr. Trump, Barr wrote in a four-page letter in March that Mueller did not find Trump campaign associates had \"conspired or coordinated\" with the Kremlin during the 2016 campaign. In his summary, Barr said he and Rosenstein also determined, without considering a longstanding Justice Department opinion stating sitting presidents cannot be indicted, that Mueller's findings were not \"sufficient\" to prove Mr. Trump committed obstruction of justice. Still, the attorney general said Mueller stopped short of exonerating the president of obstructing justice. \"While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\" Mueller wrote in his report, according to Barr's summary.\u00a0 On Thursday, Barr strongly reiterated the Mueller probe found no evidence of any type of coordination between American citizens, including the president and his campaign officials, and the Russian government with the objective to interfere with the 2016 election.\u00a0 \"That is the bottom line,\" Barr said. \u00a0 Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

The law is very clear. The DNI shall convey the complaint to the Intelligence Committee,\" Pelosi said. In his opening statement before the Intelligence Committee, Maguire said that he did not immediately send the whistleblower's complaint to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees because it contained information pertaining to a conversation by the president, which may have been subject to executive privilege. He acknowledged that he had contacted the White House Counsel after receiving the complaint to obtain its legal opinion on whether he could share it. Maguire also said that his office had consulted with the Department of Justice, and included the inspector general in those discussions, to determine whether the complaint was an \"urgent concern.\" The Office of Legal Counsel for the Justice Department found the complaint did not amount to an urgent concern, because \"the president is not a member of the intelligence community.\" This meant, Maguire said, he was not legally obligated to pass on the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees. The complaint was released to the public shortly before the beginning of the hearing. It raises concerns about White House efforts to restrict access to the records of the call. According to the complaint, \"senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call,\" and White House officials were \"directed\" to remove the electronic transcript from the computer system. The complaint reported an \"urgent concern\" about Mr. Trump's request for Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, as well as how records of the call were handled and the role of Mr. Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, in the U.S. relationship with Ukraine. In the complaint, the whistleblower wrote, \"I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election. This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President's main domestic political rivals.\"\u00a0 Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - KRISTIN WOOD CORRESPONDENT MICHAEL MORELLPRODUCERS: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON MICHAEL MORELL:\tKristin, welcome to Intelligence Matters. It is great to have you on the show.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tMichael, it's great to be here. Thanks.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo you did many things in your career at CIA, but I want to focus on three of them. I want to talk about what it's like to be an analyst. We've had a lot of CIA operations officers on the show, and not a lot of analysts. And we've never really had a conversation about what's it like to be an analyst every day. So I want to do that. I want to talk about what it's like to be a daily briefer for senior policy makers, which you did. And I want to talk about the growing importance of open-source information to the intelligence community. Because that's something you did at the end of your career as well, and I know it's something you feel strongly about. So that's what I want to do, if that's okay with you.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tI'd love to.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo let's start with briefing. Which is where we first met. I was the briefer for President Bush, and you were the briefer for the vice president's chief of staff and national security advisor Scooter Libby and for the vice president himself from time to time. Did you enjoy being a briefer?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tI loved the job. I think I just, as you found, it is the opportunity to take the wisdom of the intelligence community and bring it to national-security problems and dilemmas that administrations are facing. And so it's an incredible privilege and responsibility. But very much feeling like you have this tremendous engine behind you and your job is to bring it to the nation's problems. Fantastic job.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tDescribe the daily routine.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tSo I think it depends on the specific briefer in terms of how much lead time they need. But generally, the briefings take place about 7:00 a.m. And depending on the amount of material you need to go through, you backtrack your arrival. So prior to 9/11, I think most of us would get in 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning and start reading the material that the operations center had collected overnight. And the president's daily brief, the book. What was in the book, reading all the background material--\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tWhich had been prepared the night before, specifically for the president?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tExactly. And so making sure that we understood what was in the book, we were lucky enough to have analysts come in and explain the products. And then, the specific tailoring that takes place to each senior policy official. So the book was designed for the president, but the vice president, or maybe secretary of defense, might look at it a little bit differently. So making sure that there's additional information to support their particular missions was a really important part of it as well. And then going down to, in, you know, my case, usually the White House, to go give the briefing and collect their questions afterwards--\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tHow did the briefing work?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tSo it depended upon where we were. If we were in Washington D.C., generally it was in the White House or the Old Executive Office building. And we'd go in and sit down one on one with senior policy makers. So in the case of Mr. Libby, it would be maybe 30 minutes and you'd go through the book and then they would have a lot of particular interests in other things. So we used to call it, there's the book and then behind the fold. So the other things, policy things or national security issues that they really cared about, we had the opportunity to give them something more tailored to their interests. And so that really was a conversation--\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tAnd that was both other pieces of analysis that were done as well as raw-intelligence information?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tRaw-intelligence information and sometimes open-sourced information as well. So it really kind of depended on what was going on issues of the day. We would come back then to report to the building what was said, what questions that came up as a result of the piece. What policy makers thought in terms of how relevant it was. Any feedback we could provide the authors to give them a sense of how much they kind of really hit the mark with the product. And that's not, \"They liked it, \"They don't like it.\" That's, \"It's really useful.\" And I think that was for analysts always the goal, right, is to be as useful as possible for the national security decision makers. After 9/11, that actually changed quite a lot. Because as you remember, we all had to get in much earlier because the stack of things to go through that was collected overnight went from maybe a four or five-inch stack to a foot-high stack. And that also brought with it the responsibilities of a much higher magnitude, right? The world had changed. And we were under attack. And so I think all of us at CIA and the intelligence community and then us as briefers felt the responsibility even more so, every day, to make sure we put the right information in front of our policy makers so that they could make decisions in time to keep us safe.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo do you have a best briefer story?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tOh gosh. So one in particular that stands out, as you know, Vice President Cheney was at the undisclosed location for quite a long time after 9/11. And the briefings took a lot longer when he was traveling. So for example, going from 30 minutes to sometimes two and three hours. And with the weight of what had happened to the nation, in, as a central piece of that, it was an incredibly demanding and frankly exhausting experience. So I came out of the briefing, went into the driveway, and -- we were lucky enough to have a driver to take us to and from places. Not because of us, but because of the materials we're carrying. And we started to drive away. And I'm chatting with him, and I all of a sudden see him in the rearview mirror.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tWhich is the vice president of the United States.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tNo, this is my driver.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tThis is your driver.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tLooking in the rearview mirror, his eyes bulge out. And he is clearly panicked. And I turn around to see the vice president of the United States of America, his photographer, his doctor, his chief of staff, and his security people running after my car. And the driver puts on the brakes and I leap out of the car. And I'm thinking, \"I'm fired. I've said the wrong thing. I forgot something important. I did something so colossally wrong that I'm going to get fired before I even get back.\" So he says, as he pauses, taking some breaths, \"Kristin--\"\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tThis is a man with a heart condition.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tYes, that's why the doctor was running too. He says, \"Kristin, so-and-so promised me that today you would bring me this document. I need to make some decisions on it today and it's not here.\" And I said, \"You have more than made your point. I will get that for you.\" And so why that sticks out to me is when we have a commitment to deliver, people notice. And sometimes decisions must be made in a timeline that doesn't fit with having the data ready. He did get the document later in the day, by the way.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo Kristin, because history matters, I want to ask you a couple of questions about Vice President Cheney and Mr. Libby. You briefed two people who history sees as having politicized or at least having tried to politicize intelligence. In a briefing context, did you ever see them try to skew an analytic line? Was that your experience with them?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tSo I guess I approach this question a little bit differently than you've asked it. First and foremost, Vice President Cheney was a politician. And they get to have political views. And he had a very strong political optic on what he thought was happening and who was responsible for what was happening after 9/11; and I think so did Mr. Libby. They tried very hard to push to say, \"Isn't this true?\" But they were very aggressive and assertive I think in saying, \"Is the world this way?\" And they got to be. Our job as intelligence analysts is, it's trite, but it's to speak truth to power. They push very hard because they had their world view. And I actually thought it was a privilege to be on the other side of that saying, \"This really matters. We're making colossal choices about where, are we going to go to war with another country. Why? Was there a role that another country played in the 9/11 attacks?\" I didn't find anything inappropriate about it. I thought it was our job to be very certain about what we told them in terms of, \"This is what we know, this is what the data says, this is our confidence in the data.\" And they had to go and make a decision based on that. So did they want it to be a certain way? Sometimes I felt that. But that wasn't really our job and our responsibility.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tDid you ever see us skew analysis to please them?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tNo. Absolutely not.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tNeither did I. Neither did I. Okay. Being an analyst. What's the job? What's an analyst supposed to do? This is for nobody who's ever been in our building and done this. So kind of the basics.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tOkay. So I think first and foremost, an analyst's job is to understand what is happening on their particular account. The subject matter that they follow. So as a new officer, there's a huge growth curve, even if someone's gotten a PhD in a subject, in understanding from a classified perspective what additional information is brought to bear on the topic that they understand so well from academic schooling. The other piece of it is the rigor with which we need to think about and write about and brief about the topics that we're covering. And as a student, there's a responsibility to do that, but the consequences are so different when we're an intelligence officer telling leaders who may make decisions based on this data. So I think the agency does an excellent job, and from the Sherman Kent School, of teaching analysts how to think about their job, how to perform on the job. And then now with the advanced analysts program, even experienced analysts get additional opportunities to further hone their skills. So the job really is communicating to policy makers what is happening in an account, why it matters, what it means to the United States, why it matters.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tAnd why it is happening and where it might be going from here.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tRight.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tWhat factors will determine where it goes from here--\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tRight, absolutely.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tAnd those factors are important because it gives them opportunities to perhaps manipulate those factors and affect the outcome?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tUh-huh (AFFIRM). Absolutely.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tYeah. So did you enjoy being an analyst?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tBest job ever. I know I said briefing--\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tYeah, but you already said being a briefer--\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tThey're all the best job ever. So I think when being an analyst, from my perspective, was such a privilege. I mean, so I was a political science major, how cool is it that I get to write something that the president of the United States is going to make a decision about? And getting a product in the president's daily brief was just the coolest thing ever. So, you know, from, like, a geeked-out, political-science perspective, it's terrific. I think the thing that maybe most people don't know is the rigor with which any piece is both conceived and written, and then edited and reviewed by senior officials with maybe a broader perspective on what's going on in my account, for example, my tie-in to something maybe I'm not aware of. Either economic issues or something else. So I think it's the quality-check effort that happens at every step that I think most people wouldn't be aware of, how committed we all are to deliver something that is as useful as possible to senior leaders.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tYeah, you know, the thrill of it, I remember from being a junior analyst all the way to being a senior analyst, when I wrote a PDB, the next morning, seeing it, right, in print, with the words at the bottom, \"For the president's eye's only.\" Right? That was like, \"Wow.\"\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tAbsolutely.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo the questions you answer as an analyst, where do they come from?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tSo it depends. Oftentimes, they come from the briefings themselves. A piece will be written for the president, for example, as you saw many times, and it will cause the president or the vice president or another leader to say, \"You know, this makes me think, what are the implications of this on another country or another set of issues?\" So they're generated by the policy makers themselves. Sometimes they're generated by senior leaders within the agency to say, \"Look, I can see what's coming here, we need to make sure we have the administration prepared\"--\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tI never did that. (LAUGHTER)\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tYou might've been a little famous for doing that. Yeah, and usually it was due within about eight hours, so. And then sometimes they're generated by analysts themselves. We can see what's coming, an analyst who has a lot of experience on it, and that account, either knows the cycle of the account or they can see that there's a change coming and they'd need to provide warning to the administration about a new development.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo Kristin, what information does an analyst have to do their analysis? And does it come to them from multiple directions? Or does it come to them in one place? How does that work?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tSo sources of information probably over the course of the career, that's one of the things that change the most. There's definitely human intelligence collected by people who are providing information to the U.S. government. There's signals intelligence, so an opportunity to understand what people are saying. There is open-source intelligence, and then reporting that we get from media or journals, things like that, that are in the public sphere. So it comes to analysts, and this is where the change is the biggest, right, it used to be probably 20 years ago, that you could read everything on your account in the morning. And then think about it for the rest of the day. And as social media has exploded, as online media has exploded, and then the just pure amount of intelligence collected otherwise, you end up with way more information than you can possibly read in the course of a day. And so then, the job of the analyst is to make sure that it's being sorted in a way that lets them see trends in data as well as read the data itself. So this is, it's a much more complicated, much more sophisticated problem than it had been, because I can only read so much. If I can read 1,000 reports a day, that would be a miracle. But if I'm receiving 100,000, we really have got to have data sets and algorithms written so that I can actually make sure I'm seeing really what all of the data says, and let the story it tells, and maybe not read each of them.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tRight, right, right. So Kristin, maybe the hardest question of all, so you've got a question that either a policy maker has asked or you've asked yourself as an analyst or somebody in between has asked. And you have all this information that you've collected. How do you come to a judgment? What is that process like? Is it a black box? And it's really tough to explain? Or is there some methodology around it? I know that's a tough question.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tIt is a tough question--\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tAnd you and I have talked about this a lot, actually.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tAnd I think there's a debate among analysts themselves about what analysis truly is, right? So I think there are several layers to it. First is understanding being current, understanding what's happening in a particular situation. But your first thing is, is it the right question, right? And so sometimes a policy maker would ask a question that isn't going to get them the answer they're actually looking for. Either it wasn't as nuanced as they might-- it wouldn't get them the sophistication of answer they needed. And so first question is, is this the right question. And if not, how do we craft in such a way that we're going to be providing the information that the policy maker needs. And the second thing is, looking at the data that's available to address the question. How am I going to approach this. What are the key parts and pieces that need to be answered to address the question and look at the data. So there are all sorts of, if the data is conflicting, if there's something there that, maybe big gaps in data, which happens all the time, right? It's always imperfect knowledge. Then there are analytic tools and techniques that you can use to try to ascertain whether or not you're getting the right answer. So one of the things I think as an analyst, in particular, we experience a big risk is in confirmation bias, right? Where I understand things so well that's happening, what I look at just confirms where I was coming from. Right? And so--\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tWhich was a problem with Iraq.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tYeah. So the 'disconfirming' information can be thrown aside. And sometimes, as you said with Iraq, WMD, that can be the most important thing that's out there. And so I think on key issues, on shifts, we thought it was going this way, it's now going this way, when it really matters, we're applying one or two or three analytic techniques to it to make sure that we're being really, really true to the data and not being caught up in what we believe. So all of those are ways of getting at the information. But the other piece of it is, with expertise, with knowledge of these tools and techniques, there's also these flashes of insight that come. And if I'm lucky enough to get one in an issue, that's fantastic. Because it says, \"Wow, I need to know at it this way.\" And then you're looking--\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tIt comes intuitively?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tRight, absolutely intuitively. And that intuition only can come with experience and insight and if you've done all the groundwork, those flashes can come. They can also lead me astray, right? So I need to then apply the rigor that we've just discussed to those flashes of insight. But those are the magic moments. When you see something that's happening, then I see something that's happening, I haven't recognized before, we know that this not what the thinking is in terms of the national-security community, and that's just a cool moment. Really a cool moment.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo the review process -- so when you wrote something, it wasn't just Kristin's view, right? It was the CIA's view. So obviously, a lot of people are interested in seeing it, particularly if it's an important issue. So what is the review privilege, what's it like, how do people feel about it?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tSo are we talking with Michael Morell as part of it or not? (LAUGHTER)\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tYou can do it any way you want.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tOkay. I say that because Michael is rather famous for being a tough reviewer. So I think your point at the beginning is the most important part, which is it doesn't matter what I think. It matters what the agency thinks. I mean, what the agency says, this is what we're comfortable with. And so the review process is painful and it should be. I need to be challenged at every layer of management to make sure that what I am saying on behalf of the Central Intelligence Agency really reflects the views of the Central Intelligence Agency. So sometimes, that ends up with very testy conversations with peers, less testy conversations with managers. But everyone is focused on the goal of providing the best product possible to the president. And I think the sausage making on that can be very difficult, but the result is absolutely worth it.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo let's take a real-life example here, okay? And I know this is one you can talk about because a lot of this has been declassified. The link between Iraq and Al Qaeda after 9/11. You were the team chief responsible for that issue. You took that job, by the way, after working for me as my executive assistant, I remember. So you were the first-line supervisor for the analysts that were looking at that question. Walk us through that from the perspective of being an analyst.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tSo that one, that job, I will never forget the responsibilities I felt as part of that. So the question at the time was, 'Did Iraq, did Saddam have a role in supporting Al Qaeda or conducting the 9/11 attacks?' And we looked at it from really three optics. It's, you know, control, direction, and then complicity. And our responsibility was to investigate, look at all the data that had ever been collected on Iraq's support for terrorism, and then anything more recent related to Al Qaeda, and make an assessment to answer this question in a very difficult political environment, when there was the potential to go to war over the answer. And so the rigor that we've talked about, applying to agency analysis writ large was even more ratcheted up at an incredible amount. Because the answer is so important. And I think the analysts on my team definitely approached it with that kind of a sophistication and understanding. So we were really looking at leadership, is there a leadership connection, are there contacts between the two. Are they providing training? Have they offered safe haven? And we investigated. The difficulty was, though, that there's really poor reporting. We just didn't have the intelligence collection that we needed to provide the kind of answers with certainty that we needed to. But at the time, we concluded that there had been some contacts, there was no relationship--\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tBack in time--\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tBack in time, yeah. Back in time. There were contacts, but there hadn't been a relationship. That there was no direction of the 9/11 attacks by the Saddam Hussein regime. And that there was no question that they both saw the U.S. as an adversary. But that we didn't see that that led them to cooperate. It was a very difficult process. So analytically, we talk about the review process. That one, as it should have been, was very, very, very difficult because we wanted to make sure we were speaking for the whole of the agency. And as terrorism analysts, we looked at things a little bit differently than regional analysts. And the priority really for even the counterterrorism center at that point was Al Qaeda itself, not Iraq. Iraq support for terrorism, though well known, though ubiquitous in the Middle East in many ways, hadn't been what caused the 9/11 attacks. And so we were really a peripheral issue for counterterrorism center. But it was a very central issue for the administration. Some of whom really believed that Saddam Hussein had a role in it.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo in retrospect, we nailed this one? We got this right, right?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tRight, so--\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tWe got the Iraq WMD wrong, but we got this one right. And people who worked on it should be extraordinarily proud of that.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tThank you. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence did a review of prewar intelligence. And I think as an intelligence officer, it's the ultimate report card, you know, how'd you do? And they said throughout all of our judgments, that it was reasonable, objective, and balanced. And I think in that horrible situation, with all of the other things that happened that were very difficult, it was a bright spot.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tOkay, Kristin. Let's switch gears for the last time and talk about your experience in the open-source center at CIA. What was your job there?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tSo my job was leading innovation and technology in the open-source center. So looking at this dilemma that we discussed a little bit earlier of the massive amounts of data that come in, that analysts and officers have to somehow try to understand what it's telling them when you cannot do that on a human scale.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tAnd what did you learn?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tWhat I learned is that the job we used to have as analysts back in the, you know, early '90s was actually a lot easier because you could put eyes on all of the data and understand it. And for analysts who are currently on the mission, they're dealing with a much more difficult challenge of this fire hose of information coming at them. And the responsibility is to extract meaning from it at a pace that would serve policy makers' and administrations' need to make decisions. And so there's a really vital need to continue to look to the private sector for the analytics tools and the data-mining capabilities to make sure that we're looking at not only what the data says, but what trends it's talking about, where it's coming from, what does it reflect. You know, sentiment analysis is one of those things that we've been -- it's a holy grail we've been after for years -- is something's happening in another country, what is the population feeling about that? Do they feel strongly enough that there are going to be protests? Do they feel strongly enough that they're going to try to overthrow the government? Or is this something where it's not really a significant development? And chasing that has been difficult. With so much online video, video storage just from data-storage perspective, we all know from our own computers, you just can't store all of that, even if we have clouds. And then how do you view tens or hundreds of thousands of hours of video? And so the challenges around capturing the information that come from those sources of information and the open source actually are tremendous. And I think increasingly, a very important part of what an intelligence analyst needs to not only see, but understand in addition to the human-intelligence signals and intelligence that's being collected.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo you're talking about the challenge of this massive amount of data as a result of the open-source revolution. But there's also opportunity here, right? There's opportunity to collect things and see things that you can't see otherwise. So--\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tAbsolutely.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\t--I do know that one of the first indications that the Russians were in Ukraine was from social media, right? Russian soldiers taking pictures of each other and posting them on social media. So there's new information to be found, right? And that's another piece of this.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tRight, no, absolutely. New information. But also, it comes with it a different level of credibility. Because if you see a video, for example, of tanks moving into a country, and it's geotagged, so you can see where it was happening, and you can see that it's going east, it's a pretty solid piece of information where--\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tEven more powerful than a human source telling you, right--\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tRight. Right, exactly. So the power of it was amazing. It's also a lot less expensive in terms of both financial resources and risk to human life. I mean, to put someone on the ground right there, to witness it would be tremendously expensive and risky. But you actually didn't need to leave your desk in some cases, where you could see what was happening. So I think one of the biggest challenges that the intelligence community faces now has for a few years and will continue to face in the future, is making sure that we're capturing this data that's available not for free, but for darn close, so that we get what insight we can without having to send someone into harm's way.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tSo how long since you were in the open-source center?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tIt's been four years.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tAnd my sense, four years ago, that we were pretty far away from where we needed to be with regard to the issue you're talking about, right? Which is harnessing this open-source information in a way that improves the agency's performance. Why do you think we were so far away? I know you don't know where we are now and what's been done since you left, but why the gap?\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tSo first of all, this is hard. This is really, really hard. And it's new. Not new, social media has been around for a bit. But the importance of open-sourc information has changed significantly over the decades. So if you think about it, open source in the '50s and '60s was really newspaper and video broadcasts and important information to understand context. But it was the source who was next to a really important senior leader that you could get insight into what that senior leader was thinking, right? So I honestly don't think people took open source quite as seriously as maybe we should have back then. So fast forward all this time, much of what happens is now in the public. Whether that's leaders tweeting or speaking publicly, whether that's, like, we were talking about the sentiment of a public, social-media platforms. So much more happens now and I think, personal perspective, is I think that that revolution and data maybe caught us a little bit off guard. Maybe not everybody, maybe there were people talking about it, but it didn't really get the attention it needed in part because there are so many other challenges that the intelligence community are facing, right? We're trying to make sure there's not another 9/11. We're trying to make sure that Russia and China, we're monitoring Russia and China and what's happening there in Iran and North Korea and many, many other areas. And I just think it hadn't gotten the focused attention that it really needed and deserved to be fully developed as the source of information it can be.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tGoing back four years, if you had been a queen, right, and you could do anything you wanted, what would you have done to have sped up the process? To have sped up the closing of that gap.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tSo remember, I'm a CIA officer, was first and foremost. I would probably have changed the mission of the open-source center just to support CIA and its mission. So right now, it supports the whole of the intelligence community and DOD and lots of others. And that broad mission makes it very difficult to go deep. And so I think bringing it to, it's not that large of an organization to bring it to a single mission where you can dig in deep and support the analysis and collection that the CIA conducts. I think that's where it could've been much, much more effective and a powerhouse. I really think it's a powerhouse for the future.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tYeah. Kristin, you've been fantastic with your time. I want to ask you one last question. We've had a lot of former senior women from the intelligence community on and I've asked many of them, you know, what is it like to be a woman in what used to be, not anymore, but what used to be a male-dominated environment. But I want to ask you a different question. You have two amazing sons. I want to ask you how easy the IC and the agency make it to be a mom as an intelligence officer.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:\tSo first of all, thank you for the compliments on my sons. They are wonderful human beings. Personally, I don't feel that it was relevant to the senior leaders who I was supporting whether or not I had kids or elder-care issues or a health issue, or whatever it was. It's not that people didn't care, it's that, well, we still have to stop the attack that's coming tomorrow. So you need to stay late. The only thing is, I think all of us, whether we're parents or not, moms or dads, we just feel this tremendous responsibility to stay. To see it through. To make sure that we ask the right question, that we get the information today to the people who need it. And the mission itself makes it very, very difficult to be there for a family the way we want to be. It's part of what we sign up for when we join the agency. In the difficult days, with the prewar intelligence on Iraq, and we're trying to decide, \"Are we going to go to war with Iraq because it supported the 9/11 attacks?\" I needed to be at work. And I would go to work at 6:00, come home at 7:30, I would put my kids to bed, and then, you know, at the time, not anymore, at the time, you could have a secure fax. And I would have my people fax their papers to me and their products and I would review them until midnight, and then I would fax them back to the operations center and my analysts would pick them up in the morning and we'd start again. So all consuming. And I have to be honest, I still feel some guilt about that today, of the times I missed. My kids being in the Washington D.C. area were aware of the kind of work that we did. They were children of the 9/11 attacks. They were terrified of Osama bin Laden personally because they saw what happened. And they're at those formative, elementary-school days where, you know, that was really powerful. So I think they are very proud of me for working to serve the American people. But it is kind of nice to have more time with them now as they're a little bit older.\t\tMICHAEL MORELL:\tYeah. You could be talking about my kids and my situation as well. Kristin, thanks for being with us.\t\tKRISTIN WOOD:00:40:22;06\tThank you for having me, Michael. \t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski testified about Robert Mueller's report in a combative hearing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, spending hours fielding questions about an incident in which President Trump asked him to direct the attorney general to curtail the scope of the special counsel's probe. Lewandowski was defiant from the outset. In his opening statement, he called the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry \"unfair,\" and Republicans on the committee agreed. They condemned the inquiry and unsuccessfully moved to adjourn the hearing. Asked by Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz about the Democrats' motives, Lewandowski responded, \"You know, congressman, I think they hate this president more than they love their country.\" During questioning, he often sidestepped and stalled, saying he would not go beyond the contents of the Mueller report. He asked lawmakers to read specific sections of the report to him to \"refresh\" his memory, and he paused at length to read passages related to the questions posed, all while Democratic lawmakers grew impatient. Under questioning by the committee's counsel toward the end of the hearing, Lewandowski was asked about answers in television interviews that contradicted the version of events described in the Mueller report. He said he had never lied under oath, but asserted he had \"no obligation to be honest to the media.\" The incident that was the subject of the hearing took place on June 19, 2017, according to the Mueller report. Then-White House counsel Don McGahn had been directed by the president to have Mueller removed, and Mr. Trump on June 19 met alone in the Oval Office with Lewandowski. He \"dictated a message for Lewandowski to deliver to [Jeff] Sessions,\" the Mueller report said, referring to the attorney general at the time.\u00a0 That message said that Sessions \"should publicly announce that, notwithstanding his recusal from the Russia investigation, the investigation was 'very unfair' to the President, the President had done nothing wrong, and Sessions planned to meet with the Special Counsel and 'let [him] move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections,'\" the report stated. Lewandowski never delivered the message to Sessions. Over the course of the hearing, Lewandowski declined to answer some questions about his actions at the time, citing privileged communications with the president and White House counsel, though he has never worked for the Trump administration. Nonetheless, there was some new information that emerged from his testimony. He offered an explanation for why he never gave Sessions the message. Prodded by Democratic Representative Hank Johnson about whether he \"felt a little squeamish about delivering that message,\" Lewandowski denied that was the case. \"I went on vacation,\" he said, adding, \"I took my kids to the beach, congressman. That was more of a priority.\" Johnson theorized that Lewandowski had another reason for not giving Sessions Mr. Trump's message. \"You knew that Attorney General Sessions had recused himself at that time, and since he had recused himself, you knew that it would have been against the law for him to comment in any way on that investigation, isn't that right?\"\u00a0 Lewandowski again denied the implication. Throughout his testimony, Lewandowski maintained that Mr. Trump had never made any improper requests, telling Democratic Congressman Steve Cohen that the president \"never asked me to do anything illegal.\"\u00a0 He later said he had wanted to give Sessions the message in a \"relaxed atmosphere,\" but it slipped his mind. According to the Mueller report, Lewandowski relayed the message to Rick Dearborn, a former senior Trump aide. The Mueller report said Dearborn was \"uncomfortable with the task and did not follow through.\" Dearborn and another former White House staffer, Rob Porter, were also subpoenaed to testify before the committee, but the White House blocked them from appearing. Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler called Lewandowski's sometimes combative testimony \"completely unacceptable,\" and said that holding Lewandowski in contempt of Congress was \"certainly under consideration.\" The Judiciary Committee voted Thursday in favor of a new resolution formalizing the impeachment inquiry and further intensifying its investigation into Mr. Trump.\u00a0 Allyson Ross Taylor, Rebecca Kaplan and Emily Tillett contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "President Trump traveled to the Florida Panhandle to fire up his staunch supporters with fiery rebukes of congressional Democrats, whom he accused of blocking additional disaster aid for the storm-hit region and wanting to give Puerto Rico \"more and more\" federal aid.\u00a0 Holding up a paper chart which purportedly showed that the hurricane-battered island has received more federal assistance than states in the mainland, Mr. Trump told the boisterous crowd, \"What the Democrats want to do, they want to give more and more.\"\u00a0 \"They complain, they want more money,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to Puerto Rico's government, which he has constantly clashed with over federal assistance to the island in wake of a pair of devastating storms which struck the U.S. territory in 2017.\u00a0 Mr. Trump told supporters that the island has received $91 billion from the U.S. government \u2014 a misleading claim he has made on numerous occasions. Although the figures are murky, Puerto Rico has not received $91 billion from Washington.\u00a0 A Puerto Rican government official told CBS News last month the island has received $300 million in funding for \"permanent work\" on the island in the wake of hurricanes Maria and Irma. The official added that several federal agencies, like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), have projected billions in relief work for Puerto Rico over the next several years, but that only a small percentage of the funds have been distributed. The president also told his supporters he's ready for a general election opponent. \"I want to run so badly. I want this race to start immediately,\" he said.\u00a0 He mocked a few of his opponents from the stage, making fun of Pete Buttigieg's name \u2014 pronouncing it \"Boot-edge-edge\" \u2014 and saying he'd like to see the South Bend mayor negotiate a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping. He asked if former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke had \"fallen like a rock?\" And he called \"sleepy\" Joe Biden and \"crazy\" Bernie Sanders \"some real beauties.\" Bringing up the tariffs he authorized to go into effect Friday, Mr. Trump said China \"broke the deal\" on trade. But he assured the crowd that his administration will ultimately broker a pact with Beijing.\u00a0 \"Don't worry about it. It'll work out. There's no pressure,\" he said of Thursday's negotiating sessions with the Chinese vice premier. Before the rally, the president visited storm-hit Tyndall Air Force Base, which is still reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Michael. Additional federal relief funds for the Panhandle and other disaster-hit communities across the country have stalled in Congress in recent months as lawmakers have failed to break a\u00a0gridlock\u00a0over additional hurricane recovery funds for Puerto Rico \u2014 which the White House strongly opposes.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 In a statement, Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, the vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, criticized the president for \"repeatedly and falsely\" claiming that Democrats were blocking the disaster aid package. \"The fact is that the President is holding disaster aid to all American communities hostage over his petty political grudge with the American citizens of Puerto Rico,\" Leahy said.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The president's visit to Florida also came as Democrats in Washington are warning of a \"constitutional crisis.\" Earlier in the day, the president claimed\u00a0executive privilege\u00a0over special counsel Robert Mueller's entire report and its underlying documents at the request of Attorney General William Barr. Echoing comments made by the Justice Department, the White House insisted that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York, is \"overstepping\" his oversight authority. Making good on his promise, Nadler and his Democratic-controlled committee voted to find Barr in contempt for not complying with the panel's subpoenas for the Mueller report. The New York Democrat told reporters that the \"stonewalling\" by the Justice Department and White House had precipitated a \"constitutional crisis.\"\u00a0 Arden Farhi contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena Monday demanding former White House counsel Don McGahn testify before Congress and hand over documents concerning dozens of subjects detailed in the Mueller report.\u00a0 Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York ordered McGahn to hand over documents pertaining to 36 different subjects concerning his time at the White House by May 7. He must also testify before the committee on May 21.\u00a0 McGahn was a prominent figure\u00a0in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The report, which does not come to a conclusion as to whether President Trump obstructed justice, said McGahn told investigators Mr. Trump twice ordered him to fire Mueller.\u00a0 McGahn refused to obey the request, fearing that doing so would set off a situation reminiscent of the \"Saturday Night Massacre,\" in which President Nixon fired top Justice Department officials in an attempt to derail the Watergate investigation in 1973. He told colleagues he was prepared to resign rather than follow through on the request. After The New York Times reported in early 2018 that Mr. Trump had told McGahn to fire Mueller, the president asked his then-counsel to release a statement disputing the report, according to Mueller. McGahn again refused, saying he \"shrugged off\" the order despite Mr. Trump threatening to fire him. \u00a0 At one point, the report states, McGahn decided he would tender his resignation to the president, only to be talked out of it by Reince Priebus, then the White House chief of staff, and Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump's top strategist. Priebus also told investigators McGahn had complained that Mr. Trump had asked him to do \"crazy s**t.\" In a statement, Nadler said McGahn's \"testimony will help shed further light on the President's attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others do the same.\"\u00a0 But Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, blasted Nadler's decision to subpoena McGahn.\u00a0 \"Don McGahn sat for more than 30 hours of interviews with the special counsel's investigation, and the chairman has answered that with a stunning 36-item subpoena,\" Collins said in a statement. \"Instead of looking at material that Attorney General Barr has already made available, Democrats prefer to demand additional materials they know are subject to constitutional and common-law privileges and cannot be produced.\" Documents subpoenaed by the committee include McGahn's communications involving the firing of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney Jeff Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia matter and the \"resignation or termination, whether contemplated or actual, of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\"",

            "article_content": "President Trump is nominating Congressman John Ratcliffe, Republican of Texas, to replace Dan Coats as director of national intelligence, Mr. Trump tweeted Sunday night. Coats will leave office Aug. 15, the president announced, and an acting director will serve in the interim. \"I am pleased to announce that highly respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by me to be the Director of National Intelligence. A former U.S. Attorney, John will lead and inspire greatness for the Country he loves,\" the president announced. \"Dan Coats, the current Director, will...be leaving office on August 15th. I would like to thank Dan for his great service to our Country. The Acting Director will be named shortly.\" Axios first reported Coats' expected departure and said the White House would likely nominate Ratcliffe, who\u00a0aggressively questioned Robert Mueller in last week's hearing on the former special counsel's report. Ratcliffe, one of the most conservative members of Congress by his voting record, has served in the House since 2015. He's a member of both the House Intelligence Committee and House Judiciary Committee, and once prosecuted terrorism cases. He took to Twitter to comment on his prospective new job: I am deeply grateful to President Trump for the opportunity to lead our Nation\u2019s intelligence community and work on behalf of all the public servants who are tirelessly devoted to defending the security and safety of the United States. In his resignation letter, dated July 28, Coats, 76, thanked the president for the opportunity to serve as DNI, which he called a \"distinct privilege.\" \u00a0 \"I have overseen the selection of new, extremely capable leaders across the IC, and within the ODNI, have transformed its focus, structure, and integration efforts to ensure you have the best, most timely, and unbiased intelligence possible,\" Coats wrote. \"As we have previously discussed, I believe it is time for me to move on to the next chapter of my life. Therefore, I hereby submit to you my resignation effective August 15, 2019.\" \u00a0 Earlier this month Coats announced the creation of a new senior-level position to coordinate election security efforts across the intelligence community. Known as the election threats executive, the new position is responsible for coordinating \"all election security activities, initiatives, and programs.\" The president's tweet ended months of speculation that Mr. Coats would either soon depart or be ousted from his role. Though he was among the longest-serving national security officials in the president's cabinet, Coats' public statements on behalf of the intelligence community occasionally ran contrary to Mr. Trump's preferred policy outcomes, stoking the president's ire. At the annual Worldwide Threats hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January, Coats said North Korea would \"seek to retain\" its nuclear program, though the president had months ago declared it \"no longer\" posed a nuclear threat. He said Iran was continuing to abide by the terms of the nuclear deal from which president Trump had withdrawn the U.S. in 2018. Coats also said ISIS' pervasive ideology meant it would continue to pose a threat, though the president had recently declared the terror group \"defeated\" and ordered the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria. After the January hearing, President Trump tweeted that \"The Intelligence People\" were \"wrong\" and should \"go back to school.\" Several times over the course of his tenure, Coats also issued delicately timed, carefully-worded statements that were nonetheless seen as pushback against actions taken by Mr. Trump. After the president's press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland in 2018 \u2013 during which Mr. Trump touted Putin's \"extremely strong and powerful\" denial of having interfered in the 2016 presidential election \u2013 Coats said the intelligence community had been \"clear\" in its assessments of Russia's actions in 2016 and said Moscow's efforts to undermine democratic processes in the U.S. were \"ongoing\" and \"pervasive.\" \"[W]e will continue to provide unvarnished and objective intelligence in support of our national security,\" Coats said. His statement followed what became one of Coats' most inadvertently memorable public moments, when Coats, during the annual Aspen Security Forum in Colorado, said he still did not know exactly what transpired in the 2018 one-on-one meeting between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. When NBC's Andrea Mitchell informed Coats the president had just invited Putin to the White House, Coats said on stage to Mitchell, \"Say that again?\" He added, to titters from the live audience, \"Okaayyy. That's gonna be special.\" He later apologized for what he said was an \"awkward\" response. Some of his other statements were more calculated. After President Trump granted sweeping declassification powers in May to Attorney General William Barr \u2013 who is conducting a review of the intelligence community's actions and assessments related to Russia's 2016 interference \u2013 Coats, whose office would normally have jurisdiction over declassification measure, said he would provide the Department of Justice with all \"appropriate\" information related to its review. \u00a0\"I am confident that the Attorney General will work with the [intelligence community] in accordance with the long-established standards to protect highly-sensitive classified information that, if publicly released, would put our national security at risk,\" Coats said at the time. \"I believe that the intelligence community is strong in part because of the way Dan [Coats] has conducted his job,\" Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Sue Gordon said in a recent interview on CBS News' Intelligence Matters podcast. \"He has played intelligence straight down the middle. And he's done it in a manner that is quiet, except when he has to correct the record.\" Gordon also said the strong relationship that Coats, a former senator from Indiana who served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, had with congressional lawmakers had also been a crucial asset. \"No matter whether the Congress is mad at us or happy with us, whether we're on the side of goodness or the side of vexing, that they will call Dan Coats, believing that he can help navigate that, has been [a] tremendous benefit,\" Gordon said. \"I don't know any DNI could've done in this time what Dan Coats has done.\" Several Democratic congressional leaders issued statements praising Coats after news of his departure broke. \"The mission of the intelligence community is to speak truth to power,\" said Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner in a tweet. \"As DNI, Dan Coats stayed true to that mission.\" In a statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, \"the departure of DNI Coats is bad news for the security of America.\" \"DNI Coats' successor must put patriotism before politics, and remember that his oath is to protect the Constitution and the American people, not the President,\" Pelosi said.\u00a0 Sara Cook, Kathryn Watson and Olivia Gazis contributed reporting.",

            "article_content": "The House Judiciary Committee has set May 21 as the date for former White House Counsel Don McGahn to testify, although McGahn has not yet confirmed his attendance. The committee wants McGahn to address the report by special counsel Robert Mueller, in particular, the part of the report that says that President Trump asked McGahn to fire Mueller, a request McGahn refused to carry out. Mr. Trump has indicated that he will not allow McGahn to testify before Congress because he already spent about 30 hours speaking to Mueller's investigators. \"I've had him testifying already for 30 hours and it's really \u2014 so I don't think I can let him and then tell everybody else you can't,\" Mr. Trump said last week in an interview with Fox News. House Judiciary Chairman\u00a0Rep. Jerrold Nadler\u00a0also threatened Tuesday\u00a0to hold McGahn in contempt\u00a0if he didn't respond to a congressional subpoena for Mueller's documents. CBS News also confirmed last week that the White House asked McGahn to publicly state\u00a0after the release of the Mueller report that Mr. Trump had not obstructed justice. A source familiar with the matter told CBS News that White House lawyer Emmet Flood made the request, which McGahn did not comply with. \"We did not perceive it as any kind of threat or something sinister,\" said McGahn's attorney, William Burck. \"It was a request, professionally and cordially made.\" In Mueller's\u00a0long-awaited report\u00a0on Russian interference in the 2016 election, Mueller did not make a judgment on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice. But Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein have cleared the president. Mueller's report, though, described 10 instances of possible obstruction by Mr. Trump, including his\u00a0order to McGahn to fire Mueller\u00a0in the summer of 2017, though Mr. Trump did not bring up the request again when McGahn refused.\u00a0 Mr. Trump tweeted Saturday night he never wanted to fire Mueller. \"Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!\" Mr. Trump wrote. Democrats are also trying to get Mueller to testify, but have not yet agreed on a date for him to appear. Mr. Trump this week\u00a0claimed executive privilege\u00a0over Mueller's entire report and the underlying documents, after Nadler issued a subpoena for the full report, including redacted portions and supporting documents.

            "article_content": "In a CNN town hall in March, Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren became the latest candidate to bring one of the most controversial political topics in America into the spotlight: \"I believe it's time to start the national full-blown conversation about reparations in this country.\" Warren is one of several 2020 presidential candidates who has advocated for a serious discussion about reparations, which is the idea that descendants of slaves should be compensated in return for the forced labor and bodily harm done to their ancestors. Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, who are both black, have discussed the need to have conversations around the issue.\u00a0 Reparatations used to be a fringe idea -- at least among white politicians -- but it's receiving more attention from mainstream Democrats in the 2020 presidential campaign. Many of the declared Democratic presidential candidates have identified a position on reparations, or at least support having a national conversation about the issue. As the topic enters the political mainstream, Americans may be forced to reckon with the racial injustices of the past and present, even if these discussions don't result in full reparations. In January 1865, as the Civil War was winding down to a close, General William Tecumseh Sherman issued Special Field Order 15, dictating that freed slaves would receive land parcels on the coast between South Carolina and Florida. The order allocated 400,000 acres of land \u2014 40 acres per family \u2014 and directed that these lands be governed by black people themselves, with the \"sole and exclusive management of affairs will be left to the freed people themselves.\" Sherman later ordered that the army could give the new settlers mules. President Andrew Johnson reversed the order in 1865, allowing the plantation owners who once owned the land to return. But the promise of \"40 acres and a mule\" for those formerly enslaved has echoed through history as a mantra for supporters of reparations: the idea that for the injustices that they had endured, some kind of payment was owed. Supporters of reparations argue that 250 years of slavery, plus a century and a half of racial terrorism, segregation, discriminatory housing policies and other injustices mean that reparations for black people are just as necessary today as they were in 1865. However, the idea has remained politically unpopular, according to recent polling.\u00a0 A\u00a02018 poll by the left-leaning organization Data For Progress\u00a0found that 26 percent of Americans supported reparations. A\u00a02016 Marist poll\u00a0also found that 26 percent of Americans believe the U.S. should compensate black Americans as \"a way to make up for the harm caused by slavery and other forms of racial discrimination.\" However, a\u00a0February Gallup poll\u00a0found that only 18 percent of black Americans are satisfied with how blacks are treated in the U.S. today. An April Pew poll revealed that 84 percent of black Americans \"believe the legacy of slavery affects the position of black people in American society today a great deal/fair amount.\" The 2016 Marist poll also showed that nearly 60 percent of black Americans support reparations. But the unpopularity of the idea may also stem from the way reparations was defined in the polling questions. For instance, the Marist poll asked whether the U.S. \"should or should not pay reparations, that is, should or should not pay money to African-Americans who are descendants of slaves.\" Direct payment to the descendants of slaves may be the simplest expression of the solution, but it's viewed by many as impractical and may not be the most effective way to try to right this historic wrong. \u00a0 In Congress, a bill to create a commission to study reparations and its implementation -- H.R. 40, named for the \"40 acres and a mule\" promise -- has languished in the House since former Rep. John Conyers first introduced it in 1989. But Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee reintroduced the bill in January. Former President Barack Obama, the first black president in American history, is among those who thinks reparations are not \"practical.\" In 2016, he said he suggested the better approach might be to throw more resources into moving children out of poverty. \"I have much more confidence in my ability, or any president or any leader's ability, to mobilize the American people around a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment to help every child in poverty in this country than I am in being able to mobilize the country around providing a benefit specific to African-Americans as a consequence of slavery and Jim Crow,\" Obama said in an interview with writer Ta-Nehisi Coates for The Atlantic in 2016. (Coates wrote a well-regarded article in 2014, \"The Case for Reparations,\" which stirred interest in reparations among white reporters and politicians.) If the economic proposals espoused by presidential candidates like Warren, Booker and Harris are any indication, they hew more closely to Obama's belief about reparations -- that the better approach might be to address income inequality across the board, and not just African-Americans hurt by the legacy of slavery and racial segregation in America. William \"Sandy\" Darity, a professor at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University and an expert on racial inequality and reparations, said that the candidates' proposed plans broadly addressing income inequality might also help to diminish the racial inequality gap, but he does not think that they go far enough to make a difference in the lives of black people.\u00a0 \"I think that the primary objective of a reparations program has to be elimination of the racial wealth gap,\" Darity said, since policies such as slavery and segregation were responsible for poorer economic outcomes for African-Americans in the first place. Darity is co-writing a book on reparations that he expects to publish in 2020.   Here are some of the candidates' income inequality proposals:\u00a0 Booker's proposed American Opportunity Accounts Act, commonly known as \"baby bonds,\" would provide every child born in the United States with a $1,000 savings bond. The child would receive up to $2,000 every year, based on family income. The child would be able to access the account at age 18, and only for allowable uses, like education and home ownership. If a family of four lives below the federal poverty line -- living on $25,100 or less -- a child would receive an additional $2,000 each year. This would give the child around $46,000 by the age 18. The size of the additional deposits decreases as family income increases; a child in a family earning roughly $56,000 would receive $500 a year, while a child in a family with an income of around $125,000 would get no additional deposits. A study by Naomi Zewde of Columbia University's Center on Poverty and Social Policy found that the baby bonds proposal would \"reduce generational wealth disadvantages and improve the net asset position of young African American households,\" and \"reduce the black-white wealth disparity from a factor of 15.9 to 1.4 at the median.\" This proposal, inspired in part by ideas floated by Darity and Darrick Hamilton of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at The Ohio State University, would diminish the racial wealth gap. But, Darity is quick to note, it would not eliminate it completely -- meaning that he does not consider it true reparations. \"I've actually endorsed this proposal but I don't view it as reparations,\" Darity said about the baby bonds. \"From the standpoint of dealing with general wealth inequality, the Booker proposal is a pretty good one. But from the standpoint of dealing with racial inequality, it's wholly inadequate.\" Booker has also introduced a bill in the Senate to create a committee which would study reparations, a companion bill to H.R. 40 in the House. Harris' proposal, the LIFT The Middle Class Act, would provide up to $3,000 a year for a single person or $6,000 a year for a married couple, given in a lump sum at the beginning of the year or in monthly installments. Working families earning $100,000 or less would qualify. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan institute, found that Harris' plan would lift 9 million Americans out of poverty, according to the Atlantic. However, the proposal is an income supplement. Because black Americans already have a far lower median income than white Americans, providing an additional $6,000 a year would not close the disparity. Pew Research Center calculated in 2014 that black median income was around $43,300, while white median income was around $71,300. \"A $6,000 allocation that goes to all families who have incomes below $100,000 will do very little in terms of closing the racial wealth gap, although it could be helpful in terms of reducing the kind of economic stresses that families are confronted with,\" Darity said. Warren's proposal to diminish income inequality is based on housing. Warren has proposed the American Housing and Economic Mobility Act, which includes a provision that would offer grants to first-time homebuyers who live in formerly redlined neighborhoods or areas which were previously segregated by law and remain low-income. Redlining occurred when the federal government denied housing subsidies to black Americans, pushing them into certain higher-risk neighborhoods. \"This enormous gap is a moral stain on our country. And because the government bears a big part of the blame for it, the government should take real steps to fix it,\" Warren said in a Medium post of the Kirwan Institute for the Study of Race and Ethnicity at The Ohio State University explaining her proposal. The post also notes that the plan has been endorsed by Professors Mehrsa Baradaran and Darrick Hamilton, who have said it \"has the potential to make a substantive dent in closing our enormous and persistent racial wealth gap.\" However, while this bill will redress some of the harm done by federal housing laws against black homeowners, not all formerly redlined neighborhoods are still majority-black, and not all homeowners seeking to move into these communities are black, due to gentrification. \"It is uniquely focused on home ownership and the barriers to home ownership that were associated with the post-World War II period for black potential homeowners,\" Darity said. \"But it doesn't address at all the huge litany of injustices that has been inflicted on black Americans from slavery to the present moment.\" Only two candidates have explicitly endorsed reparations: Marianne Williamson and Julian Castro. Castro has not yet offered specifics on his plan, although he said in an interview with The Grio that reparations could come in the form of housing reform or educational investment. Williamson's proposal\u00a0has varied in price, ranging from $100 billion up to $500 billion. Her reparations plan would not involve payments to individuals, but rather would \"apply this money to economic projects and educational projects of renewal\" for African-Americans.\u00a0 However, critics argue that this is not nearly enough: Darity has calculated that reparations to black Americans could cost a minimum of $1.5 trillion. Several candidates have expressed interest in discussing how the history of racial inequality in the U.S. could be addressed, although they may not necessarily support reparations. Sanders has been the most dismissive of reparations. In 2016, Sanders said it was \"its likelihood of getting through Congress is nil\" and that it was very \"divisive.\" At another CNN town hall in February, Sanders questioned the definition of the term when told that Warren and Castro had indicated support for reparations. \"What does that mean? What do they mean? I'm not sure that anyone's very clear,\" Sanders said, although he continued, \"As a result of the legacy of slavery, you have massive levels of inequality.\" When asked if he still believed reparations would be divisive, Sanders said, \"it depends on what the word means.\" However, in his speech at Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network convention in April, Sanders said that he would be willing to sign H.R. 40 to create a commission to study the topic. \"If the House and Senate passed that bill, of course I would sign it,\" Sanders said. \"There needs to be a study, but let me also say this, that I think that what we need to do...is to pay real attention to the most distressed communities in America.\" Sanders also supports the \"10-20-30\" proposal by House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn which would require that \u00a0a minimum of 10 percent of federal funds go to communities in which the poverty level has been twenty percent or higher over the past thirty years. O'Rourke told voters in Iowa that it was necessary to have a conversation about reparations before taking any action. \"At the root of the word 'reparations' is 'repair'...in order to make sure we repair this country, we first have to confront the truth,\" O'Rourke said, arguing that conversations need to start happening at a community level before it could be addressed by the government. \"We have to be able to have conversations in homes like this one. There has to be the political will developed so then we can take action nationally,\" O'Rourke said. At the National Action Network convention in April, O'Rourke confirmed to Rev. Al Sharpton that he would sign H.R. 40 if he became president. He added that he had \"never seen a major Democratic candidate for president talk about white privilege.\" In an interview with Esquire, Buttigieg said that \"the cleanest way\" to redress wrongs done to black Americans were to focus on policies which address inequality. \"I've never seen a specific, workable proposal. But what I do think is convincing is the idea that we have to be intentional about addressing or reversing harms and inequities that didn't just happen on their own,\" Buttigieg said. He suggested a strategy whereby focusing on housing and criminal justice could disproportionately benefit people of color, similar to the ideas presented by Booker, Warren and Harris. \"I think that's one way that we can be intentional and make a difference on this. I've just not seen a cash transfer mechanism that's been laid out that you can envision working that most people would think is fair,\" Buttigieg said. In an interview on \"The View,\" Buttigieg suggested a policy similar to Warren's, focused on assisting homeowners in formerly redlined areas. He also said that he supports H.R. 40.

            "article_content": "President Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani says it's his right to travel to Ukraine to \"defend\" his client -- to try to push for investigations that he thinks could be \"very helpful\" to the president. The New York Times first reported Giuliani's travel plans -- he told the Times that he plans to ask Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to look into the origins of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden's son's past connections to the country.\u00a0 He said there's \"nothing illegal\" about his effort to pursue probes in Ukraine, since he is not trying to carry out foreign policy initiatives on behalf of the administration. \"[T]his isn't foreign policy \u2014 I'm asking them to do an investigation that they're doing already and that other people are telling them to stop. And I'm going to give them reasons why they shouldn't stop it because that information will be very, very helpful to my client, and may turn out to be helpful to my government,\" he told the Times.\u00a0 Late Friday morning, Giuliani tweeted, \"Explain to me why Biden shouldn't be investigated if his son got millions from a Russian loving crooked Ukrainian oligarch while He was VP and point man for Ukraine. Ukrainians are investigating and your fellow Dems are interfering. Election is 17 months away. Let's answer it now.\" In an interview on Fox News' \"The Ingraham Angle\" Thursday night, Giuliani said that as Mr. Trump's lawyer, he has an obligation to develop \"explanations of what [his] client was charged with.\"\u00a0 \"The fact is, this was a massive collusion between the Democratic National Committee, officials of the Obama administration, (Hillary) Clinton people, and the Ukrainian officials, corrupt officials -- who, by the way, were pro-Russian corrupt officials -- to create false information about Trump, about (Paul) Manafort,\" Giuliani explained.\u00a0 \"This is -- this is real -- not collusion, conspiracy to present false information, and to leak it to the press, and to give it to the FBI,\" he claimed.\u00a0 Is there a double standard: Democrat alleged wrongdoing is ignored and Republican exaggerated and sometimes falsely. The media blackout of the investigations in Ukraine of alleged Democrat corruption is further proof of a double standard. If it involved Republicans, headlines. It's an accusation Giuliani has brought up several times, charging that the news media has ignored allegations of Democratic corruption involving the Ukrainian government, and that DNC officials tried to \"set up\" members of the Trump campaign in 2016 with \"false information\" about Mr. Trump. Giuliani maintains that there's a double standard when Democrats' alleged wrongdoing is ignored,\" while accusations against Republicans are \"exaggerated and sometimes falsely.\" Attorney General William Barr\u00a0has assembled his own team to investigate how the Russia investigation began, a U.S. official told CBS News.\u00a0Barr said in a Congressional hearing\u00a0that he is \"reviewing the conduct of the investigation and trying to get my arms around all the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted during the summer of 2016.\" At the same time, the Justice Department's inspector general is also investigating the Justice Department's early handling of the Russia investigation, which predates Barr's tenure at the department. He became attorney general after concerns had already been raised in the Justice Department that it might be too easy to open an investigation.\u00a0 Giuliani previously paid a visit to Ukraine as part of his work for Giuliani Security & Safety, which offers foreign governments and multinational corporations a \"full platform of security, investigative and crisis management services,\" according to the firm's web site.\u00a0 He also traveled to Kharkiv, Ukraine, in November last year as part of the firm's work to help improve security in the city. Since the release of the Mueller report, after a nearly two-year long investigation into any involvement by Trump associates in Russian meddling in the 2016 election, congressional Democrats have pushed for the full unredacted release of the report. They have issued sweeping subpoenas calling on White House officials to turn over any documents pertaining to the probe.\u00a0 But the White House is trying to block most of these efforts, most recently announcing that the president would be claiming executive privilege over the entire Mueller report and the underlying documents. The president has also vowed to fight \"all the subpoenas\" from Capitol Hill.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

In an interview for\u00a0The Takeout Podcast, Reed told CBS News Chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett that Biden's name recognition and Senate record should serve the former vice president well in a crowded primary field. But Reed stopped short of endorsing Biden. \"(Fundraising is) part of the process...he'll have to do that if he wants to be successful,\" Reed told Garrett, adding that he didn't think Biden's age, 76, would be an issue with voters, especially if he wins the nomination and squares off against 72-year-old President Trump. Garrett asked whether Reed, a four-term senator and top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, had ever met President Trump or spoken with him. \"Not really, no,\" Reed replied. Reed's committee oversees the Pentagon's budget. U.S. military expenditures will top $1.4 billion this year and next, a fact the president routinely touts. Reed also weighed in on special counsel Robert Mueller's report which examined Russian collusion with the Trump campaign in the 2016 election and whether the president obstructed justice. \"I don't think (the Mueller Report) constitutes grounds to begin impeachment proceedings in the formal sense,\" Reed said, despite calls for impeachment hearings from fellow Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren. \"There's much more to be done in terms of investigation.\" In 1999, Reed voted to acquit President Clinton on two impeachment charges, including an obstruction charge. \"We haven't seen all the evidence yet,\" Reed said.\u00a0 \"(What does) 'high crimes and misdemeanors' mean? It has no real definition.\" This week, the White House refused to allow current and former administration staff testify in certain congressional investigations.\u00a0 Reed said \"It suggests there's something there that's embarrassing at the minimum.\" The White House also indicated it would invoke executive privilege to block testimony from former White House Counsel Don McGahn. \"That would be a mistake,\" Reed said.

            "article_content": "Congress should not expect to see President Trump's tax returns, says White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Nor should lawmakers think they're entitled to see any more of the special counsel's report, he told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. In a wide-ranging interview for \"The Takeout\" podcast this week, Mulvaney also weighed in on Venezuela, North Korea, and took a jab at a recent entrant to the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.\u00a0 Here are some of the highlights: Mulvaney said that Congress will never get to see President Trump's tax returns, despite efforts by House Democrats to subpoena the information. \"They're not entitled to see them by law,\" Mulvaney told Garrett. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u00a0wrote in a letter\u00a0Monday that the Treasury Department\u00a0would not release Mr. Trump's tax returns\u00a0to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal. Neal, citing a statute that gives the chairman of House Ways and Means the authority to obtain any individual's tax return,\u00a0had demanded six years of Mr. Trump's taxes. Mulvaney called efforts to obtain the tax returns \"a pure show pony-type of situation,\" and said that House Democrats were just trying to \"embarrass\" the president. \"What's embarrassing about his tax records?\" Garrett pressed Mulvaney. \"That's what they want to know,\" Mulvaney said, adding that he didn't know if there was any embarrassing information in Mr. Trump's returns because he had not seen them. \"I don't care, and more importantly, voters don't care. Keep in mind, everybody knew, everybody who cared knew that the president didn't produce his tax records before the election, and they voted for him anyway,\" Mulvaney continued. \"So from a political perspective, this debate is over. The Democrats are trying to continue that political conversation and there's no reason to do it.\" Mulvaney also addressed other pressing issues, like the\u00a0Senate Intelligence Committee's subpoena of Donald Trump Jr.\u00a0The committee is chaired by Republican Sen. Richard Burr. For the Senate Intelligence Committee to subpoena Mr. Trump's son and \"not at least get a heads-up, I thought was -- let's say bad form,\" Mulvaney said. He said he did not know whether the president was also caught by surprise. Mulvaney said that Congress is also \"not entitled to see\" the full report by special counsel Robert Mueller, countering Democrats' argument that they have the right to see the unredacted report in order to conduct their constitutional duty of congressional oversight. \"The Mueller report was lightly redacted in the first place and redacted for reasons that everybody agrees are the right reasons to redact it,\" Mulvaney told CBS News Chief Washington Correspondent Major Garrett on this week's episode of \"The Takeout\" podcast. The Justice Department has offered to allow a few members of Congress to view a less redacted version of the report, under the condition that these members do not speak with their colleagues about the report. Democrats consider this offer unfair. \"I'm not sure how they find it insufficient. It's everything that there is,\" Mulvaney said in response to Democrats' complaints. \"They are not the Department of Justice. They do have a -- they do have a right -- by the way, it's not in the Constitution. It's been implied in the Constitution by the Supreme Court to have some oversight.\"\u00a0 But that oversight should not be understood, Mulvaney argued, as Congress' role to \"second-guess the Department of Justice\" or \"supplement their decision for the decision of the attorney general.\" He added, \"They are not the executive branch of government. They are there to make law, and their oversight is supposed to be related to their process of making law, and that's not what happened - that's not what's happening right now.\"\u00a0 \u00a0 Mulvaney discussed foreign policy as well, including American opposition to the leadership of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The U.S. has recognized Juan Guaid\u00f3, president of the National Assembly, as interim president of Venezuela, though Maduro's government remains in place.\u00a0 Mulvaney said that the U.S. will not intervene to ensure that Guaid\u00f3 becomes president. \"I don't think we're going to take affirmative action to make him become the leader. We're going to continue to back him. Is it moving slower than some people thought that it might? Perhaps, but that doesn't mean that thing are over by any means down there,\" Mulvaney said. Mulvaney also said that despite escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, the two countries are not on the brink of war. The U.S. imposed more sanctions on Iran this week. The Department of Defense also announced Monday that an\u00a0aircraft carrier strike group and Air Force bombers\u00a0would be sent to the Persian Gulf in response to \"recent and clear indications that Iranian and Iranian proxy forces were making preparations to possibly attack U.S. forces in the region.\"\u00a0 \"We have specific interests in the region. We have troops, for example, in Iraq. We have good allies in Saudi Arabia and the UAE and Bahrain. We have military assets there to protect. We have interests in the region,\" Mulvaney said about the strike group headed to the Persian Gulf. \"We are not going to war with Iran,\" Mulvaney said. Mulvaney said that the U.S. will likely impose increased tariffs on China, as the two parties are at an impasse in trade negotiations.\u00a0 \"The president said that there would be, and we're not making enough progress. We're making some, but not enough,\" Mulvaney said about imposing the tariffs amid stalled negotiations. The White House chief of staff also took aim at a frequent target of Mr. Trump, former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the Democrats running for president. Mulvaney said that the presidency is a harder job than Biden knows. \"He ran for vice president. I mean Mike Pence'll tell you there's a difference between running for vice president and running for president. You sort of come in at the end. And you give the big speeches after the guys are already nominated right? But when you're out there on the trail every single day knocking on doors - I've done it. And it is really really hard work,\" Mulvaney said.

            "article_content": "The justices are returning to the Supreme Court bench for the start of an election year term that includes\u00a0high-profile cases\u00a0about abortion, protections for young immigrants and LGBT rights, any of which could affect groups of Americans this term.\u00a0 The court met Monday morning for its first public session since late June. The first case heard was a Kansas death penalty case regarding whether states can abolish an insanity defense for criminal defendants. The justices also heard arguments Monday on whether the Sixth Amendment applies to state courts, that is, whether juries can convict criminals without a unanimous verdict. Louisiana is one of two U.S. states allowing non-unanimous criminal convictions. The term could reveal how far to the right and how fast the court's conservative majority will move, even as Chief Justice John Roberts has made clear he wants to keep the court clear of Washington partisan politics. The court is beginning its second term with both of President Trump's Supreme Court appointees, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, on board. Kavanaugh will be watched this term to see where he'll stand on some of the hot-button issues confronting the Supreme Court, CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford points out. The justices could be asked to intervene in disputes between congressional Democrats and the White House that might also involve the\u00a0possible impeachment\u00a0of the Republican president. Roberts would preside over a Senate trial of Trump if the House were to impeach him. Its biggest decisions are likely to be handed down in late June, four months before the election. The court is also likely to be monitored as the presidential campaign continues, especially because of health concerns surrounding 86-year-old Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. For now, though, the court has plenty of significant cases to deal with, including whether federal civil rights law that bars workplace discrimination on the basis of sex covers LGBT people. The justices will hear arguments Tuesday in two cases on that topic, their first foray into LGBT rights since the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who wrote all the court's major gay rights rulings. Next month, the fate of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program is in front of the justices. Lower courts have blocked Trump from ending the Obama-era program, which has shielded roughly 700,000 people from deportation and provided them with permits to work. Amid the ongoing gun debate in the wake of a series of mass shootings this past summer, the court will also be looking at a gun rights case, debating a law out of New York which makes it harder for law-abiding citizens who own guns to take their guns outside of their homes. During the winter, the justices will take up a challenge to a Louisiana law that would force abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals. It's another test of whether the change in the court's composition will result in a different outcome. With Kennedy in the majority, the court in 2016 struck down a virtually identical Texas law.",

            "article_content": "Special counsel Robert Mueller has finally submitted his long-awaited report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and any contacts Trump campaign associates may have had with Kremlin officials. And while we don't know what Mueller and his investigative team say in that report \u2014  or what will eventually make its way to the public \u2014   there are regulations in place that present a road map for what should happen next. Here's what will occur now that Mueller and his team have completed their report: President Trump's newly-confirmed attorney general now oversees the Mueller investigation, and he's the person who receives Mueller's confidential report. In that report, according to\u00a0Justice Department guidelines, Mueller must explain his \"prosecution and declination decisions.\" Barr will then submit a report to the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees explaining Mueller's findings and why the investigation ended. Justice Department\u00a0guidance\u00a0stipulates Barr should only submit a \"brief notification\" containing \"an outline of the actions and the reasons for them.\" What that means is probably open to some interpretation, but anyone hoping for a massive Starr Report-like document \u2014   from either Barr or Mueller \u2014  is likely to be disappointed. The current special counsel guidelines were written in large part because lawmakers decided the 1998 report by independent counsel Ken Starr, which contained graphic details about President Bill Clinton's sexual liaisons, went too far in publicizing private misdeeds. Barr can decide to make much of Mueller's report public if he deems it in the public interest. But\u00a0during his confirmation hearings\u00a0in January, the attorney general was cagey on how much of the report he might make public, saying he would need to have a better understanding of the regulations governing the investigation and what the special counsel report would look like to make a final decision. Alternatively, Barr's report to Congress could contain relatively little information about Mueller's findings. The report Barr receives will be confidential, and because it's possible Mueller's report may also contain extremely sensitive information regarding how the intelligence community collects information, much of it could stay under lock and key for some time. Mueller's report is likely to explain why he declined to prosecute some individuals and, as Barr noted during his confirmation hearings, the Justice Department tends not to reveal why it did not prosecute someone. However, that policy is not absolute. \"The policy is designed to protect targets of investigations if the evidence does not support indictment. This situation may be different if the Justice Department does not indict President Trump because it concludes that a sitting president cannot be indicted,\" explained CBSN legal contributor Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School and a former Manhattan assistant district attorney. \"The public interest in keeping the information private is not the same,\" Roiphe added. \"In fact, the public interest is the opposite, because the broad principle that no person is above the law would mean that Congress and the public must have access to the evidence to hold the president accountable through impeachment or political process.\" The\u00a0current legal opinion\u00a0of the Justice Department is that sitting presidents cannot be indicted. If Barr adheres to that opinion, which he is not legally bound to do, he could decide to withhold information in Mueller's report that implicates the president. But as legal expert Neal Katyal \u2014   who wrote the underlying regulations governing the special counsel investigation\u00a0 \u2014recently\u00a0explained in The New York Times, if Mueller's report suggests that the president should be indicted, Barr would have to tell Congress whether he overruled the special counsel's recommendation and explain that decision to lawmakers.\u00a0 The purpose of the regulation, Katyal said, is partly to allow Congress to act as a check on the president if the Justice Department insists a president cannot be indicted. But the report would need to be substantive enough to help Congress do that. Grand jury testimonies contained in Mueller's report are also likely to remain secret unless a court orders them made public. Some argue that a court could release the material if Congress issues subpoenas.\u00a0 During Barr's confirmation hearings, Senate Democrats said they wanted Mueller's report released to the public in full, with the exception of any sensitive intelligence matters. And Barr testified before Congress that he wants to release as much of it as he can, \"consistent with the law.\" If the Democratic-controlled House Judiciary Committee wants more information than Barr provides, it could also subpoena Mueller's report, setting up a potential battle with the White House over executive privilege, national security and the role of grand juries. That would send the decision to release Mueller's report to the judiciary. Will Rahn is a political correspondent and managing director, politics, for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "In this episode of Intelligence Matters, host Michael Morell speaks with Susan Rice, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser to President Obama. Rice discusses her career trajectory and some of the major foreign policy decisions she helped inform while serving in the Obama administration. Morell and Rice discuss the value of alliance networks and America's global leadership role. Rice also shares anecdotes from her new memoir, Tough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For.\u00a0 On America's role in the world:\u00a0\"I'm a strong believer that the United States has to have the greatest military in the world, the greatest intelligence community in the world, the greatest diplomats in the world, the greatest development workers in the world, the freest press, the best universities. We have the capacity to be and remain all of that, if we don't squander it. And I worry that we're at risk of squandering it.\" On the value of alliances:\u00a0\"This is not a world where we can bomb a disease or even a terrorist cell into submission. We don't have the capacity acting alone, even when we're at our strongest, to thwart these kinds of threats unilaterally. So we need others to want to join with us. The only way to make others want to join with us is to be a player, where they understand that there's mutual benefit to our cooperation, and that there's merit in wanting to be seen to work with the United States.\" [...]\"What I would list as the fundamental deficiency [of the Trump administration] is the denigration of our alliance networks and the elevation and burnishing of our adversaries. Everything is upside-down. For reasons that we still don't fully understand, we have a president who seems far more interested in coddling and supporting and validating adversaries who happen to be dictators, whether it's Putin or Xi or Kim Jong-un, than he does in supporting and embracing our traditional treaty allies or even our friends. And that weakens our capacity to bring countries to our side. On Russian election interference: \"The Russians every day are, through social media, through all of their disinformation and information campaigns, are trying to weaken us from within and exacerbate these divisions and cause us to hate each other and fear each other and turn on each other, whether through violence or just through completely discrediting our national cohesion and integrity, and doubting the viability of our institutions. And so when the president talks about fake news and denigrates the intelligence community and law enforcement and diplomats and now uniformed military officials, and embraces the conspiracy theories of Vladimir Putin, we're in a tough spot.\" On damaging effects of the \"politics of personal destruction\": \"I want people to understand that this politics of personal destruction that we've become so accustomed to Washington, doesn't just target the individual who opponents are trying to take down.It affects everybody who loves them, everybody who works with them, people who didn't sign up for this-- kids, elderly people. And it has a cost, a human cost.\" INTELLIGENCE MATTERS - SUSAN RICECORRESPONDENT MICHAEL MORELLPRODUCER: OLIVIA GAZIS, JAMIE BENSON MICHAEL MORELL:Susan, welcome to this show. It's certainly good to have you on. And it's great to see you.\tSUSAN RICE:It's good to be with you, Michael.\tMICHAEL MORELL:We've been through a few things together. So, yes, we'll talk about that later. You recently published a book. It's called Tough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For. Let me say first, congratulations.\tSUSAN RICE:Thank you. I appreciate it.\tMICHAEL MORELL:I know how tough it is to write a book. And you just published a New York Times bestseller, so that's fantastic.\tSUSAN RICE:As you did.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Let me also--\tSUSAN RICE:So I'm just trying to keep up with you, Michael.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Let me also say to my listeners that it's a terrific read. They should go to the bookstore. They should go online, wherever they buy their books, and they should get themselves a copy. Because when I finished reading it-- and I'm being very, very honest here-- you will not find, I think, a more honest memoir by a national security official. I don't think you'll find a more insightful account of the issues that you went through in-- during your career. And I don't think you'll find a book that offers better insight into what it's really like to be a senior national security official and the impact that that has on your life, both the good, the bad and the ugly.\tSUSAN RICE:Thank you.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So--\tSUSAN RICE:I appreciate that very much from you.\tMICHAEL MORELL:--to my listeners, \"Go buy it.\" So we chatted in the green room of Face the Nation a few Sundays ago. And we talked about interviews for books. And one of the things we talked about was, when you do an interview, you very rarely get to talk about the book. They're asking you about the issues of--\tSUSAN RICE:Yes.\tMICHAEL MORELL:--the day. They're asking you about impeachment. They're asking you about all sorts of things, right?\tSUSAN RICE:Right. So--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Because we want that quote, right, from a former national security advisor. We're not going to do that.\tSUSAN RICE:Oh, great! Yay!\tMICHAEL MORELL:Well, maybe a couple of questions at the end, okay? But I really want to talk about the book. So maybe the place to start is the title. Can you explain that to the listeners? What does Tough Love mean?\tSUSAN RICE:Tough Love means loving fiercely but not uncritically. And it's how my parents raised me and my younger brother. It's also how I've tried to raise our kids. And in many ways, also, Michael, it's how I've tried to lead my teams in government and serve our country. When you love somebody fiercely, you want to be willing to tell them the truth, whether it's what they want to hear or what they don't want to hear but they need to hear. And from the time that I can remember, my wonderful parents were insistent on trying to help me be a better person by telling me the unvarnished truth. And from that experience, from having the benefit of some tough love feedback from colleagues along the way, and mentors, all throughout, I think it's made me wiser and better. And I've tried to do the same as I've become a leader myself. And when it comes to country, as you know, as wonderful and unbelievable a country this is that you and are both so deeply committed to, we are not perfect. And we've made mistakes. And we will make mistakes. And for us to perfect our Union, we've got to be willing to acknowledge those and improve on them. So, I think it was a good summation of many aspects of my personal and professional experience. The subtitle, My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For, really relates to the subthemes of the book. And in my estimation, family, education, equality are critical things worth fighting for. And in the present context, as I argue at the end of the book, so are our national unity and the strength of our democracy, which I think in both instances is under real strain.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Director Panetta and -- I don't know if you remember this-- we were on the end of the tough love once.\tSUSAN RICE:Only once?\tMICHAEL MORELL:Once. Once. Once. We had an operational issue when you were U.N. ambassador. And it's something we wanted to do and you didn't want us to do it. And we met on a Friday here in Washington. It's where you spent your Fridays, if you remember.\tSUSAN RICE:Yes.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And we met. And we didn't have the whole story. Our team did not tell us the whole story. You had the whole story. And when you asked us about the part of the story that we didn't know about, we knew with that, that that moment, that we had lost the argument. And you said something, like, \"I love you guys, but you should have known this.\" And I thought that was a great example, I think, of the tough love.\tSUSAN RICE:Oh my goodness.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So do you think it applies to international relations as well?\tSUSAN RICE:I do, interestingly. I mean, obviously, international relations is first and foremost about interests and how interests converge or collide. But we do have friends. We have allies. We have partners. And for those relationships to endure, I think it does require at times for countries to speak difficult truths to each other. And when we fail to do that, I think we see the consequences. A great example is our relationship now with the Saudis. The Saudis have many, many imperfections. And historically, we have, to a large extent, chosen to overlook them, whether on human rights, women's rights, some of their behavior domestically as well as in the region.But in the most recent years, we've seen egregious examples, not least the murder of Khashoggi. And the United States' response has been to sweep it under the carpet. And that relationship is now frayed in many important respects, from the private sector to government, with Congress on a bipartisan basis trying to change the nature of that relationship, and the Executive Branch resisting. And the strains that that is imposing, I think, are only to be revealed in the future. I think they're--\tMICHAEL MORELL:And also--\tSUSAN RICE:--quite significant.\tMICHAEL MORELL:--also sends a signal to other countries that--\tSUSAN RICE:Yes.\tMICHAEL MORELL:--you can get away with that kind of thing, right?\tSUSAN RICE:Yes. So, what do you think? Do you think there's a space for tough love in--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Absolutely.\tSUSAN RICE:--international relations?\tMICHAEL MORELL:I think you have to be earnest with other countries, right, and not sweep things under the rug and not not talk about them. I think it's really important. Here's something I kept on thinking about as I read the book. This is a memoir. But, \"she's not done yet.\" I kept on thinking that as I was reading it.\tSUSAN RICE:We'll see.\tMICHAEL MORELL:\"She's not done serving her country, so how can this be a memoir?\" Did you think about that as you wrote the book?\tSUSAN RICE:Yes. But I may think I'm more done than you do. One thing I will say about the book is I-- in some ways it's really not your typical Washington memoir. It's pretty raw. And it's pretty personal, including going back to my parents and grandparents, my childhood, my parents' divorce and some of the struggles I've had as a mother and a daughter and a wife in the public spotlight. And I really didn't write this as a book that was intended to support or promote a future endeavor. It's a little bit too raw for that. But it was important for me to tell my story as faithfully and truthfully as I could. And to the extent that it doesn't reflect well on me or people I love, I was fully aware of why I wanted to do that, and I think tried to do it pretty unflinchingly. So, it's true, I'm-- I just turned 55, so I'm not that old. And honestly, as we might discuss, had it not been for Benghazi, and the fact that in the context of Benghazi and every year subsequently, I continue to be characterized and mischaracterized on the Right and the Left, depending what cable channel you watch. I'm a villain, I'm a victim, I'm a whatever-- none of which bore any relationship to who I am and where I came from and what makes me tick. And so I think I felt a sense of urgency once I left government and was able to speak in my own voice, rather than on behalf of the U.S. government or the president of the United States, to tell that story and hopefully impart some experiences and lessons that would be valuable to others. So, I realize that it's a little early. I could've waited till I was 75. Hopefully, I'll get there. But I also, frankly, didn't want somebody else to write my story for me before I could. And it gets back to a lesson my father taught me which is, \"Don't let others define you for you.\" And while I was serving, as you know, I didn't have a choice.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Right. Not much you can do about that.\tSUSAN RICE:It's a privilege, a huge privilege to serve. And I wouldn't trade it. But that was a cost.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So let's talk a little bit about your family. Your background, I think, is absolutely fascinating. Yourself was descended from slaves in South Carolina, I think.\tSUSAN RICE:Uh-huh (AFFIRM).\tMICHAEL MORELL:Your mother, from immigrants. I'm wondering what the conversations were like around your dining room table.\tSUSAN RICE:Well, as I write in the book, at a certain stage around the age of seven or so, they got pretty heated between my parents, who were going through a pretty difficult divorce, pretty ugly divorce. But interestingly, my mother's family, as you mentioned, were originally from Jamaica. And they came to Portland, Maine in 1912. And my grandfather on my mother's side was a janitor. And my grandmother was a maid. They had no formal education. And yet they, like so many immigrants, came to this country to try to forge a better life for what would be their children. And they had five of them and saved and scraped and sent all five of their kids to college. Two of my mother's brothers became doctors. One became an optometrist, the fourth, a university president. And my mom--\tMICHAEL MORELL:All underachievers.\tSUSAN RICE:All underachievers. And my mom, a successful champion of access for higher education for low-income people. She was known as the mother of the Pell Grant Program, and then also later in her life a corporate executive. My father's side of the family, as you said, descendants of slaves. My great-grandfather was a slave, Walter Rice. And he fought in the Union Army in South Carolina. And after the war, through the good offices of one of his commanding officers, he was able to get an education, and ultimately a college degree at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, and then went on to found a school in New Jersey that, for 70-some years, from the late 1880s to the 1950s, educated generations of African Americans. So, I come from a family where education was hugely important, upward mobility, what I call in the book \"a compulsion to rise,\" and an expectation that we all had some significant blessings, even as we may, in some instances, have begun poor, to give back. And so the debates at my dinner table, we fought, we argued, we talked about the issues of the day-- Watergate, Vietnam, the Civil Rights Movement, race, politics. I grew up here in Washington, D.C. and my parents were determined that my brother and I really face the world in which we are living. So, in 1968, I'm four years old, my brother's barely two, and Washington, the 14th Street Corridor has burned down after Dr. King was assassinated. And my parents took us down and-- me walking and my brother in a stroller-- to see the destruction and to visit the Poor People's Campaign and to understand that this was a complicated world. And so we really did grow up discussing and debating the issues of the day, and were raised with the responsibility to engage those issues, not to be simply a bystander.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So, Susan, you've been very successful at everything that you've done.\tSUSAN RICE:I'm not sure that's--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Oh, no, you have. You have--you have. You rose rapidly in your chosen profession. And you're a black woman. And you're young--\tSUSAN RICE:Last I checked. Yes.\tMICHAEL MORELL:--and you're young. And I know your parents--\tSUSAN RICE:I was young. Not anymore.\tMICHAEL MORELL:--and I know your parents had to deal with racism and discrimination. I'm wondering if you ever felt the hands of discrimination holding you back, either because of race, gender or age.\tSUSAN RICE:Absolutely. And I don't know anybody who looks like me who can say, if they're being honest, that they haven't experienced that. But I'd qualify it by saying I've felt like there have been efforts to hold me back. I think because\u00a0of the gift my parents gave me and my brother, of teaching us to believe in ourselves and to fight for ourselves and to, as my dad often said, \"don't take crap off of anybody.\" I-- as conscious as I was of people who might resist or resent me, I didn't-- and this was quite difficult-- I didn't let it inform my own sense of who I am. And so yes, there were times when particularly in the earlier stages of my career, when I was a young assistant secretary of State, 32 years old, responsible for the African continent and all of our embassies, and I was working with people 20 to 30 years my senior who were career officers, who were quite skeptical of my youth and perhaps of my worthiness to be in that role. I faced more than my share of resistance. It's hard to know, Michael, whether to ascribe it more to race or to gender or to youth. And frankly, in that context, I think I'd prioritize youth. But also, I was a brand new mother of-- and I was breastfeeding my three-month-old son in the State Department. There were all kinds of ways in which--\tMICHAEL MORELL:All kinds of issues.\tSUSAN RICE:I was not the typical assistant secretary. And yet, my parents taught me that you either persevere and do your best and don't accept other's definitions of you, or you let the bigots win. And so to me it really wasn't a choice. And the other thing, I would say, is that I had far fewer obstacles than I had supporters and mentors, who really supported and lifted me up, and from former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to former National Security Advisors Tony Lake and Sandy Berger. My first immediate boss in government, Richard Clarke, the famous or infamous counterterrorism czar--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yes, I know him well.\tSUSAN RICE:--these are all people who didn't need to take an interest in me, but did and helped me to grow and to learn, even at a very young age.\tMICHAEL MORELL:This is not a question I wrote down here, but it just jumped into my head. So when I did my book tour, I was struck at the questions that I got about President Obama. And they were tinged with racism, there's no doubt in my mind. I remember calling Dennis when I got back from one of my book tours and telling him that. Did you sense or do you sense that some of the struggles that President Obama had were because of race?\tSUSAN RICE:As president?\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yes.\tSUSAN RICE:I think so. I don't think you can pretend that there wasn't that element to it. I don't think it would be fair to say that was the predominant source of his-- the resistance he faced. I think it was primarily political, partisan politics and the effort to minimize the success of a president of the opposing party. But I'd be interested for you to elaborate on what you heard. But I think there remains a segment of society that believes that black people are inferior and that they don't deserve to hold positions of responsibility. And I think it's also fair to say that in some, hopefully relatively narrow segment of our populace, the fact that not only he was twice elected but served with distinction and without scandal and was a paragon of a happy family man, responsible and committed to his wife and children, it was hard for some people to stomach.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Without scandal for eight years, by the way.\tSUSAN RICE:Yes.\tMICHAEL MORELL:That's saying something in today's world.\tSUSAN RICE:So tell me more about what you heard on-- as you were going around and what--\tMICHAEL MORELL:It was questions about, \"Please tell us that he's not trying to weaken the country through his foreign policies.\" That was a not infrequent question. And they wanted the answer to be, \"Yes, he is weakening the country.\" It was never a question I got about George Bush, the other president I worked very closely with. So there was this contrast between the questions and the way they were asked.\tSUSAN RICE:And you ascribe that to race because the implication was that somehow he had questionable loyalty?\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yes.\tSUSAN RICE:Okay. I wonder what you'd be hearing now --\tMICHAEL MORELL:-- No, I know. It'd be kind of fun. So your interest in international affairs, where did that come from?\tSUSAN RICE:It's interesting. I didn't expect, until really my mid to late-20s, that this might be my field. I also knew, growing up here in Washington, that I cared deeply about public policy. And I was very lucky even in high school to be able to work during my summers on Capitol Hill. I was a page. I was an intern. But my focus had been on domestic issues, things like employment opportunities, education, things that contributed to a quest for greater equality. And when I was in college at Stanford, I was a history major. And my expectation was that I'd go to law school after graduation and eventually practice some form of public interest law and maybe run for a political office with a domestic focus. And then I, in my senior year, was fortunate to receive a Rhodes scholarship that allowed me to study for at least two years in the U.K., at Oxford University. And then my expectation was, \"I'll do two years and then I'll continue on to law school.\" And in those two years, I thought, \"Well, let me study something that I haven't really focused on that much. Let me study international relations.\" Because my thought was if I eventually wanted to serve an elective office, I shouldn't be a complete ignoramus about the world at large, even though that seems to be a radical thought these days. And I was going to be living overseas. And that'd be a great opportunity to do so. And so I did. I did my Master's Degree in International Relations for two years. And I fell in love with the subject and decided to stay and do my Ph.D., which required almost another two years. And so I left Oxford with a Ph.D. in International Relations and decided along the way that I really didn't want to go to law school, which I never did. And I had a series of career forks in the road. My first job after graduate school was in management consulting. And then I had the opportunity to work in the brand new Clinton White House and was offered a choice, \"Do you want to work on the National Security Council staff or do you want to work on the National Economic Council Staff?\" I was extraordinarily lucky to have that choice. And I wrestled with it, but chose national security, strangely calculating in my own ignorance that because I wasn't really sure where I wanted to land, if I wanted to make the transition from national security to domestic policy, that would somehow be easier--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Easier than going--\tSUSAN RICE:--than the other way.\tMICHAEL MORELL:--the other way. Yes, interesting.\tSUSAN RICE:And that was the basis on which I did it. And one thing led to another, and I liked it and found it really interesting and challenging. And next thing you know, it was my career.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Well, a lot of the kids I deal with today in various guises, whether in classes or mentoring them, they want to have a plan, right? Everything's planned out. And--\tSUSAN RICE:Exactly.\tMICHAEL MORELL:--sounds like you didn't have a plan.\tSUSAN RICE:Well, I didn't have a set plan that I was unprepared to deviate from. Yes, I have a kid in college now and one on her way, eventually. And I see that same thing. People are very uncomfortable with not knowing exactly where they're trying to get to. And I always try to underscore to the students I work with at American University or up at Harvard that, \"You've got time. And what you don't want to do is be so set in a track that you can't seize opportunities that you hadn't anticipated.\" My whole story is about opportunities I hadn't anticipated, that I chose to test.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yes. My daughter's going to kill me for saying this, but when she was in college, she updated her life plan every Friday.\tSUSAN RICE:And has she stuck to it?\tMICHAEL MORELL:I think she's deviated from it, but she continues to plan but not as often. Susan, how would you describe your world view, particularly with regard to the U.S. role in the world?\tSUSAN RICE:I'm a strong believer in the critical importance of American leadership and our unique and, I would even use the world that some like and some hate, indispensable ability to move other countries in partnership with us to accomplish important objectives. Now, we're in a moment which I hope is only a moment, where that capacity is in question and has been deliberately undermined by the president himself. But I believe in a strong principled engaged American global leadership. I think we're safer and richer and better as a country when we are active on the world stage, when we are actively promoting our interests and values. I'm a pragmatist, but I hope a principled pragmatist. And I'm a strong believer that the United States has to have the greatest military in the world, the greatest intelligence community in the world, the greatest diplomats in the world, the greatest development workers in the world, the freest press, the best universities. We have the capacity to be and remain all of that, if we don't squander it. And I worry that we're at risk of squandering it.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So I agree with you 100%. But that view is being challenged, right?\tSUSAN RICE:Yes.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So how do you make the case? You're traveling around the country on your book tour. How do you make the case to people that they're better off, right? If they're in Akron, Ohio, which is where I'm from, or they're in Detroit, or they're in St. Louis, how do you make the case that it's in their interest for the U.S. to be engaged in the world the way you're talking?\tSUSAN RICE:Well, first of all, let me just say as a matter of data, such as there is data, you know and I know that the Chicago Council on Global Affairs does an annual survey of attitudes, American attitudes towards the world and our leadership in the world. And theirs is, because it's an annual survey and with high-quality methodology, it's a pretty interesting barometer of how those views change. And despite what you might think, the vast majority of Americans understand and are committed to strong American leadership, a strong alliance network, even free trade. So, the public attitudes aren't as isolationist as we might suspect in the moment. But having said that, and what I argue is, look at the nature of the world we're living in today. This is not the 17th century or the 19th century. We are absolutely wholly integrated economically and from a security point of view, with the rest of the world. There's nothing that happens even in the most remote corners of the world that doesn't have the potential to affect Americans here at home, whether it's the rise of a terrorist organization, the proliferation of dangerous weapons, a pandemic flu or other disease, the consequences of climate change. All of these things that we need to worry about-- cyber threats, you name it-- are almost inherently now transnational in their origins and in their implications. So what happens in, you know, Burkina Faso, believe it or not, can ultimately have ramifications for people in Akron. And the only way know can effectively combat those kinds of threats or even traditional state threats like that rising from China or Russia, is with the active and willing cooperation, and effective cooperation, of other countries and partners. This is not a world where we can bomb a disease or even a terrorist cell into submission. We don't have the capacity acting alone, even when we're at our strongest, to thwart these kinds of threats unilaterally. So we need others to want to join with us. The only way to make others want to join with us is to be a player, where they understand that there's mutual benefit to our cooperation, and that there's merit in wanting to be seen to work with the United States. And that requires active principled leadership, based on our interests and based on our values. And it means bringing others to join us in tackling these challenges, whether it's a revanchist aggressive Russia or it's a biosecurity threat.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Would you list this as the biggest deficiency of this administration, what you just talked about?\tSUSAN RICE:What I would list as the fundamental deficiency is the denigration of our alliance networks and the elevation and burnishing of our adversaries. Everything is upside-down. For reasons that we still don't fully understand, we have a president who seems far more interested in coddling and supporting and validating adversaries who happen to be dictators, whether it's Putin or Xi--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Kim Jong-un.\tSUSAN RICE:--or Kim Jong-un, than he does in supporting and embracing our traditional treaty allies or even our friends. And that weakens our capacity to bring countries to our side. We work together through issues of all sorts-- counterterrorism, the Ebola epidemic, dealing with the Iran nuclear threat. Not one of those issues could be addressed effectively without our allies.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Susan, let me ask you about some of the issues that you were involved in during your career, get you to talk a bit about how they were handled then and what you think you learned from them in retrospect. And maybe the place to start is Somalia in the aftermath of Blackhawk Down.\tSUSAN RICE:Well, this is 1993. I'm a 28-year-old staffer on the NSC, National Security Council. My portfolio, my job was to be the junior staffer responsible for the United Nations and peacekeeping. And so I had a sort of front row seat, though not a real decision-making role, when it came to Somalia and subsequently Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti, all these challenges of that era. And what was so striking to me in the moment, but also in retrospect on Somalia-- and I'd be interested if you have a perspective on this from your time-- we had over 20,000 or approximately 20,000 U.S. servicemen and women, I presume, deployed in Somalia, in what had become a hot combat situation, having morphed from a humanitarian intervention. And the National Security principals, the Cabinet-level officials who, as you and I know are supposed to sit around that table in the situation room and wrestle with the most important issues, weren't really engaged on Somalia. The deputies were. But until we lost our 18 servicemen on October 3rd, 1993, the principals really weren't grasping that issue as theirs. And once the tragedy hit, the president, then Clinton, was under enormous pressure from a Democratically-controlled Congress, to withdraw are forces precipitously from Somalia, cut and run, at great detriment both to the mission and to our standing and to our counterterrorism interests. And we just were playing catch-up. So one of the key lessons I learned from that experience was the importance of the senior-most officials remaining hands-on and engaged when we have U.S. military personnel deployed in hot combat situations or those that have the potential to become that, and not wait for a crisis, for that kind of care and attention. The other thing I learned is how counterproductive, on occasion, Congress's intervention can be in national security. Now we've seen it work in positive ways on other occasions. But Congress really pulled the rug out from under a new president and compelled us to withdraw the military from Somalia, I think, prematurely. And so seeing how Congress can parachute in with very little knowledge and a lot of impact and force decisions that may not be in the national interest, was another key lesson.\tMICHAEL MORELL:So I was working on Asia at the time. And one of the things that struck me was the lesson that the Chinese took from our withdrawal. Because the Chinese said to themselves, \"The United States of America is not willing to spill blood. They are weak.\" Now that turned out to be a wrong assessment, right, given what we did in the aftermath of 9/11. But sometimes we don't think about the impact that what we do has outside of the narrow issue that we're looking at, right?\tSUSAN RICE:And it also sent a message to terrorists like Mohamed Hadid who was the clan leader who was responsible for shooting down those helicopters, that the way to get America out of your territory, if you don't want them there, is to spill some blood.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Spill some blood. Yes. The genocide in Rwanda.\tSUSAN RICE:Six months after Blackhawk Down, one week after Congress had ordered the last Americans to leave Somalia, as you'll recall-- and we're in early April 1994-- the plane carrying the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were shot down. The plane was shot down. And the genocide ensued, a very carefully orchestrated planned genocide, that within 90 days or so resulted into-- up to one million lives lost. Again, I had a front row seat, though not a decision-making role on that horrific tragedy. And what struck me again was that we were so, I would guess-- I'd say paralyzed by-- and traumatized by the experience of Somalia that we did the normal things that you do in a crisis like that. You get your people out of harm's way. You vote in the Security Council, etcetera. But we never actually considered the question of whether the United States or the United States working with others or the United States enabling others, should intervene to try to stop the killing. Now I'm not necessarily here to argue that the answer should've been yes, although I think you could make a case for that. But what I did learn is that the failure to even confront the question at any stage, the failure of the Congress to call the question, the failure of any editorial page in this country of any note to raise the issue of, \"Should the United States do something to stop the killing,\" before it was too late, never was-- never arose. And so the lesson I took from Rwanda-- I took many lessons-- but the critical lesson was that we have to call the question. And we have to force decision-makers to weigh the risks and the benefits of action or inaction, because they both have huge costs and consequences, as you and I know.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Do you think the question wasn't called because it was in the middle of Africa?\tSUSAN RICE:I think the question wasn't called because it was unthinkable, literally unthinkable. And therefore nobody thought about it. To consider putting U.S. forces back into an even more remote part of Africa that nobody had even heard of, after Somalia, literally seven days, as I said, after the last American forces were ignobly removed from Somalia. So I think that, yes, it was because it was Africa, but that it was more than that. We'd just gotten badly burnt, so nobody was thinking about putting their hands back in the fire.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And let's jump forward then to the Obama Administration. Let me ask you about two issues. One is the intervention in Libya. How did you think about that then? And how do you think about it now?\tSUSAN RICE:So, I write, as you know, at some length in the book about Libya. And both the process we underwent in the situation room to make a judgment about whether or not the United States should act with allies to try to prevent Qaddafi from slaughtering tens of thousands, as he was about to do in Benghazi, the second largest city in Libya, in the middle of this Arab Spring uprising in Libya, and I was among those who are argued that we should intervene. And by intervene in that case, what it meant was using our air power with other NATO countries and Arab countries, with the authorization of the United Nations which I worked to obtain as U.N. ambassador, to prevent Qaddafi from the air, from moving his military columns into Benghazi, and to protect civilians. We got the authority from the Security Council to do it. We had the support of our allies. And I argued we should do it because I assessed that the risks to our interests were significant if Qaddafi were allowed to kill with impunity, and that the costs to the United States were relatively low. It wasn't going to involve a ground combat operation. It was a relatively finite endeavor. And it enabled us to save substantial numbers of lives, using a unique American capacity, which was our overwhelming air power. So, I supported it. I think, as I write in the book, our failure came in the aftermath, after Qaddafi was removed. And the failure was, a lack of attention and investment of time and resources into the question of, \"How do we help Libya build a stable post-Qaddafi society,\" when it had no government institutions and no experience with anything other than one-man rule. And it's a failure that I think lies at the hands of the United States but also the European partners, the United Nations, the Africans and the Arabs who all had a stake in Libya's future. And I think honestly-- Mike, I'd be interested in your sense on this-- I think because there were-- we were divided as a government going into that decision, that President Obama had to make a tough call, \"Do we do it or not do it?\" Basically half of his team said, \"Yes,\" and the other half said--\tMICHAEL MORELL:I've never--\tSUSAN RICE:--\"No.\"\tMICHAEL MORELL:--seen the room more split than it was on that occasion.\tSUSAN RICE:I think the people who'd thought it was a bad idea weren't interested in spending much time on the problem thereafter. That's the polite way to put it. It's not that they wanted to sabotage the outcome. I just think it was a question of, this was not something they were committed to, not something they wanted really to do. \"Okay, we did it, we're done, bye.\" And I think as we've learned the hard way in so many other contexts, including now Libya, you break it, you buy it, to some extent. And we weren't buying the responsibility of building the Libyan nation, but we could have and I think should have, in those early months, been more hands-on. And then Benghazi happens a year later. And Washington wants to have nothing to do with Libya at that point, and not just within the Administration. And it wasn't really until the president's second term, and arguably a new team-- I came down as National Security advisor, we had Secretary Kerry, we had Hagel-- it was a different team-- didn't have that sort of same hangover. And the president had a sense of urgency about trying to put Humpty Dumpty back together if we could. And so we finally, belatedly, I think, devoted a level of effort and attention that was more commensurate with the challenge. But I think it was too late. And so we'll never know, in my judgment, whether or not had we tried early enough with sufficient effort and energy, whether we could've made a difference. We'll never know. I believe we know we didn't try sufficiently.\tMICHAEL MORELL:I wrote about this in my book. I think there's a intelligence community failure here, too, not to lay it all on the intelligence community. But we never wrote a piece for you guys, a memo, whatever you want to call it, we never put in front of you a piece of paper that said, \"The aftermath is going to be extraordinarily difficult. Here's why.\" Right? \"And here's all the things, all the challenges that you're going to face in the aftermath.\" We didn't do that.\tSUSAN RICE:Before the decision or at any--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Before the decision.\tSUSAN RICE:--or at any point, really.\tMICHAEL MORELL:At any point, right. Because that just didn't happen. Maybe the toughest of it all, Susan, toughest one of all--\tSUSAN RICE:Syria.\tMICHAEL MORELL:--Syria. So our limited intervention in Syria. And every single senior Obama Administration official I've had on this show has said, \"I think about this a lot.\"\tSUSAN RICE:I think we've all agonized over it. I deal with this at some length, as you know, in Tough Love. And I really think that we have to be disciplined about recognizing there are three aspects to the Syria challenge that we faced. The easiest one came later, which was after the rise of ISIS and the question or whether or not the United States and allies should intervene to try to defeat ISIS in Syria and Iraq. President Obama saw that essentially as a no-brainer. The answer was, \"Yes.\" And we've been fighting that fight until recently. Second question, which was harder, that we wrestled with, was when Assad employed chemical weapons in 2013 and crossed the president's so-called \"redline,\" should the president have struck as we-- using military force in a limited fashion to punish Assad for using chemical weapons without Congressional authorization? President Obama, as you'll recall, was ready to do it, and decided close to the 11th hour that it would wise to seek Congressional approval first, in order to give us flexibility, which frankly, as you'll recall, we didn't really have in Libya, legal flexibility, in case that initial set of military strikes evolved into a more sustained commitment. I, as you may remember, was the only principal, senior person at the table who argued that we should not wait for Congressional authorization; we shouldn't bother to get it, because I didn't think we could get it. Mine was not a policy judgment in that moment, more as a political judgment. And, of course, as the National Security advisor I'm not supposed to be the political expert, especially when you have four sitting senators at the table, or former senators at the table. So, president made the decision to seek Congressional authorization. We didn't get it. We went on with the president's leadership to negotiate with the Russians and the Syrians in the U.N., the removal and the destruction of 1,300 metric tons of chemical weapons, which we thought at the time was the bulk of the stockpile. And then, of course, we saw in 2017 and 2018 that chemical weapons were used again. And Trump struck, using Obama's target list, and had one night of military strikes, which I supported in that moment. But nothing changed. Whatever chemical weapons were there, still are there, and probably more. So that resulted in zero being removed and destroyed. So, in my judgment, both were unsatisfactory outcomes. Because whatever was there is still there, and probably more. The third issue-- and this was the hardest one, as you know-- is to what extent should the United States get involved on the side of the Syrian opposition to topple Assad? As you know as well as anybody, we wrestled with that ad nauseam for years. And this was another issue that divided us as principals. There were those who thought we ought to get more actively involved-- no-fly zones, safe zones, striking Assad's air force. And there were others who thought that the risks and costs outweighed the benefits. But nobody believed that what was happening in Syria was acceptable, from any perspective-- humanitarian, strategic or what have you. I actually was in the same place then and now as President Obama, taking the view that at the end of the day we should not get directly militarily involved against Assad. Because I didn't think that was going to be a limited engagement like Libya, but a long-term costly ground commitment, more like what we had to do to remove Saddam Hussein. And I didn't think, given all that we had going on in Afghanistan, Iraq, elsewhere, that this was a wise commitment of our resources. But obviously came at a huge cost. And--\tMICHAEL MORELL:Largely borne by the Syrian people.\tSUSAN RICE:Largely borne by the Syrian people and also by Syria's neighbors, and even arguably by Europe. And I don't know anybody who worked intensively on that issue that feels good about the outcome.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Let me ask a few questions about Benghazi, which enveloped both of us. We could actually talk about it for hours, probably. But just three quick questions. In my mind, Susan, this was raw winner-take-all, ugly politics, in my view all designed to undermine the president and to weaken Secretary Clinton's chances of being elected president, which I think at the end of the day, it turned out that it played a role in that. At the time, as I look back on it now, it sort of foreshadowed the ugly politics of today.\tSUSAN RICE:It sure did.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And I wonder if you kind of look at it from the perspective of this being the first data point in this new politics that we live in.\tSUSAN RICE:I don't know if it's the first, but it's a big data point. And we weren't able to see it as such in the moment. Benghazi looks like pattycake compared to what we're dealing with now. And you and I both were, for a sustained period and arguably still are in the crosshairs over that. And yet, you and I were senior officials-- in my case, Senate-confirmed and political appointees, and therefore, arguably, knew what we were getting ourselves into. Today, this politics of personal destruction, which I think, sadly I experienced in my limited way, is being meted out by the president of the United States against almost unknown civil servants, career officials who never signed up for the public spotlight. And their character, their careers, their integrity is being maligned and impugned in the same way that ours was, certainly mine was. It's exponentially worse.\tMICHAEL MORELL:I'm going to ask about family as well. You and I both know that false accusations have impacts on family. You write about it very honestly in the book, specifically the impact on your daughter. Was that a tough decision?\tSUSAN RICE:To write about it?\tMICHAEL MORELL:Uh-huh (AFFIRM).\tSUSAN RICE:No. I had to write about it. And I had to get, obviously, her permission. By the way, this is her 17th birthday today.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Oh, happy birthday.\tSUSAN RICE:And she's doing great. So that's where I'll begin this story. A happy, healthy successful high school student. But she was nine at the time. And she began, say, six weeks after I'd appeared on the Sunday shows to complain that she was seeing images of men coming at her out of walls. She'd be in the classroom at school in third grade or at a sleepover at a friend's house or even in their own bedroom. And she was, in effect, hallucinating. And obviously her dad and I were completely freaked out. And we took her to Children's Hospital here in Washington. And for a couple of weeks they put her through a battery of tests. They were trying to figure out is-- the most likely explanations were brain tumor, some kind of psychosis or schizophrenia, perhaps a vision problem. And they eventually ruled out all those worst-case scenarios and we're left sort of by process of elimination with the conclusion that she was in all likelihood having a stress reaction to what was happening to me. This went on for months and months. And my husband and I realized that we had failed to understand that a television in the background, that we were able to tune out, was really hard to process for a kid at that age. And all she knew was that her mother was being attacked. And that was how she reacted. It was infuriating. And of all the things that I want to share about that experience-- and I talk about it, the effect on my mom, too, who was quite ill-- I want people to understand that this politics of personal destruction that we've become so accustomed to Washington, doesn't just target the individual who opponents are trying to take down. It affects everybody who loves them, everybody who works with them, people who didn't sign up for this-- kids, elderly people. And it has a cost, a human cost. And so once my daughter agreed to let me include that, I was-- I wanted to do so.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Susan, let me just ask you one more question. You've been amazing with your time here. So you say something in your book that I think is absolutely 100% on the mark, which is that the biggest threat we face is not from overseas. It's our broken political system.\tSUSAN RICE:Our domestic political divisions.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yes. How concerned are you about that? Is our democracy at risk? How do you think about that?\tSUSAN RICE:I'm deeply concerned about it. And yes, I do think our democracy is at risk. But at the end of the day, as I also write, in the last chapter of the book called Bridging the Divide, where I sort of delve into this whole question of how our divisions are-- constitute a threat, and the kinds of steps that we can take to address them, I end up at a point of optimism because I'm a student of history, in many respects. And if you look back over the course of our existence as a nation, we've been through multiple periods of far more stark and violent divisions, from the Civil War to Reconstruction, the experience of two world wars followed by McCarthyism, the Vietnam Era where students were being shot on our campuses, the Civil Rights Era where people like me had dogs sicced on them and water hoses and our cities burnt down due to rioting? That's not where we are today. And through each of those extraordinary periods of challenge, we emerged whole and arguably stronger.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Stronger.\tSUSAN RICE:And so I say, really the last lines of the book are, \"Nobody's ever won by betting against the United States of America's long-term capacity to grow and change and renew itself. And they'd be foolish to start now.\"\tMICHAEL MORELL:And nobody's ever--\tSUSAN RICE:I believe that.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Yes. Nobody's ever won betting against human freedom at the end of the day.\tSUSAN RICE:At the end of the day. That's exactly right. But we've got huge amounts of work to do. Our ability to beat this challenge depends on a will to do it and a sense of urgency, and recognition that these divisions are doing, above all, Russia's job for them. The Russians every day are, through social media, through all of their disinformation and information campaigns, are trying to weaken us from within and exacerbate these divisions and cause us to hate each other and fear each other and turn on each other, whether through violence or just through completely discrediting our national cohesion and integrity, and doubting the viability of our institutions. And so when the president talks about fake news and denigrates the intelligence community and law enforcement and diplomats and now uniformed military officials, and embraces the conspiracy theories of Vladimir Putin, we're in a tough spot.\tMICHAEL MORELL:And--\tSUSAN RICE:We've got to confront it. And I talk about in the book, a whole range of things we can do from the personal, individual level. I've experienced these personal-- these political divisions in my own family. I have a very, very conservative--\tMICHAEL MORELL:You do.\tSUSAN RICE:--son.\tMICHAEL MORELL:You do.\tSUSAN RICE:And he's an--\tMICHAEL MORELL:So do I, by the way.\tSUSAN RICE:--active political--\tMICHAEL MORELL:I don't know how that happened.\tSUSAN RICE:I've got a very progressive daughter and I've got a husband who sits with me in the middle trying to keep food from flying at the table. But we've got things we can do individually and personally. We've got things we can do in terms of how we educate our children and teach civics and teach civil discourse. There are things we can do to reform our political system that would eliminate the power of the extremes, or reduce the power of the extremes. And then I throw out some pretty provocative ideas, including mandatory national civilian service for everybody in this country, 18 to 22, to spend six to 12 months working with people from vastly different backgrounds, living with people from vastly different backgrounds, doing things that benefit all of us, whether it's reforestation or laying broadband or what have you. And I suggest that, as costly and dramatic a step as it might be, because I really believe that it's very hard to hate somebody when you actually know them. And that's the kind of step we need to be willing to contemplate if we're going to beat this moment.\tMICHAEL MORELL:Susan, thank you for taking so much time to be with us. The author is Susan Rice. The book is Tough Love: My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For.\tSUSAN RICE:Thank you so much Michael. Appreciate it very much.\t* * *END OF TRANSCRIPT* * *",

            "article_content": "President Trump, while at the United Nations General Assembly\u00a0(UNGA) Tuesday, announced in a pair of tweets that he's authorizing the release of the full transcript of his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The transcript will be released to the public Wednesday. \"I am currently at the United Nations representing our Country, but have authorized the release tomorrow of the complete, fully declassified and unredacted transcript of my phone conversation with President Zelensky of Ukraine,\" he tweeted. ....You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time! \"You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and, unlike Joe Biden and his son, NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!\" Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the UNGA on Monday, the president had said he hoped reporters would see the transcript of the call, but later admitted he didn't necessarily want to release the transcript. \"I may do it because it was a very innocent call on both his part and mine,\" he said Monday of releasing the transcript of the call with Zelensky.\u00a0 There have been growing calls for transparency over the president's call, which is the subject of a whistleblower complaint filed by someone in the intelligence community. The intelligence community's inspector general (ICIG) found that the complaint was both credible and of \"urgent concern.\" The ICIG was supposed to turn the complaint over to the House Intelligence Committee, but the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has declined to do so, citing the fact that it contains privileged communications. The acting DNI has also said the complaint is not a matter of urgent concern. The president has\u00a0confirmed that during the call with Zelensky, he discussed former Vice President Joe Biden\u00a0and withholding foreign aid to Ukraine. He said Sunday, \"The conversation I had was largely congratulatory, with largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place and largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\" The president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, have accused Biden of acting inappropriately by pushing Ukraine to oust then-prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who was considered by the U.S. government and European leaders to be corrupt. Shokin was ultimately ousted by the Ukrainian parliament. He had opened an investigation into a Ukrainian natural gas company whose board members included Hunter Biden, the former vice president's\u00a0son, but according to Bloomberg, the investigation was dormant when Shokin was removed. As the White House releases the transcript, the president could in fact be meeting with Zelensky for the first time since news of the controversial call came out. He is also scheduled to address the press at the close of the UNGA. Moments after Mr. Trump tweeted about the impending release of the transcript, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff announced on Twitter the whistleblower hopes to testify before his committee. \"We have been informed by the whistleblower's counsel that their client would like to speak to our committee and has requested guidance from the Acting DNI as to how to do so,\" Schiff tweeted. \"We're in touch with counsel and look forward to the whistleblower's testimony as soon as this week.\" Meanwhile, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday that the House is launching a formal impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump, setting up a dramatic constitutional clash just over a year before the presidential election. \"Today I'm announcing the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,\" Pelosi said at the Capitol. The inquiry marks just the fourth time in American history a president has faced a viable threat of impeachment.",

            "article_content": "One of the key congressional panels leading the charge with ongoing probes into the Trump administration is set to hold a series of hearings on the findings laid out in former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia report. The nearly two-year long probe into the president's ties to Moscow came to an official close last week after Mueller announced his resignation from the Department of Justice and subsequent closure of the special counsel's office.\u00a0 The House Judiciary Committee will hold the hearings beginning next week, Chairman Jerry Nadler announced Monday. The first hearing will feature testimony by John Dean, the former White House counsel whose bombshell testimony during Watergate paved the way for President Nixon's resignation.\u00a0 \"These hearings will allow us to examine the findings laid out in Mueller's report so that we can work to protect the rule of law and protect future elections through consideration of legislative and other remedies,\" Nadler said. \"Given the threat posed by the President's alleged misconduct, our first hearing will focus on President Trump's most overt acts of obstruction. In the coming weeks, other hearings will focus on other important aspects of the Mueller report.\" The hearings come after Mueller, in his first public statement about his Russia probe, explained that his team of investigators did not explicitly exonerate Mr. Trump, and instead offered reasoning why his office never considered indicting him for obstruction of justice. \"As set forth in the report, after the investigation, if we had confidence that the president did not clearly commit a crime, we would have said so,\" he said at the Justice Department last week.\u00a0 Despite Congress' multiple appeals to the special counsel to testify in-person on the nearly 400-page long Russia report, Mueller indicated he would prefer not to testify before Congress, as many Democrats had hoped.\u00a0 \"Any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report. It contains our findings and analysis, and the reasons for the decisions we made. We chose those words carefully, and the work speaks for itself,\" Mueller said. \"The report is my testimony. I would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before Congress.\" The panel has already held two public hearings into the president's alleged crimes, as well as Democrats' ongoing concerns over possible abuse of executive authority. Over the course of the panel's Russia probe, numerous administration officials have successfully dodged congressional subpoenas to appear before the body, claiming executive privilege.\u00a0 The first hearing in the series, entitled \"Lessons from the Mueller Report: Presidential Obstruction and Other Crimes,\" will take place on June 10 and feature testimony from Dean, former U.S. attorneys and legal experts. Rebecca Kaplan contributed to this report.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "The House Intelligence Committee is probing whether attorneys for President Trump and his family obstructed the committee's Russia investigation by shaping testimony from key witnesses, including Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff sent detailed document requests on March 14 to Abbe Lowell, Alan Futerfas, Alan Garten and Jay Sekulow, who represent Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., the Trump Organization and the president himself, respectively. \"As part of its investigation of foreign influence in the U.S. political process during and since the 2016 U.S. election,\" Schiff wrote, the committee is \"investigating efforts to obstruct authorized into these matters, including any attempt to impeded, obstruct and/or mislead the committee.\" According to a letter sent in response to Schiff and Ranking Member Devin Nunes on April 5, lawyers representing those attorneys have so far dismissed the committee's requests. \"Although the Committee has important responsibilities over this country's intelligence agencies, we are at a loss to see how that charge justifies your sweeping and unprecedented requests to our clients,\" they wrote to the committee. The New York Times first reported the dispute on Tuesday.\u00a0 On May 3, Schiff called the group's objections \"without merit\" and set a since-missed deadline of May 10 for document delivery. The committee, Schiff wrote, \"had a good faith basis to believe ... your clients ... may have engaged in efforts intended to obstruct authorized investigations.\" \"Among other things, it appears that your clients may have reviewed, shaped, and edited the false statement that Cohen submitted to the committee, including the omission of material facts,\" he wrote. \"In addition, certain of your clients may have engaged in discussions about potential pardons in an effort to deter one or more witnesses from cooperating with authorized investigations.\" A committee spokesman said the committee would be \"negligent not to pursue\" its leads.\u00a0 \"Material in the committee's possession, as well as Michael Cohen's committee testimony and admissions to the Special Counsel's Office, raise serious, unresolved concerns about the obstruction of our committee's investigation that we would be negligent not to pursue,\" the spokesperson said. \"If any individual is allowed to lie to our committee or encourage others to do so, hide behind inapplicable privileges, or otherwise fail to provide anything less than full cooperation, other witnesses will be emboldened to similarly obstruct, both now and in the future. We must not allow that to happen.\" Cohen reported to federal prison last week to begin serving a 3-year sentence for crimes including tax evasion, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations.",

Bernie Sanders, once the gadfly long-shot contender for the 2016 Democratic nomination, is now a frontrunner in the 2020 primaries with over $18 million raised in the first quarter. And his signature issue -- an ambitious plan to supply health care to all Americans known as \"Medicare for All\" -- has won the support of several of Sanders' rivals for the Democratic nomination.\u00a0 Sanders' reintroduced his Medicare for All bill on Wednesday. The legislation is co-sponsored by Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker and Kamala Harris -- all of whom are Democrats running for president.\u00a0 Standing before a bevy of Medicare for All supporters, Sanders said in a press conference Wednesday that his bill would ensure that health care is treated as a universal right. Medicare for All would extend the popular health program for seniors to apply to every man, woman and child in the country. Sanders told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe Tuesday that Medicare for All would cover basic health needs, but not cosmetic issues. \"In my view, the American people are increasingly clear. They want a healthcare system that guarantees healthcare to all Americans as a right,\" Sanders said in the press conference Wednesday. Sanders was not the only presidential candidate touting Medicare for All at the press conference. Gillibrand -- who has a far lower profile than Sanders and lags behind him in the polls -- gave a rousing speech on the topic, saying, \"health care must be a right, not a privilege.\" \"This is a moment when we have to decide what kind of country do we want to be, and this is a decision that every one of us has to\u00a0 make now,\" Gillibrand said in her comments. \"We have to say will we fight for this democracy, will we take back this democracy.\" However, Republicans have been eager to seize on prominent Democrats' support of Medicare for All, which would likely require major tax increases to implement. Some of President Trump's supporters believe that Medicare for All will end up helping him in the election. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called Sanders' bill a \"government takeover\" which would make the U.S. a \"socialist country.\" \"Democrats just announced their government takeover of healthcare plan which confiscates every American's private health insurance. Stand with President Trump so America will never be a socialist country!\" Sanders wrote on Twitter. Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "With 100 days left until the \"first in the South\" Democratic presidential primary in South Carolina,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell\u00a0says that more than a dozen candidates have made nearly 100 visits combined to the Palmetto State. According to the\u00a0Post & Courier, that has amounted to more than 460 events held by dozens of candidates since the start of the race.\u00a0 While some of those candidates have since suspended or ended their presidential bids, former Vice President Joe Biden has remained the frontrunner in the state by at least 22 points since the summer. In the November\u00a0CBS News Battleground Tracker, he outpaced the field by 28% as Democrats' first choice for nominee in the state. Though Biden has sustained a steady lead in the state,\u00a0Mitchell\u00a0reports that it's author Marianne Williamson who has spent the most days in the Palmetto State (30 days) and California Senator Kamala Harris has visited more times than any other candidate since launching her campaign. This weekend, Harris will return to South Carolina for her 15th visit. According to a campaign press release, she will be appealing to supporters at the \"Black Women's Weekend of Action.\" South Carolina state Representative Patricia Moore Henegan was one of Harris' earliest supporters in the state and she says that the senator's \"hands-on\" approach to community outreach is what makes her campaign unique in the state. \"When you're running for office, you want people to know you and it's not just from reading about you but to truly know you and then to watch how you interact with people,\" said Henegan. She added that early on she noticed that Harris would hug voters at events and displayed a knowledge of the importance of connecting with voters. Another candidate that has made regular stops through the state is Senator Cory Booker, who has received seven new endorsements from community leaders in the state following his performance in the fifth Democratic presidential debate. While his team is stacked with experienced state politicos, he hasn't polled above 4% in the state according to CBS News Battleground trackers. During an event at the College of Charleston earlier this month, however, Booker told a crowd of over 100 attendees that it's still early and polls are meaningless. He also added that then-Senator Obama was down in state polls at this time in 2007. Leading in the amount of paid South Carolina staffers is Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders with 62 paid staffers, half of whom are native to the state, according to South Carolina campaign spokesperson Michael Wukela.\u00a0 On Wednesday, the team announced a shake-up in state leadership with the promotion of Jessica Bright to state director. Bright, who says she's \"honored\" to be in this role, notes that the team is using faults from Sanders' 2016 state operation to improve and expand, which has resulted in outreach to over 800,000 unique voters according to the campaign.\u00a0 \"Me being in leadership, an African American women, is a testament to us changing,\" said Bright. \"Our field staff is a lot larger and a lot [more] robust and then also the investment of local people, people that actually know South Carolina.\" And while some campaigns have been in the state since the beginning of the year, others, like that of billionaire Tom Steyer, are newer to the playing field in the state but growing quickly. South Carolina spokesperson Tiffiany Vaughn Jones says the team has 50 paid staffers, and that's up 20 people within just the past two weeks. The team's goal is to reach 100 paid staffers in the state by December.\u00a0 When asked, Steyer told CBS News that the goal in South Carolina is a goal that most campaigns would probably agree to share: \"Talk to as many people as possible, have as big a presence on the ground as possible.\" JOE BIDEN Joe Biden is gearing up for an eight-day, 18-county bus tour across Iowa that is set to begin next Saturday. \"When Joe first announced he was running, he told Iowans they'd be seeing a lot of him - and he meant it,\" said Campaign Manager Greg Shultz in a statement. \"With less than 75 days to the caucus, Joe is going to work harder than anyone else to earn the support of Iowans across the entire Hawkeye State.\"\u00a0 Biden's campaign says the tour will include visits to places that will account for 974 state delegate equivalents. So far this year,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporters Musadiq Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Adam Brewster\u00a0say Biden has held 52 campaign events across 28 counties in Iowa. During this upcoming bus trip, Biden will visit 14 new counties for the first time. KAMALA HARRIS Kamala Harris announced endorsements from six Iowa educators and community leaders following last night's Democratic debate, according to\u00a0Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Brewster. Former Iowa State Senator Pat Harper said she is endorsing Harris because of her knowledge of ethics and the law.\u00a0 \"She shows deep respect for our laws,\" Harper said. \"It is what our country needs after so much deviousness and disrespect for the law from our current president.\"\u00a0 Thursday's list of endorsements for Harris also include Iowa City Housing and Community Development Commissioner Megan Alter. Atler said Harris can and will stand up to \"what will remain a horrible fractured Congress, while also trying to find ways to get work done.\" Alter said she is \"excited\" to be all-in for Harris. Alter added that Harris has a \"strong legal mind,\" and is an \"experienced legislator\" who is \"campaigning on both huge issues and the ways they affect people's daily lives.\" Harris will be back in Iowa this weekend and will also spending Thanksgiving with her family in the state. BERNIE SANDERS Bernie Sanders spoke in the shadow of a Martin Luther King Jr. statue on the Morehouse campus Thursday afternoon where he introduced his plan for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Before he did that,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte\u00a0says Sanders spoke at length about his younger years.\u00a0 The Vermont senator spoke about his Polish-born father fleeing \"the father of white supremacy, Adolf Hitler.\" Sanders said he learned at a young age about, \"racism, Arianism, and all that crap.\" He pledged to \"end all forms of discrimination\" in America when elected. He then went into detail on how, as a student at University of Chicago, he was arrested at an anti-housing segregation rally.\u00a0 \"I'm one of the few candidates ever to tell you proudly that I was arrested and went to jail fighting segregation,\" said Sanders. \"That's usually not the kind of thing candidates advertise but it's a better way to go to jail than the corruption that currently goes on in White House.\"\u00a0 Sanders says his plan would bolster funding for teacher recruitment and medical schools at HBCU's. He listed multiple data points that spoke to racial disparities in the health care profession. For example, he said only 4% of doctors are black.\u00a0 Sanders did the same with public education, saying 7% of public school teachers are black. he also spoke at length on criminal justice reform and marijuana legalization. One thing we also heard from the senator, which we almost never hear in his stump, was the call to end capital punishment. Sanders said that this would be done under his administration.\u00a0 Finally, Sanders referenced Stacey Abrams' failed gubernatorial run in Georgia, saying, \"the governor should not have been the governor.\" He thanked Abrams for her work in get-out-the-vote efforts and voter registration. The crowd loudly chanted \"STACEY\" in return. ELIZABETH WARREN Elizabeth Warren announced 25 endorsements from current and former Iowa leaders. The list includes State representative Art Staed, bringing Warren's total of endorsements this cycle from current Iowa state legislators to 10, the most of any candidate in the race.\u00a0Bidar\u00a0and\u00a0Brewster\u00a0say Warren also earned the endorsements of two former state legislators, six current or former local elected officials and six Democratic activists.\u00a0 Staed, who represents Iowa's 66th district, which covers parts of Cedar Rapids, said \"even in these times of polarization, we can make big, structural change if we lead with compassion.\" He added that Warren has \"the passion and intellect to do unite and lead our nation.\"\u00a0 And yesterday, 50 current New Hampshire State Representatives backing Warren penned an\u00a0open letter\u00a0also endorsing the Massachusetts lawmaker. \"Our constituents want us to take action to halt the effects of climate change, end our students' loan debt crisis, and pass common sense gun laws. They are counting on us to pass paid family and medical leave, raise the minimum wage, and fight the opioid epidemic by supporting recovery efforts and taking big pharma to court,\" the letter reads. \"But attempts to address these issues have failed time and again in Washington.\"\u00a0 While many current New Hampshire officials have yet to endorse a presidential candidate,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga\u00a0says Warren's announcement represents nearly a quarter of 233 Democratic representatives in the New Hampshire State House.\u00a0\u00a0 HARRIS VS. BUTTIGIEG Senator\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0says South Bend Mayor\u00a0Pete Buttigieg\u00a0sounded \"a bit na\u00efve\" when he brought up the discrimination gay Americans face during a back-and-forth about his problems attracting support from black voters at\u00a0Wednesday's Democratic debate.\u00a0CBS News Campaign Reporters Tim Perry\u00a0and\u00a0Jack Turman\u00a0report that Harris said it was wrongheaded for Buttigieg to \"compare our struggles.\" \"Those of us who've been involved in Civil Rights for a long time we know that it is important that we not compare our struggles. It is not productive, it is not smart and strategically it works against what we need to do which is build coalition.\" Harris said Thursday during a Black Women Power Breakfast hosted by Higher Heights, a national political organization for black women that endorsed Harris earlier this month. \u00a0\"We know that in our ongoing fight for civil rights if any one of us starts to differentiate ourselves in a certain way and in particular what he did on the stage, it's just not productive. And I think it's a bit na\u00efve.\" Buttigieg rejected Harris' accusation Thursday, saying \"there's no equating those two experiences.\" The South Bend mayor told reporters, \"What I do think is important is for each of us to reveal who we are and what motivates us and it's important for voters to understand what makes me tick, what moves me and my sources of motivation and ensuring that I stand up for others.\" He added, \"Last night I shared that some of my sources of motivation included my personal experience, my governing experience and my personal faith.\"\u00a0 MICHAEL BLOOMBERG Former New York Mayor has filed paperwork to run for president of the United States \u2014 but his team says he's not in yet. Bloomberg's team filed paperwork with the\u00a0Federal Election Commission\u00a0on Thursday that says he would seek the Democratic presidential nomination. An aide familiar with his plans says this \"is another step towards running but not a final decision or announcement.\" A final decision is not expected Thursday or Friday, aides said.\u00a0 In essence,\u00a0CBS News political correspondent Ed\u00a0O'Keefe\u00a0says\u00a0Bloomberg was forced to take this step Thursday because he filed paperwork to appear on the Democratic primary ballot in Alabama and Arkansas earlier this month. By doing so, he was required to file paperwork with the FEC within 15 days.\u00a0 On Wednesday,\u00a0CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson\u00a0says Bloomberg also filed to be on the Texas ballot. All three southern states hold primaries on Super Tuesday, March 3. He is working to obtain signatures on the ballot in Tennessee, another Super Tuesday state. He is not planning to contest the New Hampshire or South Carolina primaries or the early caucuses in Iowa and Nevada.\u00a0 CALIFORNIA California's Supreme Court has struck down a state measure passed\u00a0over the summer\u00a0that would have forced White House hopefuls - including President Trump - to disclose income tax returns in order to be listed on the Super Tuesday contest's primary ballot. Citing California's constitution in its unanimous decision\u00a0issued Thursday,\u00a0CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin\u00a0says Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye wrote that \"it is the voters who must decide\" whether candidates refusing to release such information \"will have consequences at the ballot box.\" GOP MATTERS At a Christian Science Monitor breakfast, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said the impeachment inquiry has helped their small dollar donations and that it is \"activating\" GOP voters like the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings did. \"It's the first time during Kavanaugh, that I've actually had people call and say, 'I'm going to give you money,' without me having to call them. It was magnificent from a chair perspective,\" she said.\u00a0 On the numbers,\u00a0CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro\u00a0reports McDaniel said they raised $5 million online within the first 24 hours of the impeachment inquiry announcement and $3 million online on the first day of the impeachment hearings. She said \"the investment is as strong as ever, which shows that this [impeachment inquiry] is partisan. If our donors were concerned they'd be pulling back.\" In October, the RNC raised $25 million and has collectively raised $194 million for the year. By comparison, the Democratic National Committee brought in\u00a0$9 million in October, with $75.5 million raised throughout the year. McDaniel also weighed in on Wednesday night's Democratic presidential debate and said nothing she saw concerned her. \"I was surprised that more of them didn't go after Buttigieg with him surging in the polls. They do seem to be very gloves-off on him right now,\" she said.\u00a0 When asked about outside groups and Democrat super PACs spending on ads and data operations in swing states, McDaniel said it allows the Democratic candidates to be \"very self-righteous.\" \"[They] say we don't want any big corporate money or dark money when they know that there are billionaires outside flooding hundreds of millions into those states\u2026 so I do think there's a lot of hypocrisy in that.\" she said. \"Yeah, it's a challenge that they have so much money flooding in and that's why the RNC has to be the best it's ever been.\" McDaniel also fielded questions about her uncle, Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, and his\u00a0previous\u00a0spats\u00a0with President Trump. \"I've said these are two grown men, very capable. They can work out their differences,\" she said. CLOSED DOOR MEETING It's no secret that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg got grilled by Congress last month over his company's policies on political ads and\u00a0cryptocurrency. But until this week, few knew he had an off-the-books\u00a0meeting\u00a0with President Trump at the White House.\u00a0 CBSNews.com writer Caroline Cournoyer\u00a0reports the two had dinner, along with the first lady. And, according to NBC News, the dinner also included venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who is a major Trump campaign donor, one of Facebook's board members and the chairman of Palantir, a data technology company that has been awarded major government defense contracts since Mr. Trump entered the White House.\u00a0 The October meeting was first reported by\u00a0NBC News\u00a0on Wednesday, and it was the pair's second meeting in two months. Zuckerberg met with the president in the Oval Office in September \u2014 that meeting appeared on the president's schedule. The topic of the more recent meeting and the reason for the lack of transparency surrounding it have not been revealed. The social media company defended the previously undisclosed meeting. \"As is normal for a CEO of a major U.S. company, Mark accepted an invitation to have dinner with the President and First Lady at the White House,\" a Facebook spokesperson told CBS News on Thursday. But Elizabeth Warren, who is running on a platform that includes increasing regulations on technology companies, said that \"this is corruption, plain and simple.\" \"This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It's no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability,\" she\u00a0tweeted\u00a0on Thursday. She\u00a0vowed, \"I won't cozy up to Facebook when I'm president.\"\u00a0 Compared to\u00a0Google\u00a0and\u00a0Twitter, Facebook takes a more lenient approach toward political advertisements \u2014 a fact that Mr. Trump, whose campaign relies heavily on social media \u2014 has praised. The company has also resisted congressional efforts to regulate it. Google announced Thursday it would make it more difficult for political ads to target specific groups of people beyond broad categories. It also bans ads making false claims and \"deepfakes.\"\u00a0 Twitter bans political ads, although it allows issue ads.\u00a0 HOUSE FUNDRAISING With the release of their\u00a0FEC report\u00a0for October,\u00a0Navarro\u00a0says the National Republican Congressional Committee has been outraised by their Democratic counterparts for 10 straight months. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee raised $2.2 million more than the NRCC in October, and has a $30 million overall advantage for all of 2019.\u00a0 \"Voters know that Democrats are fighting for kitchen-table issues that affect everyday Americans, and they are standing with us as we work to protect and expand this House Majority,\" DCCC spokesperson Cole Leiter said in a statement.\u00a0 One potential bright spot for the NRCC? RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said Thursday morning that they have recruited 160 women to file for races across the country, in hopes of increasing the low numbers of female Republican House members TAKING OVER The Republican Governors Association announced Texas Governor Greg Abbott will be its new chairman in 2020, taking over for Pete Ricketts of Nebraska. Abbott previously served as vice chairman in 2019 and will be succeeded by Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. \"With governor's races in 11 states in 2020, we are focused on defending our incumbents and competing to flip governorships from blue to red,\" Governor Abbott said in a statement.\u00a0 For Democrats, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy will take over for Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo as chair of the Democratic Governors Association heading into 2020. Next year, Democrats have to defend their seats in four states while Republicans have seven states they want to retain, says\u00a0Navarro.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kamala Harris directly challenged former Vice President Joe Biden on his recent comments on civil rights and segregationist lawmakers, delivering an impassioned critique that became the signature exchange of the second night of the first Democratic debate. As the other candidates were being asked about race relations and racial inequality on Thursday, Harris, the only woman of color on stage, didn't let the moderators move on without allowing her to share her perspective.\u00a0 \"As the only black person on this stage, I would like to speak on the issue of race,\" Harris said, eliciting fervent applause and cheers among the audience. After sharing personal experiences with discrimination and racial profiling, Harris, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, turned her attention to Biden, the early front-runner in the race.\u00a0 The California senator began to press Biden on his comments about working with conservative lawmakers who supported segregation based on race, as well as his past stance against busing to desegregate public schools.  \"I do not believe you are a racist,\" Harris said, looking straight at Biden. \"I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground ... [But] it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputation and careers on the segregation of race in this country.\" Harris also noted Biden opposed federal measures to ensure that local jurisdictions used busing to desegregate public schools during the 1970s. She said that was personally painful for her. \"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school everyday, and that little girl was me,\" she said. \"So, I will tell you: on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats. We have to take it seriously. We have to act swiftly.\"\u00a0 Harris' passionate appeal elicited some of the loudest applause of the night. Given a chance to respond, Biden challenged Harris' portrayal of his record on race. \u00a0 \"That's a mischaracterization of my position across the board. I did not praise racists,\" he said, touting his support for civil rights and highlighting his work as public defender.\u00a0 \"If we want to have this campaign litigated on who supports civil rights and whether I did or not, I'm happy to do that,\" Biden said. Harris continued her questioning. \"But Vice President Biden, do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then?\" she asked.\u00a0 \"I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed was busing ordered by the Department of Education,\" Biden replied.\u00a0 Harris noted that many local jurisdictions \u2014 including in Berkeley, where she attended public schools \u2014 failed to quickly desegregate schools after the Supreme Court issued the Brown vs. Board of Education ruling in 1954, which outlawed segregation in public schools based on race.\u00a0 \u00a0 When she mentioned that her schools in Berkeley fully desegregated nearly two decades after the Brown ruling, Biden said it was because of the decisions of local governments.\u00a0 \"So, that's when the federal government steps in,\" she countered, adding later, \"There are moments in history where states fail to preserve the civil rights of all people.\" Biden then stressed that he's been an ardent supporter of measures to crack down of the disfranchisement of racial minorities, before cutting himself off.\u00a0 \"Anyways, my time is up,\" he said.\u00a0 Along with his comments about collaborating with segregationists and opposition to federal policies to compel local jurisdictions to change busing routes to end segregation in schools, Biden has also faced scrutiny from progressives for other positions he held during his long tenure in Congress.\u00a0 As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he oversaw the contentious Anita Hill hearings during the confirmation process for then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991. He also helped spearhead efforts to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which many believe fueled a period of mass incarceration that disproportionately affected African Americans and other minority groups.

            "article_content": "Days after a shooting that has shaken his city, presidential candidate and South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is set to return to the campaign trail Thursday evening for events in Boston, one of which is a fundraiser.\u00a0 \u00a0 Buttigieg had gone back to the city Sunday afternoon after South Bend Police Sgt. Ryan O'Neill, a white police officer, fatally shot Eric Logan, an African American man.\u00a0 The shooting is the latest episode in what local activist Eli Cantu described as the \"horrible\" relationship between South Bend police and the city's black community. \"I mean, there is no trust,\" Cantu, who organized a Wednesday night vigil, told CBS News. Cantu said that the event was previously planned to bring awareness to the lives of people claimed by violence in the community and following the incident on Sunday, he added that more attention about the dialogue regarding the police and the community ensued.\u00a0 According to the mayor's office and the campaign, Buttigieg was scheduled to be in California early this week for fundraisers and a policy announcement. Instead, he spent Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in meetings with community and religious leaders, activists and elected officials.\u00a0 Buttigieg also attended the vigil organized by Cantu Wednesday night, where he spoke with Logan's mother. Cantu and South Bend common council member Oliver Davis told CBS News they appreciated the mayor showing up to the Wednesday vigil, but Davis said he was disappointed that Buttigieg had not attended another one on Monday night.\u00a0 Cantu, who said he met with Buttigieg Thursday morning, said the black community is grieving this week, but added that potential meetings are being planned with the mayor to help remedy the situation. He emphasized that these meetings can be an opportunity for Buttigieg to show his support for South Bend's black residents, and also that millennials should be involved in the conversation.\u00a0 \"This is the perfect time for him to show where he stands, you know,\" Cantu said. \"Is he going to be for the people here or not? And I think that has to do with how he handles this issue.\" Buttigieg has been criticized in the past for his handling of racial issues in South Bend. In 2012, he fired the city's first black police chief, Darryl Boykins, who was being investigated by the FBI at the time and later sued the city for racial discrimination. \u00a0 The St. Joseph County Metro Homicide Unit is investigating the shooting and reviewing evidence. According to a release from the prosecutor's office,\u00a0Logan allegedly\u00a0approached O'Neill with a knife and O'Neill discharged his service weapon. After learning that O'Neill's body camera was not activated, Buttigieg requested that the chief of police issue an order reaffirming that officers should have their body cameras turned on when engaging with civilians. Davis, the city's longest-serving black common council member, told CBS News that he will be introducing a non-binding resolution on Monday calling for an independent investigation. He said his resolution has a high level of support within the council. To improve the relationship between law enforcement and minority residents in South Bend, Davis said the police department and public officials need to \"reflect the city.\" \"We do need to have more diversity in our police department,\" Davis said, noting that the new class of police cadets lacks diversity.\u00a0 Since Buttigieg has taken over as mayor, a campaign aide told CBS News, South Bend has implemented bias training for police and made public more data concerning the use of force. And in an interview earlier this week with WUBS, a local radio station, Buttigieg said that his administration has taken steps to diversify the police force and improve the recruiting process for applicants.\u00a0 But Buttigieg also admitted that he has \"failed to get us a more diverse police department.\" \"I know it's a problem,\" Buttigieg said in the interview. \"I accept responsibility for the fact that the problem has not been solved. I will continue to seek help from experts inside and outside this community on how to improve it.\" While addressing the new police cadets at a swearing in ceremony Wednesday morning, Buttigieg said he was \"saddened and concerned\" about the incident. He also said complex and often fraught history between minority communities and law enforcement is not \"unrelated to race.\" \"In our past and present, we have seen innumerable moments in which racial injustice came at the hands of those trusted with being instruments of justice. This fact burdens everyone, all of us, no matter who we are,\" the mayor said.\u00a0 Common council member Tim Scott told CBS News that some of the trust built between the community and law enforcement \"has been pushed back a little bit\" by the shooting. He added that \"the mayor has been out front more than he has been in the past\" on this issue. At a press conference Wednesday afternoon, Buttigieg called for more transparency in the investigation and more dialogue between police and the black community. He said that this would not be an easy task, but that his city was up to the challenge.\u00a0 \"I believe in this city,\" Buttigieg said. \"I love this city. And if there is any place that can overcome the things that are pulling people apart, it is this city, this community with your help.\" A campaign aide told CBS News that Buttigieg is expected to return to South Bend Saturday evening and remain there into Monday.\u00a0 CBS News reporter covering the Senate.",

            "article_content": "The billionaire New York investor and owner of the Miami Dolphins is facing\u00a0a wave of bad publicity\u00a0over a high-dollar Hamptons fundraiser he hosted for President Trump on Friday. Stephen Ross' private equity firm Related Companies is facing pressure from members of Equinox, the upscale athletic club, and the indoor cycling studio SoulCycle, both of which are owned by Related Companies. Some celebrities and activists, Chrissy Teigen and Billy Eichner, have called for a boycott of Equinox and SoulCycle and said they're canceling their own memberships. Tiegen's tweet showed a screenshot of an Equinox message saying the clubs were experiencing \"extremely high volumes of emails.\" Representatives for the chains said, \"Neither Equinox nor SoulCycle have anything to do with the event later this week and do not support it.\" \u00a0 CBS San Francisco\u00a0reported a small group of protesters had gathered at the SoulCycle gym in San Francisco. \"We want current members to cancel their memberships,\" said well known LGBTQ activist Michael Petrelis. \"And if they can't cancel their memberships, then don't renew their memberships.\" Kenny Stills, a Dolphins wide receiver, also criticized Ross' decision to hold the fundraiser. He tweeted a screen capture from the website for Ross' anti-racism initiative RISE which says the program \"educates and empowers the sports community to eliminate racial discrimination, champion social justice and improve race relations.\" \"You can't have a non-profit with this mission statement then open your doors to Trump,\" he tweeted. In a statement published by\u00a0CBS Miami, Ross said he has known the president for 40 years. \"While we agree on some issues, we strongly disagree on many others\u2026I have been, and will continue to be, an outspoken champion of racial equality, inclusion, [and] diversity,\" Ross said. \"I always have been an active participant in the democratic process,\" Ross said. \"While some prefer to sit outside of the process and criticize, I prefer to engage directly and support the things I deeply care about.\" President Trump also weighed in, acknowledging Friday that \"the controversy makes Steve Ross hotter \u2014 he'll figure that out in about a week.\" He called Ross \"a great friend\" and \"a very successful guy.\" And he told reporters at the White House that he and Ross used to be \"competitors\" in real estate. Mr. Trump added that he thinks Ross is \"probably more inclined to be a liberal, if you want to know the truth. But he likes me. He respects me.\" Republican Party chair, Ronna McDaniel, said that the controversy had only made Friday's fundraising haul for the president and the party more successful. \"Thanks to the unhinged mob on the left, @realDonaldTrump raised $12M today, $2M more than originally expected,\" she tweeted about the Hamptons fundraisers. Joe Farrell, a New York real estate developer hosted the other fundraiser. \"The support for our President is unprecedented and growing!\" In addition to Ross' political support for the president, he also has a financial interest in Mr. Trump's business empire \u2014 including his iconic Manhattan tower. Shortly after the 2016 elections, Ross tried to take over Ladder Capital, one of Mr. Trump's biggest creditors, which also holds a mortgage on Trump Tower. Though the takeover failed, Ross' private equity firm Related Companies purchased an $80 million stake in Ladder, which is still owed more than $100 million by Trump, records show. The campaign fundraiser at Ross' home in the Hamptons, with tickets costing up to $250,000, provides another stark example of the intersection between Trump's business and political interests, the sort of co-mingling of wealth and power that Mr. Trump crusaded against during the 2016 race when he derided politicians for taking money from special interests. \"It's another reminder of how the president's refusal to divest from the Trump Organization continues to present potential conflicts of interest,\" said Brendan Fischer, an attorney with the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. \"We don't know what they might want, or what they might be getting in return.\" Unlike other presidents, Mr. Trump has refused to divest himself from his business holdings, and he is not legally required to do so. His campaign did not respond to repeated request for comment on Thursday. Daniel I. Weiner, a former attorney for the Federal Election Commission, said concern about the influence big donors may wield over a president is not unique to Trump. \"It's not that this is some completely new universe that we're living in. It's that longstanding problems with our political system are now on steroids,\" said Weiner, who is now senior counsel at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. \"It becomes very hard to know where a president's personal and political interests end and his service to the public interest begins.\" Since 2012, Mr. Trump's companies have taken out loans from Ladder Capital and currently owe anywhere between $110 million and $150 million, according to a debt range included in the president's 2019 financial disclosure. That includes at least $50 million he owes on a 2012 mortgage on Trump Tower, the building where he lives, and represents one of his most successful real estate investments. Before its takeover attempt was rejected, Related Companies purchased an $80 million share in Ladder Capital and Richard O'Toole, the company's vice president and general counsel, was installed on the board of directors, filings show. Related sold off some of its stock earlier this year and O'Toole recently stepped down from the board, but the company continues to hold 5.1 million shares in Ladder, filings show. Related spokeswoman Joanna Rose said the firm \"now owns less than 5% of the shares of Ladder\" and added that \"any allegation or speculation beyond a simple investment strategy is patently false.\" Ladder did not respond to a request for comment.",

            "article_content": "Lori Lightfoot made history in more ways than one Tuesday night, defeating Toni Preckwinkle to not only become the first African-American woman elected mayor of Chicago, but the first openly gay woman to win the seat as well. With at least 95 percent of the vote counted, Lightfoot held a commanding 74 percent to 26 percent lead in a race that saw possibly record low turnout of around 30 percent. Lightfoot addressed her supporters late Tuesday, saying she wants to turn Chicago around so that \"your ZIP code doesn't determine your destiny.\" She pledged that all of Chicago's neighborhoods would be invested in each other and \"we will grow together.\" \"We can and we will break this city's cycle of corruption,\" she said. \"We will not let politicians profit from their positions. We can and we will remake Chicago.\" \u201cTogether, we can and will finally put the interest of our people \u2013 all of our people \u2013 ahead of the interests of a powerful few,\u201d says Mayor-Elect Lori Lightfoot. \u201cTogether, we can and will make Chicago a place where your zip code doesn\u2019t determine your destiny.\u201d pic.twitter.com/V5IQnnwM1L Preckwinkle told a crowd of supporters she still believes in the power of public service and has dedicated her life to it. She said she will wake up Wednesday fighting and advocating for her constituents. She's disappointed, but not disheartened in her loss to Lightfoot. Lightfoot's victory followed five weeks of bitter rhetoric between her and Preckwinkle, CBS Chicago reports, after she won the most votes in the first round of the election in February. She had seemed to come out of virtually nowhere to secure that victory in February, having polled as low as 2.8 percent just a month earlier. After emerging from the first round of the election as the front-runner, Lightfoot quickly began outpacing Preckwinkle in endorsements, with several defeated mayoral candidates backing her in the runoff. Cheers erupting at the @LightfootForChi party HQ as election results roll in.  #ChicagoVotes #ElectionDay https://t.co/hr5nMLsy7s pic.twitter.com/1qytTiENHq The campaign took a particularly nasty turn in the final week, as Preckwinkle's campaign released a TV ad attacking how Lori Lightfoot investigated a critical failure of the 911 call center. The ad was based on a very real tragedy: A 2004 West Side fire that killed three of Dwayne and Emily Funches' children, as well as a 12-year-old godson. However, the Funches family reportedly was infuriated with the ad, saying they were not consulted about it, and wanted it pulled, because it exploits their tragedy. Nonetheless, the Preckwinkle campaign refused to pull the ad. Lightfoot, 56, has portrayed herself as a progressive champion for reforming City Hall, and repeatedly criticized Preckwinkle as a Democratic party boss who ran a corrupt political machine, assailing her for her ties to Ald. Edward Burke, who earlier this year was indicted for extortion. She also lambasted Preckwinkle for supporting former Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios after a 2017 Chicago Tribune/ProPublica Illinois investigation that found the property tax assessment program run by his office unfairly shifted the tax burden from wealthy property owners to middle- and low-income homeowners. In their first debate, Lightfoot accused Preckwinkle of telling \"lie after lie\" during the campaign and has repeatedly said Preckwinkle has tried \"to portray me as something other than I am.\" Preckwinkle has called Lightfoot a hypocrite, calling her rival a name-caller who once compared her and other candidates with ties to Burke \"cockroaches\" in a campaign ad. \"It's like when cockroaches, there's a light that's shined on them, they scramble, initially they're silent, then they try to say, 'Not me, not me,'\" Lightfoot said in the ad. \"Then when they get caught, right, then they finally stand up and do something. It's a day late and a dollar short.\" Preckwinkle also repeatedly criticized Lightfoot's record as a corporate attorney, blasting her for her work defending Merrill Lynch in a discrimination lawsuit. Lightfoot also criticized Preckwinkle for joining the race for mayor only after Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced he would not run for a third term, touting her own decision to challenge Emanuel before he announced his retirement. A former federal prosecutor, former president of the Chicago Police Board, and former Police Accountability Task Force chair, Lightfoot gained a reputation as a police reformer. The task force she led recommended sweeping changes at the Chicago Police Department, calling out a \"history of racial disparity and discrimination.\" The panel also recommended replacing the now-defunct Independent Police Review Authority with an oversight agency better equipped to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by officers. Just months later, the City Council voted to eliminate IPRA and replace I with the new Civilian Office of Police Accountability, with double the budget, and a larger staff. Now, as she prepares to take over as mayor next month when she's sworn in May 20, Lightfoot will be tasked with making sure the Chicago Police Department lives up to the terms of a consent decree governing sweeping changes recommended by the U.S. Justice Department. Lightfoot will join seven other black women currently serving as mayors in major U.S. cities, including Atlanta and New Orleans and will be the second woman to lead Chicago. She and her wife have one daughter. Brian Johnson, CEO of Equality Illinois, said the civil rights organization for lesbian and gay people was \"thrilled\" with the outcome. \"This victory is historic, and it is also an undeniably proud moment for the LGBTQ community,\" Johnson said.",

A federal court announced that next week U.S. District Judge Loretta Biggs will formally block a photo ID requirement scheduled to begin in 2020. Unless the upcoming preliminary injunction is successfully appealed, the requirement will be halted until a lawsuit filed by the state NAACP and others is resolved. Thursday's short written notice from the federal court in Winston-Salem previewed Biggs' order because state election officials were planning to expand efforts to educate voters about the ID law within days. Although the mandate would be carried out beginning with the March 3 primary, the requirement would actually start in just a few weeks with mail-in absentee ballot filers, who also would have to provide an ID copy. The mandate identified several types of qualifying photo IDs and allowed people lacking one to get a free ID card or to fill out a form while voting explaining their \"reasonable impediment\" to obtaining one. GOP leaders in charge of the legislature have been trying for most of the decade to advance voter ID, saying that more than 30 states require it and it builds confidence in elections. Data show voter impersonation is rare, however. The voting pool \u2014 currently 6.8 million registered voters \u2014 is critical in a closely divided presidential battleground state where statewide races are often competitive between the major parties. Voter ID was actually carried out in North Carolina's 2016 primary elections as the result of a 2013 law. But a federal appeals court struck down several portions of the law in July 2016, saying photo ID and other voting restrictions were approved with intentional racial discrimination in mind. Republicans strongly disagreed with that decision and put a constitutional amendment on the November 2018 ballot \u2014 a strategy designed to give the idea more legal and popular standing. The amendment passed with 55% of the vote. The legislature approved a separate law in December 2018 detailing how to implement that amendment. Lawsuits challenging that new law were filed immediately. Lawyers for the state and local NAACP chapters told Biggs in a court brief that the latest version of voter ID is a \"barely disguised duplicate\" of the 2013 voter ID law and \"carries the same discriminatory intent as its predecessor,\" likely violating the U.S. Constitution. The new rules allow additional government IDs to meet the mandate, including public and private university cards. But they still prevent government IDs for public assistance programs from being used, disproportionately affecting African Americans, the NAACP said. The actual reasons for Biggs issuing the injunction \u2014 and whether the legislature could pass a law altering the rules to resolve her concerns \u2014 won't be known until the formal order is released. State NAACP President the Rev. Anthony Spearman praised Biggs' decision, calling the 2018 measure \"the latest bad-faith attempt in a string of failed efforts by the (North Carolina) General Assembly to impede the right to vote of African Americans and Latinos in this state, and to blunt the force of the true will of the people.\" Republican House Speaker Tim Moore of Cleveland County criticized the notice Friday as a \"last-minute attempt by an activist federal judge to overturn the will of North Carolina voters.\" He said the ruling should be \"immediately appealed\" by the State Board of Elections, which is a defendant in the case. The board is composed of three Democrats and two Republicans, all appointed by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Although a voter ID opponent, Cooper is also named a lawsuit defendant because of his position as governor. Lawyers from the state Department of Justice represented the board in court to attempt to uphold the 2018 voter ID law. They argued that the mandate was improved to address previous concerns of bias and the plaintiffs failed to show it was enacted with discriminatory intent. Cooper vetoed the December 2018 law, but two Democratic legislators joined all Republicans voting to override the veto. The department declined to comment Friday about a possible appeal as it awaits Biggs' full order, said Laura Brewer, a spokeswoman for Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein. Biggs prevented Moore and Senate leader Phil Berger from officially entering the case, saying the board was making an adequate defense. Two other lawsuits challenging the voter ID mandate or the constitutional amendment are pending in state courts.",

            "article_content": "Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg was asked on Monday about his mayoral administration's support for the way New York City handled the notorious Central Park Five case, and Bloomberg did not say whether he still stood by it. Years after defending the city and its police department, Bloomberg said the exonerations of the\u00a0five wrongly convicted men are \"the final word\" in the case and \"we just have to accept that.\" CBS News asked the former New York City mayor about his stance at a campaign event in Montgomery, Alabama. The Bloomberg administration had argued that New York City and the NYPD acted in good faith in the case. \"I really have no idea,\" Bloomberg said. \"I've read in the paper, I've been away from government for a long time. So apparently, the courts have ruled that they did not commit it, commit a crime, and that's the final word and we just have to accept that. It isn't a question of what anybody believes.\" The Central Park Five were black and Latino teenagers \u2014 Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise \u2014 who were arrested and charged for the brutal rape and beating of a female jogger in Central Park in 1989, more than a decade before Bloomberg served as mayor. The five teens were convicted in 1990 and spent years in prison before DNA evidence was matched to a different man, Matias Reyes. Reyes, a convicted killer and rapist who was serving a life sentence, confessed to the Central Park attack.\u00a0 When pressed Monday about his own views on the case, Bloomberg noted that the evidence behind the teens' convictions ultimately didn't hold up. \"There was an awful lot of evidence presented at that time that they were involved. There's been questions since then about the quality of that evidence. And so it's, I've been away from it for so long, I just really can't respond because I just don't remember,\" Bloomberg said. A spokesman for Bloomberg's campaign told CBS News that \"the Bloomberg Administration never disagreed with the decision to vacate the convictions,\" and was in agreement on that point with a leading expert on police corruption whom the city hired to examine the handling of the case. All five men had their convictions vacated in 2002. During the Bloomberg administration, they filed a civil rights lawsuit against New York City, alleging malicious prosecution, racial discrimination and emotional distress. The Bloomberg administration spent nearly $6 million fighting the case over a decade, arguing that the authorities at the time had good cause and acted in good faith. In 2014, less than a year after Bloomberg left office, New York City and the Central Park Five agreed to a $41 million settlement. Under the terms of the agreement, the city continued to maintain there was no wrongdoing by police or prosecutors in the case. \"Our records have been wiped clean, but the indelible scar of going to prison is still there,\" one of the men, Yusuf Salaam, said in a 2012 interview with CBS News. \"There was a speedy trial to convict us. There was no speedy method to recompense us.\" The case, which was the subject of a recent Netflix miniseries, also became a flashpoint in the 2016 presidential election when Donald Trump appeared to cling to a belief that the men were guilty. In the days after the attack in 1989, Mr. Trump had taken out full-page ads in four New York newspapers calling for a return to the death penalty. He continued to defend the original investigation for years after the convictions were overturned. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump said he would not apologize for his comments on the case.\u00a0 Tim Perry is a reporter covering the White House for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "2020 Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden apologized Saturday for his remarks a few weeks ago about working with segregationists in the Senate. The former vice president, who is 76, said at a campaign stop in Sumter, South Carolina that he has \"changed\" since he entered the Senate in the 1970s. \"Was I wrong a few weeks ago to somehow give the impression to folks that I was praising those people who I opposed time and again? Yes I was. I regret it and I'm sorry for any of the pain and misconception it may have caused to anybody,\" Biden said, to applause. \"But for that misstep to define 50 years of my record of fighting racial injustice. That doesn't represent my record.\" \u00a0 Biden has been criticized for his age and political positions earlier in his career. \"America in 2019 is a very different place than the America of the 1970s. And that's a good thing. I've witnessed an incredible amount of change in this nation and I've worked to make that change happen. And yes \u2014 I've changed also,\" Biden said. Biden also pushed back against criticism against his time in the Senate by noting his service as vice president to President Obama, who remains very popular in the Democratic Party and among black Democratic voters in particular. \"If you look at the issues I've been attacked on, nearly every one of them is for something well before 2008. It's as if my opponents want you to believe I served from 1972 until 2008 \u2014 and then took the next eight years off. They don't want to talk much about my time as vice president,\" the excerpt said. Biden has been under increased scrutiny since the first primary debate at the end of June, when Sen. Kamala Harris challenged him over his relationships with segregationist senators and his opposition to federally imposed busing in the 1970s. In his speech Saturday, Biden said he believed politicians needed to get to the root causes of segregation, like housing discrimination. \"Discrimination in housing has been one of the most pernicious forms of racism that has taken hold in this country. Wreaking havoc, wreaking havoc not only in education but denying generation after generation of African Americans the ability to create and pass on wealth,\" Biden said. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Biden said he was surprised by the way Harris came at him in the debate. \"I was prepared for them to come after me but I wasn't prepared for the person who came at me the way she came at me,\" Biden said.\u00a0 Biden also defended his position on busing, saying that he supported busing in response to de jure segregation \u2014 that is, segregation imposed by law. \"If the court ruled or there was a law passed or a circumstance that a county a city or a state did that prevented black folks from being somewhere, then that is wrong and you should bus,\" Biden told CNN. \"I even went so far, in the middle of that busing controversy, as saying use helicopters if that was necessary to make the point.\" During the campaign, Biden has also been criticized for his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Anita Hill hearings in 1991, and his support for the infamous 1994 crime bill, which disproportionately affected black Americans. However, he remains the frontrunner in most state and national polls, although his lead is waning. Grace Segers is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",
