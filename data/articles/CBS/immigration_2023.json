            "article_content": "Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb has filed federal paperwork to run for the U.S. Senate in Arizona, becoming the first Republican to jump into a high-profile race for the seat now held by independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. Lamb, who filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday, has built a profile in Arizona and beyond as a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump and an advocate for cracking down on illegal immigration and drug smuggling. While Pinal County is not on the U.S.-Mexico border, it has a number of active drug and human smuggling routes through remote desert terrain. Arizona, long a GOP stronghold, is a top target for Republicans looking to take control of the Senate, which Democrats control 51-49, including Sinema and two other independents who generally vote with Democrats. The state was solidly red, with former President Bill Clinton in 1996 being the only Democrat to win the state in a presidential election since 1948 and two longtime GOP senators. After voting for Trump in 2016, the state went blue for President Joe Biden in 2020 and Democrats were able to win both Senate seats, although Sinema has since left the Democratic party.\u00a0 The 2024 Senate map heavily favors the GOP, with no Republican seats up in states won by Mr. Biden and three Democratic seats up in states Trump won in 2020. Under the same Senate map in 2018, Sinema was one of only two Democrats to flip a GOP-held seat and Democrats lost three seats. The closest Republican wins, meanwhile, were in Florida and Texas.\u00a0 Sinema, who left the Democratic Party in December after her relationship with many members of the party ruptured, is raising money for a potential reelection campaign but has not said whether she will seek a second term. U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego is the only Democrat in the race so far. He said last week he raised $3.7 million in the first quarter. Fast-growing Pinal County is sandwiched between the Phoenix and Tucson metro areas. Its small agricultural and mining towns have been dwarfed in recent decades by master-planned exurbs and retirement communities where newcomers gobble up affordable homes. Lamb is a fixture in border-themed television ads that show him walking through the desert, rifle in hand, with Republican candidates. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020, the sheriff refused to enforce Republican then-Gov. Doug Ducey's stay-at-home order. He also created a streaming service called \"American Sheriff Network\" to highlight the work of law enforcement agencies. Lamb could wind up in a crowded Republican primary and will likely face a formidable fight for the GOP nomination. Kari Lake, a former television news anchor who became a star among many Republicans before losing the 2022 race for governor, is considering a Senate run and would be the immediate front-runner. Others considering running include Blake Masters, Jim Lamon and Karrin Taylor Robson, who lost 2022 races for Senate or governor. All of Lamb's potential Republican rivals have, to varying degrees, something the sheriff lacks \u2014 easy access to large sums of money. Lake can raise it from her legion of fans, while the other potential candidates have personal fortunes or benefactors they can draw from. Lamb's ability to raise money will be an early test of his viability. Arizona Republicans have embraced Trump's unfounded claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him, last year nominating for statewide offices a slate of candidates who put election conspiracies at the center of their campaigns. All lost in the general election, prompting fears in some Republican circles of a repeat that could hinder their path to a Senate majority. Lake has continued to aggressively push claims of interference in her own election loss last year that have been rejected by courts. Lamb this month distanced himself from election conspiracies, saying he hasn't seen evidence of \"material, large-scale fraud\" that he could take to a jury. Lamb's own Pinal County had serious issues last year that were blamed on ineptitude rather than fraud. \"Where I thought there was smoke, I looked for fire,\" Lamb said in an interview with the Phoenix Fox affiliate. \"I got involved with some of the groups that were actively out saying they had evidence. To this day, I've never been provided any evidence of significant material fraud.\" Lamb experienced tragedy late last year, when his 22-year-old son, the son's fianc\u00e9e and their 1-year-old daughter were killed in a crash when their vehicle was hit by a suspected drunken driver.",

And former President Trump takes his grievances public in his first big campaign rally of the year. More than a dozen tornadoes reportedly tore through parts of Mississippi and Alabama this weekend, leaving death and destruction along a 100-mile- wide path. We will have the latest. Last night, the former president rallied thousands of supporters in Waco, Texas, with his latest line of attack. (Begin VT) DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States): The new weapon being used by out-of-control, unhinged Democrats to cheat on election is criminally investigating a candidate. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: As he and the rest of the political world await action from a Manhattan grand jury in the case related to alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. We will have new information that case and the bigger investigation going on in Washington, where a judge is compelling some key allies of Mr. Trump to testify before a grand jury. We will also look at Mr. Trump's increasingly threatening tone and the growing concerns over violence related to his legal troubles. (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-New York): The twice-impeach former president's rhetoric is reckless, reprehensible and irresponsible. It's dangerous, and, if he keeps it up, he's going to get someone killed. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales about that and the new developments on border security. Plus, how do we keep the Chinese government from accessing Americans' information through TikTok? Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner has a plan. We will ask him about it. Biden administration National Security Council spokesman John Kirby will be with us following the repeated attacks by Iranian-backed forces on U.S. troops in Syria. Finally, we will look at the renewed focus on the Federal Reserve with the head of Minneapolis Fed, Neel Kashkari. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have got a lot of news to get to today, but we want to start with the devastating tornadoes in the South that are likely to continue through the weekend. There have been at least 26 fatalities reported, all but one in Mississippi. Plus, there are dozens of injuries. One massive storm tore through several towns in the Mississippi Delta, an area that's among the poorest in the country. That tornado's path was reportedly a mile-wide and it lasted for more than an hour. President Biden declared a state of emergency today in Mississippi and vowed to deliver federal assistance as quickly as possible to impacted areas. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will visit the area later today. And the National Weather Service is predicting more severe weather in the South later today. There are already reports this morning of a tornado touching down in Georgia. We find ourselves in somewhat the same position as we did last Sunday, waiting for developments in the Manhattan case against former President Trump. Last weekend, he said he would be arrested this past Tuesday. He was not, at least not yet. Saturday, Mr. Trump put out a social media post and later told reporters that the case had been dropped. That's not true. A source within the DA's office tells us that grand jury proceedings are still ongoing. Our Robert Costa has been covering this story. And he joins us now. It's good to have you here, Bob. I know we're going to have a lot of details on the Manhattan case. But you have got new information about the federal case against the president and his allies. This is the one led by special counsel Jack Smith. It's a dual investigation. So, let's start with the part regarding January 6 itself. What have you learned? ROBERT COSTA: Good to be with you, Margaret. Based on our reporting, the special counsel is tightening his investigation around former President Trump when it comes to January 6, now compelling some of his top aides and allies to testify under oath about their private conversations with Trump. That means there's no privilege, no executive privilege they can cite to try to block any kind of testimony on those issues. We know the special counsel is looking into a possible conspiracy case against Trump and people around him about trying to block the congressional proceedings on January 6. We're going to potentially hear now from Mark Meadows. Robert O'Brien, the former national security adviser, John Ratcliffe, the former the director of national intelligence. And sources who are close to the grand jury also tells CBS News that they're being asked, witnesses, about what kind of national security levers Trump was asking about in those final days. MARGARET BRENNAN: Significant. ROBERT COSTA: Highly significant. MARGARET BRENNAN: And on the classified documents, the documents the former president was not handling properly, there was also a key decision by a judge this week. What impact will it have? ROBERT COSTA: It's so rare for a judge to say to a lawyer, you now have to testify about your client in a criminal case. Well, that happened in this classified records investigation of Trump being conducted by the special counsel, two investigations at once. Evan Corcoran, Trump's lawyer in this case, now being told to come in, and he did come in for hours on Friday. And he didn't just talk about his broad view. He had to share audio files, notes, details about all of his conversations with Trump about how Trump handled those federal requests about classified documents. Think back to the Mar-a-Lago FBI search last summer. Corcoran was pressed about, what was Trump doing at that intense time? And that really gives the prosecutors a prism into what really happened. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, all of these legal developments are coming up against the rush towards the presidential race. And, of course, former President Trump is running again. When he spoke last night in Waco, Texas, the former president didn't mention that Manhattan district attorney case, which was surprising to some because of the social media posts that he had made showing himself with a baseball bat next to the DA's picture, warning of death and destruction if he is prosecuted. Does this kind of rhetoric impact at all how the party thinks of him? Is it helping him? Is it hurting him politically? ROBERT COSTA: It depends on which part of the Republican Party you're asking the question to. Donors are alarmed. They see a possible indictment in New York. They see a possible obstruction case being mounted against Trump on the classified documents front. But when you look at his core supporters in the Republican Party, they are rallying to him in many respects, fueled by his grievances, these rallies. And Trump's allies tell CBS that he believes he's newly confident now that he can push back the threat of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and try to solidify his coalition inside the GOP at this early stage. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's going to be a long race. Bob, thank you very much for laying all of this out. And we're joined now by Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales. It's great to have you here, Congressman, in-person. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES (R-Texas): Yes, thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start the conversation we were just having here, because this is your home state of Texas where the former president spoke last night. When he walked on stage, he played a recording made by some of those who are being prosecuted for attacking the Capitol on January 6. He also had footage seeming to glorify the attack that day. He's calling for protests. He said things like \"death and destruction\" if he's indicted. I know you've supported him in the past. Do you support statements like this? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Look, January 6 was a terrible day. We have to make sure that never happens again. I certainly was here at the Capitol keeping -- keeping folks from -- from getting on to the House floor. But it was great to have President Trump back in Texas. And it was a reminder that Trump's policies, President Trump's policies, worked. And, right now, we're in a time where Biden -- Biden is failing us. And so, you know, I welcome any serious presidential candidate to come to Texas, see it firsthand. In particular, come see the border. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you had endorsed the former president back in November 2022. Do I understand what you just said means you're also open to other candidates? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: So I haven't met with President Trump yet. I look forward to meeting with President Trump. But, right now, I'm focused on securing this border. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And I think that's a key part to it. MARGARET BRENNAN: I just want to button this up, because I hear what you're saying in terms of policy and substance. But what the former President was talking about was not policy or substance. Don't you see some danger from -- from lionizing those who are being prosecuted for breaking the law... REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... and attacking the place where you and other lawmakers work? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Isn't that part of it, something that must give you pause? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: The rhetoric is absolutely out of control on both sides, on all sides. But I would also see -- I see President Trump, honestly, being attacked, being demonized on all these different fronts. You know, things that are happening to him in regards to the classified documentation, similar -- similar things happen to President Biden, and you don't see those things. I think a lot of people are done with the political rhetoric. They want solutions. And whichever presidential candidate is going to bring real solutions to their lives is going to get their vote. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I hear that you still support him. It's interesting, because you are such an independent voice within the Republican Party. I mean, you've stood apart from your party in a number of things on this program. You've taken stands. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: You supported expansion of background checks. The Texas GOP censored you because of your support for gay marriage, a bold vote, other things regarding immigration. But this is a line that you feel you can't cross when it comes to criticizing what the former president did with lionizing January 6 attackers? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Well, I spent 20 years in the Navy. I'm a retired Navy master chief. I'm always going to fight for what I believe is right. And what I see right now is, people are fed up with the environment that is happening. They're fed up with the rhetoric. They're tired of inflation. They're tired of the border crisis. They're tired of the national security policy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And they want real action. And whoever delivers that for them is going to get their vote, whether that's President Trump and -- or anyone else. So I think that's the part people are missing out on. MARGARET BRENNAN: Including those who attacked law enforcement as they did on that day? That -- that part has to bother you. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Look, January 6 should never have happened. And those that are -- that -- that have -- found wrong for doing that, they need to be held to this -- the highest standard. I absolutely agree with that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, they were singing last night as the walk-on song for the former president of the United States; 17 of the 20 inmates held in that jail... REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... were accused of assaulting law enforcement. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Yes, look, there... MARGARET BRENNAN: That's the walk-on song. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: There is -- there is no room for anyone that assaults law enforcement, right, similar to what happened in -- in Oregon or anywhere else throughout our country. We have to absolutely be -- surround our law enforcement and ensure -- they have the toughest job right now. You have to get it right every single time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: So, now's not the time to attack law enforcement. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Well, let's talk about the border and law enforcement there. In your district Friday, there was this horrific case of these two migrants found dead, others suffocating to death in this train. Secretary Mayorkas blamed smugglers. Do you have any idea where these migrants are coming from and how they passed undetected? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Yes, Margaret, sadly, this isn't a new issue for any of us that live in Texas' 23rd District. So, Knippa, happens all the time. Hondo is another city where this happens regularly, Uvalde, Eagle Pass. This has been ongoing for a couple of years now. Just last week, just last week in Ozona, Texas, small little town out in West Texas... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: ... there was a smuggler that came through town and killed -- that killed a woman, a grandmother and her granddaughter. So, every day, someone is dying. MARGARET BRENNAN: So what's the bipartisan effort to deal with this issue at the border? Republicans still haven't put forward their proposal with a budget. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is it you're asking for? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I'm asking for a border package that focuses on securing the border and an immigration package that focuses on legal immigration. Both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party often get it wrong when they focus on illegal immigration. And I'm going to do everything in my power, whether it's to buck my own party or buck the other party, to be able to say, we have to have real tangible solutions. H.R.29 is a prime example, this Border Safety and Security Act. It does anything but secure the border. So guess what? That bill in particular, it's dead. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: There's no way it's going to get on the floor. I'm going to do everything in my power to prevent that, because, in my district... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: .. people are dying. And we need real solutions, not political rhetoric. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, talking about political rhetoric, you've said this, that there are people who have interest in making this crisis flare up. Dan Crenshaw recently urged the Biden Administration to initiate military action against cartels. James Comer said President Trump should have bombed drug labs. Lindsey Graham, senator from South Carolina, demanded U.S. forces destroy drug labs. None of that sounds serious. That's -- that's the Republican policy option that deals with the things you say are important. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I spent 20 years in the Navy. I spent five years in Iraq and Afghanistan. I fought in two wars. I know what war looks like. I hate war, I want to prevent war. MARGARET BRENNAN: And not bomb drug labs? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And not -- and not -- and not do these things. But part of it is rolling up your sleeves and going to work. Just last week, I gave Senator John Cornyn a lot of credit. He put together this congressional delegation, 12 members, six Republicans, five Democrats and an independent. We traveled to Mexico City last week -- last weekend. We met with the president of Mexico, and we had a four-hour dialogue, four- hour discussion. That is how you solve problems. Now, I look at it that's the State Department's job. And the State Department isn't doing their job. But Congress can't just point fingers. We can't just please blame. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: We are an equal body, and we got to roll up our sleeves and find solutions. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll stay tuned and stay in touch with you on that, look for those solutions. Congressman, thank you for coming in today. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Thank you, Margaret, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic Chairman of the Intelligence Committee. He joins us from King George, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: It was a pretty intense five hours of questioning of TikTok's CEO this past week. Your bipartisan bill has White House support, and it would deal with TikTok by giving the Commerce Department power to review and potentially ban technology flagged by U.S. intelligence as a credible threat. Will it pass in a divided Congress? SENATOR MARK WARNER: We're now up to 22 Senators, 11 Democrats, 11 Republicans. We've had strong interest from the House. I think they wanted to get through their hearing. And, clearly, while I appreciated Mr. Chew's testimony, he just couldn't answer the basic question. At the end of the day, TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance. And by Chinese law, that company has to be willing to turn over data to the Communist Party. Or one of my bigger fears, we got 150 million Americans on TikTok, average of about 90 minutes a day, and how that channel could be used for propaganda purposes... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: ... or mis or dis-information advocated by the Communist Party. MARGARET BRENNAN: But has the White House made clear to you that they want this bill to pass and do intend to ban it? Or is a forced sale more likely? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I think the White House is very in favor of this bill. We give the secretary of commerce the tools to ban, to force a sale, other tools. And, end of the day, one of the things that may lead to a ban is, the Chinese Communist Party has said they felt like the algorithm, the source code that resides in Beijing, is so important that they'd rather see a ban than give that source code up to be placed in a third country, which, again, I think speaks volumes about the potential threat that this application poses. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the commerce secretary, though, recently said that the politician in her thinks a ban will mean losing every voter under 35 forever. And if you look at use of TikTok, I mean, just last week, President Biden showed up in celebrity videos on TikTok from the White House. Plenty of lawmakers, including your Democratic colleague Senator Cory Booker, use it. A number of House progressives use it. Given how important this platform is to Democrats, can you actually get TikTok taken care of before 2024, when you might need it for political outreach? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, Margaret, I think there's a lot of creative activity that goes on, on TikTok, but I absolutely believe that the market -- if TikTok goes away, the market will provide another platform. And, at the end of the day, that could be an American company. It could be a Brazilian company. It could be an Indian company. All those companies operate within a set of rule of law. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but the commerce secretary is saying there's a political cost if it goes away. And that's what she fears. SENATOR MARK WARNER: I think... MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're empowering her. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Listen, I have met with -- I have met -- I have met with Gina Raimondo on this issue. I think she will make very clear that she believes TikTok is a threat as well. And, listen, if, at the end of the day, you could end up with a forced sale, and that forced sale also makes sure that the core algorithm, the source code, resides someplace different than China, that could be an outcome that would be successful as well. At the end of the day, you cannot have American data collected, nor can you have the ability for the Communist Party to use TikTok as a propaganda tool. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sixty percent of the company is owned by other investors, including U.S. firms. So is this a policy that you really need to address with Americans to stop them from investing in companies like this? SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, that's one of the reasons why I think our approach, the RESTRICT Act, says, rather than dealing with TikTok in a one- off fashion, or, a few years back, it was Huawei, the Chinese telecom provider, or years earlier, the Russian software company Kaspersky. We need to have a set of tools, rules-based, so they can stand up in court -- TikTok would still did its day in court, even under our law -- that says, if there's a foreign technology from a place like China and Russia, and it poses a national security threat. And one of the things we also require is that the intelligence community has to declassify as much of this information as possible. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR MARK WARNER: So it's not simply like, hey, trust the government. We got to make the case. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, since you sit on the Senate Banking Committee, about this rolling turmoil that we are in. Do you think there needs to be more regulation of midsize banks now? SENATOR MARK WARNER: If it ends up that a stress test that would have been applied to these midsize banks would have spotted this, of course, I would add additional regulation. I think, though, what it appears to me is, two things happened. One, basic banking regulation, if this has been only a $5 billion bank, not a $200 billion bank, should have spotted the fact that this management and the regulators missed basic banking 101, the interest rate mismatch. And, two, one of the things that I think we also have to look at is, this was the first time we've had an Internet-based run. There was literally $42 billion... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR MARK WARNER: ... taken out of this bank in six hours. That's the equivalent of 25 cents on the dollar. And I would like to know why some of the venture capitalists spurred this run in the first place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Interesting topic. I want to ask you, though, as well, about your relationship with SVB Bank and political donations. You received $21,600 from their political action committee, nearly six grand from its CEO. Do you feel any pressure to give those funds away? Is there a point to it? SENATOR MARK WARNER: We're going to hear the facts on Tuesday. And if there's malfeasance at the bank, of course, I'm going to give the money back. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Senator, before I let you know -- go, I want to just follow up on what you shared with us when we spoke back in January, when you were very frustrated that the administration wasn't sharing more information about the classified materials improperly held by the current president when he was out of office and the former president. SENATOR MARK WARNER: Mm-hmm. MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been briefed. Any more clarity on this? Any further information? SENATOR MARK WARNER: We need more information about these documents. And, more importantly, we need to make sure that what the intel community has done to mitigate the harm. And we're still in conversations with the Justice Department. The administration's position does not -- does not pass the smell test. We've got a job, not to go into the legal ramifications, but to make sure that the intelligence community has done what's right. And we've got some additional tools. We can restrict some of the spending. We're in active conversations with the Justice Department. But we've got to get those documents. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator Warner, thank you for your time today. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby. Good to have you here. A lot to talk to you. I want to start right where Senator Warner left off. Does the White House want to share more information about these classified materials? He says it doesn't pass the smell test. JOHN KIRBY (NSC Coordinator For Strategic Communications): We're fully cooperating with the Justice Department on the -- on this ongoing investigation, Margaret. That's got to be the focus, making sure that we preserve that process. And so that's what we're doing. And, of course, at the appropriate time and in the appropriate setting, we certainly understand the desire by members of Congress to know more, to see more. But we have got to make sure that we're in full cooperation with the Justice Department on this right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: As for what Senator Warner was laying out there, and giving the White House the tools to make a call on TikTok, this has been going on for years now... JOHN KIRBY: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... the review of whether to allow it. If it's a national security threat, doesn't there need to be swift action, rather than more debate? JOHN KIRBY: Well, there's an ongoing, as you know, and -- review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. MARGARET BRENNAN: Three years now. JOHN KIRBY: Ongoing review. We -- it's an independent review. We want to respect that process. But, look, in the meantime, the president's already said, we absolutely have national security concerns about that application, and he's banned it from government devices. We don't want to get ahead of this review. We have endorsed the RESTRICT Act, pending legislation. We'd love to see that passed by the Congress, so that the president can have additional tools and authorities. MARGARET BRENNAN: We showed a video in that last segment of the president on TikTok from the video shot by a celebrity inside the White House. So, for the 150 million Americans who still use this app, how do you say to them, sorry, we're going to take it away? JOHN KIRBY: It's not on government... MARGARET BRENNAN: It looks hyper-critical -- hypocritical. JOHN KIRBY: It's not -- it's not on government devices. We do have legitimate national security concerns. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: Filmed on government property. JOHN KIRBY: We have legitimate national concern -- security concerns over TikTok. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a useful political platform. JOHN KIRBY: I just would tell you that, again... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JOHN KIRBY: ... our concerns on the national security front are valid. We have banned it on all government devices. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JOHN KIRBY: We got to get through this CFIUS review to see what the outcome is there before we -- before we move ahead. In the meantime, again, the president welcomes... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JOHN KIRBY: ... congressional action on the RESTRICT Act. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will -- we will see when it moves and what -- what the action will be, ban or for sale. Let's take a break. I want to talk to you about Syria and Iran in a moment. JOHN KIRBY: OK. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you miss an episode of Face the Nation, you can listen to our podcast. Find us on Amazon Music or wherever you get your podcasts. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We return to our conversation with National Security Council Spokesman John Kirby. I want to ask you about what has been happening in Syria with these attacks on U.S. forces there. We had this deadly attack on Thursday by these Iran aligned groups, a U.S. retaliation, and then three other known attacks on U.S. positions. President Biden said he would act if U.S. troops were under fire. Is the U.S. going to retaliate? JOHN KIRBY (National Security Council Spokesman): We have acted with U.S. troops under fire. First of all, our condolences - MARGARET BRENNAN: On Thursday. JOHN KIRBY: Our condolences to the family of the U.S. contractor, U.S. citizen, who was killed. That's devastating news that no family wants to ever get. And we certainly grieve with them. And we're, obviously, hoping for a speedy recovery for those who are still suffering from the wounds. But this was a - this was a serious attack by these militant groups and the president retaliated swiftly and boldly and significantly to deal with that. You're right, there were some follow-up response from -- MARGARET BRENNAN: At least three. JOHN KIRBY: At least three from these militant groups. Not a lot of damage caused, although the one - one service member was injured. So, we're going to see where this goes. But the president, in Ottawa, made it very clear that we're going to always act to defend our troops and our facilities. And here's what's not going to change, Margaret, the mission and ISIS is not going to change. We have under 1,000 troops in Syria that are going after that network, which is, while greatly diminished, still viable and still critical. So we're going to stay at that task. MARGARET BRENNAN: The president is committed to keeping those 900 or so troops in Syria? JOHN KIRBY: That's right. Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: The head of Central Command testified earlier in the week, there have been 78 attacks by Iran-backed groups against Americans since 2021. That was before these recent strikes. They don't appear to be deterred by these verbal threats or even the retaliation. JOHN KIRBY: That's why, again, the president acted so swiftly and boldly here in this particular case. And I certainly am not going to rule out the potential for additional U.S. action if the president deems it appropriate and necessary to continue to protect our troops and our facilities. We're going to keep at that. And that message is send loud and clear. Now, again, the - these Iran- backed militant groups, that they're going to have decisions that they're going to have to make, they need to know, and we demonstrated it here this week, that the United States will always act decisively to protect our people. MARGARET BRENNAN: But to cause American fatality, did this Iran - Iranian- backed group know that parts of the radar defense system were not fully operational at the time they carried out that drone attack? JOHN KIRBY: We've seen no indication that they - that they had that kind of a - that kind of knowledge. And, in the past, on some of these other attacks, I mean they have used similar capabilities to go after our troops and our facilities there in Syria. So, there's no indication that they would have had knowledge of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin said yesterday that Russia struck a deal with Belarus to station tactical nuclear weapons on its territories by July 1st and then by about April 3rd he says they're transferring ballistic missile systems and beginning training. Is he serious? Is this just more saber rattling? JOHN KIRBY: We're just going to have to watch and see where this one goes, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: No movement so far? JOHN KIRBY: The - the - we have not seen any indication that he's made good on this pledge or moved any nuclear weapons around. We've, in fact, seen no indication that he has any intention to use nuclear weapons period inside Ukraine. Obviously, we would agree that no nuclear war should be fought. No nuclear war could be won. And clearly that would cross - cross a major threshold. I would also tell you that as we monitor this, and we monitor it every day, you have to with the rhetoric out of Moscow, and with rhetoric that's been coming out since the beginning of the war that we've seen no -- nothing that would cause us to change our own strategic, deterrent posture. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why would he do this now? JOHN KIRBY: You'd have to ask Mr. Putin. I can't speak to that. I think in some of the Russian media reports they linked it to claims that that United Kingdom was going to provide depleted uranium rounds. There is no radioactive threat from depleted uranium rounds. They're common on the battlefield. Even Russia uses similar rounds. So, if that is, in fact, the justification, it's a stake through a strawman. There's no radioactive concerns with that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Here in the United States, Taiwan's president is scheduled to begin a visit later this week in New York and then next week out in California. Republican lawmakers will visit with her. Has the White House ask Democrats not to do so? JOHN KIRBY: There's been no request by the White House to Democrats not to meet with President Tsai. Members of Congress have every right to manage their agenda and their meeting schedule as they seem fit. I think it's important to remember what this is. This is a transit. They're normal. She's done six before. MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a long transit. JOHN KIRBY: She's done six before. MARGARET BRENNAN: Tension with China has never been this high. JOHN KIRBY: They're - they're -- we - and, look, we understand that. And the president has said clearly he believes it's important to keep the lines of communication with China open. He wants to have another conversation with President Xi. We'll move in the direction. But these transits are normal, particularly for this particular president. MARGARET BRENNAN: No date for that call with President Xi yet? JOHN KIRBY: No date for that call. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you so much for joining us here. JOHN KIRBY: My pleasure. You bet. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We now return to former President Trump's legal problems in that Manhattan case being prosecuted by District Attorney Alvin Bragg. We're joined once again by our Robert Costa and joining us remotely our CBS News legal analyst Rikki Klieman, along with former New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, who also happens to be Rikki's husband, in full disclosure. They are both in Naples, Florida, and we're so glad that they can join us together because I do want to start on the legal and security aspects of this case. Rikki, last night the former president told reporters he thinks the case against him has been dropped. We've seen no evidence to back that up. What is reality about what to expect in the coming days from this grand jury? RIKKI KLIEMAN: From all of the information that we have, the grand jury is set to meet, as usual, on Monday. The grand jury usually sits Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. We do not know if they are done with their evidence yet. But when they finish, we assume that Alvin Bragg's office will come to them with a draft indictment, at which point he will put forward the charges that he intends to prosecute. The district attorney, or his people, are excused from the room. The grand jurors deliberate. It takes a vote of 12 out of 23 grand jurors to return an indictment. It could happen as early as this week. MARGARET BRENNAN: It could happen. Commissioner, the Manhattan district attorney, in the past few days, has already received threats. The former president, besides the rhetoric that he has issued, reposting images of himself with a baseball bat, he's vowed death and destruction, we also had this example of a white powder being sent to the office of the district attorney. Can you just give us a snapshot of the threat level right now? BILL BRATTON (Former NYC Police Commissioner): Well, as you might expect, the threats that are being made by the former president, which are unfortunate, law enforcement officials will be responding accordingly in the sense of ramping up security certainly around the district attorney and others affiliated with this case. The district attorney is normally provided with New York City police protection. That protection has, in fact, been expanded. There is significant protection around that courthouse, in that courthouse, if, in fact, that is the courthouse that is going to be used for an arraignment if there is an indictment. Law enforcement is monitoring social media very closely and will respond, as they always will, with speed and intensity to any threats made against any of the individuals in this case. MARGARET BRENNAN: If there is an indictment, Commissioner, how -- can you walk us through what an arrest of a former president looks like? I mean this seems unprecedented. Will anyone even be handcuffing him, for example? BILL BRATTON: If there are handcuffs, the president is going to have to bring them himself. I don't imagine that the court officials will require handcuffs to be placed on the former president. That's a policy decision. It's thought that the president would like to have that photo, but I don't think the officials in New York are going to provide that opportunity. If there's an indictment or indictments, the president will be required to surrender some place in Manhattan at one of the courthouses where he would be basically fingerprinted electronically, photographed, and basically given a booking number, if you will, at which time he would then be taken before a judge to be arraigned on the charges contained in the indictment. The way it works is the, if you will, the booking would be supervised by people from Alvin Bragg's office. The New York police are there for security purposes. Secret Service would be there every step of the way, as they are required to do to protect the president. So, the process is being negotiated as to where and how it will be done. It's an exceptional process, as you might expect, for this particular case, for this particular individual. MARGARET BRENNAN: Exceptional is certainly the word. Rikki, you know, past Manhattan district attorneys have chosen not to move forward with this case. There have been questions about the legal theory that part of it, at least, is based on. If the indictment happens, do we know what the charges would be, and what is the likelihood it goes to trial? RIKKI KLIEMAN: We do not yet know what charges will be, but we certainly have a very good idea of what some of them will be. And we have that idea not only because of Michael Cohen speaking outside to the press after he has testified. But we also know that the district attorney's office has spoken with Stormy Daniels. And we also know that from Joe Tacopina, the president -- former president's lawyer, as what they expect, as I say, some of the charges to be, because there may be additional charges. And what the charge that is expected has to do with the hush money payment that was made by Michael Cohen, he says at the behest of Mr. Trump, in order to buy her silence, in order to have it not come out on the eve of the 2016 election. The difficulties with this case, and no one would say this case is easy, is that you take misdemeanor charges for falsifying business records, because the payments, back to Michael Cohen, are written off as legal fees against retainer. You take those as falsifying business records, you couple them with a federal election violation in order to up the misdemeanor to a felony. That's a unique theory. It is novel. It has not been tested before. But Alvin Bragg certainly feels that it will pass muster under the law. Ultimately, will the case go to trial? I believe so, if there is an indictment. Will the case be won while a jury in Manhattan may want to convict Donald Trump on the evidence presented, the question may be for a judge as to whether or not the facts constitute a crime under the laws of New York. Keep in mind one other thing, Margaret, this may not be the only charge. There may be tax evasion charges. There may be other kinds of charges that have been looked at by Mr. Bragg's predecessor, which had to do with inflation and deflation of property values that are currently being looked at in a civil case by the New York attorney general. So, we don't ultimately know what the final charges will be, if there is an indictment. MARGARET BRENNAN: If. Commissioner Bratton, the district attorney, Alvin Bragg, is a Democrat. Mr. Trump has really taken aim at that fact and his record on crime. What should people at home know about Bragg? Is he an effective district attorney? BILL BRATTON: Bragg has been controversial since his election relative to the issues of crime in New York City, particularly in Manhattan, his jurisdiction. Crime has gone up. Recently shootings and murders are down. But, overall, crime is continuing to go up. So, his effectiveness, his progressive policies have been very much under debate in terms of people in New York City. I'm somebody who has criticized very frequently his actions or inactions relative to that crime situation. But we need to take that and separate it from this current situation, this current case. They are two separate issues entirely. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Commissioner and Rikki, thank you for your analysis. I want to ask Bob Costa, who's here in studio with me, about the reporting you have gathered on this case. Is it all about Michael Cohen? ROBERT COSTA: It is not all about Michael Cohen. After being outside the Manhattan criminal court all week, it's clear, based on our conversations with sources, that the district attorney has documents in his possession that would be central to any case he eventually decides to mount, should it move in that direction, that it's not just about Michael Cohen's testimony. So often we hear about this case, and we hear Michael Cohen's testimony would be the keystone for any sort of prosecution. It would certainly be critical but not the only component. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do we have any details about what might be in those records? ROBERT COSTA: To build on Rikki's point, we are hearing there are business records, e-mails, financial records, that the district attorney has compiled, that this is not just about bringing in Michael Cohen and Bob Costello, though we do wonder at this point who else is going to come in this week potentially. We spoke to Bob Costello, the final witness potentially, last night, and he told CBS News he does not expect to be called this week. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Bob Costa, we'll continue to follow this story. And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Neel Kashkari, who joins us this morning from Minnesota. Good morning to you. NEEL KASHKARI (Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: How stable is the U.S. banking system right now from your perspective, and are you confident that the risk level we saw out in California and in New York, with these failed banks, doesn't exist elsewhere in the country? NEEL KASHKARI: The banking system is resilient and it's sound. The banking system has a strong capital position and a lot of liquidity and has the full support of the Federal Reserve and other regulators standing behind it. Now, I'm not saying that all of the stresses are behind us. I expect this process will take some time. But, fundamentally, the banking system is sound. MARGARET BRENNAN: This process, what do you mean by that? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, when tensions flare up in the banking system and stresses emerge, we often hope that they'll be resolved very, very quickly. Sometimes it takes longer for all the stresses to work their way out of the system. So, we know that there are other banks that have some exposure to long-dated Treasury bonds, who have some duration risk, as they call it, on their books. We also know that commercial real estate, there are a lot of commercial real estate assets in the banking sector and there are some losses that will probably work its way through the banking sector. So, that process will take time to fully become clear. But, fundamentally, the banking system has a lot of capital to be able to withstand those pressures. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you mentioned commercial real estate because so many of these mid-sized banks are lenders in that space. So that could impact construction, in other words. This could have a real impact on the economy. Does it tip us towards recession? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it definitely brings us closer. Right now what's unclear for us is how much of these banking stresses are leading to a widespread credit crunch, and then that credit crunch, you're right, just as you said, would then slow down the economy. This is something we are monitoring very, very closely. Now, on one hand, such strains could then bring down inflation. So, we have to do less work with the federal funds rate to bring the economy into balance. But right now it's unclear how much of an imprint these banking stresses are going to have on the economy, but it's something to watch very carefully, and that's what we're focused on. MARGARET BRENNAN: And Chairman Powell said as much this past week at the Federal Reserve, that that tightening in credit might be doing your work for you in terms of slowing down the economy. Does that mean it would make Neel Kashkari hit the brake on rate hikes at your next meeting? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we have to see. You know, right now the stresses are only a couple weeks old. There are some concerning signs. The positive sign is, deposit outflows seem to have slowed down. Some confidence is being restored among smaller and regional banks. At the same time, we've seen the capital markets have largely been closed for the past two weeks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. NEEL KASHKARI: If those capital markets remain closed because borrowers and lenders remain nervous, then that would tell me, OK, this is probably going to have a bigger imprint on the economy. So, it's too soon to make any forecasts about the next interest rate meeting that we have, the next FOMC meeting. But these are the factors that I'm going to be most focused on. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, when it comes to confidence among Americans in the system right now, CBS News just recently did a poll and only 15 percent of people polled by us said they had a lot of confidence in the Federal Reserve's ability to manage these bank issues. Why should the public trust the Fed now when this risk to banks was missed out in San Francisco and New York and when the Fed was late to the game on catching up with inflation? NEEL KASHKARI: You know, the Covid pandemic has thrown some curveballs at us that none of us have experienced in any of our lifetimes. And it has taken us time to catch up and figure out exactly where the economy is head. The interest rate risk that brought down Silicon Valley Bank is something that we've all been very focused on. We've been communicating it to banks all across the country for the last couple years that interest rates are going up and most banks have done a much better job of managing their risks in advance of those interest rates going up. And so there is still uncertainty in the economy, there are still stresses. You have a group of people at the Federal Reserve who are totally committed to our mandates, to -- committed to achieving the public service responsibilities that we have. And we are going to continue to let the data and the evidence guide us. And that is the best reassurance that I can give, is that a lot of - a group of people, are non-partisan, focused on doing their very best on behalf of the American economy and American households. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we're about to see the first hearing on Capitol Hill this week about what just happened. But there were flashing warning signs out there at SVB Bank, the Silicon Valley Bank, in the months leading up to its failure. On this program, just earlier today, Senator Warner of Virginia, who's on the Banking Committee, said the regulators missed basic banking 101, the interest rate mismatch. How could that risk have been so missed by the regulators at the Federal Reserve in Washington and in San Francisco? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I don't know any specifics about the SVB case because they're not regulated by the Minneapolis Fed. And I know Vice Chair Barr is conducting a rigorous review to understand exactly what happened. It has been publicly reported that the Federal Reserve did take action specific to SVB to get them to address these exposures. I don't know more than that. And I'm looking forward to Michael Barr's review and his findings, which we're all going to take very seriously. I can tell you, at the Minneapolis Fed, we have conversations with our bank supervisors and then with the banks about these risks all the time. It doesn't mean that we're not going to make mistakes. It doesn't mean that we are perfect. But I know, across the Federal Reserve, that bank supervisors have been focused on these very exposures since before the interest rates increases even began last year. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, just on this program last week, Senator Warren says she doesn't have confidence in Mary Daly, the San Francisco Fed president. Do you? NEEL KASHKARI: I do. I know Mary Daly exceptionally well. I've worked closely with her for the last several years. She's an outstanding public servant committed to helping all of us fulfill our mission for the public. Nonetheless, we have to look at the findings that Vice Chair Barr comes out with, take those findings very seriously and potentially make changes based on those findings. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. NEEL KASHKARI: But I know Mary Daly and all of my colleagues at the Federal Reserve are doing our very best. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have experience in banking crises from your work back in -- with TARP, the rescue program in 2008. I wonder what you think now. Do you think there needs to be more regulation? Should deposit insurance on accounts above $250,000 be raised? And should those rollbacks from 2018 be reinstated in terms of regulation of mid-sized banks? NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we have fundamental issues, regulatory issues facing our banking system. I have argued for years that the biggest banks in the world are still too big to fail. This question is now beyond doubt. All right, the reason that deposits are flowing to the big bank, the reason that Credit Suisse was bailed out by the Swiss government is because banks have this premium position. And it's unfair. It's an unfair playing field that puts enormous pressure on regional banks and community banks. And that needs to be addressed. We need regional banks in America. We need community banks in America. So, we have -- once we get through this stress period, we have to come up with a regulatory system that both ensures the soundness of our banking system, but is also fair and even so that community banks and regional banks can thrive. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes. NEEL KASHKARI: We do not have that today. MARGARET BRENNAN: Neel Kashkari, I look forward to talking to you again about this. We're going to have to leave it there. And we'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan. (ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

            "article_content": "Several Republican members of Congress and donors who are longtime supporters of former President Donald Trump attended a retreat hosted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over the weekend, just four miles away from Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence, as DeSantis mulls a potential presidential run in 2024.\u00a0 Trump held his own donor gathering last Thursday at Mar-a-Lago. More than a hundred attended DeSantis's gathering, which was meant to connect several of the governor's longtime donors and allies, a sign that Republicans are keeping their options open in 2024. DeSantis himself moderated panel discussions centered around immigration, COVID-19 and the \"Florida Blueprint\" that his 19-point re-election win in 2022 could provide for the rest of the country.\u00a0 According to event attendees, notable figures who were in Palm Beach, Fla. for DeSantis' retreat include Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who spoke at a panel about the \"medical establishment.\" DeSantis has been critical of big pharmaceutical companies, and has tapped into the anti-vaccine flank of the Republican party with his ban of vaccine mandates and questions his office raised about the safety of Pfizer and Moderna\u00a0COVID-19 vaccines.\u00a0 Still, the attendance of Johnson and other Republicans doesn't mean they'd back DeSantis, should he decide to run. Johnson has been a staunch Trump ally, and his spokesperson, Corinne Day, said he \"historically does not endorse in primaries and plans to continue this trend and remain impartial in 2024.\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican leader in the first state to kick off the Republican nominating process in 2024, spoke at a panel to discuss the governor's \"Freedom Blueprint,\" which focuses on school board elections.\u00a0 Reynolds has held several events with 2024 candidates and potential candidates, including this past week with Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, who is so far the only other major declared GOP presidential candidate besides Trump. Reynolds has previously said she would not endorse in the 2024 primary.\u00a0 \"You'll see her introducing and welcoming all candidates to Iowa, just like she did with Haley and Scott this week,\" a person close to the governor said. Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, as well as Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Chip Roy of Texas also attended the DeSantis event. Massie has called DeSantis \"is the best governor in the United States.\" Adam Laxalt, a former candidate for Nevada Senate and state attorney general who was also DeSantis' roommate during naval officer training, and former Arizona Senate candidate Jim Lamon were at the retreat. Roy Bailey, a Texas donor and fundraiser who was the national co-chair of Trump's joint fundraising operation with the Republican National Committee in 2020, was also spotted at the retreat. Former Trump-era White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was also there.\u00a0 Former Congressman David McIntosh, president of the influential conservative economic group Club for Growth, was in attendance at the retreat. His group, which has not endorsed anyone at this early point in the primary, has conducted polling that shows DeSantis winning in a head-to-head matchup with Trump and is hosting its own donor retreat in March with potential 2024 candidates. While Trump was not invited, DeSantis, Haley, Scott, former Vice President Mike Pence, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who has also declared his 2024 presidential candidacy, are among those expected to be in attendance.\u00a0 In most polls, Trump still receives a plurality of the support in a more crowded primary field. A Fox News poll released last Sunday showed Trump on top with 43%, followed by DeSantis with 28%.\u00a0 Though he isn't a presidential candidate yet, DeSantis has already been on the receiving end of several attacks from Trump online and in interviews. In November 2022, Trump disparaged him as \"Ron DeSanctimonious\" and has since written social media posts criticizing the Florida governor's previous stances on Social Security and Medicare. Asked at a February press conference about another post in which Trump insinuated DeSantis drank with underage girls during his stint as a teacher in Georgia, DeSantis said, \"I don't spend my time trying to smear other Republicans.\" Earlier this month, multiple potential 2024 candidates attended a separate retreat hosted by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and arranged by strategist Karl Rove. The gathering was to raise money for the \"Texas Voter Engagement Project,\" and was attended by Haley, Scott, Pence, Sununu, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who ran for president in 2016.\u00a0 Trump and Haley are the only major declared candidates in the 2024 GOP primary race.\u00a0 DeSantis has been coy about a potential 2024 run, at one point answering a reporter who asked in February about his timeline for a campaign, \"Wouldn't you like to know?\" But DeSantis' three-day long retreat is viewed by Republicans as one sign he's preparing for a run and building the infrastructure for a potential campaign. Last Monday he traveled to three Democratic-run cities (Staten Island, Philadelphia, Chicago) for speeches and meetings with law enforcement officials.\u00a0 Richard Porter, an RNC Committeeman from Illinois who attended his speech in Elmhurst, said the governor was \"very well received\" and that he's \"putting governing first to build on his successes.\" DeSantis' new book, a memoir, will be published Tuesday and kicks off a national book tour over the coming weeks for the governor that could take him through several presidential primary states. This weekend he'll be attending fundraisers in Texas and California, and is expected to skip the Conservative Political Action Committee conference in Washington D.C. later this week. Former President Trump and Haley are both expected to speak at the conference. If he makes the final decision to enter the 2024 presidential race, DeSantis isn't expected to launch a campaign operation until after Florida's legislative session ends in May, which he emphasized in a recent interview with Fox News. \"I've got two big things coming up: One, I have a book coming out on Feb. 28... It's called 'The Courage to Be Free.' It talks about Florida's blueprint for American revival. So, we're going to go on a tour on that. We're going to sell some books, we're going to spread the message of Florida,\" he said. \"Then on March 8, I have our Legislative Session that's kicking off. \"This is going to be the most productive Legislative Session we have had across the board and I think people are going to be really excited \u2026 So those are what we're going to be doing over these next few months, as we get beyond that, then we can decide from there,\" he added.\u00a0 Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

And this week on Face the Nation: The high-stakes diplomatic drama over the Chinese spy balloon is intensifying, as we learn more about what the Chinese may have discovered from their soaring surveillance. In the end, it took a missile fired from an F-22 fighter jet flying over the South Carolina coast to shoot-down the gigantic surveillance balloon that had floated across the U.S. 60,000 feet above ground. (Begin VT) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Recovery efforts are under way to determine just what the Chinese had attached to that balloon. The Saturday shoot-down marked the end of a tense week for the Biden administration. (Begin VT) QUESTION: You were saying the recommendation from your -- was from your national security... JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): I told them to shoot it down. QUESTION: On Wednesday? PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: On Wednesday. QUESTION: But the recommendation from... PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: They said to me, let's wait until the safest place to do it. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will ask Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz how the incident will impact our already strained relationship with China. Then: Following the brutal beating of Tyre Nichols by the Memphis police, we will take a look at efforts to renew police reform with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Plus, how will the new 53-year low in unemployment impact the Fed's moves to lower inflation. We will hear from Gary Cohn, who led the National Economic Council under former President Trump. Finally, ahead of Tuesday's State of the Union address, four new House members weigh in on the prospects of action on crime, immigration and spending in this divided Congress. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. Well, it was a drama that had all the signs of a Hollywood movie. The end of the Chinese spy balloon's journey was somewhat predictable, but what happens next is still very much up in the air. According to the White House, the balloon was detected a week ago in Alaskan airspace, and was not assessed to be an intel risk or threat. It then drifted through Canadian airspace moving southeast and was spotted in Montana, home to a U.S. nuclear missile base, where it turned into a very public diplomatic crisis. Beijing insisted the balloon was an airship gathering weather data that had just drifted off course. Secretary of State Blinken abruptly canceled his trip to China, a visit intended to thaw icy relations between the two countries. Many lawmakers, mostly Republicans, expressed frustration with the administration for not taking action earlier. But the president stuck with the Pentagon's recommendation to wait until the balloon moved offshore and away from civilians, still within U.S. waters. Now, the debris from that balloon, as well as what the Chinese learned from the mission, is of huge interest. The Chinese government issued a scathing reaction to the shoot-down, stating they strongly disapprove and that it was a clear overreaction and a serious violation of international practice, and warned that Beijing reserves the right to make further responses. We want to bring in our David Martin for more on this story. David, the Pentagon says this is part of a fleet of balloons and that it was surveilling sensitive military sites. Do we have a sense of the damage? DAVID MARTIN: Well, the Pentagon claims that there was no real damage because most of this intelligence, they already collected with the satellites that China sends over the U.S. every day. But it loitered over an American intercontinental ballistic missile field in Montana. And it was fitted with what the Pentagon says were cameras and antennas. And you have to believe that they picked up something, or it wouldn't have been worth all of the risks that they ran in sending a balloon over here that they knew was going to be detected. There's no way they could have believed that they could sneak that balloon across the United States. So, I think you have to assume that they got some intelligence value out of it. Now, I think you have to assume that the U.S. got some intelligence value out of it, because they sent planes up to photograph that sensor pod that was on the balloon. And they have got videotapes of it. So, they -- the U.S. was essentially watching China watch us. And it's all spy-vs.-spy stuff. And, over time, the spy vs. spy stuff just tends to cancel itself up. One day, you're up. The next day, you're down. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what can you actually see from 60,000 feet? What's the advantage? DAVID MARTIN: Well, back in the day, I actually went up to 60,000 feet in a backseat of a U-2. And, up there, it's not just like being in an airline, or only higher. You can actually see the curvature of the Earth. And you're in a plane that is filled with cameras, which have obviously a much higher resolution than the human eye. And they're not looking just straight down. They're looking out and all around them. And they're sending those pictures up to a satellite, which is then relaying it down to a ground station, where an intelligence analyst is watching in real time. The U-2 is a great intelligence collection platform. It's got one problem. Anybody with a missile that can get up to 60,000 feet can shoot it down. And, of course, that turned out to be the balloon's problem as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which indicates this could be a problem. But the message from the administration to date has been that this wasn't really a threat. It did throw off that attempt to reset relations with Beijing. And that could have some big implications. Diplomats are really trying to lower the tension, but you see in that Chinese statement there's some edge. DAVID MARTIN: Well, they say, yes, we reserve the right for further responses. So let's see what those further responses are. Are they going to send another balloon? Is the U.S. going to shoot it down right away? Or I think, more importantly, are they going to start some serious harassment of these American reconnaissance planes that fly around the periphery of China? They have already been buzzing them. And the U.S. has already been filing diplomatic complaints about it. I would not want to be flying the next mission around the periphery of China. And the question is, will the U.S. provide armed escorts for those reconnaissance planes? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DAVID MARTIN: And what happens if some... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. DAVID MARTIN: ... Chinese fighters show up, and you have a confrontation? MARGARET BRENNAN: David, always sobering to talk to you. Thank you for your reporting. DAVID MARTIN: Sure thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Dallas, Texas, where we are joined by Republican Senator Ted Cruz. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): Good morning, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this balloon traversed 11 states, but the Pentagon says they were able to mitigate some of its impact. Do you think there is upside to the fact that this was captured this time? SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, listen, I want to start by doing something that I don't do very often, which is commending Joe Biden for actually having the guts to shoot this down. That was the right thing to do. That is absolutely what the president should have done. Unfortunately, he didn't do that until a week after it entered U.S. airspace. He allowed a full week for the Chinese to conduct spying operations over the United States, over sensitive military installations, exposing not just photographs, but the potential of intercepted communications. And -- and, more broadly, I think this entire episode telegraphed weakness to Xi and the Chinese government. And to illustrate why, I would just ask one -- one hypothetical question. Imagine how this would have played out if nobody had taken any pictures of the balloon, if nobody in Montana had looked up and noticed this giant balloon, if it wasn't in the news. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TED CRUZ: We know that when the Biden administration knew about the balloon, they said nothing, they did nothing, they didn't shoot it down. And, at the end of the day, I think the only reason they shot it down is because it made it into the news... MARGARET BRENNAN: Well... SENATOR TED CRUZ: ... and they felt forced to, as a matter of politics, rather than national security. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well... SENATOR TED CRUZ: That's a bad message for the Chinese government to hear. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Pentagon has since disclosed that it's apparently happened four times before, never quite like this. Back in 2020. the Trump administration shuttered the Chinese Consulate in Houston after detecting espionage. Do you think there needs to be more diplomatic fallout on that scale now? SENATOR TED CRUZ: Look, I -- I think there does. When -- when -- when the Trump administration shut the Chinese Consulate in Houston, I spoke with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, about it. And what they had discovered about the espionage activities being carried out in the state of Texas by the Chinese government was horrifying. Right now, there is a Texan, Mark Swidan, who is a political prisoner. He is a hostage in China. He's been there for 10 years. This past week, I introduced a resolution on the floor of the Senate, along with John Cornyn, calling on China to release Mark Swidan. He's wrongfully imprisoned. He's been there 10 years. They've sentenced him to death on charges for which they have little to no evidence. And -- and I had been urging Tony Blinken, when he was going to Beijing, to raise Mark Swidan's case... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TED CRUZ: ... and to make the case for Mark to be released. China, if they want to demonstrate that they're not bad actors, if they want to demonstrate that they can aspire to being a great nation, they should release Mark Swidan because great nations and great powers don't hold political prisoners. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And he is wrongfully detained, according to the State Department. SENATOR TED CRUZ: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: This was raised to Xi Jinping in November, and there -- there hasn't been a release to date. Thank you for mentioning that. But I want to ask you about your role. You are the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee. You're also a dad. I know you know how hard it is to keep kids offline and this app called TikTok. It's been downloaded 200 million times. I know you think it's espionage. Are we at the point where we're past a ban, where this is just so embedded, that you can't get rid of it? SENATOR TED CRUZ: Yes, look, TikTok is incredibly concerning. You're right. With our kids, if you have teenagers, if you have kids in junior high or high school, they're all using it. And the degree to which they have infiltrated our children is really disturbing. There are lots of problems with it. There are problems in terms of the messages that they're pushing on young kids, body image messages, where, for girls in particular, you have problems with eating disorders, where they push one message after another. You have messages of self-harm, where the algorithms push self-harm messages on young girls, and we're seeing really disturbing figures among teenagers. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TED CRUZ: And then, on top of that, you've got the espionage risks. The Chinese Communist government has access to all of the information TikTok collects. I think it is a serious, serious threat. I will tell you, on the Commerce Committee... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TED CRUZ: ... I have already sat down with each of the Republican members on the committee to ask them their priorities, and there was consensus on this side of the aisle that focusing seriously on TikTok is a real priority. MARGARET BRENNAN: As a ban? SENATOR TED CRUZ: And I think there are a lot of Democrats who are very concerned about it as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: As a ban or to force the sale of it? SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, I -- I think all of the options are on the table. And I will tell you, I encourage Maria Cantwell, the Democrat chairwoman, that I think it makes sense early on for us to have a hearing on TikTok and examine these harms very directly, how it's hurting our kids, and how it's undermining national security. As I said, both Republicans and Democrats are very concerned about the impact of TikTok. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Should America restrict U.S. companies from investing in Chinese industries and key technology sectors? SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, I think we should be doing a lot to delink our supply chain from China, to make it so that we are not dependent on China. We saw, during the pandemic, when one of the major Chinese state-owned newspapers threatened to cut off lifesaving pharmaceuticals, things like heart medication... MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. SENATOR TED CRUZ: ... that -- that people depend upon. And it makes no sense for us to leave the lives of Americans at -- at the whim of the Chinese government. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TED CRUZ: I will tell you, in the last Congress, I introduced an amendment on the floor of the Senate to block the United States government from purchasing electric vehicles or batteries that were manufactured using slave labor in concentration camps in China. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR TED CRUZ: China has over one million Uyghurs in concentration camps. And, Margaret, sadly, when we voted on it, every Democrat but one, every Democrat but Joe Manchin voted no. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TED CRUZ: And, right now, the Biden administration is one of the largest customers in the world for the concentration camps that are carrying on murder and torture right now in China. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, and that... SENATOR TED CRUZ: That doesn't make any sense, and it's not right. MARGARET BRENNAN: No. Senator, I want to ask you about something here at home. You also introduced a bill to limit terms to two six-year terms in office for Senators. Why aren't you holding yourself to that standard? You said you're running for a third term. SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, listen, I'm a passionate defender of term limits. I think that Congress would work much better if every senator were limited to two terms, if every House member were limited to three terms. I have introduced a constitutional amendment to put that into the Constitution. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're still running. SENATOR TED CRUZ: And if and when it passes -- if and when it passes, I will happily, happily comply. I have never said I'm going to unilaterally comply. I will tell you what. When the socialists and when the swamp... MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you running for president? SENATOR TED CRUZ: ... are ready to leave Washington, I will be more than happy to comply by the same rules that apply for everyone. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TED CRUZ: But, until then, I'm going to keep fighting for 30 million Texans, because that's the job they've asked me to do. MARGARET BRENNAN: You -- I think you heard me -- I think you heard me ask if you're running for president. SENATOR TED CRUZ: I'm running for reelection to the Senate. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK. SENATOR TED CRUZ: There's a reason I'm in Texas today. I'm not in Iowa. I'm in Texas. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR TED CRUZ: And I'm fighting for 30 million Texans. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you very much, Senator Cruz, for your time today. We turn now to Democratic Senator Cory Booker in Newark, New Jersey. We turn now to Democratic Senator Cory Booker in Newark, New Jersey. Good morning to you, Senator. SENATOR CORY BOOKER (D-New Jersey): Good morning. Thank you for having me on. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on the news of the moment. Mark Warner, fellow Democrat, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, tweeted: \"There is no way the Communist Party of China would allow a balloon like this to fly over the Chinese heartland.\" I wonder if you personally are concerned that it was allowed to enter U.S. airspace at all? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Well, again, Mark Warner is right. We should not have had this kind of incursion into the United States. And we have a real problem with China on a number of issues, from their human rights violations, to their violations of international business law, to even the challenges we've had with them on overt spying. So, I'm grateful that the military took decisive action when they did and how they did. But we obviously have issues here. MARGARET BRENNAN: And the issues with espionage, as you just indicated, go into a number of different areas. Due to national security concerns, Congress had banned TikTok, for example, the social media app, on federal devices. Your home state of New Jersey has also put restrictions in place. But you still use it personally. Does that mean that you think it's too late to go ahead and ban this? It's already on 200 million American devices. Is it just so integrated that that espionage is something we have to live with? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: No, absolutely not. And I think there's two ways to approach this. One, the proactive step of banning and on government devices is something that the United States federal government is doing, states and even localities are doing. But the other way to go about this is going directly to the company. They are now working with U.S. intelligence folks to try to make sure that the proper precautions are taken, so the Chinese cannot get access and use it for spying. So, this is something we have to take seriously. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about the meeting you had with fellow Democrats at the White House on Thursday in regard to police reform. What agreements did you all come up with? And is it anything you can get Republicans to sign on to? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Well, first of all, I want to again express my condolences to the family of Tyre Nichols. This was a really horrific murder. We saw a man on the ground handcuffed, being beaten, and eventually die as a result of his wounds. This should not happen in the United States of America. And so I'm grateful that the president has taken decisive action in the last Congress with an executive order, but it falls to Congress to find a bipartisan way forward to make sure that we are doing what is necessary to raise police standards and professionalism, to create more transparency and accountability in American policing. I believe we can find a way forward. It is going to be more difficult in a divided Congress. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR CORY BOOKER: But I believe that a moment like this, a moral moment like this, requires decisive action. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we've been through moral moments before, and negotiations have failed, as they did when you were talking to your Republican colleague Tim Scott back in 2021. He says that this -- House progressives' police reform bill -- I assume he means George Floyd Act -- it won't go anywhere. But he has given an impassioned speech saying he wants solutions that would have made a difference, specifically, more grants, more de-escalation training, and duty-to-intervene training. Is this a starting point for talks? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Absolutely. I mean, I have been talking to people on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Capitol, in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. There is a pathway forward. And I'm going to be tireless and not stop until we do significant things to make Americans safer and to make our policing standards higher. And I'm not standing alone on this. The fact that we have police leaders, the largest union that represents the majority of police... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR CORY BOOKER: ... that we've been able to come together on bipartisan ideals, I think there's a pathway forward, though I'm very sobered, in a divided Congress, about our ability to get it done. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you talking to Tim Scott now about this? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: I don't think Tim Scott and I have stopped talking. Let's be clear, Tim and I have been a proven partnership. We've gotten things done, from... (CROSSTALK) MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you walked away from the talks a year ago, so you did stop negotiating. Are you renewing those negotiations? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: Again, Tim and I have not stopped talking. We're guys that have gotten the Opportunity Zone legislation done. We've gotten the criminal justice reform done. We may have stopped formal negotiations, but he and I are actually friends. We may be in different parties and disagree on a host of stuff, but the reality is, we're two black men in America who have had really awful experiences with law enforcement that law enforcement leaders say are unjust. We're motivated. MARGARET BRENNAN: One issue you put to the side back in 2021 was that really hard issue of qualified immunity, which is whether to hold individual officers accountable for -- or the entire police department accountable civilly for police misconduct. Lindsey Graham tweeted that: \"Holding departments accountable makes sense because, in America, if you run a business and produce a product, you're responsible for your actions. The same should be true for police departments.\" Is he offering you the start here of something? SENATOR CORY BOOKER: You know, I have had conversations, meetings with Lindsey Graham, in this Congress as well. He is somebody that agrees with me that there is common sense here. You can't have accountability without consequences when things go wrong. And we should definitely agree that the things we're seeing too often now because of body cameras and other filming have to stop in our country. This is wrong. And I'm happy that I have Republican colleagues that agree this is wrong, and we're trying to work something out. And I'm going to continue with it. And I'm grateful for the president of the United States... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR CORY BOOKER: ... to members of the House of Representatives, like the Congressional Black Caucus. We're determined to try to get something done. May it be a big comprehensive bill? In this Congress, that might be hard. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR CORY BOOKER: But we can find ways to do things that make things better. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Booker, thank you for your time this morning. We will be back in a minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We have got some good news this week. Hiring surged last month, but there may be a downside. Mark Strassmann reports. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): Not since the Nixon era, May 1969, has an American president watched unemployment dwindles so low, 3.4 percent, despite big tech's latest bloodbath, pink slips galore at Amazon, Google and Microsoft, American labor overall added more than a half-million jobs last month. MAN #1: We're gaining jobs, which is great, but in terms of, like, inflation, interest rates, definitely would love to see that improve over the next year. MARK STRASSMANN: But the sizzling job market complicates the Fed's mission, bludgeon inflation with higher interest rates. Inflation is now at 6.5 percent compared to this time last year, down from the June peak of 9.1 percent. The Fed raised its benchmark rate by another quarter-point last Wednesday, its eighth hike in 11 months. Expect rates to go up again in the months ahead. JEROME POWELL (Federal Reserve Chairman): We will need substantially more evidence to be confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path. MARK STRASSMANN: Those latest economic developments do little to calm millions of Americans. Ahead of Tuesday's State of the Union address, our new CBS News poll shows ripples of anxiety. Six in 10 Americans believe the economy's condition is bad, pessimism that has been in place over the last year. Among all America's challenges, our poll says the top priority, lowering inflation. Three in four people said they worry about it the most. WOMAN: I think you never fully stop holding your breath when you see prices going up. MARK STRASSMANN: Over the next year, our poll shows roughly six in 10 Americans expect the economy to be in recession or slowing. Many everyday Americans are sweating this economy. Instability generates insecurity. MAN #2: I feel like it's kind of falling apart, the economy. We need to rebuild it up. I don't know what the exact answer is. MARK STRASSMANN: It's vexing because of all the guesswork involved for economists, for all of us. For Face the Nation, I'm Mark Strassmann in Atlanta. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Be sure to tune in for special coverage of President Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday starting at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on our streaming network and 9:00 p.m. on the CBS broadcast network. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with Gary Cohn, who led the National Economic Council under former President Trump. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We want to turn now to the economy and that surprising jobs report for the month of January. We're joined by former top economic adviser under the Trump administration, Gary Cohn, who is now the vice chairman of IBM. Good morning. Good to have you back here. GARY COHN (Vice Chairman, IBM): Thanks for having me, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, 517,000 new jobs, but a lot of companies, particularly in tech, are announcing layoffs. So, exactly where is the economy headed? GARY COHN: So -- so, it's interesting. We did see the 500,000 plus new jobs, which was quite surprising I think to many of us. But I think what we're actually seeing here is a re-normalization of the new economy. A lot of the jobs that we saw were jobs in the service industry. The service industry is coming back very strong because we're starting to see the economy go back to what we historically think of the economy. For the first time we've seen occupancy rates in offices in major cities over 50 percent. When you see occupancy rates go up, you need the service sector to work. Think about people going back into the office. They need parking attendants. They need people to work in the buildings. They need security. They need people to clean the buildings. People stop for coffee when they go into the buildings. They go out to lunch. They go to bars. For the - for that to happen, you need the service sectors to come back to work. So the 128,000 service sector employees that came back to work, that 100 percent correlates with people going back to what is the new normal. It may not be five days a week in the office, but it's enough days in the week in the office where you need the service sector to come back to work. The interesting thing about last month's employment numbers is, we brought people back to work, but we did not have to entice them with pay. So, the monthly -- the month over month number in wage gains was 30 basis points. The prior month was 40 basis points. So we're seeing - we're getting people back into the labor force for a lower wage than we were prior to this. I - MARGARET BRENNAN: And - and that's a little bit hopeful for you on the inflation front? GARY COHN: Yes. Yes. And I think this is natural. I think what we've seen is after all the stimulus that was put in the system over the last three months, people are running out of stimulus moneys. We saw that in the fourth quarter last year. We saw consumer spending slow down. We saw debit balances on credit cards go up. We started to see delinquencies go up. And you know what happened, people actually did the right thing and they went back to work, they re-engaged and they reentered the workforce. And I think we saw a lot of that in the January numbers. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, these more positive signs have led Bank of America, for example, to say recession, still in the cards, but not until after March. I wonder what your thoughts are on that. And as CEOs warn about borrowing costs going up as a result of the Fed hiking, they are tightening belts. So, how far off is this recession? GARY COHN: Well, we -- we've got a couple phenomenons going on. Interest rates have been going up, so borrowing costs have been going up for companies. On the flip side, the dollar has been weakening. So the multinational corporations in the United States, who repatriate earnings from offshore, those repatriated earnings have become more valuable. I think the people that have been really worried about a recession in the first and second quarter of this year, I think after what we've seen this week with both Chairman Powell's announcements and the data in unemployment, I think that recession is off the table for Q1 and Q2 this year. You know, we're going to get another employment report before the next Fed meeting and we'll see where the economy's going, but it does feel like we're in relatively good shape here. The question is going to be, how does the Federal Reserve handle what's going on in the economy? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GARY COHN: Are we going to continue to have to increase wages to draw people back in the labor force, or are people coming back in the labor force because they need to and we're not going to have wage inflation. And if that happens, the Federal Reserve is actually in a very good place. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about something the Fed chair said this week. He said, Congress has to lift this debt ceiling. I'm throwing one of the things that could screw up your - your rosy prediction at you. GARY COHN: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: He said, no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner. He's warning. He's not making plans for a default. You're on your own if it happens. GARY COHN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Should there be a plan for the Fed to step in? I mean, I know legally it's in question here, but I hear -- talk to people on Capitol Hill who say, Wall Street's not taking this seriously enough. The politics are really bad around the debt ceiling. GARY COHN: The politics are very bad. You know, the one thing is, every American, every American is holding the U.S. government to raise the debt ceiling. The full faith and credit of the U.S. dollar and the U.S. dollar being the reserve currency is imperative to our economic well-being as a country. We ultimately have to get the debt ceiling raised. That said, what's going on here is not something out of the ordinary. If you look at debt ceiling raises over the last 40 or 50 years, no matter which party is in the minority, about 50 percent of the time debt ceiling raises come with some amendments attached to them from the other party. So, this is quite normal, the process that we're going through. MARGARET BRENNAN: You - you don't sound overly concerned? GARY COHN: Look, I'm always concerned when we're dealing with debt ceiling, but I have a feeling that we will get there in the end when we have no other choice. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GARY COHN: You had the - you had the speaker here last week, and he felt confident that we would get there when we had no other choice. The speaker met with the president of the United States this week. The two of them came out of the meeting relatively confident. I feel they both understand, there is no choice. In the end of the day, we have to raise the debt ceiling. The question is, can the Republicans get something in the legislation attached to the debt ceiling legislation that they want, that they feel like is a win and the Democrats are willing to give it to them? Historically, that is what's happened numerous times. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Yes. And the risk there is real. I want to ask you as well about China. Mark Warner was here with us last week, and he said, technology competition with China is the biggest issue of our time. He's worried about things that -- like your company does, IBM GARY COHN: Yes. Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of quantum (ph) computing. Is enough being done to keep America competitive on that front? GARY COHN: Well, we're starting. You know, if you look at where - where we've been this year, you know, we passed the Chips Act in the United States, which, you know, is - is - is something that's not a normal motion for us in the United States for the federal government to pick and choose an industry. MARGARET BRENNAN: To subsidize. Yes. GARY COHN: And to subsidize. It really is not a normal action. It's an action that, you know, historically I probably not would have been -- have supportive of. I was extremely supportive of the Chips Act. We, at IBM, were extremely supportive of the Chips Act. If we learned nothing else from the pandemic, we learned that there are certain goods that are necessity goods for this country to have. And we are overly reliant on places like China. And if we don't find ways to change the manufacturing system in the supply chain and move it back to the United States where we can take care of ourselves, we have made a - a catastrophic miscalculation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. GARY COHN: Chips are one of those areas where we cannot depend on the rest of the world and run our manufacturing business and continue to grow our economy. Pharmaceuticals is another area where we really have to move that industry and that manufacturing back to the United States. So I think we really have to evaluate what are the most crucial and sensitive businesses or industries that we cannot live within the United States and we're going to have to make real investments in those here in this country. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll keep talk about it with legislators, who have to figure out how to pass some of those laws. But we're going to take a quick break and when we come back we'll be talking with four members of the freshmen class in the 118th Congress. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Joining us now for a look at the new Congress, a group of freshmen House members. Congressman Robert Garcia is the president of the Democratic freshmen class. He's from the state of California. The gentleman next to him is New York Republican Congressman Mike Lawler. Congresswoman Summer Lee is a Democrat, and she is from the state of Pennsylvania. And Congressman Zach Nunn is a Republican from Iowa. So, I want to talk about some of the things you all think you can get done here in Washington. Congressman Lawler, the former speaker, Nancy Pelosi, recently told \"The New York Times\" that Democrats could have held on to the House if New York politicians had realized earlier on that crime was such a key motivating issue. In the last Congress, they green lit about $4 billion in grants for local law enforcement. Do you think that money now needs to be accompanied by some kind of reform, something more on crime? REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): Here in Washington, there's a lot of bipartisan support, I think, for especially making sure that law enforcement has the resources they need and the training that they need to do their jobs effectively. I think, obviously, the situation in Memphis with Tyre Nichols is a horrifying example, but I think there's a lot of area where we can work together to address the rise in crime and why we are seeing such a rise across the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Like what? MIKE LAWLER: You have to look at, what are some of the root causes of why, you know, we're seeing such an increase in crime, gang activity. Obviously, you see the scourge of fentanyl pouring into our communities, drugs being dealt that are having a devastating impact. So, I think there is a lot of area where we can work together to address these challenges. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman? This is your party in the majority. REP. ZACH NUNN (R-IA): Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: $4 billion in grants just went to local law enforcement. Does Congress need to do anything more to address crime? ZACH NUNN: When I was chair of judiciary at the state level, Iowa moved very aggressively after the George Floyd homicide. We immediately said that we were going to allow our attorney general to investigate crimes directly so that we weren't waiting on county attorneys. We made sure that bad law enforcement officers couldn't be cycled through without some kind of a background check. We made sure that we made a direct investment in mental health across the state and made sure that our regional, both our urban, but also our rural communities, had access to that. And, ultimately, we also worked with our law enforcement to make sure that law enforcement had a better relationship with the community, rather than one of conflict. There's some tangible successes we've seen at state levels. Let's bring those up to the federal level to make sure they can work the same way. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do want to see more legislation on -- ZACH NUNN: Yes, I think there's absolutely more that needs to be done on this. What doesn't need to be done are what I will call these fig leaf grants, the idea that we can just hire more minority officers in rural Iowa. That is a very challenging thing to do. We should be identifying - and we saw tragically, even in Memphis, that that alone is not a silver bullet solution. We've really got to get to the effort of, you know, good policing, but also recognizing, when there is good law enforcement, we hold that up as a partner in the community. That's where this money could be going. And it needs to be accountable. I think far too much of this has gone to, you know, some major metropolitan areas which have seen actually crime spike in those neighbors. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, you said it would be good to revive the George Floyd Policing Act but we're so far past that right now we really need to kind of escalate the conversation faster. What do you mean? What are you calling for? REP. SUMMER LEE (D-PA): So, let me be really clear, there is a proliferation of disinformation and bias in conversations about crime and conversations about policing. And to be very clear, police violence is crime. We cannot say that we care about crime but then do nothing, choose to do nothing, over and over and over when the crime is committed by a police officer. There are statistics that show that less than 2 percent of police officers who are engaged in the misconduct are ever indicted at all. And while we can all celebrate that five black police officers, right, in - let -- not escape us, that it was only when they were black that there was swift action and there was a sixth who was not black and there was not swift action, that we can say that Tyre should be alive, so should Atatiana Jefferson, so should Antwon Rose II, from my district, so should Mike Brown, so should Philando Castile, they should all be alive. So, when we're talking about crime and we're talking about how we're going to solve it, when I say that we need to change the conversation, we need to acknowledge that public safety does not begin with policing, public safety begins with investments, it begins with addressing our own implicit and explicit biases in policy making and education and appropriations. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when the president talks about reviving George Floyd Policing Act, you're saying not as it's currently written. You want more measures added? SUMMER LEE: Absolutely. I want us to be intentional at every step about addressing racial bias, about addressing poverty, about addressing crime and about addressing police violence. REP. ROBERT GARCIA (D-CA): I think Representative Lee is absolutely right. Listen, I would vote for the George Floyd Policing Act if it was on the floor tomorrow, but more needed to be done. Additional steps need to be taken. MARGARET BRENNAN: It won't be put on the floor tomorrow under Republican leadership, to be clear. ROBERT GARCIA: Absolutely. And that's why I want to be clear also with our - when colleagues bring up that more should be done around this issue. The truth is that you look at a place like California or most of the country, we are actually safer today than we were 15, 20, or 30 years ago. Statistically. And so there's a lot of concerns around crime, and there should be. We all want to be safe. But I also think we've also got to look at the data and actually look at the facts. The truth is that every single election cycle, it just seemed that there is a lot of focus on crime and inner cities. And the truth is that we are safer than we were 20 or 30 years ago in our communities. MARGARET BRENNAN: But there was a spike in violent crime and you can't -- MIKE LAWLER: In New York state - in New York state in particular, the reason there was a focus on crime by voters is because they didn't feel safe. You had people being pushed in front of oncoming subway cars, you had people being stabbed in the street. By the way, the vast majority of victims of crime are black and brown people. So, to act as though it - there -- there's not a crime issue I think is - is dismissing the fact that it is serious and people do not feel safe. And so, yes, we need to address the root causes of why someone may turn towards crime or why they may find themselves as part of a gang, but we also need to hold people accountable with the decisions that they make. And I think part of the problem here is that oftentimes it is very easy to go say law enforcement bad. But the vast majority of people who are in law enforcement are good people. I come from a community that has a strong law enforcement presence. Fifty percent of - of households in my district have a cop, a firefighter or a first responder or a veteran in them. They're good people and they want to do right by our community. SUMMER LEE: The vast majority of people in poor and working class neighbors are good people. ZACH NUNN: That's right. MIKE LAWLER: They are. They are. SUMMER LEE: And they are victims of crime that we don't say anything about. For instance -- MIKE LAWLER: And they want police presence. ZACH NUNN: Exactly. MIKE LAWLER: They want to be protected. ZACH NUNN: They want a police presence. SUMMER LEE: But, for instance, there is no police presence when they're a - when they're a victim of waste theft. Who - who -- we're not seeing anybody fear mongering -- MIKE LAWLER: You what, I passed legislation - I passed legislation to prosecute that. And it should be prosecuted. SUMMER LEE: That's awesome. And I would like to see it happening here because what we don't see, when we're talking about crime, we're really talking about white collar crime, we're really talking about ways in which we're going to hold corporate criminals accountable, we're really make -- taking any strides in any level of government to do anything about that, but we continue to talk about the crimes of desperation, and particularly the crimes in marginalized communities. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some other issues, immigration and border security. It has been years and there has been failure to legislate on this. What's going to be different in a split Congress now? Do you see hope for this? ZACH NUNN: I do. I really do. The challenge right now is, until we secure the border, we have a really porous situation where the folks who are coming here illegally are jumping ahead of the folks who are coming here legally. The folks who have set up shop in America and want to be got citizens are finding themselves outfoxed by people who are being encouraging to come here illegally. And it's not like everybody has the chance. It's those who can get here. ROBERT GARCIA: Most Republicans in this Congress have been disingenuous on immigration. I'm an immigrant. I came to the U.S. when I was a young kid. I had the privilege and honor of becoming an American in my early 20s. I am grateful to this county. I love this country. Immigrants love this country. They just want an opportunity to be here, a pathway to citizenship, or even just worker programs. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're talking about dreamers. You're talking about border security. ZACH NUNN: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: You - I mean there are different aspects of this. ROBERT GARCIA: Well, you can do both. You can - you can do both. MARGARET BRENNAN: What part of this can get through in this Congress? Which piece? ROBERT GARCIA: So I - ZACH NUNN: Well, I would like all of the above. ROBERT GARCIA: I would hope that both could be done in this Congress. ZACH NUNN: Yes. I - yes, done. I agree with you on that. ROBERT GARCIA: Here - here's the thing. The thing is, is that, unfortunately, we -- there's this myth that Democrats somehow aren't secured about a secure border, that we don't want an orderly process, but we also want to insure that we want secure - everybody wants a secure border, but we also want to insure that we're talking about the humanity of people. SUMMER LEE: Absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ROBERT GARCIA: These are people that are coming to this country that are desperate, that are suffering. And so this idea that we can't give these people justice, we can't support and help them I think is anti-American. And I am hopeful, like some of you, I have talked to some Republicans on the other side that have an interest in a broader immigration reform package. And that's something that I hope we can all work on. MIKE LAWLER: My wife is an immigrant as well. And she came to this country about a decade ago in search of economic opportunity. She comes from eastern Europe. A former Soviet satellite state. The bottom line here is this, we embrace immigration. All right. But we have to have a legal process. You need to secure the border. We need to increase border patrol. We need to increase the number of judges and court personnel to hear asylum cases. Nobody should be waiting two to three years to hear an asylum case with the hope that they may come back for the court hearing. That's insane. And then we need to fix the legal immigration process so that people who want to come here can do so legally and contribute to our communities, to our culture, to our economy. And I think there can be broad bipartisan agreement on this if everybody is willing to kind of give a little. Both sides have failed on immigration for years. For years. This is not one party or the other. Both sides have failed miserably here. And we have a situation that is unsustainable. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to move on to - to governance and debt. Can I see a show of hands, are you all confident that America will avoid defaulting on its debt? MIKE LAWLER: Yes. ROBERT GARCIA: Yes. ZACH NUNN: I think - MARGARET BRENNAN: Show of hands. ZACH NUNN: I'd like to think so. SUMMER LEE: I hope so. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are - you're confident we will avoid the cliff? MIKE LAWLER: We - we absolutely will. The bottom line is this, we have incurred debt previously. We have an obligation to pay that. We will lift the debt ceiling. But -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that some of your Republican colleagues, who have been very -- in a very different place on this, will come along and that the party -- MIKE LAWLER: Absolutely. But - but here's the point I would make. Over - over the past many decades, major spending reform has been tied to the debt ceiling, OK. So, the White House needs to recognize one thing. One party rule in Washington is over. They need to negotiate with the speaker in good faith to come to a long-term agreement that puts us on the path to fiscal solvency. MARGARET BRENNAN: Social Security, health care, including Medicare and Medicaid and then defense are the three biggest line items. Where do you cut? If you have to have this conversation, where do you cut? SUMMER LEE: Defense. The reality is, is that we can't keep asking the same people to compromise over and over and over. When we talk about these conversations, we have to humanize them. We have to be very clear, what we are proposing to cut, who are going to be impacted by it. ROBERT GARCIA: What we've actually been spending all this money on is actually getting our country back on track. We just went through the single largest loss of life event in the modern era of our country. We lost over a million Americans. We spent money trying to keep people alive. We spent money trying to keep businesses afloat. We spent money to ensure that people were housed, people that needed support. And so, yes, we spent. There was a significant spending, but it was spending to respond to this incredible pandemic. And so this idea - and so this idea -- ZACH NUNN: So, I have to be respectful and say, you're saying government's the solution for this. I'm saying states like Iowa, they opened back up, people were the solution. ROBERT GARCIA: We're - we're - we're in the business of governance. So, of course, government is the solution. SUMMER LEE: Oh, (INAUDIBLE). ZACH NUNN: Absolutely. And so - so let's - with respect -- ROBERT GARCIA: And as far as - and as far as -- as far as this unity amongst Republicans around the debt ceiling, the truth is there is no unity. We're not -- Democrats are united. ZACH NUNN: You're not in our conference. ROBERT GARCIA: We're not going to cut Social Security. We're not going to cut Medicare. And so I'm interested to know how we're going to get to this resolution so that - because we know that this - this issue, at the end of the day, impacts working people the most. MARGARET BRENNAN: So the discretionary spending you would cut is also in defense? ROBERT GARCIA: Listen, look, I think, first of all, I - MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you just said (INAUDIBLE) - ROBERT GARCIA: If it was up to me, we'd be raising taxes on billionaires and the corporations. That's where we'd be getting more support. But I think Representative Lee is right, I think we have to be able to look at an institution like the Pentagon -- ZACH NUNN: So let's be very clear here - ROBERT GARCIA: Not all. ZACH NUNN: If somebody is looking for an opportunity to go to college - SUMMER LEE: Not all. ZACH NUNN: They have the opportunity to serve in the military, and it will help pay for them to have the privilege of going to college. What I will not do is see members of the military who are on the front line defending our very opportunity to even go to college have their paychecks cut or their opportunity to defend themselves cut because of lackluster equipment. SUMMER LEE: (INAUDIBLE) there is a vast difference between - MARGARET BRENNAN: House Speaker McCarthy - ZACH NUNN: Look, the military - the military is very - no, no, no, you just said Pell Grants versus military. SUMMER LEE: No, but, no, no, no, she asked us - ZACH NUNN: Let's humanize this. SUMMER LEE: Let's humanize. There's a difference between sending our - our troops somewhere defenseless and then looking at our defense budget. ZACH NUNN: Right. So -- SUMMER LEE: Which is the highest of the next, what, 20 countries combined. ROBERT GARCIA: Right, and we are continually forced to defend the world. SUMMER LEE: We're not saying that we're sending - absolutely, we're - with endless - endless wars. With endless wars. ROBERT GARCIA: And that's (INAUDIBLE). ZACH NUNN: No - no him, by our maker (ph). MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know Speaker McCarthy, on this program last week, said when it came to cutting discretionary spending, actually one of the places he would look to trim fat was the Defense Department. You don't sound like you're OK with that. ZACH NUNN: Margaret, I think - no. So let's - let's take, first of all, what he did say is take things off the table. We're going to protect Social Security. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ZACH NUNN: People have paid into that. They deserve to have that back. Republicans are committed to that. Let's take the Medicare that has gone out there to make sure that people have access to the health care they need to be successful off the table. When it comes to defense spending, what I just heard was, cutting things across the board. If there is a review, everything should have the opportunity to be assessed. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're on board. ZACH NUNN: (INAUDIBLE). SUMMER LEE: (INAUDIBLE) to cut. MIKE LAWLER: (INAUDIBLE) what? ZACH NUNN: Yes, I think we should be looking across the board. And I would also say, here's where we have been successful in a state like Iowa that has the number one growth rate - MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. ZACH NUNN: Is that we don't spend more than we take in. And ever year we only spend - SUMMER LEE: But who are you going to cut? ZACH NUNN: No, no, it's not about cutting. SUMMER LEE: Because she asked me, who are we cutting? Yes. MIKE LAWLER: Here's - here's how - here's part of the problem with - ZACH NUNN: How do we grow the economy to begin with? SUMMER LEE: By taxabilities (ph). MIKE LAWLER: We have not had a real budget process in a very long time. ZACH NUNN: That doesn't grow the economy. MIKE LAWLER: And you have to go line by line and you need these departments and agencies to justify their spending. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ZACH NUNN: Right. MIKE LAWLER: They have not had to do that in a very long time. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. MIKE LAWLER: We need a real budget process as part of this negotiation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. Sure. Which takes time. We're going to have to leave it there. Thank you all for coming in. And I want to thank each and every one of you for joining our panel. ZACH NUNN: Thanks, Margaret. ROBERT GARCIA: Thank you. MIKE LAWLER: Thank you. SUMMER LEE: Thanks for having us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.

            "article_content": "When Sanna Marin was elected prime minister of Finland in 2019, she made history. At 34-years-old, Marin became the youngest head of government in the world. But it wasn't the prime minister's political moves that caught the world's attention last summer. It was her dancing. You may recall the uproar after a video of the millennial prime minister partying with friends was leaked to the press. Prime Minister Marin was already in the spotlight after Russia invaded Ukraine last year.\u00a0 Finland and Russia share a long border and a complicated history. In May, Prime Minister Marin announced Finland would apply for NATO membership for her country of five and a half million. A bold move that ended seven decades of Finnish neutrality and angered Russian President Vladimir Putin. Sanna Marin: I don't think that Vladimir Putin is someone that you can reason with. I think his actions are very emotional and it's based on some kind of-- feeling of history and-- and greatness-- of Russia. They see Ukraine part of Russia, and they think that they have the right to attack another independent country. Sharyn Alfonsi: Do you think that as we sit here right now that Russia poses a threat to Finland? Sanna Marin: I think Russia poses a threat to all of Europe. They are attacking another country. They are killing civilians. They are demolishing infrastructure. Russia poses a threat to all of us, and that's why we have to make sure that Ukraine will win. We met Sanna Marin at the prime minister's official residence in Helsinki. A quiet spot overlooking the frozen Baltic Sea. Sanna Marin: We live upstairs there. But, of course, we also have our own home. Sharyn Alfonsi: Oh, that you can-- Sanna Marin: Yeah. Sharyn Alfonsi: be private? Sanna Marin: On a few kilometers here. Sharyn Alfonsi:\u00a0 OK Moments of quiet have been few and far between, for Prime Minister Marin. Who, over the last three years, has moved from one \"once in a lifetime\" crisis to another. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 The most defining one, unfolding last year. Finland's 800-mile border with Russia is the longest of any European Union country. Sharyn Alfonsi: How quickly after the invasion did you decide that Finland should join NATO? Sanna Marin: I knew it right away. I was leaning-- in favor-- of NATO even before-- but the country wasn't ready.\u00a0 If you would have asked Finnish people or politicians in the parliament, \"Should Finland join NATO?\" before the war, majority would have said no.\u00a0 But after the war started, I knew immediately that this is the only way also for Finland to join the alliance--\u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi: When you say, \"This is the only way,\" what do you mean by that? Sanna Marin: Well, we are a next-door neighbor to Russia. And now, we have seen that Russia is attacking today-- their neighboring country.\u00a0 And we don't ever again want to see war-- in Finland. So we are asking ourselves, \"What is the line that Russia wouldn't cross?\" And that's the NATO line.\u00a0 The invasion of Ukraine opened old scars for many finns. In 1939, Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union. which took about 10% of its territory. Since World War II, Finland has been militarily neutral. Its leaders, characterized as \"bear whisperers\" for their ability to stand up to Vladimir Putin but not provoke him.\"\u00a0 The president of Finland, who oversees foreign policy, reportedly last spoke to Putin in May. The same month Finland submitted its application to join NATO. Sharyn Alfonsi: Putin has said if Finland joins NATO that Russia may be forced to take retaliatory steps.\u00a0 Do you view those words as a threat? Sanna Marin: I think we should make our decisions not based-- by fear-- but what we really feel and think. And that's why we are joining NATO and hopefully we will be members of NATO very soon. Sharyn Alfonsi: It's one thing to say, \"We support Ukraine.\" It's a very different thing to go to Ukraine, to stand next to President Zelenskyy, which you did, which was a bold move. Why did you choose to do that? Sanna Marin: Well, I think it's very important that we are showing solidarity in many ways-- by sending humanitarian aid, financial aid, military-- aid-- equipments, for example.\u00a0 And I think it sends very important message: that we are in it together. They are not alone; we are right beside them. Taking sides is not what the Finns are known for, but Sanna Marin seems to enjoy breaking traditions. Marin, who was raised by her mother and her female partner in a working-class neighborhood, was the first in her family to graduate high school, and later, college. She was elected to city council at age 27. Soon, her contentious speeches were shared around Finland on YouTube. \u00a0 In 2015, she was elected to parliament as a member of the left-leaning social democratic party. \u00a0 Four years later, at age 34, she was named the prime minister of Finland. The most powerful political position in the country.\u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi: Was that your intention? Sanna Marin: I never really have focused about my own career. I-- I know that sounds (LAUGH) interesting, because I am in this position. But it's also coin-- coincidence that I became a prime minister. Sharyn Alfonsi: Really? You can become prime minister by coincidence? Sanna Marin: Well, I was the first vice-chair of our party when the last-- previous-- prime minister, Antti Rinne, had to resign, and then I had to step up.\u00a0 The former prime minister submitted his resignation after he was accused of mishandling a postal strike. Marin was chosen by her party to fill his shoes.\u00a0 Sanna Marin: But it wasn't something that I pursued. I wasn't sure (LAUGH) is it something that I personally want, or-- or am I capable of doing-- all of those things? But-- but I thought that, \"If somebody else can do it, why not me?\" Marin, who was the mother of a newborn, with her now-husband, Markus Raikkonen, took office in December 2019, leading a historic coalition government in which all party leaders were women. A month later, the prime minister and her new cabinet were tested with a global pandemic. Sharyn Alfonsi: That had to be just-- a crash course in leadership for you. What were those days like as you were figuring that out? Sanna Marin: Everybody was like frozen in the beginning. \"What should we do?\" And then it really took-- political leadership-- from me but-- but al-- also-- many ministers that were-- in the center, in the middle-- of the crisis.\u00a0 So-- so it was also lonely. It-- it took cour-- courage-- a lot to do those very difficult choices that we weren't prepared before.\u00a0 She's talking about when she ordered her country's borders and schools to be shut down in March of 2020 and promptly imposed a lockdown. Finland fared better than most of Europe, with lower infection rates and a quicker economic recovery. Prime Minister Marin was praised for her steady leadership and earned an 85% approval rating for her handling of the crisis. But as the pandemic came to an end, the public spotlight turned to the prime minister's private life. In August, a series of private videos, including one of the prime minister dancing with friends, was leaked to the press and made international headlines. Critics accused her of embarrassing Finland, a country that prides itself on being stoic and reserved, and called for her to resign.\u00a0 Opponents demanded the prime minister take a drug test, which was negative. Marin held back tears as she defended her actions, saying: \"I am a human, during these dark times, I too need some joy\u2026 light and fun.\" She added she'd never missed a day of work. Sharyn Alfonsi: In your apology you said, \"I'm a human.\" Do you think politicians are allowed to be human right now? Sanna Marin: I think we need more politicians that are human-- that are normal human, also showing emotions, and also being themselves. Because they are representing ordinary people. Why cannot they be ordinary? On social media, women around the world rushed to Marin's defense, posting videos of themselves dancing in solidarity. Sanna Marin: Those videos weren't something that I wanted to be, like, leaked. Those-- those were private. It was private apartment and private videos. But, of course that didn't stop the media of-- of-- publishing them. Sharyn Alfonsi: But the backlash. You know, Boris Johnson, there's videos of him dancing. Sanna Marin: And there's videos a lot of people dancing. Sharyn Alfonsi: And it wasn't an international incident.\u00a0 Sanna Marin: Yeah. Sharyn Alfonsi: Do you think it's because you were a woman and a young woman that you were criticized the way that you were criticized? Sanna Marin: I think-- one of the reasons why it caused that kind of frenzy was the way I looked in the videos, the way I danced. And some people thought that's not appropriate, because there are-- these non-written rules still, unfortunately, the women-- especially women in-- in these kind of positions, that-- that you shouldn't be a human being, and that you shouldn't have every scope-- in your life, that you should only-- be put in certain kind of position, and that you should stay in that position.\u00a0 I don't care about those rules. I really don't.\u00a0 (CLAP) I'm living my life, and still dancing, and drinking occasionally, meeting my friends and-- and doing all kind of-- things (LAUGH) that are normal for my age people.\u00a0 I don't think that we should give that room-- for sexism or-- or-- misogyny. I think we should all just be ourselves and people can vote we live in democracy thats the good thing they can vote they can vote me out if they want. Prime Minister Marin is up for re-election in April. We went with her to a party kick-off event earlier this month, that looked more like a Eurovision competition.\u00a0 The prime minister was introduced with a laser show befitting of a rock star.\u00a0 Sharyn Alfonsi: How did you feel about today? \u00a0 Sanna Marin: It's very good atmosphere people are so happy they are willing to make the campaign happen and really win the elections. Polls show Marin is the most popular prime minister in Finland in 30 years, she manages her own Instagram account of more than a million followers, posing for photos at rock festivals and showing up on reality shows. But the prime minister is facing a tight race against the conservative \"True Finns\" party. Sharyn Alfonsi: Voters in Europe have veered to the right with this anti-immigration sentiment. Does that concern you here in Finland? Sanna Marin: I don't think that's answer to anything. I-- I really see the problems that we are facing also because our population is aging.\u00a0 We need more people to Finland. So I think the far right, when they are saying, \"Don't come,\" they are really wrong, and it's very-- very dangerous policies also, because we cannot cope ourselves. Sharyn Alfonsi: Why do you say it's dangerous? Sanna Marin: Because if we would close our doors-- say no to people, then-- then we wouldn't have that economic growth, we wouldn't have new jobs-- we wouldn't have those prospects. And they have also said that their aim and goal is-- to get rid of European Union, to leave European Union. Sharyn Alfonsi: What would that mean to Finland? Sanna Marin:\u00a0 It would be a catastrophe to Finland if we would leave. It would be so stupid, I say bluntly.\u00a0 We have seen the problems with Brexit, and Great Britain is a bigger country than Finland.\u00a0 We are a small country. We have aggressive neighbor. There's no other choice and possibilities for us but to stay in European Union. It is a defining moment for Finland and for Prime Minister Marin. Just after our visit, she appeared with other heads of state at the council of Europe and snapped a selfie with President Zelenskyy. Sharyn Alfonsi: Your critics, said you were too young, you were inexperienced. You have since negotiated a global pandemic, an economic crisis. You've gone toe-to-toe with Vladimir Putin. What do you say to your critics now? Sanna Marin: I don't focus on my critics. They will shout (LAUGH) whatever I do, You should focus on the issues that are on the table. And I think the most important thing is not to be afraid. I think too many people-- are living their lives-- to-- being too-- afraid. And I think also too many politicians are not doing the important decisions, because they are afraid. Produced by Michael Rey. Associate producer, Tadd J. Lascari.

And this week on Face the Nation: the battle for the head of the House is over. The dust is settling. But how will new Speaker Kevin McCarthy rule with such a bitterly divided group of Republicans? At long last, after 15 roll call votes spread over more than four days and 25 hours of congressional togetherness on the House floor, the ultraconservative never-Kevin caucus won a number of concessions from California's Kevin McCarthy. The arm-twisting finally paid off. (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-California): I hope one thing is clear after this week. I never give up. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: For the nine-term Bakersfield, California, native, it was a moment of triumph. On the cusp of victory, he claimed the prolonged haggling was a plus. (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: This is the great part. Because it took this long, now we learned how to govern. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's hope so, because the challenges ahead are daunting. Speaker McCarthy's Republican Conference has only a tiny five-seat majority, difficult even if his party were united. This conference is not. We will talk with two House Republicans, South Carolina's Nancy Mace and Tony Gonzales of Texas. Then: President Biden is headed to the U.S.-Mexico border after unveiling tough new immigration rules meant to discourage illegal entry. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN (President of the United States): Do not just show up at the border. Stay where you are and apply legally from there. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Some Democrats don't like it. We will talk with El Paso's congresswoman, Veronica Escobar, and get her take. Maine Senator Angus King is just back from Ukraine. We will talk with him and Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova. We have got a new CBS News poll that looks at how Americans are feeling in the new year. And we will take a closer look at the evolution of a congressional tradition. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. It was early yesterday morning when Kevin McCarthy finally secured enough Republican votes to give him the gavel. (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: That was easy, huh? (LAUGHTER) REPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: I never thought we'd get up here. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: That latter sentiment was felt by many Americans, after watching the proceedings drag on for days. (Begin VT) REPRESENTATIVE KEVIN MCCARTHY: Do you solemnly swear, affirm... (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Congress was finally sworn in, and they are officially on the job. (Begin VT) CONGRESS MEMBERS: (r)MD-IT_I do. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: But the challenges ahead are enormous, especially for McCarthy, who was forced to make concessions to a small group of holdout conservatives in order to win their support. Will he live to regret what he agreed to? We begin with one of the Republican members of Congress who was with Speaker McCarthy on all votes. That's Nancy Mace of South Carolina. Good morning to you, Congresswoman. Welcome back. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE (R-South Carolina): Good morning. Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Again and again, 14 times, the hard right faction of your party refused to vote for Kevin McCarthy, even after he was making repeated concessions to them. How can Republicans possibly govern when your party is so unruly? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Well, first of all, I want to say, number one, Kevin McCarthy is the only member that I know of that can bring all the different groups together within our own party, because we do have different factions, just like Democrats do. And that's -- that's the first thing. And then the second thing is that, sometimes, democracy is messy. It looked kind of like an unnecessary and prolonged food fight last week. And I agreed with many Americans who thought that. I came home this weekend and listened to folks of all sides. I represent a very purple district. I have all sides to serve. And there was a lot of was a lot of frustration with the prolonged and unnecessary food fight that we had this week. But you saw democracy on full display. And I think that's healthy to have that kind of debate. I'm glad that it's over and we can move forward. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I mean, some would say it wasn't so much democracy as it was dysfunction. \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page was pretty scathing, said: \"Don't believe the happy talk this was a healthy display of deliberative democracy. It was a power play. A group of backbenchers saw an opportunity to exploit the narrow GOP margin of five seats to put themselves in positions of power that they hadn't earned through seniority or influence with colleagues.\" If this rules package passes, with all the concessions that Speaker McCarthy made, this will be leave you beholden, won't it, to those backbenchers? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Well, a couple of things I want -- I want to say. On the rules package, the rules that are governed the way -- that will govern the way the House operates, there are some very great, good ideas in there, like the 72-hour rule, having three days to read a bill before it comes to the floor for a vote, having a path to balance the budget over the next 10 years, ensuring that there are spending offsets, especially with mandatory spending. If you're going to increase in one area, then you have to decrease in another. But I will tell you, when I ran for Congress two years ago, I won by one point, and I ran to be a new Nancy in the House. And what I saw last week was a small faction of the 20 who were acting just like the old Nancy, trying to cut backroom deals in private and secret without anyone knowing what else was going on. And when they did the rules package at the end of the day, there was only one point that was changed. That was on the motion to vacate. That was the only difference in the package that we're going to be voting on tomorrow that was different from the original package that was proposed. So, my question really is today is, what backroom deals were cut, did they try to cut, and did they get those? Because we shouldn't be operating like Nancy Pelosi, this small faction. And they're the ones that are saying they were -- quote -- \"fighting the swamp,\" but then yet went and tried to act like, you know -- like, they actually are the swamp by trying to do these backroom deals. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: And we don't know what they got or didn't get. We haven't seen it. We don't have any idea what promises were made or what gentleman's handshakes were made. We just -- we just have no idea at this point. And it does give me quite a bit of heartburn, because that's not what we ran. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Speaker... REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: It is quite ironic. MARGARET BRENNAN: But -- well, so, you're saying Speaker McCarthy is not being transparent about all the deals that he brokered in order to win this job? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: I'm saying there's a small handful of individuals in that 20 who were trying to cut deals in secret, and not letting anybody else know about them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Didn't they succeed in doing that? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: We're not sure. We don't know at this point. And that does give me pause and gives me significant heartburn on what direction we're going to take. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: I represent a purple district. I have to represent Republicans, Democrats and independents. I want to know that the positions that I have are going to have a voice, that it will have weight in the conference. There are a lot of members like me that that have issues with some of the policies that we're going to be working on. Look at what happened after overturning of Roe v. Wade. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: We didn't have a plan. And I want -- as a woman and as a victim of rape, want to know that we're going to be serious, that we're going to be balanced in protecting the rights of women and protecting the rights of the unborn. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: There's a way to do both, and not be guided by one extreme or the other. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I just want to clarify there, because it -- I had asked you initially about the rules package, which is published and would be voted on tomorrow. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Right. Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you saying that you're going to withhold your vote on those published agreements until you know what these backroom deals were? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: I am considering that as an option right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: I like the rules package. It is the most, open, fair and fiscally conservative package we have had in 30 years. I support it. But what I don't support is a small number of people trying to get a deal done or deals done for themselves... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: ... in private, in secret to get a vote or a vote present. I don't support that. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: That is just what Nancy Pelosi does. And that's not what they should be doing. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you... REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: And so I am on the fence right now about the rules package vote tomorrow for that reason. MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it. It reportedly includes a pledge that would likely require a $75 billion cut to national security funding. Do you support that part of it? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: I want to see -- I want to see it in writing. I want to see what promises were made. And what we are being told is that these handshakes, what's going on, these promises, will go through regular order and go through the regular appropriations process. I don't want to see defense cuts. I -- again, we don't -- we don't know what deals were made. And that's something that we should be transparent about Sunshine is the best medicine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: That's what we have always said. So, what -- what are we guaranteeing or what promises were made? We should know. MARGARET BRENNAN: The speaker has reportedly given the Freedom Caucus, that ultraconservative faction, a third of the seats on the powerful Rules Committee, which controls which bills make it to the floor. You have called Matt Gaetz, one of its members, a political D-lister and a fraud. You have sparred with Marjorie Taylor Greene. I will show our viewers part of that and let them interpret your meaning. How are you going to work with these folks to get anything done for the American people? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: It's going to be very difficult. Matt Gaetz is a fraud. Every time he voted against Kevin McCarthy last week, he sent out a fund-raising e-mail. What you saw last week was a constitutional process diminished by those kinds of political actions. I don't support that kind of behavior. I am very concerned, as someone who represents a lot of centrists, a lot of independents -- I have as many independents and Democrats as I have Republicans in my district. I have to represent everybody. I am concerned that commonsense legislation will not get through to get a vote on the floor. And I -- for example, we have 12 bills that we're supposedly going to be voting on in our first week in office. Three of them are abortion -- abortion bills and pro-life bills. I am pro-life, but I have many exceptions. But they are not legislation, pieces of legislation, that can pass the Senate and get onto the desk for the president to sign into law. And so if we're going to be serious about protecting life, for example, maybe we should look at more centrist views, like ensuring every woman has access to birth control, because, if you can reduce pregnancies, you can reduce the need or want for women to have abortions... MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: ... for example, a very commonsense, pragmatic point of view. But that's not what we're going to be voting on this week. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: And I am concerned. I want to see pragmat -- pragmatics at work, common sense, fiscal conservative issues at work that represent all views. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Before I let you go, I have to ask you. You have a new colleague from the state of New York, Representative George Santos. He says he's embellished his resume. You could say he just flat-out lied about work history, education, family background. How can you work with someone like that? And does he need to be removed from office? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: It's very difficult to work with anyone who cannot be trusted. And it's very clear his entire resume in life was -- was manufactured, until a couple of days ago, when he finally changed his Web site. It is a problem. If we say we can't trust the left when they aren't telling the truth, how can we trust our own? Americans want transparency. And the one lesson I have learned in D.C., if you want a friend you can trust, get a dog. (LAUGHTER) REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: So... MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand you are a dog fan. All right, Congresswoman, thank you. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: I am a huge dog fan. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY MACE: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nancy Mace, thank you for your time this morning. We want to go to another Republican, Tony Gonzales of Texas. He is in San Antonio this morning. Congressman, let's get right to it. I saw you said on FOX News Friday you're very worried and the American public should be terrified at what the 118th Congress is going to look like with all this division. Exactly what do we need to be prepared for? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES (R-Texas): Yes, Margaret. Good morning. Thank you for having me. You know, the speaker vote is the easiest vote we'll take in Congress. And it was pretty chaotic. The rules -- the rules package is the next easiest vote. It's -- look, the House of Representatives is a rough and rowdy place. Anybody that watched C-SPAN this week got to see it firsthand. This is only the beginning. And with a such a small minority, Republicans are much different than Democrats. We're not just going to line up and jump off the cliff. All of us represent our districts and we're going to fight for that. I spent 20 years in the military. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Beyond my district, we've got a nation to save. And -- and part of this division doesn't help. But at the end of the day, you can't let you know the insurgency caucus take hold and dictate. You know, Kevin McCarthy ran on this Commitment to America, great leadership. He put this together. Many of us got elected this cycle because of this Commitment to America. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: These are the type of policies that we have to initiate. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you dropped a bit of a bomb when you said that, even though you have supported McCarthy and voted for him, you are going to vote against this rules package tomorrow that includes some of the deals he brokered. Why? And how many Republicans are with you? And then what happens? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Yeah, McCarthy's a great leader. Like, once again, he put together this Commitment to America agenda that we have all circled behind. The reason why I'm voting against the rules package was really two -- two specific reasons. One, we were supposed to vote on this rules package in the dead of the night right after swearing in, which I think is very, not transparent of what happens. I'm pleased to see that that has now been pushed to Monday. That gives a lot of people an opportunity to -- to -- to vote on it in -- during -- during the daylight hours. But the second reason... MARGARET BRENNAN: Did it change your mind? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: ... more importantly, was, this is -- this has a proposed billions-of-dollar cut to defense, which I think is a horrible idea, when you have aggressive Russia in Ukraine, you've got a growing threat of China in the Pacific. I'm going to visit Taiwan here in a couple of weeks. How am I going to look at our allies in the eye and say, I need you to increase your defense budget, but yet America is going to decrease ours? MARGARET BRENNAN: So, that is -- you are still going to vote against it tomorrow. How many Republicans are with you? And does this cause further chaos? REP. TONY GONZALES: You know, I am going to vote against it. But there's a difference between voting against it and whipping other members to vote against it. I would say, in this case, I'm not whipping other members to vote against it. But what I will give you an example. If - - you know, if these -- this insurgency caucus decides to put anti- immigrant legislation on the floor and masquerade it as border security policy, that's not going to fly. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And I will do everything in my power to make sure that type of legislation fails on the floor. So, this is -- this is one of many votes, I think, in the 118th Congress that have to be well-thought-out. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, I want to get to the border in a quick moment. But let me quickly ask you, how can Republicans possibly govern and do things that are essential, like dealing with the debt ceiling, without causing more chaos and potentially economic catastrophe? How can you get your party in line for important, basic work? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Yes, it's going to be ugly. I mean, you look at the White House, the White House is a dumpster fire. You look at the Senate, the Senate is chaotic. You look at the House, and you -- I mean, if you're an American just sitting down watching TV, you're going, where has this country gone? What has happened, what I see is, there's nothing but politicians getting up here and grandstanding. It's time for leadership. And I think what you're going to see is, leadership has to be from the ground up. It has to be the rank and file come together and say, enough is enough. You know, I'm a conservative Republican that wants to see the border secure... MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: ... that wants to see inflation get put down. So, these type of things is what we need to focus on. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Last time you were here, you said you wanted to go with President Biden to the border. He's going there today. Are you participating at all? Have you had any contact with the White House about migration? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I'm very disappointed in the administration. You know, seven months ago, I hosted the president in Uvalde, and I asked him to visit on the border. He looked me in the eye and he said: \"Tony, yes.\" Seven months later, when I tried to be part of this El Paso visit, which I represent El Paso, I represent 50 -- nearly 50 percent of the southern border -- the White House told me, I wasn't -- I wasn't able to be part of it. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: What does that mean? That means -- that means that Democrats are using this as a political -- they think this is a political challenge, not a policy challenge. Clearly, you know, you see these images a couple of weeks ago of hundreds of people in a cell. That's not a political challenge. That is a policy challenge. MARGARET BRENNAN: Why? Why did they tell you can't come? What did they say? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I don't know. That's the frustrating part. You know, on one end, you're hearing them say they -- you know, that they want to work with Republicans. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I'm not this crazy extremist Republican. I'm jumping up and down, pushing against my party when I think it's right, looking for ways to solve problems. What I don't want to see is a terrorist action happen and say, I told you so. I have no interest in that. I'm trying to keep America safe. The administration just has turned a blind eye. And it goes to show they think that their policy is correct. And it's dangerous. If you're -- it should scare the hell out of every American out there to say this administration is going to going to double down. And it's going to taint the Biden administration. It's going to taint Biden's legacy. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, well -- well, actual legislation on the border would require your party to also help out. But, very quickly, George Santos, new New York Congressman. We just talked to Congresswoman Mace. She has a problem with the fact that he is consistently lying. He is also under investigation. Do you think he should be removed from office? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I think -- look, there's a lot of frauds in Congress. I think a lot of people got to see that firsthand over the last week. I mean, George Santos is the least of this country's worries. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, he should stay? REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: We have a lot of things to worry about. Step one is -- is getting this rules package done. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. All right, I got to go. Congressman, thank you very much. When we come back in one minute, new insights into how Americans are feeling about the economy, democracy and politics in the new year. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Our first CBS News poll of 2023 is out. Overall, Americans are feeling better about some things in the new year. But there's still a lot of angst out there. Mark Strassmann reports from Atlanta. (Begin VT) MARK STRASSMANN (voice-over): American confidence, historically fickle, gaped at this scene, the country's elected grownups grappling, another flash point in a four-day, 15-ballot debacle. No wonder our new CBS News poll shows 70 percent of Americans generally pessimistic about U.S. politics right now, and 55 percent disapprove of the way Republicans picked their new speaker of the House. About the economy, especially with inflation's long shadow and recession fears, Friday's jobs report suggested the economy is cooling, with wage gains slowing. Unemployment is at 3.5 percent, a 50-year low, but expect interest rates to rise again in 2023. Our CBS News poll shows Americans feel better about the condition of the economy than they did six months ago. But when it comes to specific economic measures, 59 percent feel pessimistic about the stock market, 70 percent pessimistic about the cost of goods and services. ALEX PELLE (Economist, Mizuho Securities USA): But we are starting from a position of strength. So, that is something that people can take comfort in. MARK STRASSMANN: But what about Americans' strength overall in this post- pandemic phase of recovery and renewal? Our poll shows only 34 percent of Americans, one-third, believe life in this country is going well. The good news? That's up from one in four last year. Nearly half say they're scared, while nearly another half feel hopeful about 2023. (End VT) MARK STRASSMANN: Two years after the January 6 riots, our poll also showed roughly three in four Americans agree the results of last year's midterms were legitimate. But most Americans also believe our democracy remains threatened, another area that showed improvement, but still has a long way to go -- Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark Strassmann, thank you. And when we come back, we will take a closer look at some of the very new faces we met in the first days of the 118th Congress. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot of us were glued to last week's coverage of the battle for speaker on the House floor, and particularly taken by the pictures of all of the children and grandchildren in the chamber for those marathon sessions, also awaiting the official swearing-in of House members. This year, we saw a lot more dads in charge, both on the House floor during boats and behind the scenes, especially when some moms had to head home to work. California Democratic Congressman Jimmy Gomez was one of those dads. His 4-month-old son, Hodge, became a social media and national TV star as he and his father bonded on and off the House floor. Baby Hodge had a firsthand view of all of the chaos from his forward-facing baby wrap. The last time children were in the spotlight during the first days of Congress was back in 2007. That's when Nancy Pelosi became the first woman speaker. She appeared on Face the Nation right after that with our Bob Schieffer. (Begin VT) BOB SCHIEFFER: Let me ask you about being the first woman speaker. That was quite a scene. When you were sworn in, you called all the kids, your grandkids, the members' kids to come up to the rostrum with you. Did you mean that to be a signal of a different kind of House? REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI (D-California): Well, certainly, a woman speaker, it represents change. And I have said it over and over in the campaign, that I will receive the gavel, the speaker's gavel, from the hands of the special interests and into the hands of America's children. I was so thrilled. The children weren't shy. They all came running up. And I want our members to know that every action that we take in the Congress, we must do with an eye to our children and their future. We owe that to them. BOB SCHIEFFER: Do you believe that, as a woman, the first woman, that you will be held to a higher standard? I have heard some people go so far as to say, if she's not successful, it will have an impact on candidates in the 2008 presidential election. REPRESENTATIVE NANCY PELOSI: Well, let me remove all doubt. I have absolutely no intention of not being successful. I have -- I'm ready for this job. The Democrats in general are ready to lead, prepared to govern, and determined to make the American people proud. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Nancy Pelosi has served in the House for more than 35 years, eight of those as speaker. And she's back to being Congresswoman Pelosi. As for little Hodge Gomez, he's eligible to serve in another 24-and-a-half years. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: If you miss an episode of Face the Nation, you can listen to our podcast. Find us on Amazon Music or wherever you get your podcasts. We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. President Biden travels to El Paso today after announcing new border enforcement actions last week. Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar will travel with the president to Texas later today. I'm so glad you could join us. REP. VERONICA ESCOBAR (D-TX): Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the president is going to visit one of the busiest ports of entry in El Paso and he's going to meet with officials and other aid organizations. What can he do to make sure that this three-hour visit is more than just a photo op? VERONICA ESCOBAR: Well, we've worked with the White House to make sure that all the folks who are actually doing the work on the ground day-to-day are the ones that the president will meet with. He needs to hear about how over time the challenges that we have faced as a country on immigration, on border issues, they have grown exponentially. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we looked at the latest CBS polling. Only 38 percent of Americans actually approve of what the president is doing on immigration, 62 percent disapprove. This has consistently been one of his weakest issues. And it was just this last week he gave his very first speech on the border policy. For the first time he's going today. And it's taken, what, two years to find some kind of alternative to Title 42. I understand it's going before the Supreme Court, but why is it taking so long to get just this? VERONICA ESCOBAR: This challenge that we're facing is so complex. I'm with you. I would have loved to have seen the administration lean in on immigration from day one because -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't they? VERONICA ESCOBAR: You know, you'd have to ask them that. The executive branch is not the only branch of government that needs to do its job, though. And - and I will tell you, I've worked very closely with Secretary Mayorkas. He has been phenomenal. Every idea that I have asked him to explore, he has. Every collaboration I've asked him to engage in, he has. Where - where it's been -- where I've hit a brick wall is Congress. And, frankly, Democrats and Republicans alike. I'm hoping things change. There's a bipartisan delegation going to El Paso from the Senate tomorrow and I hope they see what the president will see today - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. VERONICA ESCOBAR: Which is opportunity, but also long overdue work. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk about what the administration did just announce, because it was pretty big, this policy. They're expanding the use of that same Title 42 policy, the pandemic-era restrictions that allow for expulsion without guarantee of asylum hearings. And it's going to allow them to dramatically step up expulsions of Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, Venezuelans. They make up the majority of those crossing. You oppose Title 42. Does that mean you oppose what the Biden administration is doing? VERONICA ESCOBAR: Well, it's a complicated answer. So, the - the administration, in the absence of any legislation from the - the Congress - MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. VERONICA ESCOBAR: Has very few tools available. I -- I'm a staunch opponent of Title 42. In fact, I think Title 42 is the reason why those apprehension -- or encounter numbers are so high, because people kept trying over and over and over again. When you're expelled from the border, you're going to try in different areas. I think it also helped fuel the human trafficking that we've seen a significant increase in. And all of this started with the Trump administration. When -- in my conversations with the Department of Homeland Security, because a Louisiana judge essentially created a situation where they have to continue to use Title 42, they can't go to a different policy, which was used prior to Title 42 called Title 8. Now, Title 8 is - is much more punitive. And I think that is what the administration is ultimately going to go towards once a judge allows the Biden administration to do away with Title 42. MARGARET BRENNAN: Which could come in June when the Supreme Court rules. VERONICA ESCOBAR: Could come in June. And - but even then, Margaret, we will not have had a legislative solution. So, all of these executive branch efforts really are just temporary band-aids. Whether it's Title 8, whether it's Title 42, we need to make sure that Congress acts. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. And it sounds like you don't have a lot of high hopes for that kind of action. But let me ask about the Biden policy. So it's going to allow 30 - up to 30,000 migrants per month from the four countries we just listed to enter if they have a U.S. sponsor. It will also allow migrants to apply via cell phone app, something called CBP1. Does someone fleeing abject poverty really have a cell phone to apply for access? VERONICA ESCOBAR: The vast majority of refugees who are fleeing their home countries do have cell phones. That's how they communicate with one another. That's how they communicate with their - the folks at home. But I will tell you, we do need far more robust State Department involvement, especially for those who do not have access to that kind of technology. We need far greater education. Many of the refugees that I have spoken to, especially over the last couple of weeks, are - have no concept of what the asylum process is. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. VERONICA ESCOBAR: Their idea is, I'm going to go to the border, I'm going to get a job and I'm - and I'm going to help my family. Something all of us would do, of course. So, there's a lot of work that needs to be done, whether it's assisting those who don't have a cell phone access these services and legal pathways offered through CBP1, or whether it is helping to educate folks about those legal pathways so that they have a better shot. MARGARET BRENNAN: I asked you that because I know some have argued it's discriminatory against those who have the least. Mexico, as part of this Biden agreement, has agreed to take about 30,000 people a month from the four countries, but one of the things that we've consistently heard over the past few years, and it was a harsh criticism of the Trump administration, is that when individuals are pushed back to Mexico, and they're awaiting some kind of action, they face a lot of violence. VERONICA ESCOBAR: That's right. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if you criticized it during the Trump administration, you must be a critic during the Biden administration. VERONICA ESCOBAR: Absolutely. And that's why I'm - I'm grateful that the president's going to Mexico City to talk to the president. Every step of the journey along the way for these refugees, people who leave with little more than a backpack and their hopes and dreams experience a nightmarish journey along the way. And many migrants have told me, in fact, that the - the most dangerous part of the journey is in Mexico. And so there's a lot of work that needs to be done. But, Margaret, not just in Mexico, but for the entire hemisphere. We are seeing people flee their home countries, heading to Costa Rica, heading to - to countries all - all south of here. We - we have to make sure that diplomatically we are engaging at the highest levels. And, finally, giving the western hemisphere the kind of attention that it has lacked for a long time by - by the U.S. government. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, thank you for your time today. VERONICA ESCOBAR: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Turning now to the war in Ukraine. We are joined by Maine's independent senator, Angus King, who just returned from a trip to Kyiv. Good morning to you, Senator. I understand you -- you just got back. SEN. ANGUS KING (I-ME): Last night. MARGARET BRENNAN: Last night. And you met Friday with President Zelenskyy. What was the purpose of this visit? ANGUS KING: I once did a visit overseas and an - and an old man in Pakistan, as a matter of fact, said, I know why you are here. And I said, why is that? And he said, because one of day of seeing is better than 100 days of reading. And I believe you got to see, you've got to be there and meet the people in person. And we had a very informative trip. There's a lot to learn and a lot to be able to communicate back here about what's going on in Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as you were over there, here, the White House announced it was released roughly $3 billion in security aid to Ukraine. It was the biggest, sort of one-time package. It included, for the first time, tank-busting armored vehicles. Why such a surge now? Is it to get ahead of what may be a pretty serious spring offensive? What are we preparing for? ANGUS KING: Well, there are -- there are - there are two factors. And - and the - the Ukrainians, particularly, the first thing is air defense. I mean they're just being pummeled -- that's too mild of a word -- in terms of their energy infrastructure. So, air defense is part of it, patriot missiles. But also what's going on in the east is essentially trench warfare. It's almost World War I. It's horrible. And these -- these armored vehicles are designed to deal with it -- that kind of situation -- to give the Ukrainians a fighting chance against this invasion that's going on. And to put it in perspective for Americans, it's as if our East Coast, from Maine to Florida, and then west to Houston, Texas, was being occupied by a foreign power. That's the entire eastern edge of Ukraine is occupied, and that's where this fight is going to be. And that's why these maneuver vehicles are going to be so important. MARGARET BRENNAN: But this drawdown, which is what they call it technically, presidential authority, allows for an immediate or close to immediate delivery of some of this weaponry. And I am hearing increased concern here in the United States that sending weapons there is depleting U.S. stockpiles in a way that's concerning to some officials. How concerned are you about that? And how does -- how do you, in Congress, get ahead of that to make sure the U.S. isn't hurt? ANGUS KING: Well, part of it is replenishing our stockpiles. But you're right, that's - and that's a decision that the - the Pentagon, the Defense Department, has to weigh when they're doing these drawdowns. And, by the way, a lot of this equipment is coming from other countries. It's not just coming from the United States. So, some of the fighting vehicles are coming from France. Patriot battery from Germany. So, that is an issue but it's one that I know in the deliberations about what the drawdowns are going to look like, stockpiles is - is part of the issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and it also makes me think of the -- two of the conversations we just had in this program in terms of potential slash to defense spending that could potentially happen if this House proposal actually gets approved. ANGUS KING: It - it would be -- it would be catastrophic to cut off aid to Ukraine at this point. I would just ask those people that are making those noises to read a little history. Google Sudetenland in 1938, Rhineland in 1936, when Hitler could have been stopped. When he wasn't stopped, we ended up with 55 million deaths worldwide. This is a moment where we know that Putin wants to take over Ukraine. He wants to rebuild the Soviet Union. Mia Angelou says, if someone tells you who they are, you should believe them. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. ANGUS KING: And who he is, is a guy that wants to rebuild the Soviet empire. And this is a place where he can be stopped. They -- the Ukrainians are fighting for us, for our values. The aid that we're providing to them isn't charity, it's - it's self-interest. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you believe there is enough accounting for what is being given? Is it -- ANGUS KING: I'm so - I'm so glad you asked that, because that was part of my mission. I spent a lot of time in Kyiv on accountability. And, in fact, sitting across from President Zelenskyy, just as you and I are, I asked him point blank, what's the status of accountability? If there's a scandal, it's going to kill our ability to support you. He understands that. And then later we had a meeting with many of their defense officials and privates, their finance people. They're developing -- they're working with Deloitte, the accounting firm, they're working with SAP software, they're accounting for every spare part that's coming into the country. Plus, we have an inspector general from the Pentagon who's going over, I think, next month. I was very impressed by the level of accountability. And so this argument that somehow the money is being wasted, I don't think holds water. MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about things here at home and the conversation about the U.S. border that we have been having. There are Republicans who want to get something done in this new Congress. You've got Republican-held House. You've got a 51-49 Senate. Is there any possibility of getting legislation on immigration or anything? ANGUS KING: To me, there's an obvious deal on immigration, which is, heighten border security, which is very complicated. And I want to talk to the congresswoman that you just had on talking about what -- the ideas that she has. Republicans along the border, the Republican Congressman Gonzales. I want to learn. And - and there are a lot of people working on, how do we figure out the border. But the deal is, increased border security, a path to citizenship for dreamers, and workforce. I'm hearing from businesses in Maine all the time about a shortage of workers. It's one of our biggest economic problems after inflation. So, we've - we've got to work on legal immigration for workforce. So, I think, as I say, there's a package. And border security is where it starts. And I - I believe, I'm delighted the administration -- the president's going down there today. They should have gone sooner, in my view. But let's - let's work on this because we - we can't have the chaos and the humanitarian crisis that we have. Let's - let's find that. But then put together a package involving dreamers and involving workforce. That's where I think we can move. And we ought to be able to move in a - in a bipartisan way. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well -- well, you're a centrist. You're an independent. Though your caucus with Democrat. So, you can - you can say you want to work with everyone. But the politics right now are just so divisive. I read something you told \"The New Yorker\" last year where you said you have never been so worried about the future of the country because the structure of our system is at risk. Do you still feel that way? Is it improving? ANGUS KING: Well, what happened in the House this week wasn't reassuring because what you had was 20 people -- I did the math, 3.7 percent of the membership of Congress held it hostage for a week. And I don't know what -- what that foretells for the future. Yes, that is a concern. On the other hand, since I had that quote, which I certainly think has some validity, we've had one of the most productive congresses in the last 25 or 30 years. Almost all on a bipartisan basis. Not all. But the infrastructure bill, the CHIPS Act, the PACT Act for the veterans. All of those bills were done in -- on a bipartisan basis. And they started, interestingly, from the ground up. They started organically from a few members getting together, working from the middle out. The leadership blessed it. They allowed it to happen. But that's the path. And I'm hoping -- I think immigration is a great opportunity to do the same thing. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we'll end on that optimistic note. Senator, thank you for joining us. ANGUS KING: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment with Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We are joined by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Welcome back to the program. Always good to have you here. OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States): Good to be here. MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand you are just back from visiting your family in Ukraine. Over the holidays we saw Russia bombed hospitals on Christmas. On New Year's they were also bombing your country. What is life like during the holiday season? OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, it was - it was very good to be home. And, you know, when this invasion started on February 24th, until my first trip home in April, and it was right after the -- my hometown was liberated a couple of days, literally, before that, I always woke up thinking, is that a bad dream? Like, I always try to, you know, fight with the reality. But, you know, going back always, on the one hand, gives you a good perspective of how horrible it is. And, on the other hand, inspires, because you see everyone not giving up. And everyone is -- even throughout the holiday seasons when the bombs are still flying everywhere, the destruction is enormous, people are very focused on winning. People are very focused on helping each other. And there was still a festive spirit everywhere. People were singing. You know, people were trying to give gifts to each other. But, of course, the main focus is helping our brave defenders and doing everything possible to win. MARGARET BRENNAN: We were just talking with Senator King about this massive package President Biden just signed off on, which also had sort of increase in the type of weapons and - and defense items for Ukraine. Why do you need this so immediately? What are you preparing for? OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, first of all, let me take this moment to thank the previous Congress for voting on the legislation and allowing us to have the possibility to have this packages this year for everything that we need from the financial assistance, but most importantly security assistance. MARGARET BRENNAN: That was the $45 billion. OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. Yes. And the fact that, you know, we have this support from American people is very valued in Ukraine. So, everyone, you know, president, Congress, big thank you. Why do we need more? Because we see that, a, we need to increase the liberation speed of our - of our land. We need to free more people as soon as possible because we see what happens when they're under occupation. We also do not intend to stop. We do not intend to take operational pauses, which Russia probably needs because they have problem with their motivation, they have problem with even the rockets. I mean they have so many of them. But they -- we would like to faster get to peace, which means we have to liberate our territories faster. So, whatever we can get from air defense to all the armored vehicles to everything that you saw in the package, we need even more because we are facing much larger enemy. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, this package of $45 billion from the last Congress should take you through next year according to some officials, U.S. officials. When President Zelenskyy was here in Washington on that surprise visit, he did meet with Kevin McCarthy, who is now speaker of the House. Did you get assurances that U.S. support will continue with Republicans in control? OKSANA MARKAROVA: We are fighting for the same values and for the same principles. We are fighting against the evil, which is a threat not only to Ukraine, it's existential threat for us, but is a threat to everyone who believes in democracy. And I can say that our meetings during the president's visit here, both with president, administration, but also with all leaders in Senate and House of Representatives on a very strong bipartisan basis have been very constructive and very productive. I believe the American people support us and will support us until we together can win this. MARGARET BRENNAN: When the president was here, President Zelenskyy was here, he said, financial assistance is not charity, it's an investment. And he said, Ukraine will be responsible with it. But given the concerns about corruption over years past, how do you respond when you were asked that question of how do you guarantee every dollar being given to Ukraine is going to defense and not to, you know, embezzlement or something else? OKSANA MARKAROVA: I can only quote Senator King, who was just here. First on -- there are three types of assistances, right, budget assistance, security and humanitarian. On security, we're not getting the money, we're getting the goods. And we're very grateful for them. And the accountability for every piece that we are getting is there. We are not only sharing implementation, we are implementing NATO systems in place and we are ready - and already are providing information. And we know where everything is located. On the budget assistance, we have reported on all assistance that has been provided to us. There is an audit underway. But we have also sent - I mean it's very clear where we are spending the money on. And our ministry of finance has reported even before the audit is complete, and I have shared that report with every member of the previous Congress. And we intend to do so in the future. The inspector generals are involved already, from Pentagon but from other, from Department of State, from Treasury. So, we are not only open and ready, it's in our interest as well. In order to prove why we need more and that we're using it very effectively and efficiently, we would like to be as open as possible. Every U.S. dollar that is given to us, we are putting it to a good use and we're using it as an investment into our joint fight for democracy. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we've talked about in the past, and that is what's happening to Ukraine's children. More than 13,000 were deported to Russia. Are you having any luck in getting your children back? OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, first, unfortunately, we know the number is much larger than that. The 13,000 is the official number of the children we accounted for, we found. But we know we already have so many, you know, tens if not hundreds of thousands of people who we don't know their fate yet. And until we liberate our territories, we will not know. Out of the 13,000, the vice prime minister already informed that 212 have been returned. And 212 is, of course, a small number, even though, unlike Russians, every child and every life is very precious to us. So, we're so happy that these 212 are home. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OKSANA MARKAROVA: But we will not get tired and we will not stop until all of them are back home. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. OKSANA MARKAROVA: That's why we need more weapons to liberate our territories and people. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, we'll continue to follow this story and talk to you. Thank you. OKSANA MARKAROVA: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to go. And we'll be right back.

Robert Garcia, Mike Lawler, Summer Lee and Zach Nunn that aired Sunday, Feb. 5, 2023, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Joining us now for a look at the new Congress, a group of freshmen House members, Congressman Robert Garcia is the president of the Democratic freshman class. He's from the state of California. Gentlemen next to him is New York Republican congressman, Mike Lawler. Congresswoman Summer Lee is a Democrat. And she is from the state of Pennsylvania. And Congressman Zach Nunn is Republican from Iowa. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about some of the things you all think you can get done here in Washington, Congressman Lawler, the former speaker Nancy Pelosi recently told The New York Times that Democrats could have held onto the house if New York politicians had realized earlier on that crime was such a key motivating issue. In the last Congress, they greenlit about $4 billion in grants for local law enforcement. Do you think that money now needs to be accompanied by some kind of reform, something more on crime? REP. LAWLER: Here in Washington there's a lot of bipartisan support, I think for especially making sure that law enforcement has the resources they need and the training that they need to do their jobs effectively. I think obviously, the situation in Memphis with Tyre Nichols is a- a horrifying example. But I think there's a lot of area where we can work together to address the rising crime and why we are seeing such a rise across the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: Like what? REP. LAWLER: You have to look at what are some of the root causes of why, you know, we're seeing such an increase in- in crime, gang activity. Obviously, you see the scourge of fentanyl pouring into our communities, drugs being dealt that are having a devastating impact. So I think there is a lot of area where we can work together to address these challenges.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: What about you, Congressman, this is your party in the majority. Four billion in grants just went to local law enforcement. Does Congress need to do anything more to address crime? REP. NUNN: When I was chair of judiciary at the state level, Iowa moved very aggressively after the George Floyd homicide. We immediately said that we were going to allow our attorney general to investigate crimes directly so that we weren't waiting on county attorneys. We made sure that bad law enforcement officers couldn't be cycled through without some kind of a background check. We made sure that we made a direct investment in mental health across the state and made sure that our regional- both our urban, but also our rural communities had access to that. And ultimately, we also worked with our law enforcement to make sure that law enforcement had a better relationship with the community, rather than one of conflict. There's some tangible successes we've seen at state levels, let's bring those up to the federal level and make sure they can work the same way. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you do want to see more legislation on- REP. NUNN: Yeah, I think there's absolutely more that needs to be done on this. What doesn't need to be done are what I will call these fig leaf grants, the idea that we can just hire more minority officers in rural Iowa, that is a very challenging thing to do, we should be identifying-\u00a0 And we saw tragically, even in Memphis, that that alone is not a silver bullet solution. We've really got to get to the effort of, you know, good policing, but also recognizing when there is good law enforcement, we hold that up as a partner in a community. That's where this money could be going. And it needs to be accountable. I think far too much of this has gone to, you know, some major metropolitan areas which have seen actually, crime spike in those neighborhoods. MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, you said, \"it would be good to revive the George Floyd Policing Act. But we're so far past that right now. We really need to kind of escalate the conversation faster.\" What do you mean, what are you calling for? REP. LEE: So let me be really clear, there is a proliferation of disinformation and bias and conversations about crime and conversations about policing. And to be very clear, police violence is crime. We cannot say that we care about crime, but then do nothing, choose to do nothing over and over and over when the crime is committed by a police officer. There are statistics that show that less than 2% of police officers who are engaged in misconduct are ever indicted at all and while we can all celebrate that five Black police officers right and let it not escape us that it was only when they were Black that there was swift action and there was a sixth who was not Black and there was not swift action. That we can say that Tyre should be alive. So should Atatiana Jefferson. So should Antwon Rose II from my district. So should Mike Brown. So should Philando Castile. They should all be alive. So when we're talking about crime, when we're talking about how we're going to solve it, when I say that we need to change the conversation, we need to acknowledge that public safety does not begin with policing. Public safety begins with investments. It begins with addressing our own implicit and explicit biases in policymaking and education and appropriations. MARGARET BRENNAN: So when the president talks about reviving George Floyd Policing Act, you're saying, not as it's currently written, you want more measures added.\u00a0 REP. LEE: Absolutely. I want us to be intentional at every step about addressing racial bias,\u00a0 about addressing poverty, about addressing crime and about addressing police violence. REP. GARCIA: I think Representative Lee is absolutely right. Listen, I would vote- vote for the George Floyd Policing Act, if it was on the floor tomorrow, but more needs to be done. Additional steps need to be taken\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: It won't be put on the floor tomorrow under Republican leadership. To be clear, but\u2013 REP. GARCIA: Absolutely. And that's why I want to be clear also, with our- when our colleagues bring up that more should be done around this issue. The truth is that you look at a place like California or most of the country, we are actually safer today than we were 15, 20, or 30 years ago, statistically. And so there's a lot of concerns around crime, and there should be. We all want to be safe. But I also think we also got to look at the data and actually look at the facts. The truth is that every single election cycle, it just seems that there's a lot of focus on crime and inner cities. And the truth is that we are safer than we were 20 or 30 years ago\u2013 MARGARET BRENNAN: But there was a spike in violent crime. REP. LAWLER: In New York state- In New York state in particular, the reason there was a focus on crime by voters is because they didn't feel safe. You had people being pushed in front of oncoming subway cars, you had people being stabbed in the street. By the way, the vast majority of victims of crime are Black and Brown people. So to act as though there's not a crime issue, I think is dismissing the fact that it is serious, and people do not feel safe. And so yes, we need to address the root causes of why someone may turn towards crime or why they may find themselves as part of a gang. But we also need to hold people accountable with the decisions that they make. And I think part of the problem here is that oftentimes, it is very easy to go say law enforcement: bad. But the vast majority of people who are in law enforcement are good people. I come from a community that has strong law enforcement presence. 50% of households in my district, have a cop, a firefighter or a first responder or a veteran in them. They're good people. And they want to do right by our communities. (CROSSTALK) REP. GARCIA: And I agree with that. REP. LEE: The vast majority of people in poor working class neighborhoods are good people.\u00a0 REP. LAWLER: They are. They are. REP. LEE: And they are victims of crime that we don't say anything about. REP. LAWLER: And they want police presence. They want police presence. REP. NUNN: Exactly they want to be protected. REP. LEE: For instance, for instance there's no police presence when they're a victim of wage theft. We're not seeing anybody\u2013 REP. LAWLER: You know what I passed legislation to prosecute that and it should be prosecuted. REP. LEE: That's awesome and I would like to see it happening here. But what we don't see when we're talking about crime, we're really talking about white collar crime, we're really talking about ways in which we're going to hold corporate criminals accountable. We're really make- taking any strides in any level of government to do anything about that. But we continue to talk about the crimes of desperation, in particularly the crimes in marginalized communities. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some other issues you raised, for example, immigration and border security. It has been years and there has been a failure to legislate on this. What's going to be different in a split Congress. Now. Do you see hope for this? REP. NUNN: I do. I really do.The challenge right now is until we secure the border, we have a really poor situation where the folks who are coming here illegally are jumping ahead of the folks who are coming here legally. The folks who have set up shop in America and want to be good citizens are finding themselves outfoxed by people who are being encouraged to come here illegally. And it's not like everybody has the chance. It's those who can get here.\u00a0 REP. GARCIA: I think most Republicans in this Congress have been disingenuous on immigration. I'm an immigrant. I came to the U.S. when I was a young kid. I had the privilege and honor of becoming an American in my early 20s. I am grateful to this country, I love this country, immigrants love this country, they just want an opportunity to be here, a pathway to citizenship\u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're talking about Dreamers. You're talking about border security. I mean, there are different aspects of this\u2013 REP. GARCIA: \u00a0But you can do both. You can do both. MARGARET BRENNAN: What part of this can get through in this Congress. Which piece? (CROSSTALK) REP. NUNN: I would like all of the above. REP. GARCIA: Well, I would hope that both could be part of this Congress.\u00a0 REP. NUNN: Done. I agree with you on that. REP. GARCIA: So here's the thing. The thing is, is that unfortunately, we- there's this myth that Democrats somehow aren't concerned about a secure border, or that we don't want an orderly process. But we also want to ensure that we want security- everybody wants to secure border. But we also want to ensure that we're talking about the humanity of people. These are people that are coming to this country that are desperate, that are suffering. And so this idea that we can't give these people justice, we can't support and help them, I think is anti-American. And I am hopeful like some of you, I have talked to some Republicans on the other side, that have an interest in a broader immigration reform package. And that's something that I hope that we can all work on. REP. LAWLER: My- My wife is an immigrant, as well. And she came to this country about a decade ago, in search of economic opportunity. She comes from Eastern Europe, a former Soviet satellite state. The bottom line here is this, we embrace immigration, all right. But we have to have a legal process. You need to secure the border, we need to increase Border Patrol, we need to increase the number of judges and court personnel to hear asylum cases, nobody should be waiting two to three years to hear an asylum case with the hope that they may come back for the court hearing. That's insane. And then we need to fix the legal immigration process so that people who want to come here can do so legally and contribute to our communities, to our culture, to our economy. And I think there can be broad bipartisan agreement on this, if everybody is willing to kind of give a little. Both sides have failed on immigration for years, for years. This is not one party or the other, both sides have failed miserably here. And we have a situation that is unsustainable. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I want to move on to governance and debt. Can I see a show of hands? Are you all confident that America will avoid defaulting on its debt?\u00a0 REP. LAWLER: Yes. REP. NUNN: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Show of hands. (ALL FOUR RAISE THEIR HANDS) REP. GARCIA: I'd like to think so.\u00a0 REP. LEE: I hope so. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are- you're confident we will avoid the cliff? REP. LAWLER:\u00a0 We- we absolutely will. The bottom line is this. We have incurred debt previously, we have an obligation to pay that we will lift the debt ceiling. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you believe that some of your Republican colleagues who have been very- in a very different place on this will come along? And that the party- REP. LAWLER: \u00a0 Absolutely, but-but here's the point I would make, over-over the past many decades, major spending reform has been tied to the debt ceiling. Okay, so the White House needs to recognize one thing, one party rule in Washington is over, they need to negotiate with the Speaker in good faith to come to a long term agreement that puts us on the path to fiscal solvency.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Social security, health care, including Medicare and Medicaid, and then defense are the three biggest line items. Where do you cut? If you have to have those conversations, where do you cut? REP. LEE:\u00a0 Defense. The reality is, is that we can't keep asking the same people to compromise over and over and over. When we talk about these conversations, we have to humanize them. We have to be very clear what we are proposing to cut, who are going to be impacted by it.\u00a0 REP. GARCIA: What we've actually been spending all this money on is actually getting our country back on track. We just went through the single largest loss of life event in the modern era of our country. We lost over a million Americans. We spent money trying to keep people alive. We spent money trying to keep businesses afloat. We spent money to ensure that people were housed, people that needed support. And so yes, we spent, there was significant spending, but it was spending to respond to this incredible pandemic. (CROSS TALK) REP. NUNN: So you're saying the government's the solution for this. I'm saying states like Iowa where they opened back up, people were the solution. REP. GARCIA:\u00a0 We're in the business of government. Of course government is the solution\u2013\u00a0 REP. NUNN: Absolutely so so let's, with respect\u2013\u00a0 REP. GARCIA: \u00a0 And as far- as the, this, this unity amongst Republicans are in the debt ceiling, the truth is there is no unity\u2013\u00a0 REP. NUNN: You're not in our conference!\u00a0 REP. GARCIA: We're not\u2013 the Democrats are united. We're not going to cut Social Security. We're not going to cut Medicare. And so I'm interested to know how we're gonna get to this resolution, so that- because we know that this issue at the end of the day impacts working people the most. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 So the discretionary spending you would cut is also in Defense?\u00a0 REP. GARCIA: If it was up to me, we'd be raising taxes on billionaires- on billionaires and corporations. That's what we'd be getting more- more- more support. But I think Representative Lee is right, I think we have to be able to look at an institution like the Pentagon.\u00a0 REP. NUNN: So let's be very clear here. If somebody's looking for an opportunity to go to college, they have the opportunity to serve in the military, and it will help pay for them to have the privilege of going to college. What I will not do is see members of the military who are on the frontline defending our very opportunity to even go to college have their paychecks cut, or their opportunity to defend themselves cut because of lackluster equipment.\u00a0 CROSS TALK REP. LEE:\u00a0 No, no, no. She asked us, let's humanize. There's a difference between sending our troops somewhere defenseless, and then looking at our defense budget. REP. NUNN: Right. REP. LEE: Which is the highest of the next 20 countries combined. We're not saying that we're sending\u2013\u00a0 REP. LAWLER: And we're continually forced to defend the world. REP. LEE: Endless wars, endless wars. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know Speaker McCarthy on this program last week said when it came to cutting discretionary spending, actually one of the places he would look to trim fat was the Defense Department.\u00a0 REP. NUNN: MARGARET, I think \u2013\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't sound like you're okay with that. REP. NUNN: So let's- let's take- first of all, what he did say is take things off the table, we're going to protect Social Security. People have paid into that they deserve to have that back. Republicans are committed to that. Let's take the Medicare that has gotten out there to make sure that people have access to the health care they need to be successful off the table. When it comes to defense spending, what I just heard was cutting things across the board. If there is a review, everything should have the opportunity to be assessed.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're on board. (CROSS TALK) REP. NUNN: Yeah, I think we should be looking across the board. REP. LAWLER: We haven't had a real budget process in a very long time. And you have to go line by line. And you need these departments and agencies to justify their spending. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.\u00a0 REP. LAWLER: They have not had to do that in a very long time. We need a real budget process as part of this negotiation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure, which takes time we're gonna have to leave it there. Thank you all for coming in. And I want to thank each and every one of you for joining our panel.\u00a0 ALL: Thank you.",

I'm Margaret Brennan. As we come on the air this morning, we are covering two major breaking news stories. Ten people are dead following a mass shooting in Monterey Park, a city just east of Los Angeles. At least 10 more are wounded. And, at this point, the gunman is not in custody. The shooting happened just after a lunar new year celebration. Here in Washington, we have learned of even more classified material uncovered at President Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware, following a nearly 12-hour search on Friday facilitated by the Department of Justice, along with White House counsel and the president's personal attorney. We will have more on that in a moment. But we want to begin with the very latest on that shooting in Monterey Park, California. And our Kris Van Cleave is on the scene -- Kris. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Margaret, good morning. A lot of unanswered questions face investigators this morning. The work at the scene here continues, the FBI and local police still here. The suspect has not been identified and at last report was still on the loose. The motive, the why for all of this, that remains a mystery. (Begin VT) EMERGENCY SERVICES DISPATCH: I got three immediates in here, and I have got approximately 10 deceased. KRIS VAN CLEAVE (voice-over): This morning,a community celebration of the lunar new year turns to tragedy. Investigators say the deadly shooting came as the event was wrapping up in Monterey Park outside Los Angeles. Authorities believe a lone gunman opened fired on a crowd, killing 10 and injuring at least 10 others, some critically. CAPT. ANDREW MEYER (Los Angeles Sheriff's Department): When officers arrived on scene, they observed numerous individuals, patrons of the location pouring out of location screaming. The officers made entry to the location and located additional victims. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: The mass shooting took place inside a ballroom dance club a little before 10:30 Saturday night. CAPT. ANDREW MEYER: All I can tell you is that it was a firearm that was used. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: Monterey Park is a community of nearly 62,000. Almost two-thirds of its population is Asian. The lunar new year celebration is a big attraction here. Witnesses said they initially thought the shots were fireworks. MAN: I did -- heard some sounds going off, and I was like, fireworks? It's very surprising, shocking to hear that something like this went on in not only a small city, but my city. KRIS VAN CLEAVE: According to some witnesses, the shooter appeared to be firing indiscriminately. (End VT) KRIS VAN CLEAVE: The lunar new year festivities here in Monterey Park attract about 100,000 people a day. It's a two-day event. All of the plans for today have been canceled. We understand police are at a second location a few miles from here in a neighboring city. The sheriff's department says it may be related to the shooting here. We're still waiting for details on that, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Kris Van Cleave, thank you. And we will come back to you later in the show if there is any new development. But, right now, we go to our chief national affairs and justice correspondent, Jeff Pegues. Jeff, we know both the president and vice president have been briefed on this. What are you hearing from your sources about this investigation? JEFF PEGUES: Well, it's ongoing in terms of tracking down who this person is. The question is, what kind of weapon was involved here? Is it a hate crime? Some of the initial questions that law enforcement, whether it's local and federal are asking right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why are federal investigators involved in it at this point, and how do they determine things like motive? JEFF PEGUES: Well, here's where I think law enforcement has an advantage. In this phase of an investigation, when you have a suspect still out there, having the help of the FBI, the ATF can -- the ATF, for one, can trace the weapon, the origin of the weapon, also help with the crime scene, as can the FBI. But, of course, the FBI can also talk to witnesses who are anywhere across the country. MARGARET BRENNAN: At this point, all we're hearing is that it was a firearm. Why is that significant, in terms of the type of weapon? JEFF PEGUES: Well, it looks like, based on the amount of wounded and dead, that this was a high-powered sort of weapon. Whether it was semiautomatic or automatic, it could unleash several rounds a minute. And so investigators are going to look at that as they try to process the scene as it unfolded moment to moment. MARGARET BRENNAN: How -- I mean, when you hear that the shooter is still potentially on the loose here, what happens in a scenario like that? JEFF PEGUES: We don't see -- in terms of active shooter situations like this and mass shooting situations like this, you don't see a lot of suspects who do the act and then take off. In many cases, they will take their own life. And so this is an interesting case in that way, that investigators are still searching for the suspect. They have not at this time released a description of the suspect or what kind of vehicle this person could or may be riding in. And so there are still a lot of questions about the investigation going forward in terms of tracking that suspect down, which is so rare in situations like this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Jeff Pegues, I will let you get back to making calls. Thank you. Now to the other big breaking news story we're covering today. Last night, we learned that, on Friday, the FBI executed what the White House is calling a comprehensive search of President Biden's Wilmington, Delaware, home and took possession of six more items with classification markings. The search, which Mr. Biden's attorneys say was conducted with their full cooperation, began at approximately 9:45 a.m. and wrapped up around 10:30 p.m. President Biden's personal attorney, Bob Bauer, said in the statement that the Department of Justice had -- quote -- \"full access\" to all the materials in the Wilmington home, and that the search included personally handwritten notes, files, papers, binders, memorabilia, to-do lists, schedules, and reminders going back decades. Bauer also said that some of the items taken were both from Mr. Biden's tenure as vice president and from his years in the Senate. CBS News does not know the level of classification for the six new items that were retrieved Friday. But, at this point, we do know that the number of known classified documents that have been recovered since November two is between 25 and 30. The Department of Justice is considering searches of other locations tied to the president. The one Friday was overseen by U.S. attorney John Lausch. Special counsel Robert Hur does not take over the case until the end of the month. Mr. Biden dodged questions about the document investigation most of last week, but, on Thursday, reiterated that he was fully cooperating with the investigation and hoped it would soon be concluded. (Begin VT) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have no regrets. I'm following what the lawyers have told me they want me to do. That's exactly what we're doing. There's no \"there\" there. Thank you. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Ohio Congressman Mike Turner. He is expected to head up the House Intelligence Committee. Good morning to you. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-Ohio): Good morning Margaret. Thank you for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we have this development in regard to the further materials that were found at President Biden's Delaware home. What is your reaction? And what does it signify to you that no one realized that this classified material was missing, some of it dating back to his Senate years? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Yes, this is really incredible. And, as you know, congratulations to you. We would not know anything about this if it hadn't been that CBS had broken this story. The White House nor the Department of Justice had shared any of the information with the public. And this really is one matter. We wouldn't have this issue if it hadn't been for Biden's attorney general making the decision to raid former President Trump's house looking for -- for classified documents that were being held there. What's amazing about all this is, it takes us to the question of, why were these documents here? Well, now that we learn that some of these go back to his Senate time. Clearly, he's -- he's become a serial classified document hoarder. Why did he have these? Who did he show them to? I mean, the only reason you can think of as to why anyone would take classified documents out of a classified space at home is to -- is to show them to somebody. Who did he show them to? This is going to be crucial, I think, to the special counsel's investigation, is, why did the president have these documents? Who did he show them to? And is it connected to the Biden family businesses? MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know the differences of course to -- I want to talk about the Biden situation. But, just to clarify, when you reference President Trump, there were 300 classified documents. There was a warrant. There was refusal to comply in terms of handing things over. And the White House and the president's lawyer are pointing out that, in the case of Biden, he granted permission, and this was consensual for the DOJ to come in and search. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well... MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the fact that the Justice Department conducted the search signify anything more to you? And do you have any insight into the sensitivity of the documents? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Sure. Absolutely. I think this looks more like a cover-up than an investigation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any facts to back up your -- your allegations that he was hoarding things in terms of intention to take classified material vs. -- it's been characterized that it was somehow accidental? Do you have any insight into what these materials were? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, they didn't fly to his home without him. They went on a train with him from the -- his Senate offices and then in boxes that he was in charge of. The chain of custody here is going to be important, because we know that these were in Joe Biden's hands, in Joe Biden's control, then ended up behind his Corvette in his garage and in his office that he did not control and also throughout his house. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And so the special counsel is going to have to deal with the issue of, what was the chain of custody? Who had these? Why did he take them to begin with? When did he get them? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: When was he handed these documents? And what did he do with them? And this is a real critical question to all this. Why did he have these documents to begin with? MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And that is why the special counsel's work is going to be really important, because I can think of no reason why the president should have taken home, as a senator or as vice president, any classified documents that clearly have no protection. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: They're available and open to anybody. MARGARET BRENNAN: You have also before this development asked for a briefing from the director of national intelligence. You set a deadline of Thursday. Do you have any further reason to believe they will meet that deadline, that you will get any insight into these materials? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, we'll have to see, but what's critical here... MARGARET BRENNAN: They haven't responded? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And this is very important. This is what's very important to all of this, Margaret, and that is the FBI and the national archivist were working completely independent of the intelligence community or the Department of Defense. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: They claim this was all an issue of national security, but they did not speak to anyone who's involved in national security. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no response yet from the intelligence community? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I have not received a response, no. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I also want to ask you what leadership looks like with Republicans in charge. You are also on House Oversight. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Correct. MARGARET BRENNAN: There are -- of the 26 Republican members on the committee, 19 of them denied the results of the 2020 election. Your colleagues now include Marjorie Taylor Greene, Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert, Scott Perry. They all played critical roles in -- in the former president's attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. Do you have any concerns about working with these lawmakers? I mean, you're very much a centrist. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, even on the Democrat side, there's been a number of people who objected to President Bush's reelection and voted against certifying his election. There's a long history of both sides... MARGARET BRENNAN: I am asking about you, your party, and your colleagues. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: There's a long history of both sides having raised issues, including, you recall, the -- Al Gore taking President Bush's election all the way to the Supreme Court. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are not an election denier, by CBS standards, just to be clear. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I am -- I am not. And I work with both sides of the aisle, and there are election deniers on both sides of the aisle. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are comfortable with all those individuals I just rattled off and the fact that the majority of the Republicans on this committee denied the election results? Is that what you are saying? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: What I'm comfortable with is, the electorates are very smart. And these people have been sent to Congress to represent their districts and to be part of the congressional debate... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: ... to lead us to what's going to be bipartisan, bicameral resolutions. We have a split government right now. Republicans control the House. The Senate is controlled by the Democrats. You have a Democrat president. We're going to have a lot of debate and discussions. And I think this is going to be a very fruitful period for -- for Congress and for our country, because it's going to have to be bipartisan, bicameral. And I believe that the president, in opening negotiations with Republicans, is beginning to start that process. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is actually possible in this bipartisan, bicameral situation? What can you actually get legislation through on? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, I -- I mean, depending on what the pending -- depending on what the president's willing to do, I think it's unlimited, right? We have really tough issues right now. We have out-of-control inflation. We have an open border and record people crossing our border. MARGARET BRENNAN: What about gun control? REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: We have -- we have the issue of Russia and certainly in Ukraine and certainly China. I think we're going to have a number of issues that we're going to have to deal with. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congressman Turner, we have to leave it there today. REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Thank you, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: For some political analysis, we're joined now by chief election and campaign correspondent Robert Costa and Ed O'Keefe. Ed, let me start with you, because it was last night probably around, what, 7:00 or so when all of us got the e-mail from the president's attorney and then a statement from the White House about this latest discovery of documents. This drip, drip, drip just continues. ED O'KEEFE: It does. And this is by design now. The White House Counsel's Office, his personal training, making very clear that they withheld this information until after the search was conducted in his home in Delaware. And this is how we're going to be learning about things, essentially Once steps are taken by the Justice Department, in this case, an FBI search of a sitting president's home, a pretty extraordinary development in this case, and something we have not seen before, but a step that they made very clear they took voluntarily. They were there for this, attorneys were, and they took away six more items marked classified for now a total of about 25 to 30 classified documents found in -- at his former office here in Washington and then in his home in Delaware. And it raises questions about, what was that material? What more could be found? Where else might they search? MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, and what the classification level is. I mean, the reporting on this is continuing. But the politics, Bob, as you know, were laid bare there with Congressman Turner talking about outrage, frankly, that, in so many different locations, these materials could have been found. And it changes the calculus for Republicans. And it gives them an advantage, frankly, politically, to make this argument. ROBERT COSTA: The Republicans remain confrontational with this White House. They see divided government as an opportunity, especially in the House, where they have the majority, to continue this investigation, even as the Justice Department continues its own investigation. You have someone like the Judiciary Committee chairman, Jim Jordan, now mounting his own investigation of the FBI and the Justice Department and the intelligence agencies. This also comes politically at a moment of transition for the Biden White House. Ron Klain, the chief of staff, has signaled that he will be departing his position in the coming months. He has been a key link to progressives, has helped Biden work on signature legislation, like the American Rescue Plan. And he's lasted quite a long time for a chief of staff, two years. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm glad you bring that up, because the other thing that the departure of the chief of staff raises questions about is this looming policy and political conversation about the debt ceiling. Who runs point on that? Obviously, the Treasury secretary has a huge role. But in terms of talking to the Hill and the negotiations, who's doing that if the chief of staff is leaving? ROBERT COSTA: What I'm told from people inside the West Wing is that President Biden himself has a relationship with Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, of course, with Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader. They are in some ways going to try to cut out Speaker Kevin McCarthy and the House Republicans. There's not an appetite among Democrats to put spending cuts on the table at all. They would like to see a clean debt limit extension. And Jim Clyburn, one of the top Democrats in the House, recently told me he could see a scenario where centrist House Republicans band together with House Democrats for a clean debt limit extension. ED O'KEEFE: And that outreach is under way. We have heard from the White House saying that they are trying to reach out to these new members. There's going to be a meeting this week with newly elected members invited to the White House to come and meet the president and say hello. And you better believe that one of the ways they will try to work this is, are there enough Republicans out there maybe in districts that the president won or that just know they're going to face a tough reelection who can be at least talked to about the risks and the potential to work together on this issue. MARGARET BRENNAN: But clarify that. When you say cut out the speaker of the House, are you saying it's 212 Democrats, plus however many, 15 or more, that Republicans, they can pull over, rather than Republicans moving to lift the debt ceiling? ROBERT COSTA: What I'm hearing is that many more moderate, centrist House Republicans, those who are traditional Republicans, are looking at this, and they don't want to get in front of McCarthy. They know he has to meet with Biden in the coming weeks and tell the president he wants this in that in terms of a deal. But if a deal falls apart, as Ed said, they're starting to have back-channel conversations of, could a coalition of 10 to 15. House Republicans get together with 200-plus House Democrats to get a clean extension through the House? ED O'KEEFE: Not the prettiest way to do it, but certainly worth considering and something they have to talk about. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, when you talk about Leader McConnell and President Biden, they have history going back to the last time... ED O'KEEFE: You're so right. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... we went to the brink with the debt ceiling in 2011. But the politics are even more complicated than they were back then. So how do they carry out this strategy? I feel like you're laying out on ESPN the different potential strategies on the playing field here. ROBERT COSTA: Privately, I'm told President Biden and Senator McConnell have chuckled behind the scenes with longtime friends about how at this stage in divided government, it's these two men who have long been friends who are being counted upon to perhaps cut a deal. I remember, when I first started covering Congress a decade ago, I would remember Vice President Biden was the one... MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ROBERT COSTA: ... who came to the Capitol to meet with Senator McConnell to cut a deal on that so-called fiscal cliff way back then. So, they have that history, and they were recently in Kentucky together, showing at least, not political solidarity, but in terms of a personal relationship, there's a real rapport. MARGARET BRENNAN: But, politically, this still is something that we're going to be -- it can be very complicated. I mean, you can't completely cut the House out of the situation, right? ED O'KEEFE: You can't. You can't. But, look, this is also helpful for the White House. It's a helpful foil, in essence, because one of the things they want to keep doing, other than talking about that potential fight, other than talking about this search of his home over the week on Friday, is about the economy. And so you can go out there as president, as a Cabinet secretary, as the vice president, and say: Look, the economy is on the rebound. We seem to have held off inflation, for the most part. Things are in decent shape. It's going to get much worse if Republicans allow this brinksmanship to continue, and even worse so if they go after things like carving into Social Security and Medicare as a way to pay for things. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, those are the third rail, but then you add in the potential of cutting defense spending, and that also becomes problematic. ED O'KEEFE: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: But it does seem like Republicans are shifting the conversation in some way towards the need to have a conversation about fiscal spending. ROBERT COSTA: That's exactly right. And keep an eye on Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. He is telling his colleagues he is open to having a discussion about spending cuts. So, as many top Democrats say, hey, we want a clean extension, they now have Senator Manchin and a few others saying maybe we should negotiate a little bit. So there's a tension point in that area. MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to see if there are other Senate Democrats also willing. And, hopefully, we will talk to one of them that on the show. Thanks to both of you. We do have Virginia Senator Tim Kaine standing by, but we have some technical issues, so stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Today marks what would have been the 50th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade. And even though it is no longer the law of the land, both pro- and anti- abortion rights supporters are marching on Washington and other cities this weekend. We took a look back through our archives and found a challenge to Roe vs. Wade from 1989 that also prompted marches on Washington. (Begin VT) LESLEY STAHL: Welcome to Face the Nation. I'm Lesley Stahl. Sixteen years ago, the Supreme Court said a woman has a right to a legal abortion. The court, far more conservative today, is about to review that decision. SUSAN SMITH (National Right to Life Committee): We're hopeful that we will get to a point in our nation's history where we restore protection to unborn children. KATE MICHELMAN (National Abortion Rights Action League): This -- this right is in danger and it is in serious danger now. LESLEY STAHL (voice-over): So worried are the pro-choice forces, they're hoping to rally more than a quarter-million people to march in Washington today. WOMAN: I think Washington is literally going to be shut down. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) LESLEY STAHL: Abortion, it's become a litmus test for public figures. GIRL: Let's suppose that I -- I'm 12 and I was sexually molested by my father, and I became -- I was sexually molested by my father and I became pregnant. Would you want me to carry that baby to term and have that baby? DAN QUAYLE (Former Vice President of the United States): It's a difficult question and one that does not have an easy answer, but my answer would be yes. LESLEY STAHL: Anti-abortion groups have turned to civil disobedience. Some 10,000 activists have been arrested. BOB NOLTE (Operation Rescue): We are seeing clinics closed down for full days. Babies lives are being saved. LESLEY STAHL: There are still 1.6 million abortions a year in the U.S. Yet, while polls show over 75 percent support abortions for rape or incest, majorities now believe they should be illegal if sought for financial or emotional reasons. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: The issue is proving to be a tricky one for some Republican 2024 hopefuls after Democrats had a better-than-expected showing in the 2022 midterms. One big reason was, the party is more supportive of abortion rights. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. I know you have dealt with a number of mass shootings as governor and senator in the state of Virginia. I wonder your thoughts on Monterey Park this morning. SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-Virginia): Margaret, it's -- it's just like scar tissue that keeps get reopened. Every time these things happen, we're reminded in Virginia of the shooting at Virginia Tech in April of 2007. My heart goes out to this community. I'm worried that the perpetrator is still at large. So, let's first make sure that the law enforcement has the support to catch him, and then we need to support those survivors and all who've been affected. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator, we have to take a quick break, and I want to talk to you more on the other side of it. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. And we continue our conversation with Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. Senator, yesterday for the fifth time we learned about this other tranche of classified information being kept at the president's personal residence. How does a senator accidentally take classified material home? TIM KAINE: Margaret, I don't really know the answer to that question because I - I review classified material as a senator on the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, but when I do it, it's always in a classified facility where I don't have access to the materials other than to sit there and read them. So, that's why there needs to be this independent investigation and independent prosecutor. How many documents are we talking about? Dozens? A handful or hundreds? How serious are they? Why were they taken? Did anyone have access to them? And then, is the president being cooperative? And I think by all accounts it suggests that, yes, of course he's being cooperative, as - as anyone should be. But these are the reasons why this independent prosecutor and an investigation is necessary. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're one of the few senate Democrats who have said, you know, that you have concern about this issue. I wonder, how concerned you are and, politically, doesn't this damage the White House and the president in terms of trust and credibility? TIM KAINE: Well, again, those questions do depend on the answer to the -- we'll get in this investigation. I mean, Margaret, you - you know this, government has a tendency to overclassify. If they are looking at a document and they have to analyze to decide whether to classify, sometimes they just mark it classified, I'll read it in the SCIF and say, Margaret was reporting on that a month ago, or \"The Washington Post\" has been telling me this for the last six months. So, you do have to see, what's the scope, how serious, did anyone have access? And those questions have to be answered before, you know, we decide, is this -- how significant an issue is this? MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And that may take some time. I want to ask you about some of the business that Congress will have to get to soon. As you know, the White House wants a clean lift to the debt limit with no strings attached. Senator Manchin said it's a mistake for the White House to refuse to negotiate with Republicans. Do you think that position is changing? Is it a mistake? TIM KAINE: Well, first, we should - we should have a clean lift of the debt ceiling because the 14th Amendment to the Constitution says nobody should question the creditworthiness of the United States. This is about whether the U.S. we pays our credit card or not. And I don't think anyone should flirt with not paying the U.S.' credit card, which is what Republicans are doing. So, the White House position is correct, we should raise the debt ceiling. But if Republicans are saying they won't do it and they're threatening our creditworthiness because they want cuts, let them put cuts on the table. Is it the cutting Social Security and Medicare that Rick Scott wanted to, is it cutting aid to Ukraine in the middle of a war between a democracy and an illegally invading dictator? Let them put on the table what they want to cut so that the American public can see what their priorities are. MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaker McCarthy has said the president has invited him to speak -- have a conversation - TIM KAINE: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And discuss a responsible lift to the debt ceiling. So, what does that mean? How does this politically get dressed up so we avoid the cliff? TIM KAINE: Well, first, that's a good thing. I'm very, very happy that the president and Speaker McCarthy are talking. That's really positive. How do we fix this? Jeff Merkley and I have a bill that's based upon an earlier fix that Senator McConnell led during the Obama administration when there was a similar brinksmanship around a debt ceiling. And Senator McConnell said, look, we will allow the president to raise it subject to a congressional disapproval. And that was done. And we think that should be the norm anyway. So, we have a bill called the Protect Our Credit Act that would basically say the president has got to cover the debts of the United States. And if that includes raising the debt ceiling, the president can do that. But if Congress disapproves, then you can have an expedited up or down vote in Congress. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. TIM KAINE: And I think that's the right solution to this. MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, you're on Armed Services. How concerned are you that Secretary of Defense Austin left Germany with no agreement among western allies to provide tanks to Ukraine? TIM KAINE: Margaret, there are - there are some differences about exactly what and what's the timing in terms of providing equipment. But we have assembled a global coalition to support Ukraine. The unity has been very strong and the support, bipartisan and bicameral in Congress has been very strong. And I think that will continue. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine, thank you for your time today. TIM KAINE: Absolutely. Thanks, Margaret. MARGARET BRENNAN: And some of the nation's mayors are in town. They're the first line of defense in every city, as you all know. So, stay with us. We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with four of our nation's mayors. Francis Suarez is the mayor of Miami and the head of U.S. conference of mayors. LaToya Cantrell is the mayor of New Orleans. Plus we have Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens with us, along with John Giles, the mayor of Mesa, Arizona. Good morning to all of you and thank you so much for being here in person. FRANCIS SUAREZ (Republican, Mayor of Miami): Good morning. LATOYA CANTRELL (Democrat, Mayor of New Orleans): Good morning. JOHN GILES (Republican, Mayor of Mesa, Arizona): Good morning. ANDRE DICKENS, (Democrat, Mayor of Atlanta): Thanks for having us. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk about just what is developing in terms of the shooting in California. Nationwide, we are seeing this spike in violent crime. We're seeing reports of an uptick in anti-Semitism and hate crimes. All of you are from states where there are fairly permissive gun laws. And I wonder, Mayor Suarez, how you put those pieces together. What is driving this? FRANCIS SUAREZ: Yes, it's - it's so many different factors that are driving this. But, you know, one of the things that we focused a lot on in this mayoral conference that we just ended was mental health. Mental health is a huge component of what's driving a lot of these -- when you look at the root cause and you go back and you sort of peel back the layers of the onion. Mayors are very concerned about it. We, obviously, had a panel, obviously, on - on - on urban crime. And certainly a lot of these mayors have talked about, you know, gun control in their cities. In our city, you know, we - we have -- we're very blessed. We had a great year. Our homicide level went down. We've been able -- and I knock on proverbial wood, that we haven't had any of these mass shootings that we've seen across the country, which seem to be escalating in terms of frequency and in terms of, you know, the amount of times that we're seeing them. It's almost every day it seems like we're having one. So, it's been - it's been tough. It's something that mayors are grappling with across the country. And we're focusing in on it in a very comprehensive way. MARGARET BRENNAN: You specifically this week told your fellow mayors that some of this is driven by no cash bail policies. Why do you say that? Are repeat offenders a problem? FRANCIS SUAREZ: Yes, what - what I'm focusing on is the no cash bail is creating lawlessness in a lot of our cities. What's happening is, for example, people get out right away. They're not even - you know, they don't even have to post bail, so they're able to get out right away. And so we're seeing someone go into like a CVS, for example, and - and take thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise, which is causing CVS' to close, which hurts, you know, the rest of the city. But that - that's not particularly related to - to the gun violence issue. It's related more to petty crime, which is creating lawlessness in some of our cities. But what we're do -- we are seeing in the city of Miami is, you know, we are up-funding our police. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. FRANCIS SUAREZ: You know, a lot of cities got into the defunding police movement and we're seeing that as a bipartisan issue. I said it at the White House, you know, just a couple days ago, and the president echoed what I said about up-funding police and not defunding police. So I think that is a bigger issue as we struggle with how we solves these issue in - on our cities. MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Biden put in what $4 billion in grants that's available for local law enforcement use in cities around the country. ANDRE DICKENS: Yes, you know, as you talked about this issue that's happening right now in California, yet another mass shooting in our country, it continues to happen too frequently. And so, it's just too many guns in America. It's too many guns in the hands on our streets and guns plus anger equals bad outcomes, equals violence. And so we have to bring back laws that are sensible, common sense gun laws, to be able to reduce the amount of access that people have to guns. And so you see another mass shooting and lives are lost. And my heart goes out to the people of California experiencing that. And so as Mayor Suarez mentioned, we're talking about mental health and how to make sure that we have anti-violence in our communities. We're utilizing a cure violence, you know, to bring down the retaliation and make sure we have healing in our communities to try to use policing and non-policing tactics to bring down violence. Midnight basketball, things that are - you know, summer youth employment program to help our youth. But mental health and just getting people the quality care that they need so they make wise decisions. Because most of the violence that we're seeing in our community is escalating disputes. People that are unable to resolve a conflict that's just escalated too much. And people aren't fighting or arguing any more, they're taking their hands to their pockets and pulling out a gun. And it gets to intense and someone kills someone. And that's the violence we're seeing in America. So, we have to take a whole of government approach to be able to bring down this violence. Things that we can do to help our youth, to help our communities. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. ANDRE DICKENS: And that's some of the stuff that we're doing in Atlanta. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Giles, you, actually, I'm surprised when I saw that Mesa has such a big population. I think you've -- you're the biggest city at the table. JOHN GILES: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: And it looked at -- I looked at your police site (ph). It says that you are one of America's safest large cities. JOHN GILES: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you qualify that? And how are you doing that if that is a fact? JOHN GILES: Well, a lot of the things that these fellows have just mentioned. We are doubling down on our investment in our police department, and we are shifting the paradigm. A few years ago we changed the name of our fire department. It's no longer the Mesa Fire Department. It's Mesa Fire and Medical to better reflect what we do. We need to do the same when it comes to policing. It needs to be the police and mental health department. Last year we diverted over 3,000 911 calls away from a police response to a mental health response. So, again, it -- the importance of mental health is ubiquitous in all that we do. And it was discussed at the - at the conference. It's -- it has everything to do with how we address homelessness. It has everything that we do -- how we address policing in our community. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Cantrell, I want to get to you on that, too, because President Biden said it's not about defunding the police, it's about restraining the place. I wonder if you agree with that. I know you have had a problem in New Orleans with not having enough police officers. LATOYA CANTRELL: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: Less than 1,000 for 3,000 people. LATOYA CANTRELL: Sure. And the thing is, is that, it's about retention and it is also about recruitment. Because of this second tranche of the American Rescue Plan dollars coming our way with direct allocation, oh, it has really been a lifeline, where we're putting $80 million in public safety across the board. One of the biggest in terms of a retention and incentive package to retain. We see it slowing down, meaning attrition is declining. Our officers are staying. And so we just have to continue to give the tools and resources that our officers need to respond. Also, in terms of the capacity issue you mentioned, you know, I've had to put all commissioned officers that were in special ops, over 75 back on the street, because my officers were saying, hey, we need help out here. So, I have to protect my officers so they can protect my city. And so, we're seeing a real results in regards to our redeployment strategy on the ground. MARGARET BRENNAN: New Orleans has the highest per capita murder rate of any major city. Why? LATOYA CANTRELL: Why is because, one, dealing with Covid-19, violence, everyone has guns. The ability or the lack of the ability to resolve a conflict without reaching and pulling a gun. Also, as it relates to accountability. You know, low-lying offenses, you know, when they don't get bail or they're not restrained, then we're just seeing how these crimes escalate. People need to be held accountable across the board. And we're seeing results, I would say. We're moving in the right direction. But I tell you, we definitely need to hold people accountable. You can't fight crime just focusing on police. It's about a system, a criminal justice system. It's about the D.A., your judges. And it's about building in accountability. Everyone needs to be held accountable. And that's how we're focusing on it. Wholistic approach in the city of New Orleans. Definitely seeing a decline. Moving in the right direction. MARGARET BRENNAN: This issue of crime in your city is causing a lot of political problems. And you are the target of a recall drive that's underway right now. A number of allegations against you as well in regard to financial improprieties. How much of the responsibility with the crime issue do you - do you personally take? LATOYA CANTRELL: Well, first of all, it is the New Orleans Police Department that is absolutely under my authority. And with that, making sure that not only I'm listening to my officers, but getting them the resources that they need to fight crime. And that is exactly what we're seeing on the ground. The incentive packages, retaining officers, as well as recruitment. And that's the focus. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you believe you'll survive this recall effort? LATOYA CANTRELL: Well, based on what I see is that the residents of my city definitely appreciate continuity in leadership. And so with that, that speaks to keeping progress moving and alive under my leadership, second elected twice in the city, 61 percent the first time, 65 percent the second time. Continuity in leadership is what I'm seeing by my people. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to get to all of you on a number of issues, but I know something very intense has just happened in Atlanta, Mayor Dickens. I watched a press conference you held last night following the death of a Georgia-based activist. It turned into a riot. This stems, as I understand it, from the shooting death of an activist. And the body camera from the policeman who's believed to have shoot this individual doesn't exist. What can you tell us in terms of who is behind the violence that happened yesterday? ANDRE DICKENS: Yes. Earlier this week an individual that was protesting in the woods, a number of folks are in the woods trying to protest against a development of a public safety training center, which is for police and firefighters. A new state-of-the-art training center that's going to allow us to do 21st century policing, allow us to have an emergency vehicle obstacle course and these things that police and fire will be able to work together to be able to bring about, you know, safety in our community. And so we're building it, but some folks don't want to see anything built that supports police. So they call it cop city. And these individuals are in the woods protesting it. And, unfortunately, they were engaged by Georgia State Patrol, asked them to be able to move out of the woods. An individual shot at the Georgia State Patrol. And the Georgia State Patrol Officer shot back. And, unfortunately, that individual was killed and the patrol officer, the state patrol officer, was shot in the abdomen. And so now they had a protest last night. And it was peaceful. But there were some individuals within that crowd that meant violence. They had explosives. They burned down a police car. They broke windows at businesses. And so our police department, along with our state and federal partners, took swift action within two blocks and brought that situation under control. And the violence stopped. And those six individuals were arrested. And it should be noted that these individuals were not Atlanta or Georgia residents. Most of them traveled into our city to wreak havoc. And so we love to support people when they're doing right. Peaceful protest is a part of the American - our freedoms. But when you are violent, we will make sure that you get -- held accountable. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want - I want to pick you up on that point, when you say people from out of town, they're carrying explosives. Is this an organized movement here? Your local paper says this is having national reach with reaction from groups ranging from, quote, environmental activists, radical anarchists and black revolutionaries. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Georgia congresswoman, I'm sure you know her, blamed Black Lives Matter and Antifa. And that she blamed Democrats. On the facts, seven to 13 people have been charged with domestic terrorism. ANDRE DICKENS: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this terrorism? Is this crime? What is this? Who's behind it? ANDRE DICKENS: Yes, I won't go as far as whatever that representative said. But what I will say is that it is a crime. And that's why they've been charged with a crime. And these crimes -- MARGARET BRENNAN: Domestic terrorism. ANDRE DICKENS: And the crimes range from violence to domestic terrorism to assault and battery and some other things. But, yes, it is violent when someone turns to burn down a police car or break out windows or have explosives on them. I don't get into the names. I don't know all the organizations. I'll let y'all decide who did it. I just know they're arrested. And if they come into Atlanta again to wreak havoc, they will be arrested again. MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you believe your city is being targeted by organized groups? ANDRE DICKENS: In that regard, yes. Those individuals that are protesting against cop city, as they call it, it's really a public safety training center, they don't want to see the very things that they ask for, more police training. We can't train imaginary. We have to do it in a facility that allows for police, firefighters and the community to train together. And so this is bringing about the change that we wanted to see in 2020. And now while we're doing it, these individuals don't want to see any resources go towards that training. And so we're going to develop this training center and those individuals will have to come to a halt. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Giles, you are on the front line of the migration surge. And I think it's so interesting that you're characterizing your city as very safe. You know, these issues of migration surges being uncontrolled, and crime are often conflated. How are you doing that in terms of not having this overwhelm your local officials in law enforcement? JOHN GILES: Well, I wish I could say it's not overwhelming us. It is. And it has been for decades. And one of the thing I've enjoyed about this conference over the last few days is, you're starting to see more bipartisan frustration. You're seeing the mayor of New York City and Chicago and Denver are all top of their agendas now is talking about the problems that are being created in their communities as a result of the migration surge. I, in no way, support or encourage the practice of some of our border state governors in sending migrants to these large northeastern cities, but I do have to admit that it has elevated this issue to a place that it has not been previously. Border states have been complaining for decades about the need to address immigration reform, the need to dedicate additional resources to the border. And we're doing the best we can. But in our city, the church groups, the nonprofits that are being put upon by the federal government to come in and take up the slack, we are past our resources. So, hopefully this new-found bipartisan frustration and joining of northeastern cities to this issue will help elevate it. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have the Super Bowl coming out to Arizona soon. I know -- I read that you plan to take the Homeland Security secretary around your city? JOHN GILES: Absolutely. Mayor Gallego and I met with the Secretary Mayorkas just a few days ago. I've extended that invitation. We have very limited resources as far as welcoming centers and facilities to process these migrants as they proceed in their - in their journeys on sometimes to the northeastern cities. We need the band-aids to keep coming from the federal government in terms of facilities. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. JOHN GILES: But we also need to address the underlying issue of immigration reform. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mayor Suarez, I need to get to you on this as well because south Florida has seen this influx by boat. FRANCIS SUAREZ: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: Cubans in particular. Haitians. Customs and Border Protection report a 400 percent increase in the month of October alone. Are these new tighter regulations from the Biden administration making any difference? FRANCIS SUAREZ: It's hard to say. They were just imposed. But certainly I think the failure of having an immigration solution, as Mayor Giles said, is creating a sort of Miami and Florida becoming a border state and border city. As you said, we had the single largest increase in public school enrollment year over year this year. And so that -- just to put that in context, about 14,000 new children. If a big school is 2,000 children, that's seven new schools that we have to create in the system. It, obviously, as you said, puts a homeless -- strain on the homeless system and trying to take care of the least, the last and the lost in our cities. It puts a strain on our public hospital system. We have one of the largest public hospitals in the country that provides hundreds of millions of dollars of indigent care. Puts a tremendous amount of strain on that system. So, I think cities across America, as Mayor Giles said, are coming together in a bipartisan fashion and we're asking for a long-term solution. This problem has to be fixed. There has to be an articulated strategy. A lot of the immigration is coming from this hemisphere. And it doesn't seem like -- you know, either party really has focused on solving the problem as opposed to, you know, demonizing the other side for their position. And I think that's what we're - what mayors do is we focus on solving problems, not blaming somebody else for it. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. And you delivered that message here in Washington this week. Mayors, thank you very much for coming to the table. FRANCIS SUAREZ: Thank you. LATOYA CANTRELL: Thank you. JOHN GILES: Thank you. ANDRE DICKENS: Thank you. MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.

            "article_content": "The House Judiciary Committee will investigate how the Justice Department handled two classified records matters involving presidents, says the panel's chairman, GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, of Ohio.\u00a0 In the 118th Congress, Jordan's panel will probe how the department handled investigations into classified materials found at former President Donald Trump's Florida home and those found at President Joe Biden's\u00a0 office in a Washington think tank bearing his name and his Delaware home, Jordan told CBS News on \"The Takeout\" this week.\u00a0 \"Right now there are tons of questions,\" Jordan said. \"A lot of those I think will be answered in the Intelligence Committee and the Oversight Committee. But we'll be looking at the Justice Department component.\"\u00a0 Jordan said that at first, \"it looked like the White House had had this all wrapped up in a in a bow with a ribbon on top.\" But that neatness unraveled, Jordan said, with disclosures of more documents with classified markings found in the garage of Mr. Biden's Delaware home and an adjacent room. The revelation of this discovery came days after CBS News first reported that around 10 classified documents were found at the Penn Biden Center, a Washington, D.C. think tank. The documents are related to Mr. Biden's tenure as vice president. \u00a0 \"I would think that would only add to the weight of it,\" Jordan said, when asked about documents dating back that far. \"The vice president can handle classified material, obviously, because of an executive order. So he had them. But I do think, you know, six years? Were these documents at the (think tank) for six years or most of that six-year time frame? There are tons of questions but the White House doesn't seem to have many answers right now.\"\u00a0 Jordan's interview on \"The Takeout\" occurred before Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Biden document matter on Thursday. But Jordan seemed to support the idea of a special counsel to investigate the Biden documents.\u00a0 \"All I know is there's one for President Trump. And now we have a similar situation happening with President Biden,\" Jordan said. \"So if you're going to be consistent, it looks like there should be. And if that's what's warranted, I'm fine with it.\"\u00a0 The new Judiciary Committee chairman said he's suspicious of representations made by the White House that lawyers were involved in moving papers out of Biden's think tank office. \u00a0 \"I'm just a country boy,\" Jordan said. \"When we move things, you know, you call up your family, you buy pizza for them and you get the truck and you move things. It's not lawyers who are moving things. So they were obviously they're looking for something.\" \u00a0 Jordan suggested moving Biden papers might have been an effort to fend off future questions from House GOP-led committees into Biden family finances.\u00a0 \"Maybe they were getting ahead of that, getting ahead of the curve. I don't know that,\" he said. \"But that could be a reason you have lawyers involved with the moving process.\"\u00a0 On whether he thought there might be criminality involved, Jordan replied, \"We'll wait and see.\"\u00a0 He declined to comment on previous calls by some House Republicans to impeach Mr. Biden. \u00a0 \"That's a question for the entire Republican conference,\" Jordan said.\u00a0 Jordan said the focus of a new \"select\" committee on the \"weaponization of government\" \u00a0is \"not necessarily\" to investigate or short-circuit a \"specific ongoing criminal investigation.\" The select committee, which he is likely to chair, will investigate a \"double standard\" of justice applied to First Amendment protections, mostly, he said, to the detriment of conservatives or conservative causes.\u00a0 Jordan said he was not necessarily opposed to seeing former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's U.S. visa revoked. \"We will talk with our staff and some of our members and see,\" he said. Immigration policy, too, falls under Judiciary Committee jurisdiction. \"I haven't even, you know, taken a look at that situation,\" Jordan said. Some Democrats have called for Bolsonaro's temporary visa to be revoked in light of the storming government buildings by pro-Bolsonaro protesters angry about his recent election defeat. Bolsonaro is currently in Orlando, Fla.\u00a0 Jordan described former Trump's influence in the House GOP conference and national Republican Party as \"huge.\"\u00a0 \"He's the party leader and I think he was a great president.\"\u00a0 Jordan says he hasn't seen evidence that Trump lost favor or clout following a disappointing GOP performance in the midterm elections. \"I disagree. He's announced he's running for president. So, there's going to be a primary, and I think he's going to win.\"\u00a0 Though he describes Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, a possible rival to Trump, as a \"great guy\" who has done \"an amazing job as governor,\" Jordan says, \"I'm for President Trump, whether he runs or not\u2026 I think he's going to win.\"\u00a0 Executive producer: Arden Farhi Producers: Jamie Benson, Jacob Rosen, Sara Cook and Eleanor Watson CBSN Production: Eric Soussanin\u00a0Show email:\u00a0TakeoutPodcast@cbsnews.comTwitter:\u00a0@TakeoutPodcastInstagram:\u00a0@TakeoutPodcastFacebook:\u00a0Facebook.com/TakeoutPodcast Major Garrett is CBS News' chief Washington correspondent.

            "article_content": "A Democrat in the North Carolina state House switched to the Republican Party Wednesday, giving the GOP veto-proof control in both chambers of the legislature. It's a setback for Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper as he tries to block hardline conservative policies in his final two years in office. The switch by Rep. Tricia Cotham, of Mecklenburg County, means Republicans now hold the 72 seats required in the 120-seat House for a veto-proof majority. Republicans had already held 30 of the 50 seats in the Senate needed to override vetoes if party members are present and voting, but until Wednesday, they were one seat shy of a similar advantage in the House after the November elections. The improving margins for Republicans in the General Assembly have already emboldened the North Carolina party to try to pass legislation on topics such as gun rights, immigration and voting. Republicans also are interested in further restricting abortion following last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. Cotham, a former teacher and assistant principal who had served in the House for nearly 10 years through 2016 before returning in January, announced her decision at a news conference at North Carolina Republican Party headquarters. \"I will not be controlled by anyone,\" Cotham said as she announced she would switch her party registration to the GOP. She said the Democratic Party is no longer a big tent party and tries to bully its members. She said that she was considered a \"spy\" and a \"traitor\" and that the turning point was when she was criticized for using the American flag and praying-hands emoji on social media and on her vehicles. House Speaker Tim Moore, who had served previously with Cotham, appointed her this year to co-chair the House K-12 education committee, making her one of the few Democrats to hold top committee posts. And she had already voted with Republicans on a handful of key issues while nearly all other Democrats voted the other way.  Cotham, 44, has significant Democratic roots. Her mother, Pat, serves on the Mecklenburg County commission and has been a Democratic National Committee member. Her ex-husband is a former chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party.  Republicans have been advancing legislation this year that in previous years Cooper successfully vetoed because Democrats had enough seats in the General Assembly to uphold vetoes if they were presented and united.  Last week, the legislature overrode a Cooper veto for the first time since 2018 when it enacted, over his objections, a bill eliminating the state's pistol permit purchase system. And Cooper this year has allowed three other bills on topics that he also vetoed in 2021 to become law without his signature.  Cotham was one of three House Democrats who were absent last week during the override votes on the gun bill. The absences meant Republicans were able to meet, on their own, the necessary three-fifths threshold. Cotham said later that day that while she didn't support the permit repeal, she had informed both parties she would be absent. She said she was receiving scheduled hospital treatment stemming from a previous bout with COVID-19. But Cotham and the other absent Democrats were criticized for what happened, leading a liberal-leaning group, Carolina Forward, to announce plans to \"hold them accountable\" in 2024. House Minority Leader Robert Reives said Cotham should instead have resigned from her House seat because she campaigned as a Democrat in a heavily Democratic district.  Cotham campaigned as a \"supporter of abortion rights, health care, public education, gun safety and civil rights,\" Reives said before her announcement. \"Now, just a few months later, Rep. Cotham is changing parties. That is not the person that was presented to the voters\" of the district. The announcement came as the House prepared to vote Wednesday on its version of the two-year state government budget, which directs $60 billion in spending through mid-2025. ",

            "article_content": "West Virginia's Republican governor, Jim Justice, told CBS News he will decide by the end of February whether he will run for the Senate held by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in 2024, a decision that could upend the race and the balance of power in the Senate. \u00a0 Justice's openness to running raises the prospect of a blockbuster head-to-head battle between the state's two foremost political leaders:\u00a0 Justice and Manchin, the state's longtime senator who also previously served as governor. Justice, who switched parties to become a Republican just months into his first term as governor in 2017, said he is confident in his chances of ousting Manchin. \t \"I know the people of West Virginia. I know really and truly that they've been left in the dust and they really believe in me and trust me.\" Manchin has been a pivotal swing vote in Congress, confirming scores of President Joe Biden's nominees. He was also the clinching vote that helped Democrats pass the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, directing hundreds of billions of dollars in energy investments, reductions in prescription drug costs and deficit reduction. \u00a0 But he has also frustrated his party by siding with Republicans on some critical votes, including the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018.\u00a0 After a town hall meeting Tuesday in the Eastern Panhandle city of Martinsburg, Justice told CBS News he's giving serious consideration to a run for the Senate and wouldn't be influenced by whether Manchin seeks reelection.\t \"I'm a patriot. I really am. And I think our nation is going in a direction that could be our demise,\" Justice said, criticizing the economy, immigration and military policies. Justice would deliver a significant rightward shift for his state's delegation in the Senate.\u00a0 He told CBS News he would expect to be a \"reliably Republican\" vote and would not cut the same moderate figure or generate the nuanced voting record delivered by Manchin.\t \"I'm rock-solid as a Republican and being entrenched in those values,\" Justice said, despite the fact that he was once the standard bearer for the state Democratic Party in campaigning for governor in 2016. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Democrats already face a complex and potentially foreboding election cycle in the Senate in 2024. The party must defend seats in Ohio, Montana, Pennsylvania, Arizona and West Virginia. \u00a0 Donald Trump won the Mountain State overwhelmingly in 2016 and 2020.\tJustice himself told CBS News he remains a Trump supporter and would vote for Trump, if the former president is the party's nominee for the White House in 2024. West Virginia political analyst Hoppy Kercheval, who hosts the state's premiere political talk show and is the voice of a statewide radio network, said Justice would be a formidable candidate. Kercheval said, \"Justice has won statewide both as a Democrat and as a Republican. That indicates his appeal transcends traditional party affiliation.\" \"There is a genuineness about Justice that is very appealing.\u00a0 When he talks about how much he cares about West Virginia and its people, it rings true,\" Kercheval said. But Kercheval said Justice is dogged by physical mobility challenges that slow Justice's movements and could impact his ability to campaign in what could be an exhausting race. Kercheval said, \"Justice appears to be tireless, but physically he struggles to get around. That could be a detriment during a long and vigorous campaign.\" Republicans already have one major declared candidate for the West Virginia Senate seat in 2024. GOP Rep. Alex Mooney won a heated primary to secure the West Virginia 2nd Congressional District in 2022, then coasted to victory in the heavily-Republican district in November's general election. A campaign strategist for Mooney told CBS News, \"Jim Justice joined Senator Joe Manchin in supporting Joe Biden's trillion-dollar spending spree. Those polices were rejected last year in the Republican primary when Alex Mooney defeated the person endorsed by Justice and Manchin. Alex Mooney will win again next year.\" Justice has already sharply criticized Mooney, ahead of a possible primary contest.\u00a0 Justice told CBS News, \"The people of West Virginia don't know Alex Mooney.\u00a0 He can't possibly beat Joe Manchin.\" A Manchin spokeswoman did not comment on Justice's possible candidacy. Earlier this month, Manchin told reporters he was not planning to run for governor in 2024, but he also hasn't said whether he intends to run for reelection to his Senate seat.\t A Manchin aide told CBS News Tuesday the senator isn't expected to make a final decision on a reelection campaign until 2024, a timetable similar to the one he used in 2018 before announcing he'd run again.\u00a0 Manchin served as West Virginia governor until he successfully pursued his seat in the Senate. \"Joe Manchin will be formidable, I'll tell you that. If Joe and I are running (against each other) today, I win,\" Justice said, \"The people of West Virginia really believe in me and trust me.\" For longtime West Virginia residents and its political activists, a Manchin-Justice race could rise to the level of an unprecedented political battle for the ages in the state. Both are giants in the state and have the ability to tap into deep reservoirs of campaigns funds and donations. \u00a0\u00a0 Ken Lowe, a Shephardstown, W. Va., real estate agent who also serves on the West Virginia Racing Commission said many in the state have deep relationships with both Justice and Manchin. Lowe said, \"I couldn't make that decision. I'd look at Joe Manchin and say, 'I'm you're friend.' I'd look at Gov. Justice and say `I'm your friend.' I hope they don't run against each other. Tough choice. Very tough choice.\" Ed O'Keefe contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Washington \u2014 Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego announced Monday he will run for Senate in 2024, mounting a challenge to independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema. Gallego, an outspoken liberal Democrat, has long been critical of Sinema, who dropped her party identification as a Democrat to be an independent just after the party won the Senate last year. The Arizona senator still aligns herself with the Senate Democratic caucus, though. Sinema said at the time that she changed her party affiliation because she \"never fit neatly into any party box,\" but the label switch prompted an immediate backlash from many Democrats, including Gallego.\u00a0 A Marine veteran who is the son of immigrants, Gallego launched his Senate bid with a video, in both Spanish and English, detailing his childhood being raised by a single mother alongside three siblings. \"The rich and the powerful, they don't need more advocates. It's the people that are still trying to decide between groceries and utilities that needs a fighter for them,\" he says in the video. \"There is no lobbyist for working families.\" He also highlighted his service in the Marines, which included a deployment to Iraq during which his company suffered 23 casualties. \"I'm sorry that politicians have let you down, but I'm going to change that,\" Gallego says. Gallego\u00a0told CBS News' Robert Costa in December that some Democratic senators had been privately urging him to run against Sinema. \"There have been some senators that have encouraged me to run,\" Gallego said. \"There are some senators, some of Sen. Sinema's colleagues, that are encouraging me to run.\"\u00a0 Gallego did not identify the senators who prodded him to jump into the Senate race, but he believes those senators would \"absolutely\" support his Senate bid. Sinema has yet to announce whether she is going to run for reelection in 2024. Gallego, who is of Mexican and Colombian descent, currently chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus' BOLD PAC, an increasingly influential fundraising vehicle for Latino congressional Democrats. He has said he plans to pursue the support of young voters, progressive and Latino voters in the battleground state of Arizona. In his interview with Costa in December, Gallego said he thought his bid could help President Biden's own reelection prospects in the state. \"I will say this: If I was running for president in Arizona in 2024, I would want to be with someone that would be proud to be going on stage with him and going to every part of Arizona,\" Gallego said. \"More importantly, getting out the crucial Latino vote. Time will tell what the calculations are over there. I don't need to pressure them. They're certainly not pressuring me. But I know what a strong candidate I am and can be.\" But Gallego's bid comes with potential risks for Democrats, who are defending at least 23 seats in the 2024 cycle. Arizona's voters are almost evenly split three ways between Democrats, Republicans and independents and as 2022 election results prove, the Grand Canyon State's residents still narrowly favor moderate candidates. Gallego's more outspoken, strident views on issues like economics, immigration and health-care clash with Sinema's centrist approach that has earned praise from Republicans who say she's been a key moderating force in the evenly divided Senate.\u00a0 He and his wife, Sydney, live in Phoenix with their 6-year-old son and are expecting a daughter in July.

And this week on Face the Nation: the spring to-do list on Capitol Hill gets even longer, and the Republican Party struggle to define itself continues.  Congress scrambles to deal with rail safety and environmental concerns. Yet another Norfolk Southern train derailed yesterday in Ohio.  Plus, a key Democrat says he's had it when it comes to the nation's debt.  (Begin VT)  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (D-West Virginia): It can't be this total political division. It's not my fault. It's your fault. It's their fault.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk with West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin.  Then: The Republican race for the 2024 nomination is on, and key Republicans are picking sides. But the bigger question is, what exactly does the party stand for?  (Begin VT)  DONALD TRUMP (Former President of the United States): We had a Republican Party that was ruled by freaks, neocons...  (LAUGHTER)  FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: ... globalists, open border zealots, and fools.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: As more candidates consider jumping in, one is opting out.  (Begin VT)  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN (R-Maryland): It was a tough decision, but I have decided that I will not be a candidate for the Republican nomination for president. (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan tells our Robert Costa why he made that decision.  And we will talk to Illinois Democrat Governor J.B. Pritzker. He's being recruited to help President Biden's expected reelection campaign.  And was COVID-19 a result of a lab accident in Wuhan, China? New intelligence reports from the Department of Energy and FBI conflict with other agency reviews. Ohio Republican Brad Wenstrup is heading up a new committee investigating the origins of the virus. We will talk to him., Then former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb will help us sort through it all.  It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.  Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.  Saturday's Norfolk Southern derailment in Springfield, Ohio, was the fourth train derailment in Ohio in the last five months, including the one in East Palestine that spilled toxic chemicals. Norfolk Southern tells CBS News that no one was injured and no toxic substances were on board the train involved in yesterday's incident. The CEO of Norfolk Southern is expected to testify before a Senate panel on Thursday.  We want to begin the show with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who joins us from Charleston, West Virginia.  Good morning to you, Senator.  I want to start on that...  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Good morning, Brennan. Thank -- Margaret, thanks for having me.  (LAUGHTER)  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on that derailment.  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: The president last week praised bipartisan railway safety legislation that would have new rules for trains carrying hazardous materials, increased fines for safety violations, phase in newer cars. Will you vote for it? Is that sufficient? SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Yes, I'm going to be supporting that. We need to do it.  Back in 2015, in Mount Carbon in West Virginia, we had a derailment, 27 cars, tanker cars carrying Bakken oil. It went off the tracks and derailed and exploded and caused a tremendous problem there. And it was very, very dangerous. It could have been a little -- a lot worse, if it had been a little farther down the tracks, could have torn up a whole town.  But with that we were recommended that the electronic pneumatic brakes should be something -- should be considered that might prevent this, routine maintenance checks and auditing and things of this sort. I don't think any of that has been done.  And it's time for us to get serious about this. We're moving many, many products, many more products on the rails and on our roads than we ever did before. And we have a lot of people who don't want any pipelines. Pipelines would help alleviate a lot of this problem with the oil that we need in our country and we will be using for quite some time to do it safer.  But out of sight, out of mind. They are thinking, if you don't have a pipeline, you won't be using the product. Well, that's far from the truth. And this is the results of people just not making good decisions. And it's what's broken in -- in -- in West Virginia. And -- and...  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: ... broken across the country as far as in Washington, the politics.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want...  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: It's broken. It needs to be fixed.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want -- I want to come back to energy in a moment.  You're saying it's broken. You gave a pretty fiery speech a few days ago in the Senate. You're at odds with the White House and with many in your own party because you are saying that Democrats need to talk about out-of- control spending and are refusing to negotiate.  You did ding Republicans for not offering specific cuts. If you are the dealmaker -- you seem to be positioning yourself there -- where is it that you see room for negotiation?  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, Margaret, first of all, I encourage Speaker Kevin McCarthy.  I was hoping that he would, first of all, take things off the table that doesn't cause a conflict, but most -- most importantly, sit down with the president. And reached out to the White House. They did sit down, had a meeting. I'm encouraging much more of that. But what we can do is, can't we get together and just talk about how do we have this much debt accumulated this -- in this short of a period of time? Within 10 years, Margaret, we have accumulated the greatest amount of debt in the history of our country in the shortest period of time. Can't we at least find out what we did and how we expanded?  I know that COVID did so much of it. But, you know, we're past the COVID...  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: ... problems. And what we need to do is to get back to normal.  But we've gone from $3.5 trillion in spending to over $6.2 trillion in spending every year in the last 10 years. That's just unacceptable. You've got to sit down. Anybody that thinks we don't have a problem in Washington, anybody that thinks that the politics is not broken in Washington is not living in reality, does not want to face the facts and the truth.  MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.  So -- so, what is the truth here? Because Social Security and Medicare make up nearly 40 percent of spending in 2023. If no one is touching those programs, where are you finding the cuts?  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, first of all, just do our job on time.  We've been told that, if we just had a budget done -- we don't even have a budget anymore. The president is -- is a month late in putting his budget out, which will come out next week. But I don't see the House or the Senate bringing a budget forward. And, basically, by a piece of legislation was passed back in 1985, we're supposed to have our budgets...  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: ... from the House and the Senate done by April the 1st.  The president basically submits his in February, and, by September the 30th -- I'm told there's billions and billions of dollars of savings just right there if we just do it on time.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. But that's not...  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: We're not even doing that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: That -- right.  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: That's what I say it's, not working. That's... MARGARET BRENNAN: But that -- but...  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: But it gets a downward trajection, basically, and capping...  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but more has to be done...  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: How about capping some of the...  MARGARET BRENNAN: ... done than that. I mean, you know...  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Yes, capping some of the discretionary spending.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You -- OK.  Well, there's a lot to talk about right there. But I want to ask you, what is Joe...  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Hey, Mar...  MARGARET BRENNAN: What is Joe Manchin looking for in this deal? Are you looking for your permitting reform, for example, that Democrats didn't deliver on, though they had told you that you would have an agreement on?  Are you looking for that to be tucked into a potential bill in this agreement that you're saying has to be struck between Republicans and Democrats?  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, rather -- tucking something in, we're not trying to hide anything, basically.  If we don't do permitting, and we don't have permitting reform in America, we're not going to meet the challenges and be energy-independent energy- secured. If you're not energy-secured, you're definitely not going to be a superpower of the world, and depending on other parts of the world to provide what you won't do for yourself.  That has to be done. I don't care what side of the arena you're on, if you want transmission, if you want pipelines, if you realize we're going to have a balanced energy proposal. That's what the Inflation Reduction Act was for, energy security. The administration, this administration has touted that as strictly an environmental bill.  It's good for the environment, but it's also very, very necessary for us to have the fossil energy...  MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: ... using it better and cleaner than anywhere in the world to have the security we need. That's what we need to do. And that's what they've been avoiding. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: You have to have permitting. If not, all this is going to be voided.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what appears to be some separation between you and the president.  You were quoted a few days ago as saying: \"We're just in different ball games. We're not even in the same ballpark on many things.\"  Are you going to endorse Joe Biden if he runs for reelection?  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Oh, there's plenty of time for the election. This is the problem with America right now. We start an election every time there's a cycle coming up.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, he's the leader of your party.  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I -- I -- no, the bottom line is, let's see who's involved. Let's wait until we see who all the players are. Let's just wait until it all comes out.  My main purpose right now is to work for my country and my -- and my state. That's my responsibility. I'm not going to make my announcement for anything until the end of the year. I'm not going to make a decision what my political position is going to be or where I'm going to do for my political future.  I won't do it until the end of the year. I got too much work to do now.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Your political future, you mean the question of whether you personally are going to run for reelection in the Senate in West Virginia.  Your Republican governor, Jim Justice, says he's going to run for your seat, or he thinks he's got a good shot at it. Why haven't you made up your mind?  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: There's too -- the bottom line, I got plenty of time to make up my mind. The election is not until November 2024. We don't even file until January of 2024.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: And to be running and basically -- not basically looking at the problems you have, we've got a runaway debt. We got inflation that's killing people.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: We've got an unsecured energy. We have a border that's out of control.  You're telling me we're in the same ball game or the same ballpark? I don't think so.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You said let's see who all the players are when it comes to running for president.  You've said you're not running for president. Is that an open question, though? Who -- who do you think...  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I didn't say that. I didn't say anything about that.  I -- the bottom line is, I will make my political decision in December, whatever it may be.  MARGARET BRENNAN: To run for president?  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I'm not taking anything off the table, and I'm not put -- and I'm not putting anything on the table.  I said I will make a decision in January -- at this -- at the end of this year.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You'll make a decision at the end of this year as to...  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Simply that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: ... as to who you will endorse for president?  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: What my political future will be, what...  MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but for president.  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: What I will be involved with, how I will be involved.  I will be making -- any decisions I make politically will not be done until the end of the year. I'm focused on fixing what's wrong with Washington. And the politics are so toxic, the more you talk about this party, that party, what candidate and this candidate.  Look at what you have facing you right now. You've got inflation. You've got, basically, energy. You've got these unsecured borders. You've got geopolitical unrest. And we're talking about everything but that. MARGARET BRENNAN: We are -- we have a lot to talk about.  And, Senator Manchin, you're welcome back.  (LAUGHTER)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We got to leave it there, because...  SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I'm happy to come back, Margaret, any time.  (LAUGHTER)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Manchin was just talking about not wanting to talk about campaign 2024.  But we're going to do that. It is up and running, because front-runner former President Trump was in the Washington area yesterday speaking at a conservative political gathering, where he had some pretty tough talk about what would happen if he is not reelected.  Our Robert Costa spoke exclusively with former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan about why he is not jumping in.  (Begin VT)  ROBERT COSTA: You think by sitting out -- the field, maybe it's a little tighter?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: I hope so.  ROBERT COSTA: It's a little harder for Trump to get that nomination?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: I sure hope so.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob's here. We're going to be talking with him next. And you will hear more from that interview with Governor Hogan.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: So far, there are only three major Republican candidates in the 2024 campaign, but more than a dozen are still undecided. Our Robert Costa spoke to former Maryland Governor Larry Hogan on Friday.  And, Bob, he told you he's not running. Did he explain why?  ROBERT COSTA: He did.  The former Maryland governor said he felt conflicted as he made this decision. Let's hear what he had to say.  (Begin VT)  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: I was struggling, because my heart was telling me to run. My head was telling me, no, that just does not make sense for a whole host of reasons.  And my gut was flipping back and forth. So it really came down to, if I wasn't 100 percent convinced, then I shouldn't do it.  ROBERT COSTA: You were torn?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: I was torn.  ROBERT COSTA: Toughest decision of your political career?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: Absolutely, toughest decision I ever made.  ROBERT COSTA: Politically, by staying out of the race, it's a smaller field, may be tougher for Trump to get the nomination?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: I didn't want to have a pileup of a bunch of people fighting.  Right now, you have Trump and DeSantis at the top of the field soaking up all the oxygen, getting all the attention, and then a whole lot of the rest of us in single digits. And the more of them you have, the less chance you have for somebody rising up.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Bob, he doesn't see a path for himself. He worries about too many challengers carving a path, essentially, for the former president.  What else did he have to say about the campaign? ROBERT COSTA: Margaret, as you know, there is this lingering divide between traditional conservative Republicans and the Trump wing of the Republican Party.  The former governor said, as he looked at the race, he saw a narrow path for Republicans like himself as they look to 2024.  Let's hear what he had to say about that.  (Begin VT)  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: Well, there's no question it was -- it's challenging.  There's a big, big fight for the -- I would say the heart and soul of the Republican Party that I have been talking about for years. It's still going on. We're making progress, though. I mean, it went from about 90 percent of the Republican primary base was behind Trump, to about 60 percent after January 6, to it's down to about 30 percent now.  There are -- there's about two-thirds of the people in the Republican Party, while they might have supported Trump and Trump's policies, they really are ready to consider moving in a different direction.  ROBERT COSTA: But he's still leading the polls.  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: He's leading in the polls, and there's no question it's -- he's a formidable challenge.  But I think a year is an eternity in politics. And the first primaries are about a year away. So I think what it looks like today could be completely different than what it looks like a year from now.  ROBERT COSTA: You are a two-term governor, just left office. You've long been connected to the legacy of Ronald Reagan, conservative movement politics.  Is your decision to not run in 2024 in any way an acknowledgment that that party, that version of the Republican Party is fading or even gone?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: You know, I don't feel that way at all.  I think we certainly went off in the wrong direction. And we're not back on track. It's going to take a while. We're not there yet. I would say the party of Reagan is not dead, and neither is the party of Trump.  ROBERT COSTA: How serious is this moment for your party in terms of beating former President Trump? If he wins the White House again, what would that mean for American democracy? FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: Well, I'm -- I'm hopeful that it's not going to happen.  ROBERT COSTA: But what does it mean if it does?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: Then I think it's -- we're going to have to do some soul-searching. We're going to be digging out for a long time.  But, look, we've lost seven out of the last eight popular votes for -- in the presidential race. And we've lost -- we've had three horrible election cycles, where we should have done -- had a huge pickup in the last election, and we didn't. We lost, before that, the Senate, the House, and the White House.  We've got to start getting back to a party that -- that people will vote for, or we don't get to govern.  ROBERT COSTA: When you look at your effort to try to get the Republican Party to come back to its conservative roots, you're facing a lot of obstacles.  There's a big battle over what the truth is. And the recent Dominion lawsuit against the FOX News, the FOX Corporation is one example of how there's a real battle over whether election fraud happened or not. All these false claims of fraud are out there right now in the political discussion, especially on the right.  What's your response to the Dominion lawsuit against FOX News? And what does it reveal about the Republican Party and perhaps FOX News?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: Well, I don't know all the details of the Dominion lawsuit, but I'm certainly following the controversy.  And it's not -- it doesn't come as a surprise, because, for years, we've had people who, you know, I would hear from, elected officials, and leaders of the party, and people in Congress, or fellow governors, or people in conservative media that would say privately, something -- I was always telling the truth.  And I was sometimes criticized for it. But I always stood up and said exactly what I thought. People would say to me: \"Oh, I agree with what you're saying. But I can't say it.\"  Or they would -- they would be -- you know, they would know the truth, but say something different just to win votes. And I think that's part of the problem. And I think we've got to get back to truth-telling. And we've got to stop the conspiracy theories. It's why we lost all the elections in-- in this last race. I mean, the people that were spouting election lies and that were saying that nothing happened on January 6 or that the -- the pandemic was -- was fake, the virus didn't happen, they all lost. And the people who actually won were the commonsense conservative Republicans like me who were actually able to win swing votes and that were talking about issues like the economy, like crime and education. They were focused on things people cared about.  We can't keep looking backward and we can't keep denying facts.  ROBERT COSTA: Is Governor DeSantis somebody you could see yourself supporting as the non-Trump candidate in your party?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: Well, look, the people of Florida just overwhelmingly elected Ron DeSantis. I have said earlier that I think governors is -- are a good training ground to become president.  We have a lot of great governors to consider. I -- maybe Ron DeSantis and I have different styles, but, certainly, he's -- he's got every right to get out there and make the case.  ROBERT COSTA: Where do you stand on Governor DeSantis's effort to counter Disney and its self-governing zone in Florida?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: The controversy, to me, was about telling a business that, if you don't agree with me, I'm going to put you out of business or take it over.  And I'm a -- I'm a traditional kind of small-government conservative Republican who doesn't believe in heavy-handed local governments telling businesses what to do. So we come at it from a different perspective. It's not about the -- the -- the issues themselves that they were fighting over, but how -- how it's being handled, I would disagree with.  ROBERT COSTA: He's talking about his battles with what he calls woke culture.  What does the DeSantis approach tell you about his politics?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: Well, I think he's going right after the Trump base, and he wants to be, I think, the younger version of Donald Trump.  And, you know, he's trying to fire up the base, which is OK. And it may be a good strategy to win a primary, but my point was, you -- you have to actually focus on winning swing voters as well, or we'll have Joe Biden as president, and that's not what we need.  ROBERT COSTA: How rough could it get, DeSantis vs. Trump?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: Could get rough. You know, time will tell. It's going to be very interesting. Joe Biden is not the guy who should be the next president. And I think most people would agree. But you can't beat somebody with nobody. We have to come up with the best candidate.  ROBERT COSTA: You've been friendly with former Vice President Mike Pence. Someone you could support?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: Yes, absolutely. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Mike Pence. And I thought he certainly is the kind of guy -- he's full of integrity and experience.  ROBERT COSTA: And if another potential contender is listening to you today, what do you hope they hear from this decision, from your move?  FORMER GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN: I love competition, and I hate coronations.  My advice would be, don't run just because you want to get your name known, or you want to be on TV, or you want to write a book, or get a TV deal, or because you want to be a Cabinet secretary. You should only run if you believe that you're capable and qualified and that you have a real chance to be the -- not only the nominee, but the next president.  (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: When we come back, we will hear from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.  Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker of Illinois.  Good morning to you, Governor.  GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER (D-Illinois): Good morning, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I have a lot to get to with you, but I want to get something out of the way.  \"The New York Times\" has a big feature on you, calling you the Democrats' SOS candidate, saying you're keeping your options open for a presidential run in 2024 in case Biden doesn't run.  Is that true? GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: No, I'm supporting Joe Biden. He's running for reelection, and he's going to get reelected.  I'm just happy that people think of me in that way. That's certainly very flattering. But I intend to serve out my term as governor of Illinois.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you are, according to CBS reporting, potentially serving on an advisory board to the president if he does run for reelection.  You might have heard Joe Manchin, who just told us that it was kind of an open question as to who would be running. He said: \"Let's see who all the players are.\"  He didn't endorse the president. Does that surprise you?  GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, I'm sorry to hear that.  It does surprise me a bit. I will say that Joe Biden has an awful lot that he gets to run on here. He's gotten a tremendous amount done for the country, saved literally hundreds of thousands of lives by making sure that vaccines were distributed. He passed legislation in a bipartisan fashion.  We got the IRA, which is going to help us fight climate change, infrastructure, which is helping everybody across the country, the CHIPS and Science ACT, which is going to help us bring manufacturing back to the United States, and what is Joe Biden's superpower, and that is, he demonstrates empathy in everything that he does. He truly cares about the American people.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you think he needs to make it official and say he's running, so that there isn't more speculation or people considering other options?  GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: I don't think there's anybody that's serious that's actually considering running against Joe Biden, because he's done such a great job.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you.  On the issue set that Democrats are running on, your office told -- told us you're very focused on school board races in Illinois to make sure extreme right-wing candidates aren't dominating them. I'm wondering how strong the Republican ground operation is on things like school boards.  Is parents' rights really something you think Democrats need to be concerned about on a national scale?  GOVERNOR J.B. PRITZKER: Well, what Republicans are trying to do is, of course, ban books in libraries. They're trying to keep our schools from teaching black history. They make up things about CRT in schools that just don't exist. And so they have got a lot of extreme right-wing candidates, frankly, on the crazy end of things that are running. And we just want to make sure that people know who they are and know not to vote for them.  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Governor, there's a lot I want to get to with you on the other side of this commercial break, so please stay with us.  And we will be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.  Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.  We want to continue our conversation now with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.  Governor, thank you for staying with us through the break.  I want to follow up on something you said right before we took that break. You said you want to make sure people know who they are and not to vote for them. You were talking about Republicans you said trying to do things like ban teaching black history, ban books, and ban CRT. Are you talking about people in Illinois? Who are you talking about? Where is that happening?  GOV. J.B. PRITZKER (D-IL): Well, you asked - you asked me about schoolboards.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  J.B. PRITZKER: And I'm telling you we've got people running at the local level who believe that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Got you.  J.B. PRITZKER: But, of course, the Republicans are carrying this as a national message. And, honestly, it's something that's offensive to most Americans. This idea of banning black history. It's important for people to understand the history of slavery in the United States, you know, and our - - our entire U.S. history, warts and all. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.  In Florida, where I think you're gesturing to, they are not banning black history. It was specifically that AP college course. That's what you're referring to there? That version of it?  J.B. PRITZKER: Well, when they're trying to dive in and take over an AP history exam and edit it and edit out parts that they don't like, that's banning history. That's what they're doing in Florida. That's what Ron DeSantis is doing.  MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. A potential 2024 candidate.  I want to ask you about the issue of abortion because I know you are one of 20 Democratic governors very much deeply involved in trying to build a firewall here against restrictions.  There's a Texas judge who may soon decide a case that could revoke the approval of the abortion pill, which is the most common kind of abortion in this country. If there is a ruling to restrict it, how will governors respond? What will you do?  J.B. PRITZKER: Well, in Illinois, we protect the other abortion drugs that are available. And we protect women's right to express their reproductive freedom. And so we're helping our clinics in Illinois. We're making sure that all the refugees from the states around us that have banned abortion know that there's an oasis here in the Midwest, here in the state of Illinois, to protect their health and their reproductive rights.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Walgreens is an Illinois-based pharmacy. I know you called in their CEO, Ros Brewer, for a meeting on Friday. They had announced they won't sell abortion pills in states in which Republican attorneys general have threatened legal action. Can you get them to change the policy and that -- they're still waiting, I guess, on certification to sell the pill in Illinois itself. Can you get them approval?  J.B. PRITZKER: Well, that's something that happens at the federal level, but I offered to them to work with the federal government to try to speed up the process of certification. They want to certify it in Illinois and they want to be able to sell it here. So, we're going to help in any way that they ask us to.  But, look, on a broader scale, we should just recognize that these pharmacies need to protect women's health. That is the business that they should be in. And so in states where it's legal to have an abortion and legal to sell an abortion pill, they should still be doing it. And I've told them that. We need to make sure that the other pharmacies do the same.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll be following that. I want to ask you as well about crime as an issue for Democrats. In the city of Chicago, the mayor, Lori Lightfoot, just failed to make the runoff in the Democratic primary. She was challenged by a former school CEO backed by a police union and the Cook County commissioner, who was endorsed by the Chicago Teacher's Union.  So, I'm wondering what the takeaway message is here for Democrats? Is it, don't take on the teacher unions, as she did, or is it to focus more on violent crime?  J.B. PRITZKER: Well, it was a messy primary. There's no doubt about it. Nine candidates, nobody got 50 percent, or anywhere near 50 percent. So, we have a runoff coming up.  I think that these two candidates have to make sure that their messages are clear, what they're going to do to protect health care, what they're going to do to address crime. Frankly, they have not been specific on a lot of these issues. And I'm asking them to be.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you very much for your time today.  J.B. PRITZKER: Thanks, Margaret.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Ohio Congressman Brad Wenstrup, who chairs the select subcommittee on the coronavirus pandemic.  Doctor, welcome to the program.  REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R-OH): Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: There are 18 different intelligence agencies in this country, no consensus on Covid's origins. Two intel agencies undecided, four say it was natural transmission and then last week we learned that the Energy Department has joined the FBI in saying the virus likely spread through a mishap at a Chinese lab.  Is all of the evidence circumstantial? Have you seen the intelligence?  BRAD WENSTRUP: I've seen quite a bit of intelligence, as you might imagine, sitting on the Intelligence Committee. We haven't seen all that we want to see necessarily. And some of it is very classified that I have seen. And so we have to continue driving forward and getting questions answered because the more we find, the more questions that we may have.  So, you do have a variety of opinions. And, really, what we are trying to do is to follow the breadcrumbs, if you will, look at the forensics of what took place. Obviously, this is one of the more serious things that has ever happened to mankind. And so it is important to find the origins of Covid.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect the FBI and the Energy Department to testify to your committee? BRAD WENSTRUP: That -- there may come a time for that. I would hope that they do it willingly.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, if this was indeed the result of a lab leak, what is Congress doing to prevent this from ever happening again?  BRAD WENSTRUP: I'm hoping, at the end of the day with the subcommittee, that we have a bipartisan product that can really help us with our readiness going into the future. I keep using a variety of terms that we want to be able to predict a pandemic, we want to prepare for a pandemic, we want to protect ourselves from a pandemic, and hopefully prevent a pandemic. And that should be our goal. And we're going to have to work with a lot of scientists and specialists to be able to do that. But we have to get to the truth of what actually happened in this pandemic.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, in terms of the specifics, I know the White House is said to be considering recommendations from the National Science Advisory Board For Biosecurity to put oversight on gain of function experiments. Those are the things that I guess genetically alter a virus to enhance its functions and maybe make it more deadly. This was allegedly what was happening at this lab in Wuhan.  Would you want this kind of regulation, and does that come from the White House or does that come from Congress?  BRAD WENSTRUP: Well, it may be a combination of both at the end of the day. And I think it is important that we do that.  Look, if we were taking taxpayer dollars to fund research, not only in the United States but in China, concerning this type of methodology, the creation of a chimera, or it's called gain of function research, where you can take two viruses and put them into one, I don't see a whole lot of commercial use for that necessarily. So, it's something that if it's going to take place, it certainly should have oversight or should have had oversight.  In 2015, Ralph Baric of North Carolina, along with Dr. Zhengli Shi in China, published their article about the ability to create these chimeras. And they did that. So, we know that this technology exists.  My real question is, why are we doing this with an adversary like China? And we have to look into what the reasoning was for that, and what actually took place, where the money went, and why did it go there?  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I know that there has been a lot of focus on Dr. Fauci, who has since retired from NIH. And I wonder if you think that is misplaced to personalize the scrutiny so much when the intelligence agencies are all so divided. I mean can you reasonably probe this question, in a bipartisan way, without villainizing people? BRAD WENSTRUP: Well, I think that's the goal. I mean, I just want to get to facts. And when I was asked to chair this select subcommittee, one of the first things I did was call Dr. Raul Ruiz, Democrat from California, emergency physician. As physicians, we have worked on many bills together and we get along very well. We may disagree on a lot of other policies, but we work very well together, especially when it comes to health.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I think a lot of people would welcome just sticking to the facts, which is why I want to ask you about the membership on your committee, because you have Marjorie Taylor Greene on it. She's shared misleading information about deaths and Covid vaccines. She compared vaccines to Nazis forcing Jews to wear gold stars. Dr. Ronny Jackson, who said masks never worked. He called the omicron variant the midterm election variant.  How do people take your committee work seriously with members like this on it?  BRAD WENSTRUP: Well, I think we have a lot of serious members that -- on both sides of the aisle that are just after the truth. I think that they come from a variety of backgrounds.  Look, there were things that were said, hey, this is a conspiracy theory, stop this conspiracy theory that it may have come from the lab. Well, now you have agencies that are coming forward and saying that we do think it came from the lab.  Look, we have to conduct ourselves in a way that is professional, and I hope that we will. I can't control everybody.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  BRAD WENSTRUP: And that goes on both sides of the aisle. Dr. Ruiz can't either.  But, at the same time, what I'm seeing from all the members is that they have backgrounds of severe interests, significant interests. They either owned a business, they're health care providers, they're concerned about the adverse events that may come from the vaccine. These are legitimate things for Americans to be concerned about.  MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.  BRAD WENSTRUP: And through this process, I think we took doctors out of the equation all too often and left it up to non-physicians to tell America how to treat themselves.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You're from Ohio, so I want to make sure I ask you about what was a second train derailment from Norfolk Southern in your state yesterday on top of this toxic one. President Biden has praised some of the bipartisan legislation in the Senate that would up railway safety. Do you see a need for this kind of legislation right now?  BRAD WENSTRUP: Well, certainly. And any after action review or review of something that happened, if we see that there's some gaps in our safety, then we should take a look at that. Let's not put things out there that aren't necessarily facts and say that there was a safety issue if it wasn't. But, at the same time, you do want to address these issues. Look, we're always trying to do better. I hope that we can. And the other thing that I would like to see come out of all this, especially with the one where there was such a chemical, toxic reaction with the fires that were started from the derailment is, do we have a standard operating procedure of how we manage a community, what our reaction is from the government, what are we looking for, how do we protect our people? Let's make sure that we have a good standard operating procedure so although these instances are rare, according to the numbers, we have to be prepared for that 0.1 percent or whatever the case may be.  MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Dr. Wenstrup, we'll be watching the hearing this week. Thanks for your time.  We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are back now with former FDA commissioner, and Pfizer board member, Dr. Scott Gottlieb.  Good morning. Welcome back. Good to see you.  DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner): Good morning.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Gottlieb, I wanted you to sort of give us some context here, because I know you've said in the past on this program that we will likely never know the origin of Covid-19, short of finding the exact animal that carried the virus or a smoking gun proving that it accidentally leaked out of the lab. You said both theories were plausible.  Has anything changed that makes you more certain now?  SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think that there's enough information in the public domain to create a presumption that this could have come out of a lab, maybe a strong presumption. We have seen some incremental reporting. There's classified information that hasn't been made public. You heard the congressman even refer to classified information that even Congress hasn't seen in this instance. And I think based on that premise, that there's, you know, a likelihood that this came out of a lab, we may never be able to prove it with certainty, we should start behaving like it did come out of a lab and start taking the steps to make sure that that couldn't happen again. There's a lot of things that happened around the labs in China, particularly the lab in Wuhan, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, that created sloppy conditions. They were doing high-risk research in low level - low security labs. They were doing risky research. You heard the congressman talk about the gain of function research that was going on in that lab. We know the Chinese military was operating in that lab simultaneously. So, we need to look at all those things. I would be focusing on the activities in and around that lab and deriving from that what steps we need to take going toward to make sure that we get better security around high risk research that if this did come out of a lab, it's not going to happen again.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we've talked on this program to Matt Pottinger who served in the Trump administration, who said intelligence needs to be a more robust part of pandemic protection. And I know you agree with that.  You know, there was a piece in \"The New York Times\" by David Wallace Wells, an opinion piece called \"We've Been Talking about the Lab Leak Theory All Wrong.\" And the argument is that, lean into the lab theory and just look at how to prevent lab leaks. He's calling for things like a national registration on research based on risks and benefits, new safety standards, global governance to go with this as well.  Why doesn't that exist, and why isn't that being created?  SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yes, I think it should be. I mean we're three years into this. There is some recommendations that are on the president's desk. I think we need to start getting serious and looking at what steps need to be put in place.  You know, we're still stuck on the debate about whether it was or wasn't a lab leak. I don't think we're going to prove that. I think we should work on the assumption that there's a probability that it was a lab leak and start putting in place the kinds of protections that we need.  The congressman talked about gain of function research. He made the point that there isn't a real commercial prerogative of doing that kind of research. I agree with him. We ought to look at whether we outlaw that kind of research. And certainly, if it's going to take place, conduct it and be a cell-4 (ph) labs, high security labs under very strict conditions where we know what's going on and don't outsource it to labs in China. Sometimes the highest risk experiments get outsourced to the worst labs around the world because they're the ones willing to do those experiments. And so if we're going to do high risk research because we think it's important from a national security standpoint, and that's the only context in which this would make sense. There really isn't a commercial context in which this would make sense. We need to get better control over it.  And to Matt's point, Matt Pottinger's point, we need to get the intelligence agencies engaged in this as a national security - as a part of their national security mission and look at public health preparedness through a national security lens. I think we're doing that now, but we need to be very explicit about that. And that does mean also surveillance around some of the high risk activities that can create these kinds of risks.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So - but that's the White House and that's the intelligence agencies, rather than a congressional mandate? SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, Congress certainly has a role here. I think that Congress could start coming up with a list of recommendations to the administration. The administration has recommendations from independent bodies.  Ultimately, this is going to be federal rules that get imposed on research that gets funded by the federal government, as well as what we try to do through international conventions, working with the WHO and the World Health Assembly to try to get international agreements in place and what countries are and aren't going to be willing to do.  Now, you can't prevent rogue regimes from doing this kind of research. That's where the intelligence agencies come in to do monitoring to see if rogue regimes are doing high-risk research that create conditions for a lab leak, either inadvertently or deliberately.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Biden administration has called on China to release more information. And they have not delivered it. Dr. Fauci talked about that in November on this program.  I also want to ask you about what we just learned about President Biden's health. He had this skin cancer diagnosis, a basal cell carcinoma lesion removed. Given his age, is there any reason to worry more about it?  SCOTT GOTTLIEB: There's no reason to be concerned about this particular lesion. This is a slow growing cancer, usually confined to the surface of the skin that can be completely excised with a small surgical procedure. It sounds like the president had this fully removed. It shouldn't reoccur. It typically doesn't spread. These kinds of lesions typically occur in regions of the body that are exposed to sun. It is related to exposure to UV light. And so typically you see it on the neck or the face. Just for awareness, it's not like a melanoma where it appears as a very dark, irregular lesion. Typically it will appear as a sort of a clear and waxy kind of lesion, maybe scaly. So, it has a different kind of appearance. But the president should be fully cured of this through a small surgical procedure to remove it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Gottlieb, always good talk to you.  We'll be right back with a look at the anniversary of a major milestone in the civil rights movement.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden will travel to Selma, Alabama, later today to commemorate the 58th anniversary of bloody Sunday, a landmark event for the civil rights movement and for the late Congressman John Lewis. In 2015, our Bob Schieffer visited Selma with John Lewis and crossed the legendary Edmund Pettus Bridge.  (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BOB SCHIEFFER: This week marks 50 years since the shooting of Jimmy Lee Jackson, whose death at the hands of a highway patrolman, at a peaceful protest, inspired one of the iconic events of the civil rights movement, the Selma, Alabama, march.  BOB SCHIEFFER (voice over): Movement leaders had chosen Selma as the place to dramatize the demand for the right to vote. After Jackson's death, a 54- mile march from Selma to Montgomery was planned. Fiery young activist John Lewis was one of the leaders.  JOHN LEWIS: We are marching to our state capital to dramatize to our nation and to the world our determination to win first-class citizenship.  BOB SCHIEFFER: But the march was not to be. The protesters ran into trouble soon after they started as they tried to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge.  I had never been to Selma, but with the anniversary of that march looming, I went there yesterday and walked across that bridge with now Congressman John Lewis, and asked him what was going through his mind on that fateful day.  JOHN LEWIS: We were marching in twos in an orderly, peaceful, non-violent fashion, on our way to Montgomery, to dramatize to the nation that people wanted to register to vote. I really thought we would be arrested and jailed that day.  BOB SCHIEFFER (on camera): When did you realize when you got to the high point here, that's when you saw all of the law enforcement people down there?  JOHN LEWIS: We saw down below the state troopers and behind the state troopers, and the sheriff's posy on horseback.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You have to disperse.  JOHN LEWIS: We got to the bottom of the bridge.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: See that they turn around and disperse.  JOHN LEWIS: And they came toward us, beating us with night sticks, using tear gas and trammeling us with horses.  BOB SCHIEFFER: You were right in the front and -  JOHN LEWIS: I was in the very front.  BOB SCHIEFFER: So, you were among the first that was hit? JOHN LEWIS: I was the first person to be hit. And I still have the scar on my forehead. I was - I was knocked down. My legs just went out from under me. I thought I was going to die on this bridge. I said to myself, this is the last protest for me.  BOB SCHIEFFER: What happened? Do you remember anything after that?  JOHN LEWIS: I remember being back at the church. I don't even recall how I got back to the church. But apparently someone carried me back. And I guess I become conscience. And someone asked me to say something to the audience, and I stood up and said, I don't understand it, how President Johnson can send troops to Vietnam and cannot send troops to Selma, Alabama, to protect people whose only desire is to register to vote.  BOB SCHIEFFER: And then, in a matter of weeks, of course, he did send the troops and you were able to make that march to Selma.  LYNDON JOHNSON, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT (March 15, 1965): There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma. Their cause must be our cause too.  JOHN LEWIS: And two weeks later, after President Johnson delivered that speech, we did make the march all the way from Selma to Montgomery. It was a sea of humanity marching on this highway.  BOB SCHIEFFER: And you did have people protecting you then all the way.  JOHN LEWIS: All the way, people inspecting the bridges along the way, guarding the camps at night. It was - it was our military, it was our military at its best.  BOB SCHIEFFER: You know, Congressman, a lot of people who were not there, who didn't know how it was, they don't know how different it is now.  JOHN LEWIS: Well, it is -- it's a different - it's a different world. Back in 1965, only 2.1 percent of black of voting age were registered to vote in this county. You had to go down to the county courthouse. It was the only place you could attempt to register on the first and third Mondays of each month. You had to pass a so-called literary test. There were people to asked to count the number of bubbles in a bar of soap, the number of jelly beans in a jar. People stood in unmoving lines.  BOB SCHIEFFER: So, things are better, but not as good as they ought to be, I guess is the way I would say it.  JOHN LEWIS: Things are much better, but we're not there yet. We still have problems and we'll make it. We will get there. Selma was a turning point.  (END VIDEOTAPE) MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS) ",

It's a real honor to have you on the show. CATHERINE ASHTON: Thank you, Michael.  MICHAEL MORELL: So, Cathy, you just published a new book - your memoir from your time as the EU's foreign policy chief. It's titled, \"And then what? Inside Stories of 21st Century Diplomacy.\" So congratulations. It's fantastic.  CATHERINE ASHTON: Thank you. That's very kind.  MICHAEL MORELL: Cathy, because of the way we tape these episodes here at Intelligence Matters, you didn't get a chance to hear me introduce you. But in doing so, I provided your title: The Right Honourable Baroness, Catherine Ashton. And I must say that we've never had a Baroness before on Intelligence Matters. So it's a super treat for us from that perspective. So thank you.  CATHERINE ASHTON: Well, that's first rate. It's just me. So that's okay.  MICHAEL MORELL: And in fact, the reason I wanted to mention it is because it contrasts so much with who you are and who you come across as in the book. You know, in the book, you're Cathy Ashton; in the book, you're down to earth. In the book, you're a person of deep humility. You're a person who is is candid in a way that I think is unusual for any senior official, including former senior officials. So I just wanted to say that because you really are Cathy Ashton. And I think it's important for everybody to know.   Here's an example of your candor. You write in the book that, 'I have often been asked in the ensuing years whether I enjoyed my time as being the first representative for foreign and security policy, the first vice president of the Commission.' And the answer you give when you're asked that question is, 'No,' which is incredibly honest. And I wanted to ask you why you say no.  CATHERINE ASHTON: It's a good question, I think, because I was trying to make clear that when these jobs are undertaken by people like me or anyone, there's an expectation that somehow there must be some sort of great glamour or excitement about it. But the truth is that they are relentless. They are crucial. They are jobs that require you to put aside all of the things about the kind of life that you might want to have and really focus on what it is you're trying to do.   And for me, that meant that I was constantly aware that there was a limit to what I could do, that maybe there were people who could have done more and done better than I, was being confronted with some of the most tremendous human dilemmas of people gointhrough real suffering. And you're simply there to try and help. And that on a kind of weekly, monthly, yearly basis means that you are constantly aware of being given the privilege of trying to help and assist. But there's nothing about it that makes you think to yourself, 'Well, this is an enjoyable kind of role.'   It doesn't mean there weren't great moments of humor and laughter and that I met some extraordinary, wonderful people and that I saw beautiful things in the course of my travels. It's not that. It's simply that it's not and shouldn't be, in a way, a job that you should enjoy in the traditional sense.  MICHAEL MORELL: You used the word relentless, which I think is kind of exactly the way I felt when I spent seven years on the CIA seventh floor. And it's never-ending, right? Even when you're home, it's never-ending. You know, even when you're in a conversation with a family member, your mind, you know, is often someplace else. So that relentlessness, you know, really resonates with me.  CATHERINE ASHTON: Absolutely. But then you remember, too, that, you know, you're tired a lot of the time. You're constantly waiting for the next phone call or text message. You're constantly aware that you've got an agenda in front of you that's huge, that you've got an enormous amount of travel to do. You've got a lot of issues to resolve, a lot of meetings, to travel, a lot of people to talk to, a lot of what to do. So you're tired and you're concentrating, and there's never a moment when that goes away. And it is, as I say, relentless.  MICHAEL MORELL:  Cathy, you did something else that was really interesting and I think unique. When I wrote my book, I really struggled actually remembering things, right? I would write something down and then I would show it to friends and they would say, 'Well, that's not the way it happened. Remember, here's the way it's happened.'   But you did something interesting. You had conversations with your husband throughout and he would jot down what you told him, which must have made it a lot easier for you to reconstruct the narrative of those many important moments that you had.  CATHERINE ASHTON: Well, the credit really is his, Michael, because he taped me. Well, what happened? He's a journalist by background and he said to me, 'You'll never keep a diary. You'll never have time to write anything.' So when I would come back after a week or two of work on the Iran talks or Serbia Kosovo, whatever I was doing, he would simply sit you down with the cup of coffee and he would explore beyond what I describe as the outline of the meeting.   The outline of the meeting is what you read in the press report, if you like. But it's a coloring of the outline. It's the, 'What did it feel like? What did they say? How did you feel? What did you think?' that gives you the picture in the story. And so when I finished in office, he handed me the tape and said, 'Over to you,' and I, over time, transcribed them and discovered a lot of things, as you rightly point out, that I had long forgotten. And it brought back those memories, but also that sense of what we were trying to do. And I stuck to that in the story. So I haven't tried to use, hindsight being the perfect vision, what happened later, what I learned later. I've tried to tell the story as it was at the time for me. So these are my stories are not historical documents in the traditional sense. They're simply what it was like for me to be part of these particular crises or issues at that time.  MICHAEL MORELL: When you left the job, did you know you wanted to write a book or did that come later?  CATHERINE ASHTON: It came later, really. When I left the job, I wanted to sleep and I wanted to --   MICHAEL MORELL:  I know how that feels.  CATHERINE ASHTON: I wanted to have time to do the things that I'd really missed. Just seeing friends, going to the theater, you know, did things that you do. But you no longer have to kind of keep the phone switched on or worry that you're in the wrong place at the wrong time. All of those and of course, go on holiday.   But as time went by, people asked me to tell the stories because they were intrigued and interested. What was it like to meet these people? How did it feel to be involved in these particular things that were going on? And as I told the stories, people would say to me, you know, you should write a book. You should write these. And eventually I realized that none of the problems or issues that I described in the book had really been resolved. And so it seemed right to say a little bit about what I'd learned. And to describe the beginning of some of these crises, but also what it was like to try and do something to alleviate them, if not to resolve them.  MICHAEL MORELL: So, Cathy, I want to get to the tough issues that you had to deal with. But I want to ask you, before we do that, I want to ask you a couple of questions about a particular paragraph in the introduction of the book that really grabbed my attention. And let me read a few sentences from that paragraph and get you to provide an example of two of who you were thinking about when you wrote those sentences.   So the first one is, \"Sometimes I was frustrated by leaders who simply preferred to do nothing, passing the problem on to their successors or ignoring it altogether.\" Who were you thinking about?  CATHERINE ASHTON: A range of different people, but especially in places like the Western Balkans, where it was easy to not argue when you said, 'For goodness' sake, you know, we need to move forward, you need to do more,' and would do nothing about it. There were a number of countries that I visited where that was a very common response.   And it was sometimes because the process of becoming a leader. And it kind of exhausted all of the energy. And the new leader in place of the leader who had been there for a while was determined to remain there that the idea of doing anything might topple them or might make them less secure. Because one thing that is very clear is that leaders who do brave things often find that they're not appreciated for what they've done at that time; they're making compromises with enemies, that they're trying to do things that would be seen in a very negative way by large parts of their population because it's hard to explain what they're doing. And in the end, 'Isn't it better to do nothing?' is what they would think. So the example that springs to mind always when I described this of the opposite were what the leaders of Kosovo and Serbia were prepared to do, both of them knowing that it would affect the view of the people had of them, affect their popularity potentially, and it could in some cases affect their ability to lead in the future. So it's a common problem.   But see, for me, I felt that if you were given the privilege of leading your country, then the responsibility is on you to do things, is on you to make life better for the people that you serve. So I would get really frustrated by that.  MICHAEL MORELL: And it's on you to take the risks associated with accomplishing what you've been given the job to accomplish. I mean, it's pretty straightforward, actually.   CATHERINE ASHTON: Absolutely.  MICHAEL MORELL: Here's another sentence, Cathy. \"Some were the creators of chaos, prepared to put personal gain ahead of any interests in lessening the plight of their people.\" Who were you thinking about?  CATHERINE ASHTON: There wasn't any one specific that comes to mind when I write that, because in the course of my time in office I met more or less every leader across the world and at any given time, there were people that you met who, when confronted with problems, would think about themselves, would be prepared to see their country suffer as long as they okay, as long as they and their family were getting richer, they were okay.   So you came across the willingness of people to think that becoming the leader put them in a different place. They were no longer beholden to the people who took them there, and therefore they could afford that risk. I remember saying to President Morsi, Mohammed Morsi in Egypt before he was removed, 'It's not enough to be elected. It's what you do with it that matters.'   In other words, you can't just get the job and then kind of go on holiday for a few days. It's what you do once you you've been elected, not the actual fact of election, that determines whether you are a leader or not. And I think that's an important message for all leaders that actually they're given the chance to do something for their people and that's what they should do.  MICHAEL MORELL: When I read that sentence, I thought you were thinking of somebody like Bashar al Assad or Moammar Gadhafi or even, you know, Vladimir Putin. CATHERINE ASHTON: All of them would fit that mold, of course, and fit those words.  MICHAEL MORELL: Cathy, I'd love for you to take us inside three of the issues with which you had to deal, and you devote an entire chapter to each of these. The first one, I think, is the one that our listeners are going to be most familiar with. It's the P5+1s negotiations with the Iranians that eventually led to the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Program of Action, which is commonly referred to as the nuclear deal.   And I really want to ask you first, I want to ask you two questions. And the first is, were there things that you did not fully understand about the Iranian mindset about this issue at the start of the negotiations that you came to understand over the course of the talks, as you spent so much time with them?  CATHERINE ASHTON: Right. So the first thing that I always think when you're negotiating \u2013 and this is what I tell people when they ask me about negotiation - is that you have to try and understand the people who are sitting across the table. It doesn't matter whether it's a business negotiation or an international negotiation or whatever it is; not in order to cross the line and become that or take on that viewpoint, but simply, if you don't understand what drives them, what what history and what culture of, then it's more difficult to reach any conclusions.   So for me, learning about Iran and about the Iranian teams that I dealt with was really important. I was not particularly familiar with Iran when I started this, and so it was important to get to know them. And it's why I and both the Ahmadinejad and Rouhani presidencies I worked with on the issue would always begin the discussions with dinner with the chief negotiator the night before. And that was a sort of what I call a warming up period where you get a chance to talk on other things and have a chance to get to know each other.   So without question, to answer what you asked me, by the time I got to spend so much of the week or the months with them, I understood better who they were, what they thought, what concerns, and in a sense, the issues that they dealt with from that perspective. In other words, that the other side views you differently to the way you view yourself. Of course, it's an obvious point. But understanding that that's the case is quite different to kind of thinking, I guess, the case. So knowing what they see and what they're looking for, what they're expecting, it's important. And that for sure, I learned in the course of those negotiations.  MICHAEL MORELL: Would you say that the number one driver for them, the number one issue on their mind, was their own security? Or is there something else?  CATHERINE ASHTON: Well, when we were negotiating with President Rouhani's regime,     which is when Foreign Minister Zarif was leading for the Iran team, the thing that struck me most was that this government had come in on the promise of resolving some of the economic challenges that Iran had and that that was impossible unless you could do something about sanctions and unless you could open up the economy.   And so the motivation, in a sense, to get on with the agreement was, in my view, anyway, at least in part because of the need to fulfill the promise of the economy. There was a question I think that was always in our mind was, Did the Iranians believe that they were more secure or less secure with a nuclear weapon? Now, in my view, there's no question that security in the region does not include Iran having a nuclear weapon. But it was, I think, more obvious to me that, having been the negotiator himself a decade before, he understood that it was much better for Iran not to have a nuclear weapon and I don't think wanted a nuclear weapon. And so this was about a negotiation that was to ensure that we could be confident of that situation if it were the case, and that in return for that confidence, their economy could improve.  MICHAEL MORELL: So, Cathy, the second question that I want to ask you about Iran is, as you know better than anybody, a successful negotiation requires give and take. And I've never asked anybody involved in the negotiations this question. But what were some of the things the Iranians wanted that they did not get? And what were some of the things that the West wanted, the P5+1wanted that we did not get? I don't know if anybody's asked you that before.  CATHERINE ASHTON: No, not so much in those terms because the \u2013 so the Iran deal is like a jigsaw puzzle. Any deal is. But when you look at it, you should be able to see no spaces between the pieces and be absolutely clear what the pictures telling you. So, you know, it's a picture of a kitten with a ball. Whatever it is, doesn't matter what shape and size the pieces are. And the most important thing about the negotiation was that we should have absolute clarity that we could say to people, 'Look at this picture.' What you will see is that we have created an agreement that gives confidence in the purely peaceful nature of the nuclear program, to quote the wording that we were given, if you like, you know, kind of what we were told we had to do and the shape and size of each individual piece have the ability to vary depending on what happened.   You could have a bigger piece here, which meant you needed a small piece somewhere else. And so it wasn't so much there were things that we didn't get. It was more that when we were talking to Iran about all of the different parts of the nuclear program, from the heavy water reactors to a number of centrifuges and what they were capable of doing, it was about making sure that jigsaw puzzle came together and created the picture and it did it. So I don't think we came away saying, 'Well, we didn't get this or we didn't get that.' We're saying when you look at the picture, it works.   So from that point of view, what they were looking for was, of course, sanctions relief of being able to build their economy is the main focus of what they would receive in return.   And again, there may be specific elements of that verbiage, but the jigsaw puzzle piece, I think, also gave them what they needed, which was the potential to grow the economy. So it's important. And, you know, like one of the things that's always interesting in a negotiation is it's very easy for people to become fixated on a piece. And I think one of the problems that the Iran negotiations had was that people said, 'Well, unless you do this particular bit, then we don't believe in the rest.' And yet any particular bit was subject to all the others. In other words, creating the picture that if the piece was the right shape and size, that would work because it would slot together with everything else. So I think sometimes the criticism of the deal was that people thought, 'Well, if that piece doesn't look like this, then maybe the deal isn't as good as it should be.'  MICHAEL MORELL: My question fell into the trap. How about that? So, last question on Iran, Cathy. I'm sure you've followed all the developments, reading the press and talking to people over the last several years. Where do you think we're headed with the Iranian nuclear program and what do you think we should do about it?  CATHERINE ASHTON: It's very difficult to see where it's going right now, with all that's happened inside Iran and our deep concerns for the people of and the positioning, if you like, of Iran in the region and the need to concern ourselves with countries that feel vulnerable or threatened or exposed to Iran. I don't get the sense that we are seeing much movement on any of the Iran talks.   It doesn't mean you don't keep trying, of course. Having spent four years doing this, I know that's important, but it's in a sense going back to the drawing board a little bit, saying, 'Okay, well, the two-pronged approach of pressure to show that we're serious \u2013 and this is not just individual nations, this was the Security Council, all of them and members, particularly the P5 \u2013 and keeping that pressure up is going to be incredibly important, while also being determined to carry on talking whether talking might lead somewhere in the end.   And it sounds quite trying to say it, but the thing about diplomatic activity is that it is drip, drip, drip. It's drip, drip over years at times, but it's so important to keep doing it. And certainly if you'd said to me in 2010 or '11 that we would get as far as getting to the JCPOA, I'd have been astonished because we were so far from it. So we should always remember that that's an important part of anything that we do, is to keep open the possibility of being able to reach a conclusion.   MICHAEL MORELL:  You know, one of the things that that I would occasionally need to remind my analysts of when they thought something impossible is I would need to remind them that diplomats often do extraordinary things and accomplished extraordinary things.   So, Cathy, the second topic that you cover in your book that I want to talk about, which obviously has great resonance today, are the events in Kyiv in 2014: Russia's invasion of Crimea and its subsequent creation of and support for a separatist movement in eastern Ukraine. And three questions I want to touch on. The first is, why didn't the West come together at that point and loudly say 'No' to Putin when he grabbed Crimea? Why didn't we provide weapons to the Ukrainians then? And why did we do so this time around? Why didn't we do it in 2014?  CATHERINE ASHTON: It's interesting that it was a very different time and it was a very different Ukraine. And in a way, there had been this dramatic set of events \u2013 Maidan demonstrations, the departure of the President, Yanukovich, to Russia and through the ability of the parliament to move forward to its constitution. It had created a new leadership and then eventually elections led to President Poroshenko being elected. So it was a very strange and a difficult time, I think, for the country.   And in a sense, I think we didn't really know what we were looking at. Yes, Russia had taken Crimea, but it had stopped. There had been incursions into the Donbass that we thought the best approach as an international community was much more about pressure and sanctions at that point. And for a process of negotiation or mediation to actually try and resolve the issues that had appeared.   It was also, in my view, the case that Russia's way of operating was for, what is it, two countries. They'd done it in Georgia in 2008, they had done it in Moldova. They were interested in doing it elsewhere. And that these wedges were about preventing countries from acting as whole states, sovereign states. They couldn't join things like the EU and they couldn't do things because they weren't quite complete. And the people who said they represented these breakaway or whatever they call them areas would loudly claim that without that, no decisions could be formally made for that country.   And so we were, we thought we were looking at that. And that's really difficult, challenging, and we've not resolved those issues elsewhere. But it's a sort of slightly different situation than one that has been now very clearly designated by all of us as a war. You look back and you can see things that we should have confronted better and confronted together more effectively. But what I do know is that at a time when a crisis occurs, you're not always certain of what it is you're seeing, and you're not always certain of how best to try and resolve it. And so our initial reaction was to try and resolve it through discussion, dialogue, pressure, sanctions, the kind of determination but short of the provision of military hardware.  MICHAEL MORELL:  Cathy, the second question on Ukraine is where are you on the question of how much Western weapons we should be providing to the Ukrainians and on what timescale? You know, the pace has been deliberate and I'm wondering if you are comfortable with what the pace has been or if you would have liked to have seen a quicker pace.  CATHERINE ASHTON: So as you know, Michael, much better than I really, the pace is often dictated by what the country that's receiving weaponry is able to do, and particularly more modern weaponry requires people to know how to use it, requires it to be delivered in good order and so on. And all the countries that are providing weaponry have got to think about their own defense in terms of how they're going to replace what they get. So there's a lot of considerations. So sometimes the pace is not about the unwillingness of countries to do things. It's to do with factors such as the ones I've described. And those are important.   I think all of us are trying to think about looking to the future and how we can see this conflict ending. Wanting Ukraine to be whole and free to be a sovereign nation in charge of its own future. And what that means and what that means for relations with Russia down the track. We know how difficult and terrible has been the situation now. But we also have to keep, in a sense, a sense of what will be in total 20 years time when things may be maybe different, maybe not. And so all of the pacing of this and all of the thinking of this has got to be multifaceted.   The reason the book's called, \"And then What?\" is always to have in mind the question that I used to try and ask all the time, which is, if we do this and then what? And then what do we do? Where do we go next? What are the things that follow? So in terms of providing weaponry, our responsibilities to Ukraine are to help them to retain and take back the territory that makes them a sovereign state.   That's what we're trying to do, is to give them support and help, so that President Zelenskyy is able to make sure that his people end up living in Ukraine in a safe and secure country. And the safe and secure space is going to require us to think in the longer term about all of the different elements of what that means in the context of the EU, with NATO, of security guarantees of relations with Russia in the future and so on. And that's a big bundle of stuff that needs to be on our minds now if we're going to be able to help them resolve it in the future.  MICHAEL MORELL: You know the title, \"And then what?\" you know, I don't think in my time sitting in the Situation Room that we asked that question enough. And I know when we were asked to think about at CIA, we were asked to think about covert action, we didn't ask ourselves that question enough: If we do this and then what? It's a great question. And it's a it's a great title to your book.   Cathy, the third broad topic I wanted to ask you about was Serbia and Kosovo, another full chapter in your book. This is a topic that I think that Americans probably know the least about in terms of of the ones we've been discussing. Can you explain what happened, what position the West took and why this had a successful outcome?  CATHERINE ASHTON: So we go back in time to the breakup of Yugoslavia, to the wars that erupted between countries, between communities. And one of the most devastating parts of that was the fighting between people in Kosovo, which was regarded in the time of Yugoslavia as a kind of region connected to Serbia, and the desire of the people in Kosovo to be free and independent, for them to exercise self-determination, to be a nation state, having suffered at the hands of Serbia in particular over the years. We remember the photographs of floods of refugees as people were forced out of their homes. The Kosovo Albanians, in particular Kosovo Serbs, was still connected to Serbia. And eventually Kosovo declared itself a nation that was recognized by a large number of countries, most of the European Union, not all. Certainly the United States and many other countries as well, 100 or so, have recognized it as an independent nation.   Serbia has always said it is not. It is part of our territory. And they would argue that Kosovo should remain part of its territory and does not have the right to break away. And the conflict within that has continued through the years and really resonates in the north of Kosovo, where you have a big community of Kosovar Serbs that look to Serbia, not just culturally and linguistically, but politically and economically, too. And of course, the government in central Kosovo, in Pristina, the capital that wants to see the north of Kosovo, absolutely as part of its territory.   And in my time, it was the Wild West. There was lawlessness. There were dual purpose groups, there were two police forces. There were there was a kind of justice system that didn't function. And to go from one to the other was to go through two separate sets of gates for the sort of no man's land in the middle. Gates that were set on fire from time to time and many thousands of troops from NATO protecting parts of Kosovo, protecting these wonderful old Serb monasteries on the one hand, and protecting the people who were in danger on the other. So you had a complete mess, to put it bluntly.   And we were able to get Serbia, Kosovo and the two prime ministers to work together to reach a first agreement that was all about making life for the people in the North better. It was resolving that there is one police force, one justice system, having one set of gates. No no man's land in the middle, working out where the money that was collected as people use customs receipts going to and fro, how that would be spent trying to support the development of the communities developing as one community see the future.   And the first agreement was signed in my time and was an important breakthrough because the people who had talked to each other had never met before. They had nothing but, in some cases I would say almost hatred, but certainly contempt or felt that the other side was being completely unreasonable. And it was a very brave thing for them to do.   And you know, what was interesting for me was seeing the poll of the European Union, the membership of the European Union for the countries of the Western Balkans is a no brainer. That's where they should end up in time, because that's where they belong. And here was an opportunity to use the pull by being able to offer them the opportunity to get closer to the day when membership would be possible was what made it possible for them to sell what was a pretty difficult sell to many people who felt aggrieved, for many who lost their loved ones in the course of the conflicts. MICHAEL MORELL: Cathy, we have a very short period of time left. I just want to do one more thing. I want to throw out the name of a couple of leaders that were important players on the issues you worked and just get it literally a one or two sentence response from you. It's kind of like a Rorschach test here. And the first one is Barack Obama. Couple of sentences.  CATHERINE ASHTON: Very considered. A president who I've had the privilege to talk to a number of occasions. He was thoughtful. He was deeply interested in foreign policy issues. And he was very determined on trying to get outcomes that would be beneficial for the United States, but also for the people that we were trying to help.  MICHAEL MORELL: Angela Merkel.  CATHERINE ASHTON: She was the most consistently supportive leader to me across the European Union. She said to me the day I was appointed, \"I'll support you today and I'll support you every day.\" And she did. And she was always ready to find ways to try and help. Whether that was talking endlessly with President Putin, whether that was trying to navigate issues in the European Council. She was an extraordinary leader.  MICHAEL MORELL: And lastly, Vladimir Putin.  CATHERINE ASTHON: A man who exuded power from the moment that you met him. Somebody who was determined that Russia was not going to be reduced to a regional power, but was going to be a superpower, who passionately and angrily believed that it was impossible for countries that historically had been in a relationship with Russia to even contemplate looking elsewhere.  MICHAEL MORELL: The book is, \"And then what? Inside Stories of 21st Century Diplomacy.\" The author is Catherine Ashton. Cathy, thank you so much for joining us.  CATHERINE ASHTON: Michael, thank you.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Crotone, Italy\u00a0\u2014 Rescue teams pulled another body from the sea on Tuesday, bringing the death toll from Italy's latest migration tragedy to 64, as prosecutors identified suspected smugglers who allegedly charged 8,000 euros (nearly $8,500) each for the \"voyage of death\" from Turkey to Italy. Premier Giorgia Meloni sent a letter to European leaders demanding quick action to respond to the migration crisis, insisting that only way to deal with it seriously and humanely is to stop migrants from risking their lives on dangerous sea crossings. \u00a0 \"The point is, the more people who set off, the more people risk dying,\" she told RAI state television late Monday. \u00a0 At least 64 people, including eight children, died when their overcrowded wooden boat slammed into the shoals just a few hundred meters off Italy's Calabrian coast and broke apart early Sunday in rough seas. Eighty people survived, but dozens more are feared dead since survivors indicated the boat had carried about 170 people when it set off last week from Izmir, Turkey. Aid groups at the scene have said many of the passengers hailed from Afghanistan, including entire families, as well as from Pakistan, Syria and Iraq. Rescue teams pulled one body from the sea on Tuesday morning, bringing the death toll to 64, said Andrea Mortato, of the firefighter divers unit. \u00a0 Crotone prosecutor Giuseppe Capoccia confirmed investigators had identified three suspected smugglers, a Turk and two Pakistani nationals. A second Turk is believed to have escaped or died in the wreck. \u00a0 Italy's customs police said in a statement that crossing organizers charged 8,000 euros each for the \"voyage of death.\" As CBS News correspondent Seth Doane reported, the latest migrant boat tragedy on European shores stoked a roiling debate over how best to address the refugee and migrant crisis facing the continent. Italy's relatively new, staunchly right-wing government has been criticized by the United Nations and many migrant advocacy groups for adopting policies that inhibit charities from rescuing people from crippled boats in the Mediterranean. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi pushed back strongly at suggestions that the rescue was delayed or affected by government policy discouraging aid groups from staying at sea to rescue migrants, however. \u00a0 The EU border agency Frontex has said its aircraft spotted the boat off Crotone late Saturday and alerted Italian authorities. Italy sent out two patrol vessels, but they had to turn back because of the poor weather. The rescue operation then went out early Sunday after the boat had splintered. \u00a0 \"There was no delay,\" Piantedosi said. \"Everything possible was done in absolutely prohibitive sea conditions.\" \u00a0 Meloni's government \u2014 Italy's most far-right leadership since the days of dictator Benito Mussolini \u2014 swept elections last year in part on promises to crack down on migration.\u00a0 During its first months in power, the government has concentrated on complicating efforts by humanitarian boats that had long carried out rescue operations in the central Mediterranean by assigning them ports of disembarkation along Italy's northern coasts. That means the vessels need more time to return to the sea after bringing migrants aboard and taking them safely to shore. \u00a0 Piantedosi noted to newspaper Corriere della Sera that aid groups don't normally operate in the area of Sunday's shipwreck, which occurred off the Calabrian coast in the Ionian Sea. Rather, the aid groups tend to operate in the central Mediterranean, rescuing migrants who set off from Libya or Tunisia.",

And this week on Face the Nation: The Biden administration mounts an aggressive diplomatic offense at an international security conference. And former President Jimmy Carter enters end-of-life hospice care. Just ahead of its one-year anniversary, the war in Ukraine was the top item on the agenda at the annual Munich Security Conference, with U.S. diplomats publicly blasting the Russians and Vladimir Putin. (Begin VT) KAMALA HARRIS (Vice President of the United States): We have examined the evidence. We know the legal standards. And there is no doubt these are crimes against humanity. (APPLAUSE) (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Privately, Secretary of State Antony Blinken had a -- quote -- \"candid and direct,\" code for confrontational, meeting with his Chinese counterpart about the spy balloons. We spoke with him right after that. (Begin VT) ANTONY BLINKEN (U.S. Secretary of State): It's safe to say there was no apology. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will bring you that interview, plus a conversation with Senator Bernie Sanders. And we will take a closer look at the nation's mental health crisis and the hospitalization of Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman for depression. It's all just ahead on Face the Nation. Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have got a lot of news to get to today, but, last night, we learned former President Jimmy Carter has decided to spend his remaining time with his family in Plains, Georgia, in home hospice care. The 98-year-old Carter is the oldest surviving president. And our Bob Schieffer will be along later in the broadcast with some insights. But we want to turn now to that hour-long meeting between Secretary of State Blinken and his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, the first face-to-face meeting since the U.S. shot down the Chinese spy balloon two weeks ago. We spoke with the secretary last night from Munich just after that meeting. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, I know you just met with your Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, who has publicly said the U.S. response to the spy balloon was \"absurd, hysterical, and an effort to divert attention away from domestic problems.\" Was he that dismissive to you in private? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Margaret, I don't want to characterize what he said. I can tell you what I said. I made very clear to him that China sending a surveillance balloon over the United States, in violation of our sovereignty, in violation of international law, was unacceptable, and must never happen again. We also had an opportunity to talk about Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and concerns that we have that China is considering providing lethal support to Russia in its efforts in Ukraine. And I was able to share with him, as President Biden has shared with President Xi, the serious consequences that would have for our relationship. Finally, it was important for me to underscore that we believe having lines of communication, engaging in direct diplomacy is very important. MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean their defense minister will pick up the next phone call from Secretary Austin, instead of refusing it? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Well, it's one of the things that we talked about, the importance of having lines of communication, including military- to-military lines of communication. It's vital to making sure that there aren't miscommunications, misunderstandings, especially if you've got a crisis or some other situation on your hands. MARGARET BRENNAN: A senior Pentagon official said last week that President Xi Jinping was caught by surprise by the surveillance balloon and that he doesn't trust his own military. Did the left and right hand of the Chinese government not know what was going on? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: It doesn't matter, in the sense that China is responsible for this action. And, ultimately, as the leader of the country, President Xi is responsible. MARGARET BRENNAN: There is open-source reporting that Chinese companies are providing surveillance equipment to that mercenary group the Wagner Group fighting in Ukraine. Does the U.S. consider this to be providing military support to Russia? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: We've been concerned from day one about -- about that possibility. And, to date, we have seen Chinese companies -- and, of course, in China, there's really no distinction between private companies and the state -- we have seen them provide nonlethal support to Russia for use in Ukraine. The concern that we have now is, based on information we have that they're considering providing lethal support. And we've made very clear to them that that would cause a serious problem for us and in our relationship. MARGARET BRENNAN: Lethal support, what would that entail? What do you think... SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Weapons. Weapons. MARGARET BRENNAN: That's ammunition. That's... SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Primarily, weapons. MARGARET BRENNAN: Primarily... SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: There's a whole gamut of things that -- that fit in that category, but everything from ammunition to the weapons themselves. MARGARET BRENNAN: Iran is also accused of providing more weaponry to Russia here. So, they are... SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: That's right. We've seen Iran provide... MARGARET BRENNAN: They are building an alliance. SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: There's an increasingly noxious relationship between Russia and Iran. And it's actually a two-way street. Not only is Iran providing this -- this equipment to Russia, but Russia is also providing military equipment to Iran, including, it looks like, sophisticated fighter planes. MARGARET BRENNAN: So from your conversation with your Chinese counterpart, do I understand that, usually, when you say it's a direct conversation, that's diplospeak for it didn't go very well, it was pretty heated, or did you make plans to visit Beijing in the near future? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: It's diplospeak for saying it was very important to speak very clearly, very directly about the deep concerns we have, the concerns that we have about this surveillance balloon and the entire program, the concerns we have about the possibility that China will provide lethal material support to Russia in its war effort against Ukraine... MARGARET BRENNAN: But there was no apology? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: And it's important that -- again, don't want to characterize what they said, although it's safe to say there was no apology. We have to make sure that the competition that we're clearly engaged in does not veer into conflict, into a -- into a new Cold War. It's not in our interest. I won't speak to theirs, but it's not in ours. MARGARET BRENNAN: In terms of Russia's war, 97 percent of its military is already engaged in this fight in Ukraine, according to the U.K. But they have substantial airpower they haven't tapped into yet. Do you see evidence that Russia is preparing an aerial attack on Ukraine? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Russia's losses have been horrific. You're right that 90 -- 97 percent or so of their ground forces have been engaged in this war, which is extraordinary. And the losses to date have been horrific. Public figures suggest 200,000 casualties. That is a combination of those killed and those wounded. The destruction of their war machine itself, the tanks, the armored vehicles, the missile launchers, et cetera, has also been extensive. In terms of airpower, they tried some of this early on. Ukraine's air defenses were actually successful in shooting down a lot of Russian aircraft. So they backed off of using aircraft. That doesn't mean that they won't try to do that going forward. But, at least to date, Ukraine has had air defenses that have allowed it to pose such a threat to Russian aircraft that they haven't really been flying. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you lastly about this designation of crimes against humanity that the vice president announced. She cited horrific things, like a 4-year-old girl being raped by Russian soldiers, thousands of Ukrainian children being taken from their families, to say that this constitutes legally crimes against humanity. President Biden has already used the term genocide. Is the State Department working on a genocide determination? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: We will, as always, look at every legal possibility when it comes to going after the atrocities that Russia is committing in Ukraine. The determination that -- that we made of crimes against humanity that the vice president announced today is, unfortunately, starkly clear. And we've seen that almost from day one. This practice that, as a parent, is almost impossible to fathom of literally seizing Ukrainian children, sending them to Russia, sending them to centers -- there are about 43 of them that we found -- there was a project undertaken by Yale University, with our support, that has documented this -- to 43 centers in Russia and some in Ukrainian territory that Russia now holds. Some of these places are closer to Alaska than they are to Ukraine. Separating them from their families and then having them adopted by Russians, this is, in and of itself, horrific. It also speaks to the fact that President Putin has been trying from day one to erase Ukraine's identity, to erase its future. That's what's going on, and that too is a crime against humanity. MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of what you described is consistent with the statutory basis for the Genocide Convention. So I'm hearing what you're saying as you are potentially looking at that? SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: We will look at every possible determination, but we're going to follow the facts, and we're going to follow the law. These are very serious determinations, and we will engage in them very seriously. MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Blinken, thank you for your time today. SECRETARY ANTONY BLINKEN: Good to be with you. Thanks, Margaret. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: Late last week, Senator Bernie Sanders stopped by the Face the Nation studio to talk about his new book, \"It's OK to Be Angry About Capitalism.\" (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You talk about the alliance you formed with Joe Biden during the campaign to really shape the Democratic platform and incorporate many of your ideas. You said he wasn't as bold as you would have hoped, but he would have been the most progressive president since FDR if he had acted on that agenda. How do you categorize Joe Biden on that progressive scale now? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont): Well, I think the American Rescue Plan was, in fact, one of the most significant pieces of legislation for the working class in this country in the modern history of America. Build Back Bitter -- Better would have been transformational. It would have finally addressed the crises that the working class of this country has faced for decades, revolutionized childcare, revolutionized health care, dealt boldly with climate change, raised wages. I mean, it would have done a whole lot. MARGARET BRENNAN: But the votes weren't there. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We got zero Republican support, and two Democrats decided not to support it. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in terms of how you view the president, do you think he is progressive? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I think he is a much more progressive president than he was a United States senator. MARGARET BRENNAN: In some of the things you were able to get done and signed into law, President Biden points to them as achievements, but you diminish them a little bit in this book. You point out Medicare won't be permitted to negotiate lower drug prices until 2026. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: The cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for seniors doesn't kick in until 2025; $35 dollar cap on insulin prices doesn't help those who aren't on Medicare. Are you saying he hasn't delivered? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: No. I mean, look, this is the real world that we live in is that you need 60 votes often in the Senate. And the truth is that, today, over 60 percent of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. So the question that I am asking is why, in the richest country in the history of the world, why aren't -- why don't we have a health care system that works for all? Why do we pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs? So, we have seen some achievements, but given the scope of the problems and where we should be going, nowhere near enough. MARGARET BRENNAN: We also have one of the most innovative health care systems when it comes to creation of pharmaceutical drugs. You are doing this. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: No. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when someone hears you lay out the problems with our pharmaceutical industry, as you do in this book, and say, but the lifesaving vaccines, for example, for COVID, they were created by the United States of America, they were created by the pharmaceutical system, with taxpayer help. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: They were created by -- sure. Of course, the drug companies produce great drugs. But one out of four people in America cannot afford the price -- the drugs that their doctors prescribe. So, of course, we want the drug companies to do the research and development. And, by the way, taxpayers of this country spent $45 billion a year through the NIH to help with that research and development... MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about... SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: including Moderna and the vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about Moderna. Pfizer didn't take that -- that money. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Correct MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Moderna, you're -- you're sharply critical. In fact, you're calling in Moderna's CEO to testify. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: You're critical of his plan to quadruple the cost of the COVID vaccine. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, here's the... MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you stop him from doing that? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, here's the story. Taxpayers -- the NIH co-authored, worked together to create the vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Taxpayers put billions of dollars into the development of the vaccine, guaranteed sales for the vaccine. MARGARET BRENNAN: As they did with many other companies. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, all right. And then what happens? After the government stockpile of the vaccine expires, these guys say, well, we're going to quadruple the price of the vaccine. And, by the way, in the last two years, the CEO made $5 billion, and its other guys made billions of dollars. Is that really what should be happening? Truth is, pharmaceutical industry is enormously greedy, charging us outrageously, uncontrollably high prices. We've got to deal with that. And as chairman of the relevant committee, I intend to do what I can. MARGARET BRENNAN: Moderna says it's instituting a patient assistance plan to give the COVID shot to the uninsured and underinsured Americans free of cost. Is that sufficient for you? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And you know, Margaret, amazing coincidence. That happened the same exact day we announced that we were inviting them to testify. MARGARET BRENNAN: You think your political heat made that difference? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, maybe it was just a wild and crazy coincidence. I don't know. (LAUGHTER) SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: But we also want to take a look at what that patient program is about. We're talking to them about that. But, obviously, it's a step in the right direction. MARGARET BRENNAN: Step in the right direction. How do you lower the cost of prescription drugs in a way that doesn't hurt American innovation? And how do you do it politically, when Republicans control the House? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I think we have the basis for bipartisan work to tell the pharmaceutical industry that they really have got to stop ripping off the American people. A number of ways you could do it. The Inflation Reduction Act started by having Medicare negotiate prices with the pharmaceutical industry. It doesn't kick in for a few years. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I think we should expedite that. Number two, of all people, my good friend Donald Trump, all right, who I disagree with on everything, had the idea that maybe Medicare should not pay prices higher than the average of what countries around the rest of the world are paying. That's a good idea. And we want to pursue that as well. MARGARET BRENNAN: Democrats have this narrow 51-seat majority in the Senate. Both the Pennsylvania senators are out of office right now dealing with serious health issues. And so their absence complicates any votes. Do you have any idea when, for example, Senator Fetterman will be out of the hospital and well enough to return? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We wish Senator -- Senator -- Senator Fetterman has gone through a hell of a year, with his stroke in the middle of a campaign and dealing with other issues. So I can't answer that. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Biden talks about finishing the job and the potential for running for reelection in 2024. You said you won't run, if he runs. Do you believe that President Biden will face any primary challenge from the left, from the progressive wing? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I can't speak for other people. I think there's a general consensus right now that President Biden has done, not everything we would like. He has done a good job. If he runs, announces that he is going to run, I will support him. MARGARET BRENNAN: You write: \"The essence of the Democratic message in recent years has been we're pretty bad, but Republicans are worse, so vote for us.\" Is there anyone inspirational in Democratic politics? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Sure. There are some great people who are working night and day to protect working-class people. MARGARET BRENNAN: So who's the next Bernie Sanders? Who is that voice? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I will let you discover that. What I am extremely proud of is that there are more really strong young progressives, often people of color, in the House now than probably in any time certainly in my lifetime, great people. If you ask me what my -- I'm most proud of, is that so many young people -- we won the young vote overwhelmingly, and I think young people are saying, we don't want to tinker around the edges anymore, not on climate change, not on racial issues, not on economic issues. We want transformational change. And if my campaigns played a role in changing that consciousness, I'm very proud of that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Ambassador Nikki Haley is running for President, as you know, and she said there should be a mandatory mental competency test for politicians older than 75. You're 81. Do you take offense at that? Do you agree? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: What does she mean? I don't understand what she... (LAUGHTER) SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes. No. No, I think that's absurd. You know, there's a level... MARGARET BRENNAN: Absurd? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes. We are fighting racism. We're fighting sexism. We're fighting homophobia. I think we should also be fighting ageism. Trust people, look at people, and say, this person is competent, this person is not competent. There are a lot of 40-year-olds out there who ain't particularly competent. (LAUGHTER) SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Older people -- you look at the individual. I don't think you make a blanket statement. MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So when it comes to the current president or the former president and their age range, it doesn't concern you? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Look at what they do, what they believe in. What are they fighting for? What does Donald Trump stand for? Do you believe in that? Well, I certainly don't. What does Joe Biden stand for? What is he doing? Has he accomplished -- look at -- look at him in that way, not on age. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a quick break, and we will have more with Senator Sanders in one minute. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with more of our conversation with Senator Bernie Sanders. (Begin VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about some issues on foreign policy. CIA Director Bill Burns recently said that the uptick in violence in Israel and Palestinian territories reminds him of the last intifada, that there could be an explosion of violence. Israel now has the most right-wing government it's had in years. Do you think that democracy is in peril in Israel right now? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I do. I am very worried about what Netanyahu is doing and some of his allies in government and what may happen to the Palestinian people. The United States gives billions of dollars in aid to Israel. And I think we've got to put some strings attached to that and say you cannot run a racist government. You cannot turn your back on a two-state solution. You cannot demean the Palestinian people there. You just can't do it and then come to America and ask for money. MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you talked to the administration about it? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: No. MARGARET BRENNAN: They've been very careful in criticism of the Netanyahu government. (CROSSTALK) SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I am not careful about it. I'm embarrassed that -- that, in Israel, you have a government of that nature right now. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you -- are you going to introduce something? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We may well, yes. If a government is acting in a racist way, and they want billions of dollars from the taxpayers of the United States, I think you say, sorry, but it's not acceptable. You want our money? Fine. This is what you got to do to get it. MARGARET BRENNAN: The pro-Israel lobby AIPAC used to be bipartisan, but, these days, it's got a super PAC that has spent very heavily in Democratic primaries. You said.... SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Against progressives. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said they're doing everything they can to destroy the progressive movement in this country. Do you think the politics around this issue are constraining the White House going into 2024? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: The way I look at AIPAC now, in terms of their political activities, this is not even just a pro-Israel group. This is a corporate PAC, sometimes getting money from Republicans, sometimes supporting extreme right-wing Republicans. So, what really upset me very much is that, in many of these primaries, we had great candidates, young people, often people of color, and yet AIPAC and other super PACs spending millions of dollars trying to defeat them. And, as you may know, I try to get the Democratic Party to pass a resolution that, in Democratic primaries, super PAC money should not be allowed to be used. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are proposing a new Cabinet-level agency to focus on the future of work and workers. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: You talk about taxing robots who might replace humans. Isn't the Labor Department supposed to be doing these things? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, theoretically, but I don't think we're doing enough. Look, this is a huge issue. There is a revolution taking place now with artificial intelligence and robotics, OK? Millions of workers are going to lose their jobs. Who's making those decisions, Margaret? You hear it debated in Congress? I don't. If there is a technology that can do -- increase worker productivity, who benefits from that? Just the guy who owns the company, or does the worker benefit? So, if we can reduce the workweek, is that a bad thing? It's a good thing. But I don't want to see the people on top simply be the only beneficiaries of this revolution in technology. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you agree with Bill Gates in taxing robots? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: That's one way to do it. Yes, absolutely. MARGARET BRENNAN: He's a billionaire you do like? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: He's... (LAUGHTER) SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I have talked to Bill on a number of occasions, yes. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. But -- well, I'm interested in that concept and some of the other things you lay out here, including... SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: But it's not just taxing the robots. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: It's this whole question of an economic transformation. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Are working-class people going to benefit from that or just the billionaire class? MARGARET BRENNAN: So I'm told we're running out of time. But I have... SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I'm just getting warmed up, Margaret, having fun. MARGARET BRENNAN: I... (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: But I have to ask you, you're going on tour to promote this book \"It's OK to Be Angry About Capitalism.\" And you're here talking about it. I understand we're not the bad guys you're describing in the book when it comes to media. But tickets for your tour apparently are selling for $95 on Ticketmaster, which is accused of anti-competitive behavior. You know that. Some of your Democrats are criticizing them. Aren't you benefiting yourself from this system that you're trying to dismantle? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: No, I'm not. I -- first of all -- first of all, those decisions are made totally by the publisher and the bookseller. I think there's one case where, in one place here in Washington, Politics and Prose, an independent bookstore, charging some tickets. Most of them, I think, are $40, $50. And you get a book as well. So, if you want to come, you're going to have to pay 40 bucks. I will throw in the book for free. (LAUGHTER) SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: And we're doing a number of free events, but I don't make a nickel out of these things at all. MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're OK doing business with Ticketmaster? SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: No, not particularly. But that's -- again, I have nothing to do with that. That is -- if you wrote a book, it would probably be the same process. MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm. So you have to operate within the system... SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I do. MARGARET BRENNAN: ... is what you're... SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I write a book, a major publisher, et cetera, et cetera. MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Sanders, thank you very much for coming in and answering our questions today. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: I hope I wasn't too hard on you. MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And I asked all the questions I wanted. (LAUGHTER) MARGARET BRENNAN: Not necessarily what you wanted, but what I wanted. So, thank you very much, Senator Sanders. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you. (End VT) MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard him, Senator Bernie Sanders just getting warmed up. Our full conversation is available on our Web site, as well as our YouTube channel. We will be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Next week on Face the Nation, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice joins us to talk about China, the war in Ukraine and more. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. President Biden heads to Poland this week. His second visit since Russia began its war in Ukraine. For more we go to Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Good morning to you. MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI (Prime Minister of Poland): Good morning. Good morning, ma'am. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Biden will be visiting Warsaw. We know you've said President Zelenskyy will also be in Poland. What do you expect from these visits? MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI: Well, I expect that there will be very strong confirmation of our resilience and our joint efforts to defeat Russia in Ukraine, because instead of saying some western European politicians say that Russia cannot be - cannot win this war and Ukraine cannot be defeated, we have to change the paradigm and we have to say, Ukraine must win and Russia must be defeated. And I believe that the words of President Biden will reassure all Europe that the United States is with us in this fight for freedom and peace. MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're referring to the French president's recent comments. Does NATO actually want Ukraine to win this war and regain its lost territory? MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI: I believe so. I'm absolutely sure that this is the only way how we can restore peace and stability. I cannot imagine that Putin, and the Kremlin winning this war and then peace and stability is around us, because the nature - the very nature of Russia is to conquer other countries. Russia has actually summoned the worst of the 20th century, colonialism, imperialism, nationalism, and this is - this is the nature of the - of \"russkiy mir\" (ph), as they call. And this is why it's such a critical moment in our history. MARGARET BRENNAN: President Biden said he believes the war has to end in a negotiated settlement that's favorable to Ukraine. You said last year Poland doesn't negotiate with criminals.. Nobody negotiated with Hitler. Would you negotiate with Hitler, with Stalin, with Pol Pot? Are you saying peace is not possible if Putin stays in power? MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI: I just came to - to here to this interview from Munich conference. Munich Security Conference very important platform to exchange opinions today. But in 1938 there was another Munich conference where all the leaders of the western world succumbed to Hitler and they believed they are bringing peace to their countries. And one year later, the second world war broke out. We can, of course, negotiate, but it has to be under conditions and under the definition presented by Ukrainians themselves. It's up to them to define what terms and conditions can be acceptable to negotiate with the Kremlin. MARGARET BRENNAN: One of Ukraine's neighbors, Moldova, has warned that there is a plot to overthrow their government and open a new front in the war. An ally of Putin recently said that Russia should denazify (ph) and demilitarize Poland next. Do you see evidence that Russia is going to try to move into other countries, including yours? MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI: Yes. I do see lots of fingerprints of Russian forces, Russian services in Moldova. This is a very weak - we're a very weak country and we all need to help them. MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of Poland, you're in NATO, so the United States would have to come to your defense if you went to NATO and asked for it. There are 11,000 U.S. service members on rotation in Poland currently. I know your government's asking for more. Do you have any indications from the Biden administration that they will send more troops or make them permanent on your soil? MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI: We are in the process of discussion with President Biden's administration about making their presence more permanent and increasing them. But I'm very grateful also for sending new patriot systems and other very modern weapons and munitions because this is also, to some extent, a proxy for presence of soldiers, but, of course, the two go in tandem. I also recall the words of President Biden from last - from his last visit in Poland when he said that every inch or square inch of NATO's country's territory is -- will be defended. And Russia is not going to put any inroads into those countries. And I do believe that NATO countries, we are all very much secure. But it's not only about us. It's also about creating stability around us in our direct neighborhood. MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI: And if we fail to integrate Ukraine in NATO and European Union, Ukraine will always be a zone - a buffer zone, which is - which is not right. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Mr. Prime Minister, we'll be watching that visit. Thank you for your time. MATEUSZ MORAWIECKI: Thank you. Thanks for having me. MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back with some analysis. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by Dr. Fiona Hill, a Trump administration national security council advisor on Russia, and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, who is now a CBS News contributor. Good morning. Good to have you both here. FIONA HILL (Former NSC Russia Expert): Thanks. MARGARET BRENNAN: Fiona Hill, I'd love to talk to you first. Secretary Blinken admitted Russia is not isolated. It's getting support from China. It's getting support from Iran. So, does that mean the west's main tool here, sanctions, are failing? FIONA HILL: Well, I think sanctions was never the only tool that we had. I mean diplomacy, as well as the military support for Ukraine. And I think, you know, what we heard from Secretary Blinken and, you know, the fact that he's just been at the Munich Security Conference underscores that we're going to have to really up our diplomatic game because, you know, as you're suggesting here, a lot of other countries just don't buy that there's as big an issue as we see with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. I mean they're always making comparison with, you know, the great power competition among the United States and Russia and China and seeing as part of that. And I think what Secretary Blinken and other members of the administration have been really striving to get across is that it's not part of us, saying the United States isn't fighting over Ukraine for any kind of competition with China and with Russia. They're trying to help Ukraine liberate itself. That's the message that we have to get across. And, frankly, if Russia gets away with a land grab in Ukraine, it makes the world unsafe for every country imaginable that has a territorial dispute, including, of course, all of the neighbors of China in the South China Sea, in east Asia, and many other countries as well. India and China have a (INAUDIBLE) dispute in the Himalayas, for example. And what we really have to do is to work with those middle powers, the countries in the U.N. General Assembly, to make that point that we're trying to help Ukraine liberate its territory from an unprovoked aggression. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, you heard from the Polish prime minister this concern that, not just the blast radius from this conflict, but that there will be some pushing of it beyond borders, maybe not over invasion, but destabilization. JOHN SULLIVAN: Sure. MARGARET BRENNAN: When you were in the administration, you left in September, there was talk about the surrounding countries also being targeted by Russia. Do you think that's underway now? JOHN SULLIVAN: Absolutely. I mean we've seen the story earlier this week about a potential effort by the Russians to undermine the government in Moldova. We've seen over flights by Russian missiles that were attacking Ukraine that have gone over the territory of other countries that aren't parties to the conflict. But this is a long-standing concern by Poles, by eastern Europeans that always felt threatened by that colossus on their eastern border by Russia. They've always described it to me as -- when I was deputy secretary, they felt that they were on the front lines against this Russian -- imperialist Russian state. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But this feels different. I mean when you were here with us last time, you said, when you talked to Secretary Blinken February 19th of last year, he asked you, how are you feeling? You said, it feels like August 1939. JOHN SULLIVAN: Yes. Right. So - MARGARET BRENNAN: You just had the Polish prime minister invoked Hitler. JOHN SULLIVAN: Yes. So, what happened on February 24th last year, Putin pushed all of his chips to the center of the table. He went all-in. You'll recall before February 24th there were -- there was speculation about, yes, there will be maybe a limited incursion into Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. JOHN SULLIVAN: Putin went all-in. He went full World War II, World War I scale. This is war and we're going all in. We're going to take down the Ukrainian government. We're going to subjugate the Ukrainian people. And by God we're going to do with Ukraine what we wish because Ukraine isn't a country. Ukraine is part of our \"russkiy mir.\" (ph). We're going to do with it what we want to and you, the United States, you NATO, anybody else, you can't stop us. MARGARET BRENNAN: And he's betting on a short attention span here in the west, here in the United States. Vladimir Putin is set to give an address Tuesday. It's going to be his first state of the nation since the war began. Very same day President Biden is going to give a speech in Poland. What's the message you expect and should be delivered? FIONA HILL: Well, I think what Putin is going to deliver is a message that picks up on what Ambassador Sullivan has just said. He's going to depict this as a great patriot war of, you know, they use interchangeably fatherland (ph) war, protection of the motherland. In this case, Putin has been actually trying to say that this is the third invasion of Russia after Napoleon and the Napoleonic wars back in the 1800s and then Nazi Germany. So, he's actually portraying this as an existential threat for Russia. So, what we would imagine is that he's really trying to mobilize the Russian population in support of what he's depicting as the fight for their lives. Now, President Biden is going to have to counter that. We have to counter that narrative, not just in Europe and - you know, as we've heard from the Polish prime minister, we've heard from many other European leaders, they do see things in the same term as a rerun of World War I and World War II in the sense of an unprovoked aggression by a great power in Europe. But they've got to basically - and President Biden's got to convince the world, the whole world at this point - MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. FIONA HILL: Not just Europeans, that we're in a fight to help Ukraine liberate itself and that everything that Putin is saying is a distortion of history and of fact. MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, when you talk about the war in Ukraine politically here in the United States, President Biden gets attacked by Republicans, in particular, for being too slow moving to approve certain types of weapons. Fighter jets, for example, for a year have been debated about whether to give them or not. Is this too slow moving if we are actually in this incredibly important moment? JOHN SULLIVAN: Well, it is an incredibly important moment and I think some of the criticism has been fair. It has been, I think, the administration, of which I was a part until recently, has been a little slow, has been cautious. President Biden, the marching orders we got at the start of this conflict was, he wanted to do everything we could to support Ukraine, but he didn't want a war with Russia. And that's the careful balancing act that we've -- the administration has been going through. Not easy judgement -- MARGARET BRENNAN: But Vladimir Putin doesn't want a war with the United States eater? JOHN SULLIVAN: Well, Vladimir Putin says he's already at war with the United States. He says the reason that he invaded Ukraine is that Ukraine, put up to it by the United States, was going to invade Russia. Ukraine was going to develop nuclear weapons. The United States and Ukraine were developing bioweapons. The times that he will use the word \"war\" to discuss what's happening in Ukraine is when he says the west, the United States and all of its vessels, the word they use, is actually at war with Russia. When he talks about the special military operation, that's the response by Russia to the war that the United States is already waging through its Ukrainian proxies. As they say, the United States wants to fight against Russia to the last Ukrainian. And it's all made up. MARGARET BRENNAN: And those are the words you're going to be listening for on Tuesday when he gives his address? JOHN SULLIVAN: He's going to -- absolutely. Fiona's absolutely right, it's - it's going to be rallying the Russian people to support the fatherland in this, what he considers existential war that he's engaged in, in Ukrainian. MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Hill, I mean, Ukrainian's foreign minister said at Munich, the true end to the war will be when Russia's president comes to Kyiv, falls to his knees and begs for forgiveness. That does not sound like Vladimir Putin. FIONA HILL: No, but (INAUDIBLE), you know, 90 years from now some Russian president might do that. And I'm saying 90 years because actually Ambassador Sullivan and I have some Irish heritage and it took 90 years for the queen, Elizabeth II, to actually come and ask for forgiveness in Ireland in a very highly symbolic way for, you know, many of the conflicts. It's not inconceivable that at some point some Russian leader, not in the immediate future, would, in fact, ask for forgiveness for what's been done in Ukraine. We saw German leaders after World War II, you know, eventually ask for similar forgiveness at war memorials, including in the Soviet Union and in Russia itself. But it is true that when Russia drops as a country, these imperial (INAUDIBLE) that been (ph), this will finally be over. But it won't be anytime soon. MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. It's hard to believe we're a year into this conflict. We will be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: There is a mental health crisis in our country. And we are reminded of that frequently. For a closer look at what may feel to many like an epidemic, we want to bring in Dr. Joshua Gordon of the National Institute of Mental Health, which is the lead federal agency for research on mental disorders. Good morning to you, Doctor. DR. JOSHUA GORDON (Director, National Institute of Mental Health): Good morning. MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on one of these triggers, you know, Senator Fetterman, a stroke survivor, checked himself into the hospital with clinical depression. And it has inspired a lot of people to talk about their experiences with depression. In his case, what are the symptoms of stroke-induced depression? JOSHUA GORDON: The symptoms of stroke-induced depression are pretty much the same as typical depression or depression that's not associated with stroke. Low motivation, sadness, challenges with sleep, appetite, energy, loss of motivation and the like. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what is a reasonable expectation and timeline for someone's treatment? Do they get back to them -- their old selves? JOSHUA GORDON: Fortunately, there are effective treatments for depression. And those treatments do generally work for most people who have stroke- induced depression. The timeline, though, varies tremendously from individual to individual. And it's hard to make a prediction in the senator's case. MARGARET BRENNAN: What is the typical treatment for someone these days? Is talk therapy still strongly believed in? Is medication more prescribed these days? JOSHUA GORDON: Well, given the typical severity of post-stroke depression, most mental health professionals would recommend a combination of medication and what we call psycho social or psychotherapeutic interventions. So, yes, talk therapy is still used. It is a very effective tool for depression, as are medications. And if patients don't respond to talk therapy or medications, there are additional options to try. MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, there was this recent CDC study about teenage girls, which was really sobering. It said nearly three in five U.S. teens - - teen girls feel persistently sad or hopeless, double that of boys, representing a 60 percent increase, the highest level reported over the past decade. What is going on with young girls? JOSHUA GORDON: Well, it is - it is truly a tragedy. It is truly a crisis. And we desperately need to do something about it on a societal level and on community levels. The what is going on question is one that we can't fully answer at this point. A lot of people think, oh, it must be the pandemic and its effects. But if you look at the surveys that the CDC has been conducting for the last decade or more, you can see the slow rise in levels of symptomatology, particularly amongst teenage girls. It goes back long before the pandemic started. So, there are a number of contributing factors. But on the whole, it's a complex picture that we don't fully understand. MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what are parents supposed to do? JOSHUA GORDON: That's a great question. First and foremost, parents need to talk to their kids. They need to listen. They need to ask questions about how they're feeling. And if they're worried, they do need to ask the question, are you thinking about hurting yourself or killing yourself. So that's the first thing is, ask questions. And the second thing, listen to the responses, and try to be there for your kids. If the answers suggest that your child is having more trouble than you think or is thinking about harming themselves or is otherwise having challenges going to school and getting good grades, et cetera, then parents should seek professional help. MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor, thank you for your professional insight. We'll continue monitoring it. And we'll be right back. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We learned the sad news Saturday that former President Jimmy Carter has entered the final stage of his life and will forgo any further medical treatment. Our Bob Schieffer covered former President Jimmy Carter almost 50 years ago and brings us his insights into Carter's career. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BOB SCHIEFFER (voice over): When the former governor of Georgia decided to run for president in 1975, it was not as if America had been waiting for him with bated breath. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jimmy who? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jimmy Carter. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Jimmy who? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I don't know who he is. BOB SCHIEFFER: He was so unknown that his surprise win in the Iowa caucuses brought headlines blaring the same question. But that race changed politics so much that Iowa became an obligatory first stop for presidential candidates. Carter tried to make a virtue of his lack of Washington experience, a self- made peanut farmer from Plains, Georgia, introduced us to an improbable cast of small-town characters. But his best asset was always wife Rosalynn. Carter's campaign came down to one simple promise. JIMMY CARTER, (Former U.S. President): I'll never tell a lie. I'll never make a misleading statement. BOB SCHIEFFER: After the lies of Watergate, it worked, despite a campaign of dubious firsts. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The audio has been lost. BOB SCHIEFFER: The sound went out during his debate with President Gerald Ford, leaving the two candidates just standing there for 28 minutes. Carter went on to defeat incumbent Gerald Ford, maybe not so much because of what he said, but because Ford had pardoned Richard Nixon. JIMMY CARTER: I, Jimmy Carter, do solemnly swear. BOB SCHIEFFER: Like his campaign, Carter's presidency began in some chaos. He bombarded Congress with so many proposals, plans and legislation, Washington couldn't sort out his priority. The low point for Carter came when Iran's revolutionary leaders took U.S. diplomats hostage. The conflict set off a fuel shortage back home and Americans faced long lines at gas stations from coast to coast. A military mission to rescue the hostages collapsed in an Iranian desert, and with it Carter's campaign for re-election. The captives remained behind bars until the new president was sworn in. For all that, Carter was responsible for two extremely significant achievements, negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty ensured the canal stayed open to American ships and American troops would not be needed to put down an almost certain rebellion. Even more important, Carter engineered the Camp David Accords, which remains the single most important diplomatic achievement in the Middle East. It took Egypt, Israel's most dangerous adversary, out of the conflict. JIMMY CARTER: And I would like to say, as a Christian, to these two friends of mine, the words of Jesus, blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be the children of God. BOB SCHIEFFER: Although he served only one term, Carter went on to become America's most active and productive former president. He visited countries around the world, serving as a mediator and settling disputes. His scientific work in Africa helped eradicate the screw worm, where it was said his was the presidential name most often remembered. His work in Habitat for Humanity revived voluntaryism in this country. When President Biden visited him in May of 2021, the pair discussed cancer research, a topic close to both their hearts. Carter survived brain cancer in his early '90s. Jimmy and Roselynn Carter have been married more than 75 years, the longest presidential marriage in history. This is Bob Schieffer.

Morell describes how the outcome of the Russia-Ukraine war is in the hands of West and that without Western assistance, Russia could win the war. Morell defines the U.S. China relationship as a \"cold war,\" but despite that tension Morell does not predict that China will invade Taiwan in 2023. Where Morell foresees the greatest probability of war in 2023 is between Iran and Israel as a hardline Israeli government takes the helm.\u00a0 HIGHLIGHTS:\u00a0 Download, rate and subscribe here:\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify\u00a0and\u00a0Stitcher. INTELLIGENCE MATTERS: Michael Morell PRODUCER: Paulina Smolinski INTELLIGENCE MATTERS: MICHAEL MORELL ON THE YEAR AHEAD: STRATEGIC CHALLENGES IN 2023 MICHAEL ALLEN:\u00a0 Michael, Happy New Year.\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Happy New Year. Michael. I think it's a terrific idea to do this as a podcast to turn the tables on me, so to speak. So I'm really looking forward to this. MICHAEL ALLEN: All right. This will be fun. I'm going to try to interrupt you every now and again. I'll try to make it a deposition. All right. Let's start with Russia-Ukraine. What are you seeing on the ground today and what do you see in the year ahead? MICHAEL MORELL: Michael, I think it makes sense to break the answer to this question into two buckets, a tactical bucket and a strategic bucket. But before I do that, I want to give credit here to one particular source of information on the war. I read a lot on this issue, but by far the thing that I find most informative and most useful to be the daily report on the war that's put out by the Institute for the Study of War. It really is an amazing example of the high quality of analysis that's possible with open source. So I just want to give them credit because a lot of what forms my view comes from them.\u00a0 So first, tactically. The situation on the ground today is a stalemate. Both Russian and Ukrainian forces lack the resources to move forward, to conduct an offensive. Russia has not had any significant victories since early July, and for weeks they have been digging in. Literally building defensive positions, preparing for trench warfare. They are not going to be moving forward anytime soon, anywhere. Ukraine, for its part, Ukraine is awaiting the supply of new and more advanced weapons systems that had been promised by the West. That, I think, could change the deadlock in individual locations. But I don't think it's going to be enough to change the stalemate across the entire battlefield. So that's where we are tactically.\u00a0 I think the other thing to note tactically and everyone here knows this, is that the Russians continue to hammer Ukrainian infrastructure targets multiple times a week. All of that designed to deny heat, to deny electricity, to deny water to the Ukrainian people. And I'd make two points on these attacks. One, they're intentional attacks on civilian targets designed to break the will of the Ukrainians to fight. They are, in my view, I don't know if it's from a legal perspective, but in my view, they're war crimes, and they need to be called out as such by Western governments and by the Western media. And we need to use them right, to embarrass any country that is supporting Russia in any way, in my view. And then number two, they're not working, and I don't think they're going to work. They are not going to break Ukraine's will to fight. If anything, they're strengthening Ukraine's will to fight. I think this is another example of a huge mistake by Vladimir Putin in this war.\u00a0 Strategically, and I don't think- from a strategic perspective- and I don't think, Michael, this is too strong of a statement, the outcome of this war is really in the hands of the West. So if you want a guide, I think to any big inflection points in 2023, watch the West and its approach to Ukraine. And why do I say that? If the West withdrew its support for some reason, and I don't think that's going to happen. And I want to emphasize that. But if we did, Russia could and probably would still win this war, including achieving its overall objective of turning Ukraine into a vassal state. So Russia could still win, if we pulled back our support. From a policy perspective, we just got to make sure that that doesn't happen. We need to make sure that we hold together the political support here in the U.S. and hold together our allies internationally.\u00a0 On the other hand, if we continue to only slowly increase the sophistication of the weapons we're providing to Ukraine, call that the base case, that's where we've been. And that's assumed that's going to continue to happen. The fighting is likely to go on for some time, in my view. It's going to at least drag on well into the second half of this year, if not the entire year. But- and this is the last point I'll make here. But if the West- if the coalition gave the Ukrainians what the Ukrainians are asking for, namely fighters, tanks, long range precision weapons, President Zelensky's entire list, I believe that Ukraine could retake all of its territory currently held by the Russians, including Crimea. And in the process, we would demonstrate to the world that the West is going to lead and make sure that violations of sovereignty like this will not stand and the world would be a whole lot better place if that's the outcome. And just one more sentence here, which I think is really important. I want to remind everyone that what's happening in Ukraine is the biggest military conflict in Europe since World War Two. And that's quite a statement.\u00a0 MICHAEL ALLEN: Michael, I might have called it incrementally progress by the Ukrainians, but I would have come out at the same place, which is that the Biden administration is seemingly not willing to give so many weapons or give everything that Zelensky wants. I mean, why not? You've served with many of these people in the Obama administration. What's going on? MICHAEL MORELL: Let me say a few sentences and then turn it back on you because you look at this as closely as I do. I don't know is the answer. I don't sit at the table, obviously, with these people. And quite frankly, I don't talk to anyone regularly in the administration about this. My guess would be it's a concern about escalation. It's a concern about nuclear use by the Russians, and it's a concern that if Russia collapses, we could be in a much worse place. My guess is those are the kind of thoughts that are going on, the kind of discussion that's going on as they make decisions to kind of slow roll things. I think that's a mistake. I think we're over worrying about those things. And I think if you want to end this war sooner and you want to leave both countries in a better place, you would provide the weapons that the Ukrainians need to end this thing. Is my sense. But I'd love to hear your view. MICHAEL ALLEN: Well, my sense is that they're playing not to lose. They- the Biden administration is playing not to lose, and that they are being way too cautious in not transferring over what we need. What the Ukrainians need. We're just now apparently getting around to sending a lot more infantry fighting vehicles. But to me, that's a little late. And over and over you hear of requests, denials, delays, eventual acceptance, and then it takes a long time to incorporate it into the battlefield. So the Ukrainians are doing great. It's hard to say the Biden administration has been weak, but it seems like they are really talking themselves out of a lot of things for fear of World War three, which is what always ends up in the newspapers. What Biden's concerns about. MICHAEL MORELL: I think that you're absolutely right. They deserve credit for what they've done. They deserve credit for standing up to Russia and saying no. They deserve credit for leading the coalition, that supports Ukraine today. The Obama administration didn't do that in 2014, when Russia grabbed Crimea. Quite frankly, the Bush administration didn't do that when Russia invaded Georgia. So they deserve credit for standing up and saying no. But I would like to see them be more aggressive in providing the weapons that Ukraine needs. Whenever I see them make a decision to send a new weapon system. I ask myself, why didn't that come two months ago? Why didn't that come four months ago? I ask myself that question. MICHAEL ALLEN: Exactly. Well, you mentioned nuclear weapons. And of course, if we believe that Putin would use them, that is a great reason to self deter. But after his initial round of threats, I'd say three months ago, most analysts looked at this and said, you know what, I don't think he's going to use it because why would he use it on his own battlefield that he claims is Russian territory and he would lose significant diplomatic ground with the Indians and the Chinese. So I've sort of seen the nuclear weapons specter decline. What do you think? MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, I agree. So on the use of- we're talking about tactical nuclear weapons, you're right on their use. The Russian rhetoric has died down. I think there's a couple of reasons for that. One is the public rebuke of Russia on this issue from China during Chinese President Xi's meeting with German Chancellor Scholz in early November. And I think that was a very important thing for China to have done. And second, and this is only a guess I don't know for sure, is that we probably in the form of Bill Burns sitting down with his Russian counterpart or through Jake Sullivan to his Russian counterpart, sent Russia a very strong message on how we would respond to a Russian use of nuclear weapons. And what they heard gave them pause.\u00a0 So I think probably those two things have changed the dynamic here a little bit with regard to the use of tactical nuclear weapons. And that is a very good thing. Now, I'd say the probability has gone down, but it's not zero. I can still imagine situations where Putin might feel completely cornered and feel he has no other choice. But I do think the threat has gone down. MICHAEL ALLEN: And there's some suggestion from the administration on occasion that at least in the newspapers, that if the Ukrainians tried to seek or had some success in Crimea, that might provoke Putin. Do you credit that at all? MICHAEL MORELL: So certainly Crimea is the most important piece of what he currently holds to Putin. Certainly. But for all the reasons that you talked about. For why the use of nuclear weapons would be a mistake to Russia, stand in Crimea as they stand in eastern Ukraine. It would make Russia a pariah state. The Chinese would undoubtedly break with the Russians over the use of tactical nuclear weapons. Their military effectiveness, unless you use many, many of them are highly questionable. So the value you get out of it is not significant. You probably draw on NATO into the war in Ukraine. Not into Russia, but into Ukraine in some way. So there are huge downsides for Putin. And those are true in Crimea as they are anywhere else in Ukraine. MICHAEL ALLEN: My last question on Ukraine. Can you comment a little bit on Putin's political position? MICHAEL MORELL: I think, not surprisingly, Putin is highly attuned to his own politics. I think sometimes it's easy for us to sit back and look at authoritarians and say they don't have to worry about their politics. But they do. Just like any politician anywhere. But what he's attuned to is not what most of us would think. Most of us would think He's attuned to anti-war voices in Russia. No, he's attuned to and reacts to critiques from the ultra nationalist right from those folks who have supported him for years and who actually want him to be more aggressive in Ukraine,\u00a0 not less. He did the partial mobilization several months ago in response to their critiques, and he angered the general population by doing so. And I think also the the regular missile and drone attacks that we're now seeing on Ukrainian infrastructure are largely in response to the critiques of the ultranationalists. He's afraid of them. He's trying to manage them by responding to these critiques and by trying to co-opt them at the same time.\u00a0 So he's asked them, believe it or not, he's asked them for a monthly report. I think it's an effort to bring them under the tent. So he's highly attuned to his politics and to these ultranationalists in particular. I think the last thing I'd say is I think it's very hard to say if Putin is under any near-term political threat. I don't see it. But 33 years as a CIA analyst taught me that it's very hard to see successful coups coming. If we, if the U.S. intelligence community sees a coup coming, it probably means the troubled leader does as well and can move to stop it. It's the unseen coup that gets you both as a leader and as an outside analyst. So would I be surprised if we woke up tomorrow to news that Putin's been arrested or he's been shot? Not at all. But him being around a year from now. Wouldn't surprise me either.\u00a0 MICHAEL ALLEN: Wow. So you wouldn't be surprised if you woke up tomorrow morning and Putin was dead or arrested?\u00a0 MICHAEL MORELL: Right, because these ultra nationalists think he hasn't gone far enough. But again, let me emphasize, I don't see any evidence of that. And I think the last thing to say is I think there's a sense sometimes in the West and in the United States that if Putin were to go, he'd be replaced by less of a hardliner. And I think we need to realize that the more likely outcome is a more hard line, more authoritarian leader of Russia rather than a small d, democrat leader of Russia. Putin going would, in my view, be unlikely to solve our Russia problem. MICHAEL ALLEN: That's for sure. Okay, let's move to China. Let me just start off. Go ahead. MICHAEL MORELL: No, I was going to say let's move on to an easy one. MICHAEL ALLEN: That's right. What will 2023 bring to the US-China relationship? MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah. So I think we start 2023 with the U.S. and China in a Cold War. I don't think that's an overstatement. In fact, I think it's pretty indisputable. When China clearly chooses to maintain a strategic relationship with Russia despite Russia's invasion of a sovereign nation. When it threatens reunification with Taiwan by any means necessary. When we place tariffs on Chinese products largely for domestic political reasons, and when we deny Chinese technology, when we deny technology to China in a bid to contain their own technology goals, we're in a Cold War. So I think that's where we were starting the year. I think it's important to ask what's the Cold War being fought over? It's not being fought over ideology. China doesn't want to export communism or even its own version of authoritarianism. It's not a Cold War being fought over territory, outside of Taiwan, South China Sea, a couple of border disputes. China does not have territorial ambitions. Rather, I think the Cold War is being fought over technology supremacy that will define future economic and military supremacy. And it's being fought over political influence around the world. China does not want to use that influence that it has in other countries for a global common like the way we have. And I really believe that. But rather it wants to use that influence solely for its own narrow economic interests. It wants to be able simply by its economic might, to dictate, which is too strong of a word so I will use influence again, to influence countries around the world to choose economic policies that are in China's strategic interests.\u00a0 And my guess, Michael, is that we'll end 2023 deeper in that Cold War than we're starting. I think the forces that have brought us here nationalism in China and politics here in the U.S. are just too strong for there to be any other outcome. This is all going to come at a cost. It's going to come at a cost to the global economy. Globalization had much more economic benefits than costs. And the reverse of globalization, call it decoupling, which is going to be a big part of this Cold War, is going to come at an economic price. It's going to put some of our allies in an uncomfortable position, and it's going to put some U.S. companies, who do business in China, in an increasingly uncomfortable position. So that's kind of where we are. MICHAEL ALLEN: So for years now, and appropriately so, we've been worried that we were falling behind the Chinese. At a minimum, they were catching up with us. I'm wondering whether you subscribe to some of the new thinking out there that says, you know what, the Chinese are not ten feet tall like we used to see. They have structural economic issues, demographic issues, and because Xi Jinping and his zeal for the party has killed the golden goose, he's overregulated the economy. Do you put any stock in that or do you think they're still winning? MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, it's a great question, Michael. I do. So I buy into the Hal Brands argument that China is no longer a rising power, but rather a peaking one. Hal lists three reasons why China is no longer a rising power. First is the huge systemic challenges they face. Demographics, debt, among others. Second is what you just mentioned, is the slowdown and even reversal of economic reform. This is the goose right to kill the golden egg or this is killing the goose that laid the golden egg. And third is the fact that the world is beginning to stand up to China and to say no to its policies that are inconsistent with the rules based order that most of the world wants to live in.\u00a0 To Hal's three points I would add a fourth, which is, I think that China, we're going to see increasingly sclerotic policymaking in Beijing as Xi's preference for rule of life gets in the way of what was once a great Chinese strength, which was a change in leadership every five or ten years that brought new people, new ideas, fresh approaches to policymaking. China's losing that right. So I think, you look at all of that and Hal's argument, that they are peaking power makes sense.\u00a0 The caveat I would put on it is that it doesn't necessarily change our current situation with China because China has grown so strong and so confident and so aggressive over the last ten years that we have to deal with this country. And as Hal argues very persuasively, I think, them being a peaking power actually makes them more dangerous in the short run if they feel like they have less time.\u00a0 I agree with him. And I would add, that fourth point. The other thing I'd say about this is, and I think about this a lot, is there's dynamics underway in both China and the United States that I think are leading each of us to weaken ourselves. Here at home, here in the U.S., for political reasons we're walking away from free enterprise on a whole host of policies, including trade. And we're walking away from caring about budget deficits. You and I just talked about this. We pretend they don't exist. We pretend they don't matter and they still do. And plague future generations. And then you look at China and we just talked about for political reasons, them walking away from economic reform and from capitalism. And so as long as these dynamics exist in both countries, I think sometimes the competition between the two countries is literally going to come down to more about not who wins, but who loses the least. It's not a race to the top, but rather, avoid getting to the bottom first. Both countries have big issues they have to tackle. MICHAEL ALLEN: Right. Michael, what about Taiwan? We can't have a conversation without discussing them. Most timelines say something general of it gets more dangerous the longer we get in the decade. I hear people within the government always saying 2027 is the timeframe that we're most worried about. What do you think? First of all, let me just ask you bluntly, do you think that Xi Jinping is going to go for it? MICHAEL MORELL: Not anytime soon is the direct answer to that. Michael, as you know, there's been a ton of rhetoric regarding Taiwan in both Beijing and Washington over the last couple of years, more last year than the year before. A lot of increasingly aggressive military exercises by China, quite frankly, aggressive political moves by Washington. Speaker Pelosi's trip, multiple statements by the president, walking back from our long time policy regarding defending Taiwan. All of which have raised tension in the Straits over the past couple of years. And I expect all of that to continue in 2023.\u00a0 I'd note that since the Pelosi trip, China is now at a new normal in terms of military exercises vis a vis Taiwan. There's a higher tempo, more aggressive level than we saw before the trip. And I don't think that's going to change. But despite all that tension I do not believe that China is going to initiate an attack on Taiwan in 2023 or any time soon after that. There's one caveat to that, which is that China would, I believe, respond militarily to a major policy mistake in either Taipei or Washington. Say Taiwan declares independence or say we walk away from our one-China policy, neither of which I expect to happen. But if one of those two mistakes were made, then I believe China would respond militarily.\u00a0 What's the best way to think about Xi's thinking on Taiwan. A former CIA China analyst who I really respect, John Culver, really one of the best in the business, has coined the phrase, which I think is exactly right. John says, for Xi at this point, Taiwan is a crisis to be avoided. Not an opportunity to be gained. And I think there's really a couple of reasons for that. One is Xi has big domestic issues that he needs to attend to. Most importantly ensuring that China can continue to grow its economy and ensuring that China avoids the middle income trap. Solving those systemic problems we talked about earlier, that is going to determine his legacy more than anything else. If Chinese growth goes south under his watch, that is what will be on his tombstone. If he succeeds in making China rich, then that's his legacy. And second, and I think this is really important, and I think a lot of people don't understand this, is China is not yet prepared to attack Taiwan at a high enough level of confidence of success. And attacking Taiwan and losing would probably be the end of the road for any Chinese leader. MICHAEL ALLEN: So he's deterred. It's too big of a gamble MICHAEL MORELL: That is exactly the point. He's deterred right now. What do they need to have more confidence? They need more amphibious lift to move troops across the straits. They need more nuclear weapons so that they can be seen by us as being able to go toe to toe with us on the nuclear front in a Taiwan crisis. And they need enough economic decoupling from us so that China could more easily, whether broad based U.S. sanctions that would follow a Chinese invasion. That's what I think they're trying to pursue.\u00a0 And I think the point about them not being ready was captured best by Xi himself. When he ordered his military to be prepared to take Taiwan by force by 2027. He was admitting that he has doubts that he can do it today. So if you think about, and this is this is probably the most important point on China-Taiwan, so what's the right policy approach for the United States? And you said it. Focus on deterrence. Focus on ensuring that in 2027, 2030, 2035, whatever year you want to pick, that any Chinese leader is going to continue to have real doubts about their ability to take the island.\u00a0 And I think that means three things. It means building our military capabilities at an aggressive pace. It means helping Taiwan build the right military capabilities at an aggressive pace. And it means continuing to build our coalition of allies who would be willing to stand up to Chinese aggression against Taiwan. Deterrence. It's really simple. My assessment of what we're doing on this front is that we're heading in the right direction, but that we're not moving fast enough, and we're not moving aggressively enough. So I want to see us be more aggressive in pursuing that deterrence. MICHAEL ALLEN: So we see people all the time say, another reason we need to win in Ukraine is to send a message to Xi Jinping, a demonstration effect about sanctions and just what the West can do when provoked. Do you buy that or do you think Xi Jinping is just marching to his own tune? MICHAEL MORELL: No, I think the outcome of the war in Ukraine matters. The Chinese study everything, and they will study this. This will be in some Chinese working group leading group on something. They'll actually study this. But they don't know the outcome yet. We talked earlier about if the West were to pull its support from Ukraine, Russia could still win. And we talked about if the West gave Ukraine the support it's looking for, Ukraine could win. Sooner than most people think. So we don't know the outcome yet, which means that China really isn't in a position to come to any conclusions. But I think it matters. The outcome in Ukraine absolutely matters to the way Xi thinks about Taiwan. MICHAEL ALLEN:\u00a0 I want to go to Iran in just a second. But were you surprised? Give me a quick answer, by Xi Jinping's rapid rollback of China's anti zero COVID policy. MICHAEL MORELL: So this is a bit embarrassing. Surprised? No. Shocked? Yes. I really thought that Xi would not relent and that Xi certainly would not want to rip the Band-Aid off all at once. So I got that wrong. Got to admit it. Got it wrong. And I think one of the lessons here, and we sometimes forget this again, when we're looking at authoritarian countries, I think the lesson here is that public opinion in China matters. It does influence policymaking. I first learned about this when I was briefing President Bush in 2001, and we had the EP-3 crisis in March of that year. And I learned it a couple of times since. But I keep forgetting it because it's so easy to think of Chinese leaders doing whatever they want to do. One way to think about this is that if they could just do whatever they wanted to do, they would not need to use censorship and they would not need to use propaganda to shape the views of its public, which of course, they do every day. So public opinion in China matters, and this is a great example of it. MICHAEL ALLEN: Turns out welding your own people into their apartments is unpopular even in China. MICHAEL MORELL: Yeah, how about that? MICHAEL ALLEN: On Iran. Tell us about the protests that have broken out. They seem broad based, or at least they've been ongoing. Maybe not broad based. Is it enough to bring down the regime? MICHAEL MORELL: I think the really important point about the protests of the last several months is that they are the latest in a series of protests that have occurred since 2017. There's been a number of them. The demands of the protesters have been different each time. But there's a common theme. And the common theme is that there's a significant and growing share of Iranians, mostly young Iranians, who feel alienated, is the right word I think, who feel alienated from their government. Who are much more modern, much more reform minded than their leadership. That's the common theme. Having said that, there's also a large share of Iranians who are supportive of the regime and many Iranians who don't have a view one way or the other. Just like here in the United States.\u00a0 Current Iranian president Raisi, a hard liner, got 18 million votes, and he got 78% of the vote in the last presidential election. So there is support for this regime. My strong guess, Michael, is that this round of protests is not going to result in any significant political change. Some of the protests since 2017 have fizzled out. Some have been snuffed out. The 2019 protest was crushed by the security forces. This one, because it has involved women. And I think that really matters here. This one, because it's involved women, has been handled a bit more adroitly on their part. There's been some crackdowns. There's been some concessions. There's been some interesting work behind the scenes where they'll arrest somebody and then they'll let them out and they'll go to their family and they'll say, hey, you need to ]make sure your kid doesn't come out in the street and protest. So they've handled this, in a different way because so many women are involved.\u00a0 I'd make two final points. One is that you never know when a situation can turn in a radical new direction. For example, one of the key turning points in the fall of the Shah was a 1978 theater fire that killed 400 people in Abadan, Iran. And so you never know, right, what might happen tomorrow that could take this out of control. Just an important point, important reminder. And second, and this is really important, too, and this kind of goes with the Russia point. No one should assume that the fall of this regime would lead to an Iran that approaches the world in a very different way. We've got to remember that just like the Iranian leadership today, the Shah wanted Iranian hegemony over the entire Middle East. The Shah was interested in the acquisition of nuclear weapons. So this is not just the policies of an ideological regime. These are Persian policies that have been in place for literally hundreds of years. MICHAEL ALLEN: Fascinating. All right. I want to ask you one more question about Iran, and then I'm going to give you the off the wall what are we not thinking about question. But let's talk about the nuclear deal. Right now, Biden says it's not happening. The State Department says it's, quote, not on the agenda right now. But the way I look at things is that the Iranian regime could be a threshold nuclear power. And lo and behold, you look back in Israel and Bibi Netanyahu is back in charge. And if I remember correctly, there was a lot of time spent in the second term of the Obama administration talking Bibi out of bombing Iran. What do you think? Do you think it's possible they're going to go to war? MICHAEL MORELL: Great question. I think the probability of war between Iran and Israel has gone up as a result of the outcome of the Israeli election. The formation of the most hardline conservative government, probably in Israel's history. And while the probability is still low, it is for 2023, I think, the most likely place where we could see a new major war break out. I think there's two dynamics to think about when assessing the probability of an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities. One is the status of Iran's nuclear program. I think, Michael, you said something really important. I think it's fair to say that Iran is closing in on what many of us have long thought its goal is, which is to be a threshold nuclear power. That is to have the necessary pieces for a nuclear weapon and that they can put them together quickly. I think we're getting very close to that if we're not there already. Talking about this can get technical very fast and I don't want to do that. But if Iran wanted to detonate a nuclear device in the Iranian desert for all the world to see, which would change the dynamic in the region overnight. They could probably do so in a handful of months, particularly if they took some shortcuts on the nuclear weaponization work that they halted several years ago and still need to do.\u00a0 And the Israelis know all this. They watch this more closely than they watch anything. And what's happening with the Iranian nuclear program creates an incentive for the Israelis to act. Creates exactly the same incentive that Netanyahu saw ten years ago. The other dynamic, which I think pushes the Israelis in the other direction, pushes them away from military action, is that Israel still can effectively destroy all of Iran's nuclear facilities on its own. They would need the help of the United States, and I don't think the Biden administration would provide it. And without that help, the Israelis could not destroy everything they need to destroy Iran, would certainly produce a nuclear weapon in response to being attacked, and they would blame it on Israel's attack.\u00a0 And they would have that talking point to use in the world. Therefore, I think there's voices in Israel urging caution and there's voices in Israel urging or arguing that aggressive covert action rather than a military strike is the way to go in dealing with the Iranian nuclear program. So I think there's a push and pull here and we'll see how it plays out. But I think it is absolutely the place to watch in terms of a new conflict in 2023. MICHAEL ALLEN: Okay. Last question for now. We've already talked about big issues, but what's the thing we're not thinking of? Is it another terrorist attack? I think I saw you say that on Face the Nation. Is there something about the economy, after all I remember that you were trained as an economist at the CIA. What is the big thing that's possible that's going to happen in 2023 that we're not talking about? MICHAEL MORELL: So what I said on Face the Nation was that I would not be surprised if there were a terrorist attack against a U.S. interest, an embassy, a military facility somewhere in the world in 2023. And I think that surprised a few people who are looking at that terrorism front as kind of quiet. We don't hear about terrorism much anymore. But the truth is that terrorists around the world are bouncing back, which is not surprising because it's actually very easy for a terrorist group to rebound. It's very easy to degrade them, when you put pressure on them, it's very easy for them to rebound, when you take that pressure off. And so terrorists are bouncing back. And nowhere is that more true than in Africa, where Al Qaeda and ISIS occupied vast swaths of territory and where they terrorize and they brutalize civilians.\u00a0 Two of Al Qaeda's five major hubs are there. Half of ISIS's affiliates are in Africa. These groups are acquiring military equipment, weapons, explosives, drones. So far, there hasn't been an attack against U.S. interests, but there certainly could be. There's an ISIS resurgence going on in the Middle East, which is not getting a lot of news. But there's been four major ISIS attacks in Iraq since mid-December. Again, not against U.S. interests, but that could change.\u00a0 And then there's Afghanistan. We know that the emir of Al Qaeda in the Indian subcontinent and his deputy and the top recruiter are all in Afghanistan. The even bigger problem now in Afghanistan is ISIS. It's thriving. It's conducting frequent high profile attacks there. And what's particularly worrying about ISIS in Afghanistan is that they're recruiting fighters from neighboring countries. And, of course, that raises the concern that those foreign fighters could return to their home countries and conduct attacks against Western interests. So all of this is happening, right, Michael, at a time when we're taking our foot off the counterterrorism gas pedal as we focus on Russia-Ukraine. There's resources flowing away from counterterrorism. I know that we're walking away from some important foreign partnerships. I've had foreign governments, representatives of foreign governments complain to me about that, that they're worried about that. So I'd say terrorism is something to worry about in 2023 that most people might not be thinking about.",

            "article_content": "Voters in Virginia's 4th Congressional District will cast their ballots Tuesday in a special election to fill the open seat previously held by the late Democratic Rep. Donald McEachin, who died in November soon after he had been elected to his fourth term.  Democratic nominee Jennifer McClellan is widely favored in the race. She's a veteran state legislator who if elected would be the first Black woman to represent Virginia in Congress. She faces Republican pastor Leon Benjamin, a Navy veteran who has espoused conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic and election fraud. \"Jenn's going to win this race,\" Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine predicted Saturday at a rally for McClellan in Richmond.  Virginia's Democratic-leaning 4th Congressional District has its population center in the capital city and stretches south to the North Carolina border. McEachin had represented it since 2017. McClellan easily clinched her party's nomination after a high-speed, one-week campaign in December. She won a four-way firehouse primary with about 85% of the vote. A 50-year-old corporate attorney, McClellan has represented parts of the Richmond area in the General Assembly since 2006, when she joined the House of Delegates. In 2017, she was elected to the state Senate, filling a seat previously held by McEachin, following his election to Congress. In 2021, she unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor.  At the Capitol, McClellan has cultivated a reputation as a deeply knowledgeable legislator and consensus builder. She's carried many of Democrats' top legislative priorities in recent years, including bills that expanded voting access and abortion rights and legislation that set ambitious clean energy goals. During this campaign, McClellan has largely avoided discussing her opponent, whom she has far outraised, focusing instead on touting her record and pushing get-out-the-vote efforts. She and Benjamin have not met for a joint appearance.  Benjamin previously lost twice to McEachin, including by 30 points in 2022.  On the campaign trail and in media appearances, he has pledged if elected to address inflation, reduce government spending and promote school choice. He has also said he opposes American support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.  \"With the education, with the crime, I can't keep saying that enough: Families don't care about Ukraine. Families care about their children's education and who's going to keep them from getting shot in the streets,\" he said in a recent interview with right-wing radio host John Fredericks. At Saturday's rally with Kaine and other elected officials and volunteers, McClellan said that in Congress she would prioritize the same issues she's worked on at the state level.  \"Now I get to go to Congress and fight for reproductive freedom. I get to go to Congress and fight for voting rights, for worker rights, to protect our environment and for clean energy. And I'm so excited to be able to take my now 18-year record and passion for public service and level up,\" she said.  Early voting has been underway since early January. Polling places will be open Tuesday from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. ",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Joe Manchin that aired on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, March 5, 2023.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to begin the show with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, who joins us from Charleston, West Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator. I want to start on-- SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Good morning, Brennan. Thank- Margaret, thanks for having me.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on that derailment. The President last week praised bipartisan railway safety legislation that would have new rules for trains carrying hazardous materials, increase fines for safety violations, phase in newer cars. Will you vote for it? Is that sufficient? SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, so I'm going to be supporting that. We need to do it. Back in 2015, in Mount Carbon, in West Virginia, we had a derailment, 27 cars, tanker cars carrying Bakken oil, fell- went off the tracks and derailed and exploded and caused a tremendous problem there, and it was very, very dangerous. It could have been a little- a lot worse, if it had been a little farther down the tracks could have torn up a whole town. But with that, you know, we were recommended that the electronic pneumatic brakes should be something- should be considered that might prevent this, routine maintenance checks and auditing and things of this sort. I don't think any of that has been done. And it's time for us to get serious about this. We're moving many, many products, many more products on the rails and on our roads than we ever did before. And we have a lot of people who don't want any pipelines. Pipelines would help alleviate a lot of this problem with the oil that we need in our country and we will be using for quite some time to do it safer. But out of sight out of mind they thinking, if you don't have a pipeline, you won't be using the product. Well that's far from the truth. And this is the results of people just not making good decisions. And it's what's broken in- in- in West Virginia and- and-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: It's what's broken across the country as far as in Washington, the politics.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I want-- SEN. MANCHIN: It's broken, it needs to be fixed.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to come back to energy in a moment. You're saying it's broken. You gave a pretty fiery speech a few days ago in Senate. You're at odds with the White House and with many in your own party because you are saying that Democrats need to talk about out of control spending and are refusing to negotiate. You did ding Republicans for not offering specific cuts. If you are the deal maker, you seem to be positioning yourself there, where is it that you see room for negotiation? SEN. MANCHIN: Well, Margaret, first of all, I encourage Speaker Kevin McCarthy, I was hoping that he would, first of all take things off the table that doesn't cause a conflict, but most- most importantly, sit down with the President and reached out to the White House, they did sit down, had a meeting. I'm encouraging much more of that. But where we can do is can't we get together and just talk about how do we have this much debt accumulated this- and this short of a period of time, within 10 years, Margaret, we have accumulated the greatest amount of debt in the history of our country in the shortest period of time. Can't we at least find out what we did and how we expanded? I know that COVID did so much of it. But you know, we're past the COVID-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: problems. And what we need to do is to get back to normal, but we've gone from $3.5 trillion in spending to over $6.2 trillion in spending every year in the last 10 years. That's just unacceptable. You've got to sit down. Anybody that thinks we don't have a problem in Washington, anybody that thinks that the politics is not broken in Washington is not living in reality does- does not want to face the facts-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: - and the truth.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So- so what is the truth here? Because Social Security and Medicare make up nearly 40% of spending in 2023. If no one is touching those programs, where are you finding the cuts? SEN. MANCHIN: Well, first of all, just do our job on time. We've been told that if we just had a budget done, we don't even have a budget anymore. The President's is- is a month late in putting his budget out, which will come out next week. But I don't see the House or the Senate bringing a budget forward. And basically by a piece of legislation was passed back in 1985, we're supposed to have our budgets-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: - from the House and the Senate done by April, the first. The President basically submits his in February. And by September the 30th. I'm told there's billions and billions of dollars of savings, just right there if we just do it on time.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure. But that's not -\u00a0 (CROSSTALK)\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: That's why I say it's not working. That's-\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: But that--\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: gets a downward trajection basically, and--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, more has to be done--\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: How about capping some of the--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: done than that. I mean-- SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah-- MARGARET BRENNAN: You know--\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: capping some of the discretionary spending.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You okay, well, there's a lot to talk about right there. But I want to ask you, what is Joe-- What is Joe Manchin looking for in this deal? Are you looking for your permit- permitting reform, for example, that Democrats didn't deliver on though they had told you that you would have an agreement on? Are you looking for that to be tucked into a potential bill, in this agreement that you're saying has to be struck between Republicans and Democrats? SEN. MANCHIN: Well, rather tucking something in, we're not trying to hide anything basically we don't do permitting and we're not permitting reform in America, we're not going to meet the challenges and be energy independent energy secured. If you're not energy secured, you're definitely not going to be a superpower of the world. And depending on other parts of the world, to provide what you won't do for yourself. That has to be done. I don't care what side of the arena you're on if you want transmission, if you want pipelines, if you realize we're going to have a balanced energy proposal, that's what the Inflation Reduction Act was for energy security, the administration, this administration has touted that as strictly an environmental bill. It's good for the environment. But it's also very, very necessary for us to have the fossil energy using it better and cleaner than anywhere in the world, to have the security we need. That's what we need to do. And that's what they've been avoiding.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. SEN. MANCHIN: You have to have permitting, if not all this is going to be voided.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what appears to be some separation between you and the President. You were quoted a few days ago as saying, \"We're just in different ball games, we're not even in the same ballpark on many things.\" Are you going to endorse Joe Biden if he runs for reelection? SEN. MANCHIN: Oh, there's plenty of time for the election. This is the problem with America right now. We start an election every time there's a cycle coming--\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, he's the leader of your party. SEN. MANCHIN: I- I- No, the bottom line is, let's see who's involved. Let's wait until we see who all the players are. Let's just wait until it all comes out. My main purpose right now is to work for my country and my- and my state. That's my responsibility. I'm not going to make my announcement for anything until the end of the year. I'm not going to make a decision, what my political position is going to be or where I'm going to do for my political future. I won't do it until the end of the year. I got too much work to do now.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Your political future? You mean the question of whether you personally are going to run for re-election in the Senate in West Virginia. Your Republican Governor Jim Justice says he's going to run for your seat or he thinks he's got a good shot at it. Why haven't you made up your mind? SEN. MANCHIN: As to- the bottom line, I got plenty of time to make up my mind. The election is not until November 2024. We don't even file until January of 2024.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep.\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: And to be running and basically not basically looking at the problems you have. We've got a runaway debt, we got inflation-- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: - that's killing people. We've got an unsecured energy. We have a border that's out of control. You're telling me we're in the same ballgame, in the same ballpark? I don't think so. MARGARET BRENNAN: You said let's see who all the players are when it comes to running for president. You've said you're not running for president. Is that an open question, though? Who? Who do you think?\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: I didn't say that. I didn't say anything about that. The bottom line is I will make my political decision in December, whatever it may be.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: To run for President?\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: I'm not taking anything off the table, and I'm not putting- and I'm not putting anything on the table. I said I'll make a decision in Jan- at this - at the end of this year.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You'll make a decision at the end of this year as to-- SEN. MANCHIN: Simply that.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: - as to who you will endorse for president--?\u00a0 SEN. MANCHIN: What my political future will be.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: No but for president--? SEN. MANCHIN: What I will be involved with, how I'll be involved. I will be making any decisions I make politically will not be done until the end of the year. I'm focused on fixing what's wrong with Washington and the politics are so toxic. The more you talk about this party, that party, what candidate and this candidate. Look at what you have facing you right now. You've got inflation. You've got basically energy. You've got this unsecured borders. You've got geopolitical unrest, and we're talking about everything but that. MARGARET BRENNAN: We are- we have a lot to talk about and Senator Manchin, you're welcome back. We got to leave it there because-- SEN. MANCHIN: I'm happy to come back, Margaret, anytime.",

            "article_content": "Tallinn, Estonia\u00a0\u2014 Belarusian investigators are using a photo of an opposition politician shaking hands with former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as evidence in a criminal case tied to the mass protests after Belarus' disputed 2020 presidential election.  The Investigative Committee of Belarus on Friday published the photo of Andrey Dzmitryeu, who ran in the election against authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko and is now facing up to four years in prison over his involvement in the protests. In a statement it said the picture with Clinton \"may indicate that his activities were coordinated from abroad.\" \u00a0 Dzmitryeu, a 41-year-old activist and leader of the Tell the Truth opposition movement, was detained by security forces Wednesday and has been charged with \"organizing riots.\" He is being held in the Okrestsina jail in Minsk, which became notorious after rights activists alleged that participants in the 2020 protests were tortured and humiliated there. The Investigative Committee did not specify when or under what circumstances the photo of Dzmitryeu and Clinton was taken, but claimed that the politician had \"crossed the state border of Belarus 599 times, 33 of them after 2020.\" Both the Belarusian opposition and Western countries denounced the 2020 election, which gave Lukashenko another term in office, as rigged. Authorities in Minsk responded to the protests with a massive crackdown that saw over 35,000 detained and thousands beaten by police. Dozens of media outlets and non-governmental organizations were also shut down. According to official Belarusian election data, Dzmitryeu placed fourth with 1.2% of the vote, while Lukashenko got over 80%. During the election campaign, Dzmitryeu repeatedly voiced his support for opposition figures barred from running. \u00a0 According to Belarus' Viasna human rights watchdog, there were 1,445 political prisoners in the eastern European country as of early January. Opposition leader Svetlana Tsikhanouskaya, who many believe was the real winner of the 2020 election, condemned Dzmitryeu's arrest and claimed in a Twitter post that \"on average, 17 people are detained every day in Belarus.\"\u00a0 \"I am alarmed by the arrest of another presidential candidate from Belarus,\" Tsikhanouskaya, who now lives in exile in Lithuania, said on the social network. \"The dictator seems busy taking revenge on his real or imagined opponents - even moderate politicians like Andrey Dzmitryeu.\"",

            "article_content": "The following is a transcript of an interview with GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio that aired Sunday, Jan. 22, 2023, on \"Face the Nation.\" MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Ohio Congressman Mike Turner, he is expected to head up the House Intelligence Committee. Good morning to you.\u00a0 REP. MIKE TURNER: Good morning Margaret, thank you for having me.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: So we have this development in regard to the further materials that were found at President Biden's Delaware home. What is your reaction? And what does it signify to you that no one realized that this classified material was missing, some of it dating back to his Senate years? REP. TURNER: This is really incredible. And as you know, congratulations to you, we would not know anything about this if it hadn't been that CBS had broken this story. The White House nor the Department of Justice had shared any of the information with the public. And this really is one matter, we wouldn't have this issue if it hadn't been for Biden's Attorney General did- making the decision to raid former President Trump's house looking for- for classified documents that were being held there. What's amazing about all this is it takes us to the question of why were these documents here? Well, now that we learned that some of these go back to his Senate time, you know, clearly he's- he's become a serial classified document hoarder. Why did he have these? Who did he show them to? I mean, the only reason you can think of as to why anyone would take classified documents out of a classified space at home is to- is to show them to somebody. Who did he show them to? This is going to be crucial, I think, to the special counsel's investigation, is why did the president have these documents? Who did he show them to him? And is it connected to the Biden family businesses?\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know, the differences of course, too. I want to talk about the Biden situation. But just to clarify, when you reference President Trump, there were 300 classified documents, there was a warrant, there was refusal to comply in terms of handing things over and the White House and the president's lawyer are pointing out that in the case of Biden, he granted permission, and this was consensual for the DOJ to come in and search. Does the fact that the Justice Department conducted the search signify anything more to you and do you have any insight into the sensitivity of the documents?\u00a0 REP. TURNER: Sure, absolutely. I think this looks more like a cover up than an investigation. \u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any facts to back up your- your allegations that he was hoarding things in terms of intention to take classified material versus it's been characterized that it was somehow accidental? Do you have any insight into what these materials were?\u00a0 REP. TURNER: Well, they didn't fly to his home without him. They went on a train with him from the- his Senate offices and then in boxes that he was in charge of. The chain of custody here is going to be important, because we know that these were in Joe Biden's hands and Joe Biden's control, then ended up behind his Corvette in his garage and in his office, that he did not control and also throughout his house, so the special counsel is gonna have to deal with the issue of what was the chain of custody? Who had these? Why did he take them to begin with? When did he get them? When was he handed these documents? And what did he do with them? And this is a real critical question to all this, why did he have these documents to begin with? And that is why the special counsel's work is going to be really important, because I can think of no reason why the president should have taken home, as a senator or as vice president, any classified documents that clearly have no protection. They're available and open to anybody.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You have also before this development asked for a briefing from the Director of National Intelligence. You set a deadline of Thursday, do you have any further reason to believe they will meet that deadline, that you will get any insight into these materials? REP. TURNER: Well we'll have to see, but what's critical here-- MARGARET BRENNAN: They haven't responded?\u00a0 REP. TURNER: --And this is very important, this is what's very important to all of this, Margaret, and that is the FBI and the national archivists were working completely independent of the intelligence community, or the Department of Defense. They claim this was all an issue of national security, but they did not speak to anyone who's involved in national security. MARGARET BRENNAN: So no response yet from the intelligence community? REP. TURNER: I have not received a response, no.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. I also want to ask you what leadership looks like with Republicans in charge. You are also on House Oversight. REP. TURNER: Right. MARGARET BRENNAN: Of the 26 Republican members on the committee, 19 of them denied the results of the 2020 election. Your colleagues now include Marjorie Taylor Greene, Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert, Scott Perry. They all played critical roles in - in the former president's attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. Do you have any concerns about working with these lawmakers? I mean, you're very much a centrist. REP. TURNER: Well, you know, even on the Democrat side, there's been a number of people who objected to President Bush's reelection and voted against certifying his election. MARGARET BRENNAN: I am asking about you, your party, and your colleagues. (CROSSTALK) REP. TURNER: There's a long history of both sides, having raised issues, including, you recall, the- Al Gore taking President Bush's election all the way to the Supreme Court. (CROSSTALK)\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: You are not an election denier by CBS standards just to be clear. REP. TURNER: I am not, and I work with both sides of the aisle, and there are election deniers on both sides of the aisle. MARGARET BRENNAN: You are comfortable with all those individuals I just rattled off and the fact that the majority of the Republicans on this committee denied the election results. Is that what you are saying?\u00a0 REP TURNER: What I'm comfortable with is -the electorate are very smart. And these people have been sent to Congress to represent their districts and to be part of the congressional debate- MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. REP TURNER:\u00a0 -to lead us to what's going to be bipartisan, bicameral resolutions. We have a split government right now, Republicans control the House, the Senate is controlled by the Democrats, you have a Democrat president. We're going to have a lot of debate and discussions. And I think this is going to be a very fruitful period for- for Congress and for our country, because it's going to have to be bipartisan, bicameral, and I believe that the president in opening negotiations with Republicans is beginning to start that process.\u00a0 MARGARET BRENNAN: What is actually possible in this bipartisan, bicameral situation? What can you actually get legislation through on?\u00a0 (CROSSTALK) REP. TURNER: Depending on what the pending- what the president's willing to do, I think it's unlimited. Right? We have really tough issues right now. We have out of control inflation. We have an open border and record people crossing our border. MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 What about gun control? REP. TURNER: We have -we have the issue of Russia, and certainly in Ukraine, and certainly China, I think we're going to have a number of issues that we're going to have to deal with. MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Congressman Turner, we have to leave it there today.\u00a0 REP. TURNER: Thank you, Margaret.",

            "article_content": "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has warned that if Russia manages to capture the town at the center of what's been the longest and, by most accounts, the bloodiest battle of Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine, it could doom his country's chances of preventing Moscow from redrawing the border of democratic Eastern Europe by force. Speaking with The Associated Press, Zelenskyy said that if Bakhmut were to fall, Putin could \"sell this victory to the West, to his society, to China, to Iran,\" as leverage to push for a ceasefire deal that would see Ukraine agree to give up territory.  \"If he will feel some blood \u2014 smell that we are weak \u2014 he will push, push, push,\" Zelenskyy told the AP. He appeared acutely aware of the risk that his country could see its vital support from the U.S. and Europe start to slip away as the 13-month war grinds on.  \"Our society will feel tired\" if the Russians notch a victory, he said. \"Our society will push me to have compromise with them.\" Ukraine's forces, backed by increasingly lethal waves of Western weaponry and financial support, have managed to hold Russia's invading forces at bay, even clawing back some occupied ground over the last six months. Zelenskyy knows the West's support is dependent on political leaders from Washington to Berlin continuing to accept his assertion \u2014   voiced to CBS News even before last year's invasion \u2014 that Russia's attack on Ukraine is also a direct threat to the entire democratic Western world. As the U.S. gears up for a national election that could dramatically change the level of that support, the Ukrainian leader stressed its importance. \"The United States really understands that if they stop helping us, we will not win,\" he told the AP.  For now, the help keeps coming.\u00a0 Heavy tanks donated by the U.K. and Germany arrived this week and are already being prepped for deployment to the front lines that stretch right across eastern Ukraine.\u00a0 While Russian forces have pushed that line to carve into Ukrainian territory near Bakhmut in the south, further north, around Ukraine's second largest city of Kharkiv, Ukraine's forces pushed the invaders back onto Russian soil after their quick advance early in the war. Holding that line are the battle-hardened soldiers of Ukraine's 209th Battalion. Far from any halls of power, the earthen walls of trenches protect the troops as they keep a vigilant watch over the front line. \"I'll hate Russians for the rest of my life,\" said one soldier as he peered over the lip of the trench at the Russian positions in the distance.  Lieutenant \"Lord,\" his call sign, has fought since the first day of Putin's full-scale invasion, when thousands of Russian forces poured across Ukraine's northern and eastern borders, including into the Kharkiv region.  Putin's new threat, issued this week, to deploy \"tactical nuclear weapons\" on fighter jets and ballistic missiles just across Ukraine's northern border in Belarus, now hangs over the troops east of Kharkiv. Eyeing Russian land over the horizon, the Ukrainian soldiers were dismissive, describing Putin as an old man hurling empty threats. \"It's just blackmail,\" said a sergeant named Alex, \"because of fewer and fewer Russian victories.\" \"He can deploy them on the moon,\" his fellow soldier Zvyaga joked about Putin's nuclear weapons. \"Grandpa forgot to take his pills.\" Soldiers rotate in to man the trenches for three to five days at a time. There are few human comforts on the frigid, muddy front lines. \"I try to keep my humanity,\" Zvyaga told CBS News. \"I just want to finish and go home, have a wife, have a child.\" The soldiers were optimistic that with an expected Ukrainian counteroffensive this spring, Ukraine will win the war, and their country and the line they're holding will continue to stand as a shield for democracy around the world.

The governor's stance puts him in line with former President Donald Trump and at odds with other top Republicans and potential 2024 candidates who have shown ardent support for Ukraine. \"While the U.S. has many vital national interests \u2014 securing our borders, addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, achieving energy security and independence, and checking the economic, cultural, and military power of the Chinese Community Party \u2014 becoming further entangled in a territorial dispute between Ukraine and Russia is not one of them,\" DeSantis said in a statement to Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Carlson sent six questions to potential GOP presidential candidates about the war in Ukraine. Trump, DeSantis, former Vice President Mike Pence, biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answered the questionnaire. Several, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, did not respond, and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley released her answers publicly Tuesday. Trump\u00a0told Carlson that opposing Russia in Ukraine is in Europe's strategic interest, but not for the U.S. He also repeated his claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if he were president. When asked if there's a limit to funding and material he'd send to Ukraine, Trump said it would \"strongly depend on my meeting with President Putin and Russia.\" He also called for European countries to boost its support, and said he would tell Ukraine \"that there will be little more money coming from us, UNLESS RUSSIA CONTINUES TO PROSECUTE THE WAR.\" In an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity on his radio show last week, Trump said he would have negotiated a deal for Russia to \"take over\" certain areas of Ukraine. DeSantis is widely seen as Trump's chief rival in the race for the GOP presidential nomination, and their positions on U.S. policy toward Ukraine reflect the shift among some Republicans who oppose additional assistance to Ukraine. Haley took note of the similarity between DeSantis and the former president on Ukraine, and suggested Trump \"is right when he says Governor DeSantis is copying him.\" \"I have a different style than President Trump, and while I agree with him on most policies, I do not on those. Republicans deserve a choice, not an echo,\" she said in her answer. \u00a0 Other prospective GOP presidential candidates have called on President Biden to do more to help Ukraine fight Putin, exposing a rift within the party ahead of the next election. Former Vice President Mike Pence said last month that the U.S. and its allies need to \"accelerate the pace of military provisions\" for Ukraine until it defeats Russia. \"While some in my party have taken a somewhat different view, let me be clear: there can be no room in the leadership of the Republican Party for apologists for Putin. There can only be room for champions of freedom,\" he said in a speech delivered one year after Putin launched the invasion. \"The fastest path to peace is to help Ukraine win the war.\" Haley, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump and launched her campaign last month, has warned a Russian victory would have global implications.\u00a0 \"This is a war about freedom. And it is a war we have to win,\" Haley said during a town hall in Urbandale, Iowa, last month. \"If we lose this fight for freedom, Russia has said Poland and the Baltics are next and then we've got a world war.\" In response to Carlson's questionnaire, she said opposing Russia in Ukraine is a vital American strategic interest, and the nation is \"far better off with a Ukrainian victory than a Russian victory, including avoiding a wider war.\" \"If Russia wins, there is no reason to believe it will stop at Ukraine. And if Russia wins, then its closest allies, China and Iran, will become more aggressive,\" Haley wrote.\u00a0 But she pushed back against sending \"cash or blank checks\" to Ukraine, as well as deploying U.S. troops to respond to the conflict. \"Along with our allies in Europe and elsewhere, we should provide conventional weapons that enable Ukraine to effectively stop the Russian invasion and occupation of its land,\" Haley added. Scott, who has been visiting early presidential primary states since late February, said \"degrading the Russian military is in our vital national interest,\" but added there cannot be a \"blank check\" policy for aid.\u00a0 Pence, Haley and Scott are aligned with other Republican leaders, namely Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell\u00a0said last month providing assistance to Ukraine \"is not an act of charity\" by the U.S. and NATO allies and urged the Biden administration to \"act more decisively\" to make sure assistance to Ukraine \"take place at the speed of relevance.\" Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who campaigned alongside DeSantis during their reelection bids last year, said the U.S. has a national security interest in Ukraine. \"There are things we can do and should do to further that interest by helping them. It's not an unlimited interest. It's not $60 billion every six months,\" he told radio host Hugh Hewitt. \"But there are things we can do and should do, and that our partners in Europe should do more of as well, and are doing. And I do think there's some importance to it, and I think those of us who feel that way have an obligation to sort of explain to people how this fits in the broader overall package.\" Asked about DeSantis' stance, Rubio said, \"I don't know what he's trying to do or what the goal is. Obviously, he doesn't deal with foreign policy every day as governor.\" In his response to Carlson, DeSantis criticized the Biden administration for continuing to provide economic and military assistance to Ukraine, claiming Mr. Biden's commitment to helping Ukraine defend itself \"distracts from our country's most pressing challenges.\" \"We cannot prioritize intervention in an escalating foreign war over the defense of our own homeland, especially as tens of thousands of Americans are dying every year from narcotics smuggled across our open border and our weapons arsenals critical for our own security are rapidly being depleted,\" the Florida governor said. While he acknowledged \"peace should be the objective,\" DeSantis objected to U.S. assistance that would require American troops on the ground and ruled out providing F-16 fighter jets and long-range missiles. \"These moves would risk explicitly drawing the United States into the conflict and drawing us closer to a hot war between the world's two largest nuclear powers,\" he wrote. \"That risk is unacceptable.\" Trump criticized DeSantis' latest comments late Monday night, telling reporters traveling with him after an event in Iowa that the governor is \"following what I am saying. It is a flip-flop. He was totally different. Whatever I want, he wants.\" The U.S. has been the leading provider of military, economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, and Congress has approved more than $112 billion for the nation through four government spending packages.\u00a0 But with a divided Congress, it's unclear whether another aid package can clear the GOP-led House. Speaker Kevin McCarthy told Punchbowl News in October that Republicans would not support a \"blank check\" for Ukraine if the party won control of the House. Fin Gomez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Port-au-Prince\u00a0\u2014 Gang members on the outskirts of the Haitian capital stopped a bus arriving from the Dominican Republic and kidnapped more than two dozen passengers, Dominican new outlets said Thursday. Haitian police said they couldn't confirm how many of the 37 passengers were taken hostage, the owner of the bus line, Roosevelt Jean-Francois, told Haitian media, but Dominican newspapers quoted the neighboring country's defense ministry as saying the driver had made it back across the border with a harrowing story of how he and a handful of others escaped from the gang.  Gunmen intercepted the bus from the Capital Coach Line on Wednesday at around 2:30 p.m. local time, a Haitian national police official told AFP on the condition of anonymity.  Law enforcement officials said they recovered at least seven people who were on board the bus, as well as the vehicle. But the driver was taken by the bandits. A bus line attendant was injured in the attack, Jean-Francois said. That information largely corroborated the version of events reported by Dominican newspaper Listin Diario, which cited the country's Ministry of Defense as saying Thursday that the driver was received at a border crossing earlier in the day. The driver, identified as 32-year-old Johan Antonio de la Rosa, reportedly told authorities that he, a female conductor and passengers were forced into another vehicle by the gang. According to the account attributed to the defense ministry, that vehicle ran out of gas, and de la Rosa, the conductor and a handful of Haitian passengers used the opportunity to flee. The two employees made it to an office of the bus company in Haiti, said Listin Diario, before the driver was brought to the border crossing to return home. The female conductor was shot during the escape, according to the account, which has not been confirmed by Haitian officials. She was given emergency treatment by first responders and later transferred to a hospital in chaos-wracked Haiti for treatment. Her condition was not clear on Friday. Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste reported that a total of nine people escaped from the kidnappers, but it was unclear whether any of the passengers who got away were still free on Friday. Nor was there any further information on the fate of the more than two dozen passengers apparently captured by the gang. Powerful criminal gangs have taken to plundering cargo convoys and seizing hostages on the route between Port-au-Prince and the Dominican border in recent years. In May 2022, a bus belonging to another company operating between Santo Domingo and Port-au-Prince was hijacked by members of a gang. Gunmen held passengers captive, including eight young Turkish citizens, who were released after more than a month in captivity.  The assassination of President Jovenel Moise in July 2021 has left the country to descend rapidly into a complete security void, with gangs controlling huge swathes of territory, including in the capital Port-au-Prince, and the government seemingly powerless to respond. The de-facto president, Ariel Henry, is serving with no formal mandate as the security situation has made it impossible to hold long-overdue elections, leaving virtually no sitting lawmakers in nation's congress. \"It's a collapse,\" Patrice Dumont, one of 10 senators who departed from their offices this month upon the end of their congressional mandate, told NPR this week.",

New Hampshire GOP chair Chris Ager said in a statement to CBS News that \"we are looking forward to hearing the Governor's message.\" The news was first reported by Fox News.\u00a0 DeSantis visited Iowa and Nevada, two other states that hold early nominating contests, over this past weekend for his \"Freedom Blueprint\" tour to promote his new book and talk about his record in Florida.\u00a0 In Las Vegas over the weekend, DeSantis touted his state's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, saying \"the elites got everything wrong about COVID.\" \"We refused to let our state descend into Faucian dystopia,\" he said. He went on to say the \"Fauci decrees\" weren't about health or science but about politics.

            "article_content": "The House Freedom Caucus launched its opening salvo in the upcoming fight over raising the nation's debt ceiling Friday, as members of the conservative group said they would agree to raise the debt limit for the first time in their careers if several of President Biden's legislative accomplishments are rolled back and strict limits on government spending are implemented. \"Members of the House Freedom Caucus, who have never voted for a continual debt ceiling increases, will support a solution to responsibly address the impending debt ceiling crisis,\" said Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Scott Perry, the group's chairman, in a press conference Friday. \"Simply put, the plan is to shrink Washington and grow America.\" Many in the Freedom Caucus, which numbers over 40 members, were among the detractors who sought concessions from Rep. Kevin McCarthy before agreeing to support his election as House speaker \u2014 and others ultimately voted \"present\" rather than support him. The Republican majority in the House is a slim one, just 9 votes. Without the Freedom Caucus' support, McCarthy risks a rebellion from his right flank. Perry and other members of the Freedom Caucus expressed confidence that McCarthy would not cut a deal with Democrats to raise the debt ceiling. The group wants to hold spending levels at 2022 fiscal-year levels for 10 more years, which it says would save $3 billion in the long term. In the near term, the caucus members want to pull back money already appropriated by the Democratic-led Congress during the first two years of Mr. Biden's term, taking aim at some of his signature legislative accomplishments: blocking his $400 billion student loan forgiveness plan, which is currently making its way through the courts, pulling back unspent COVID-19 funds that haven't yet been allocated, recouping $80 billion for the IRS to bolster its workforce and replace retiring employees and cancelling billions of dollars allocated for climate change projects through the climate, health care and tax law passed last year. The group also proposes policies it says will help domestic growth \u2014 by limiting the administration's ability to write new regulations and ending other rules related to domestic energy production. The Freedom Caucus also wants to see the implementation of 1990s-era work requirements on welfare programs that passed under President Bill Clinton. The group unveiled its plan a day after President Biden unveiled his $6.9 trillion budget, which the White House claims would reduce the deficit by nearly $3 trillion over the next decade by raising trillions of dollars in taxes on the wealthy and corporations. House Republicans have not yet released their budget, but McCarthy has rejected the notion of a \"clean\" debt ceiling increase with no spending cuts. The president and speaker last met in early February to talk about spending. In a statement, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called the Freedom Caucus proposal \"a gut-punch to the American middle class\" that wouldn't reduce the deficit. \"Extreme MAGA Republicans' proposals would ship manufacturing jobs overseas, in a crushing blow to states from Ohio to Georgia to Arizona \u2013 and would provide a windfall of economic benefits to China,\" she said. She went on to say that they would cut Medicare, defund police, weaken U.S. efforts to compete with China and cut border security funding \u2014 all to provide tax breaks to corporations and the wealthiest Americans. Perry insisted that under this plan, \"the benefits under Social Security and Medicare are not going to be cut.\" \"A default on our debt would trigger an economic and financial catastrophe,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee Friday. \"I urge all members of Congress to come together to address the debt limit without conditions and without waiting until the last minute.\" The Congressional Budget Office estimates that at a date between July and September the U.S. will be unable to meet its debt obligations if Congress does not act.

            "article_content": "Tallinn, Estonia\u00a0\u2014 A Belarusian court on Friday sentenced Ales Bialiatski, Belarus' top human rights advocate and one of the winners of the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize, to 10 years in prison. Bialiatski and three other top figures of the Viasna human rights center he founded were convicted of financing actions violating public order and smuggling, Viasna reported Friday. Valiantsin Stefanovich was given a nine-year sentence; Uladzimir Labkovicz seven years; and Dzmitry Salauyou was sentenced to eight years in prison in absentia. Bialiatski and two of his associates were arrested and jailed after massive protests over a 2020 election that gave authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, a close ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin, a new term in office. Salauyou managed to leave Belarus before he was arrested. \u00a0 Lukashenko, who has ruled the ex-Soviet country with an iron fist since 1994, unleashed a brutal crackdown on the protesters, the largest in the country's history. More than 35,000 people were arrested, and thousands were beaten by police. After coming under international criticism for brutally stifling free speech and political dissent, he Lukashenko then allowed Putin to use his country as a launchpad for Russia's war on Ukraine, which shares borders with both nations. The Belarusian leader has continued to allow Russian forces to stage and train on his soil since Putin launched his war on Feb. 24, 2022, and he's made it clear that if required, Russia could again use Belarus to launch a new offensive against Ukraine. Lukashenko has said could also send his own country's forces into Ukraine to join Russia's war directly, but only if Ukraine attacks Belarus first. That has raised concerns in the U.S. that Belarus or Russia could fake or baselessly claim such an attack as a \"false flag\" to use as a pretense for Belarusian forces to join the war. While Russia and Russian-backed forces fighting in eastern Ukraine have pushed a new offensive in recent weeks, with a particular emphasis on trying to capture the eastern industrial town of Bakhmut, so far American officials have seen no indication that Russia is again massing forces or military hardware in Belarus for another major ground offensive from the north, as it did prior to the full-scale invasion a year ago.\u00a0 During Bialiatski's trial, which took place behind closed doors, the 60-year-old\u00a0 and his colleagues were held in a caged enclosure in the courtroom. They have spent 21 months behind bars since the arrest. \u00a0 In the photos from the courtroom released Friday by Belarus' state news agency Belta, Bialiatksi, clad in black clothes, looked wan, but calm. \u00a0 Viasna said after the verdict that all four activists have maintained their innocence. \u00a0 In his final address to the court, he urged the authorities to \"stop the civil war in Belarus.\" Bialiatski said it became obvious to him from the case files that \"the investigators were fulfilling the task they were given: to deprive Viasna human rights advocates of freedom at any cost, destroy Viasna and stop our work.\" The sentencing of @viasna96 human rights defenders today - including #NobelPeacePrize laureate Ales Bialiatski - is simply appalling. Ales has dedicated his life to fighting against tyranny. He is a true hero of #Belarus & will be honored long after the dictator is forgotten. pic.twitter.com/siSwoYGYWn Exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya denounced the court verdict on Friday as \"appalling.\" \"We must do everything to fight against this shameful injustice (and) free them,\" Tsikhaouskaya wrote in a tweet. \u00a0 The Norwegian Helsinki Committee, a non-governmental organization working to ensure that human rights are respected in practice, said that it was \"shocked by the cynicism behind the sentences that were just issued to our Belarusian friends in Minsk.\" \u00a0 \"The trial shows how Lukashenka's regime punishes our colleagues, human rights defenders, for standing up against the oppression and injustice,\" Secretary General Berit Lindeman said in a statement.",

The state visit by Lukashenko \u2014 a key ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin \u2014 comes after Beijing released a position paper on Russia's war in Ukraine insisting it is a neutral party and calling for dialogue between the two sides.  It also follows allegations by the United States and NATO that Beijing could be mulling sending arms to Russia as the conflict enters its second year. China has strenuously denied the claims.  Ahead of Lukashenko's visit, Beijing hailed its \"all-weather and comprehensive\" strategic partnership with Minsk.  In an interview with China's state-run Xinhua news agency, the Belarusian leader said he was looking forward to meeting with his \"old friend\" Xi. He also praised Beijing's position paper as \"a testimony to its peaceful foreign policy as well as a new and original step that will have a far-reaching impact all over the world\", Xinhua added. \"Today, not a single issue in the world can be resolved without China,\" Lukashenko said.  Xi has spoken to Putin several times since the war began, but has not done so with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Lukashenko is a close ally of Putin and has backed Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. China has repeatedly declared a neutral stance on the conflict, but has long supported Moscow with non-lethal aid, largely in the form of bolstered trade, to keep Putin's war machine running. The U.S. government, meanwhile, has voiced increasing concern that China may decide to start supplying Russia with lethal aid, such as arms or ammunition. Belarus shares a border with both Ukraine and Russia, but is financially and politically dependent on the Putin administration.  A year after allowing Russia to use Belarus as a launch pad for its Ukraine offensive, Lukashenko said he was ready to do so again if Minsk felt threatened.  Kyiv has also expressed concerns that Belarus could again support Moscow in its war effort.  In September last year, Xi and Lukashenko met in the Uzbek city of Samarkand, where they again hailed their \"all-weather\" partnership. Lukashenko's Beijing visit follows the announcement on Monday that the European Union had extended by one year sanctions on Belarus over Minsk's repression of political opposition and its support for Russia's war. The bloc has hit Belarus with multiple waves of sanctions since Lukashenko launched a brutal campaign of repression against demonstrators protesting a disputed election in 2020.  The sanctions have been extended until February next year, the European Council, which represents 27 EU member states, said in a statement.",

And this week on Face the Nation: As the war in Ukraine officially enters its second year, divisions between the competing global alliances are getting even sharper. Are we heading into a new Cold War?  We spoke exclusively with CIA Director Bill Burns at the CIA on Friday. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will give us her world view. And we will talk with the chairs of a new congressional committee created to investigate threats to the U.S. from the Chinese Communist Party.  It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.  Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.  It was a high-stakes week on the foreign policy front. President Biden took a daring top secret trip to Kyiv to mark one year of the war in Ukraine. Chinese President Xi moved closer to Russian President Putin, while the U.S., NATO and most of Western Europe doubled down in their support for Ukraine.  On Friday, we traveled to CIA headquarters in nearby Langley, Virginia, where we sat down with CIA Director Bill Burns.  Here's part of our conversation.  (Begin VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: On the cusp of Russia's invasion, you flew to Kyiv, and you told President Zelenskyy -- tell me if this is right -- the Russians are coming to kill you.  Was that the very first thing you said?  WILLIAM BURNS (CIA Director): It wasn't the very first thing I said to President Zelenskyy.  But President Biden had asked me to go to Kyiv to lay out for President Zelenskyy the most recent intelligence we had, which suggested that what Vladimir Putin was planning was what he thought would be a lightning strike from the Belarus border to seize Kyiv in a matter of a few days, and also to seize an airport just northwest of Kyiv called Hostomel, which he wanted to use as a platform to bring in air -- airborne troops, as a way, again, of accelerating that lightning conquest of Kyiv.  And I think President Zelenskyy understood what was at stake and what he was up against. MARGARET BRENNAN: You also have said -- and tell me if this is correct -- that it was only a group of about three or four people around Vladimir Putin who knew that he was actually planning this invasion.  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: Mm-hmm. No, I think that's true. Putin had narrowed his circle of advisers, and it was a circle in which he prized loyalty over competence.  It was a group of people who tended to tell him what he wanted to hear. That was one of the deepest flaws I think, in Russian decision-making just before the war is, it was such a close circle of people reinforcing one another's profoundly mistaken assumptions.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Does he take counsel from anyone these days?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: I think he's become increasingly convinced that he knows better than anyone else what's at stake for Russia.  I think his sense of destiny, and his appetite for risk has increased in recent years as well.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You recently went back to Kyiv, and you met with President Zelenskyy. And three months ago, I understand you met with Russia's top spy chief.  Is there any kind of opening that you are finding here, any kind of opportunity?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: No, I mean, the conversation that I had with Sergey Naryshkin, the head of Russia's external intelligence service, was pretty dispiriting.  My goal was not to talk about negotiations. That's something that Ukrainians are going to need to take up with the Russians when they see fit. It was to make clear to Naryshkin and, through him, to President Putin the serious consequences should Russia ever choose to use a nuclear weapon of any kind as well.  And I think Naryshkin understood the seriousness of that issue, and I think President Putin has understood it as well.  MARGARET BRENNAN: There's not a lot of contact with Russia right now.  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: There's not a great deal; you're right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you still have that line of communication with your counterpart?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: Yes.  And I -- and I think, even in the most deeply adversarial relationships -- and that's certainly what our relationship with Russia is today -- it's important to have those lines open. And the president believes that. MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you walk away from those conversations with? You said it was dispiriting.  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: Mm-hmm.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: There was a very defiant attitude on the part of Mr. Naryshkin as well, a sense of cockiness and hubris, reflecting Putin's own view, his own belief today that he can make time work for him, that he believes he can grind down the Ukrainians, that he can wear down our European allies, that political fatigue will eventually set in.  And, in my experience, Putin's view of Americans, of us, has been that we have attention deficit disorder, and we'll move on to some other issue eventually. And so Putin, in many ways, I think, believes today that he cannot win for awhile, but he can't afford to lose.  MARGARET BRENNAN: He doesn't seem to have that assessment, though,  I mean, 97 percent of his ground force is in Ukraine.  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a meat grinder. Does he just look at his population and say, I have enough young men I can continue to send off to die?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: He's...  MARGARET BRENNAN: I mean, what is the price that makes him change his mind?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: He's -- Putin is certainly not a sentimentalist about the loss of Russian life or the huge losses that he's taken in terms of Russian armaments as well during the course of the war.  But there's a lot of hubris that continues to be attached to Putin and his view of the war right now. And I think what's going to be critical is to puncture that hubris on Putin's part and regain momentum on the battlefield.  I don't think the Russians are serious today. And I think it's only progress on the battlefield that's going to shape any improved prospects for negotiations down the road.  MARGARET BRENNAN: At what point does Putin say, I can't win? DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: I think Putin is right now entirely too confident of his ability to wear down Ukraine, to grind away.  And that's what he's giving every evidence that he's determined to do right now. At some point, he's going to have to face up to increasing costs as well, in coffins coming home to some of the poorest parts of Russia. There's a cumulative economic damage to Russia as well, huge reputational damage. It has not exactly been a great advertisement for Russian arms sales.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: So this is going to build over time, but, right now, the honest answer, I think Putin is quite determined.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what appears to be potentially a new line of ammunition and weapons for Russia.  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: Secretary Blinken has said publicly we have begun to see -- we have begun to collect intelligence suggesting that China is considering the provision of lethal equipment.  That's not to suggest that they've made a definitive conclusion about this.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Blinken said that the U.S. had picked up information over the last couple of months. But picking up information over the last couple of months to thinking they're actively considering it, I mean, how confident are you in the intelligence that this is something Xi Jinping himself may change his mind about?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: Well, we're confident that the Chinese leadership is considering the provision of lethal equipment.  We also don't see that a final decision has been made yet, and we don't see evidence of actual shipments of lethal equipment. And that's why, I think, Secretary Blinken and the president have thought it important to make very clear what the consequences of that would be as well.  MARGARET BRENNAN: To deter it?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: Yes, to deter it, because it would be a very risky and unwise bet.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why would Beijing risk a tailspin in its relationship with the United States and with Europe by crossing this line?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: It's a good question, and that's why I hope very much that they don't. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that Beijing benefits from having the West distracted and involved in a prolonged conflict in Europe...  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: I mean...  MARGARET BRENNAN: ... that that's the aim?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: It's conceivable.  But I think there's no foreign leader who's watched more carefully Vladimir Putin's experience in Ukraine, the evolution of the war, than Xi Jinping has.  MARGARET BRENNAN: What are the consequences for the conflict in Ukraine if this does happen? What does more ammunition and more weapons mean? Does this -- is it a game-changer?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: We also have evidence that the Iranians are providing lethal equipment and munitions, that the North Koreans are doing the same thing as well.  So, wherever that lethal assistance comes from, it prolongs a vicious war of aggression.  MARGARET BRENNAN: How good is our visibility into Xi Jinping's thinking and his decision-making process?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: Oh, it's always the hardest question for any intelligence service as well, you know, in -- in an authoritarian system where power is consolidated so much in the hands of one man.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But you had such exquisite intelligence when it came to Russia and Vladimir Putin and his inner circle. Do we have that for Xi Jinping?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: Oh, we work very hard to develop that.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Working on it?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: I think we work very hard to develop the very best intelligence we can.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But I wonder if, when you're talking about his thinking and his decision-making if he suffers from the same kind of yes-man culture that you said Vladimir Putin does, because Xi Jinping got rid of a lot of people in his government. DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: It's a -- Margaret, it's a concern in any authoritarian system.  And I think what we've seen in Beijing is President Xi consolidating power at a very rapid pace over the course of the more than a decade that he's been in power as well.  And as we've seen, where Putin's hubris has now gotten Russia, and the horrors that he's brought to the people of Ukraine in that kind of a system, a very closed decision-making system, where nobody challenges the authority of their insights of an authoritarian leader, you can make some huge blunders as well.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said Xi Jinping told his military to be prepared to invade Taiwan by 2027. The intel community seems a little bit more ambiguous in its conclusions here.  Do you think it's an outright invasion, or do you think China's more likely to slowly strangle democracy in Taiwan?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: We need to take very seriously Xi's ambitions with regard to ultimately controlling Taiwan.  That doesn't, however, in our view, mean that a military conflict is inevitable. We do know, as has been made public, that President Xi has instructed the PLA, the Chinese military leadership, to be ready by 2027 to invade Taiwan. But that doesn't mean that he's decided to invade in 2027 or any other year as well.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: I think our judgment, at least, is that President Xi and his military leadership have doubts today about whether they could accomplish that invasion.  I think, as they've looked at Putin's experience in Ukraine, that's probably reinforced some of those doubts as well.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I would be remiss if I didn't ask you when the intelligence community will have some insight into what Beijing was collecting with that spy balloon over the U.S.?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: It was clearly an intelligence platform.  And I think we'll be able to develop a pretty clear picture of exactly what its capabilities were.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But it will be a while, won't it?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: It takes some time, but I think my understanding is that we're managing to pull up quite a bit of evidence and material from that platform. MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think Xi Jinping knew that balloon was sent here?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: I don't know.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You have an idea.  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: Well, I think the Chinese leadership obviously understood that they had launched this capability, that it was an intelligence platform.  Whether -- when and what the Chinese leadership knew about the trajectory of this balloon, I honestly can't say.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said in the past, there's the beginnings of a full-fledged defense partnership between Russia and Iran. Exactly how far does the alliance go?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: Well, it's moving at a pretty fast clip in a very dangerous direction right now, in the sense that we know that the Iranians have already provided hundreds of armed drones to the Russians, which they're using to inflict pain on Ukrainian civilians and Ukrainian civilian infrastructure.  We know that they've provided ammunition for artillery and for tanks as well. And what we also see are signs that Russia is proposing to help the Iranians on their missile program and also at least considering the possibility of providing fighter aircraft to Iran as well.  So it's a quite disturbing set of developments.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Have Iran's leaders made the decision to pursue a nuclear weapon?  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: To the best of our knowledge, we don't believe that the supreme leader in Iran has yet made a decision to resume the weaponization program that we judge that they suspended or stopped at the end of 2003.  But the other two legs of the stool, meaning enrichment programs, they've obviously advanced very far, you know, over the course of the last couple years.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Eighty-four percent purity, reportedly.  DIRECTOR WILLIAM BURNS: They've advanced very far, to the point where it would only be a matter of weeks before they could enrich to 90 percent, if they chose to cross that line.  And also, in terms of their missile systems, their ability to deliver a nuclear weapon once they developed it, has also been advancing as well. So, the answer to your question is, no, we don't see evidence that they have made a decision to resume that weaponization program, but the other dimensions of this challenge, I think, are growing at a worrisome pace too. (End VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Our full conversation with Director Burns is on our Web site and our YouTube channel.  Face the Nation will be back in one minute with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, so don't go away.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with President George W. Bush's Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is the current director of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.  Good morning.  CONDOLEEZZA RICE (Former U.S. Secretary of State): Good morning.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Good to have you here.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: It's awfully good to be with you, too.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, when you were secretary of state, Bill Burns, CIA director, was U.S. ambassador to Moscow.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: That's correct, and, later on, undersecretary for policy at the State Department when I was still at State. So...  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you worked together very closely.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And I was reading his book recently, where he was talking about your head-to-heads with Vladimir Putin, who didn't like you standing in high heels, apparently, taller than he is.  (LAUGHTER)  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Right.  MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the serious matter, what do you make of the Biden administration's policy, the choices it's making and how they're using the CIA director as kind of the tip of the spear here? FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, I think, in general, in total, the policy is in the right direction.  You have to support Ukraine. You have to do it as much as you can as a part of a coalition. It's really important that the Europeans are on board. And I have been impressed with what they've been able to achieve with the Europeans in creating that -- that unity.  And, in a sense, NATO has never been in better shape. I do think -- and, look, it's a lot easier out here than it is in there. But I do think we sometimes seem to be a little bit behind in what we provide to the Ukrainians.  So, we were not going to provide air defenses, and then we did, tanks and - - and armor, and now we have. And so, if I could say one thing, to perhaps just to anticipate a little bit better what the Ukrainians are going to need, because it takes a long time to supply.  And as to Bill Burns' role, he's unique. I think he's walking a very fine line and doing a good job of it. He's an intelligence chief at this point, but he has vast experience in Russia. He knows the Russians. They know him. And so I think the signaling and the sending him to Moscow to talk with Naryshkin, for instance, or with Zelenskyy in Ukraine makes perfectly good sense with this particular director of the CIA.  MARGARET BRENNAN: When you talk about delivering weapons to Ukraine, you wrote an op-ed with former Defense Secretary Bob Gates talking about this, saying, have a dramatic increase in military supplies and capability.  Does that mean train them yesterday on the F-16s they'll need tomorrow? Is that specifically the piece of weapon -- weaponry you're focused on?  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, we weren't talking about a specific set of weapon systems, but I think the idea that you anticipate and, therefore, perhaps you start the training before it's going to be necessary to send that equipment.  The one thing we know is that this war keeps evolving.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: And you try to have to -- you have to try to evolve a little bit ahead of it.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So you think President Biden is being a little too hesitant?  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, I -- again, I don't know. Internally, we have issues with stockpiles. We have issues with our own -- own defense capabilities, because I don't think anybody expected to be fighting a land war in Europe. MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: And so I have some sympathy for that.  But to the degree that that can be accelerated, I think it will help, because I think we have to get away from the phrase time is on the Ukrainians' side. I would be careful about that. Vladimir Putin seems to believe the time is not on the Ukrainians' side.  He believes, if he throws in the Russian way of war, mass at the problem, poor boys from Dagestan who are just kind of cannon fodder, if he engages in terrorist activities against the Ukrainian population, he'll wear the Ukrainians down, he'll wear us down, he'll wear the Europeans down. I don't think that's right, but we have to do everything that we can to convince him that it is indeed wrong.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Russia invaded Georgia in 2008.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Yes.  MARGARET BRENNAN: At that time -- and I was reading these cables recently -- you and Bill Burns were going back and forth on Ukraine joining NATO and whether that crosses that red line for Vladimir Putin.  Do you think now, after all these years of waiting, that Ukraine should be allowed into NATO?  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, that's going to be a hard lift because of the Article 5 an attack on one is an attack upon all guarantee of NATO.  But I...  MARGARET BRENNAN: And no one wants to take that vote now?  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: That's right.  But I do think that what we've seen is that Ukraine is de facto now a very strong ally of NATO and vice versa. And I expect that's going to continue, because I think some form of security arrangements with -- with Ukraine will be necessary in the future, and it's probably good to start working on that now.  What we do know is that the -- that NATO itself is protected. The piece of territory that was not protected was Ukraine. And that tells you something about leaving a vacuum in the center of Europe. And so, whatever we do -- and I doubt it will be Article 5 -- we need to make sure that that vacuum isn't there in the future. MARGARET BRENNAN: At this early stage of the 2024 presidential race, foreign policy is already getting talked about a fair amount.  Former President Trump criticized the amount of U.S. funding for Ukraine. Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis, widely expected to run, said the U.S. cannot provide Ukraine an open-ended blank check.  They reject your point of view, in many ways, by saying the U.S. needs to kind of pull back here.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, I'm not going to put words in the mouth of future presidential candidates. We'll see where they -- where they end up.  But I will...  MARGARET BRENNAN: You mean Ron DeSantis?  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Right. But I will...  (LAUGHTER)  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: But I will say this.  It is really important that whoever runs for president of the United States understands the essence of this conflict, the fact that we are defending not just Ukrainian independence, but we're defecting a rule -- we are defending a rules-based system that says, might doesn't make right, you can't just extinguish your neighbor.  And, oh, by the way, for those who would say, oh, we ought to be concentrating on the Indo-Pacific because China is really our adversary, Xi Jinping is telling you what he thinks about that, because he is not only watching what is going on in Ukraine. According to our intelligence, apparently, he's even considering getting in on the side of the Russians.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think he would make that judgment?  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well...  MARGARET BRENNAN: Why is it in his interest to extend the war?  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: We have -- we have -- yes, so, I think we have to recognize that the Chinese-Russian relationship is perhaps more strategic than many of us had thought, that it really is a relationship that is aimed at the heart of U.S. power in the world. And that would say, then, these two are not divisible. So, if you want to say, let's just concentrate on the Indo-Pacific, that's not going to work. And oh, by the way, many of our allies, Australia, Japan, fundamentally understand that.  So, I would say to those who are going to run for office, be careful what you say. And I would just make one other point. If the American people see a world in which Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping have won this engagement, this first volley, if you will, in the larger strategic picture, and they see that Ukrainian independence has been extinguished, and they know that the United States could have done something about it, I don't think that's going to be a very good message for a future president to have to deliver.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that problem will come to his desk?  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Because that problem will come to his desk.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Or her desk?  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Or her desk.  And I would just say, just remember dates, 1914, 1941, 2001. These conflicts always come home.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Sobering warning there.  You've said, though, for the Republican Party, they need new leadership, a new generation. Do you have a leader in mind? U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, for example?  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: I think the Republican Party has a lot of very good prospects.  When I say we need leadership -- new leadership, I'm not coming back either. So I think it's really time for us to look at those who can -- can look at an American future. And there are a lot of very, very good candidates out there. Let's -- let's let everybody make their case and see where we -- where we end up.  MARGARET BRENNAN: To that question I asked you earlier about why it would be in Xi Jinping's interest to have destabilization in Europe, do you think it really is ultimately a long game for Taiwan, tie up the West in Europe, so he can expand in the Pacific?  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Well, that's pretty precise.  I think this is really more about weakening American power in the world. And one way that you do that, I don't think he would have chosen for Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine. MARGARET BRENNAN: Apparently, his intelligence didn't know.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: And it's become quite a mess as well. And your relationship without limits is with somebody who's causing all kinds of problems.  But I think what we have to convince the Chinese of is, this is, first of all, not in their interests...  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: ... because his primary interest is to grow the Chinese economy against headwinds that include, of course, a demographic disaster that they are having...  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: ... and strengthen Taiwan, so that it's not an easy target.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: It is not inevitable that -- that the Chinese win this battle.  In fact, I will bet on American democracy, American innovation, American strengths. But that isn't inevitable either that they will triumph.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Rice, thank you for your analysis today.  FORMER SECRETARY CONDOLEEZZA RICE: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: A new bipartisan House select committee is putting a focus on the geopolitical threat from the Chinese Communist Party.  Republican Mike Gallagher serves as the chairman and Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi is the ranking member. We will talk with them both when we come back. Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS) MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.  Stay with us.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.  We're joined now by the two leaders of that new House select committee on China, Congressman Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi.  Welcome to the program.  REP. MIKE GALLAGHER (R-WI): Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You have your first hearing on Tuesday. What is the message you both hope to send with it?  MIKE GALLAGHER: Well, first, let me say how excited I am to work with ranking member Krishnamoorthi. He is a hopeless Bears fan, but he is smart and clear eyed when it comes to the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party. And in addition to elucidating that threat, I want to send a message that committee's work is going to be bipartisan. Speaker McCarthy wants to be bipartisan. And I firmly believe that besides its own people, what the Chinese Communist Party fears most is the idea of Republicans and Democrats working together to counter CCP aggression.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the question is, can you maintain bipartisanship? The vote to create the committee was bipartisan, concerns bipartisan, but this spy balloon incident, things got very political very fast. How do you manage that?  REP. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI (D-IL): Well, I echo the chairman's sentiment. And though he is a Packers fan, I am glad to work with him.  Look, I think that you're absolutely right, that the spy balloon incident quickly became political. And, you know, unfortunately, some folks on the other side took it as an opportunity to bash the president with regards to the Chinese Communist Party, even though on the whole I think he handled it very well.  Mike is right that, you know, the Chinese Communist Party likes nothing better than to have divisions between Democrats and Republicans. In fact, their chief political theorist, a guy named Mr. Wong Huning (ph) has said that this is a huge weakness in America, that Democrats and Republicans don't get along. And so we have to get over that to be effective.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So help me understand the purpose of this committee. Because you have the House Foreign Affairs Committee, you have the Intelligence Committee. This committee was particularly focused, as I under it, on the communist Chinese party threat, including here in the U.S. So, what is the extent of the activities here in the U.S.? I know you, Congressman Gallagher, have been looking at police stations -- Chinese police stations on U.S. soil? MIKE GALLAGHER: Well, I think the Chinese spy balloon isn't -- illustrates perfectly that this isn't just an over there problem. This isn't just a matter of some obscure territorial claim in the East China Sea. This is a right here at home problem. This is a threat to our sovereignty.  So, yesterday, I went with a committee member, Democrat Ritchie Torres, to the site of one of these CCP police stations in the heart of New York being used to harass and surveil Chinese dissidents. We then met with a group of Chinese students on American campuses that have been subject to harassment, and in some cases physical assault. So, we may call this a strategic competition, but it's not a tennis match. This is about what type of world we want to live in. Do we want to live in Xinjiang light or do we want to live in the free world, where we're free from fear, free to speak our minds and free to choose our own future.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Xinjiang, you're referring to where there are concentration camps for Muslim minorities in China.  When you talk about those police station, 54 overseas police stations according to the Spanish-based human rights watchdog.  So, help me understand, how - I mean the State Department says they don't like this. The FBI doesn't like this. How is that possible that this is on U.S. soil?  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, unfortunately, there are certain non-profit organizations that the Chinese Communist Party has used to try to do espionage and to crack down on Tibetans, and Hong Kongers, and Uyghur activists. And we - I'm very glad --  MARGARET BRENNAN: Living in America.  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Living in America. In fact, my State of the Union guest was a Uyghur activist whose family has been imprisoned in China because she is speaking out against the genocide against Uyghurs in China. But one thing that I really want to bring to everyone's attention is that just at the same time that we are very concerned about the CCP going after Chinese origin people here, we have to make sure that in our conversations about Chinese origin people we don't engage in any stereotyping or questioning people's loyalty.  One of my colleagues, unfortunately, attacked, Judy Chu, the first Chinese American congresswoman in the United States Congress, saying that somehow she's not loyal to the United States. I find that offensive as an Asian American myself. And I want to hear Republicans also echo that sentiment that I just made because we have to make sure that in ourconversations in the committee, we stay out of xenophobia and we make sure that we keep the focus on the Chinese Communist Party. MARGARET BRENNAN: In fact, this was a bipartisan agreement to create the committee but House progressives voiced concerns because of what you just said. The vice chair of the Asian American Caucus said they fear it will feed into bigotry. So, how do you stop your work from being distorted?  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Well, I - I'd like to say that I'm hoping that the chairman will echo my sentiments with regards to Judy Chu and the attack on her. We can't go that route. Again, the Chinese Communist Party loves it when we are internally fractious, and they like it when we are stereotyping. We have to avoid that, and we have to hold the Chinese Communist Party available -- accountable for specific activities and deal with those.  MARGARET BRENNAN: I think he asked you to call someone out.  MIKE GALLAGHER: Well, let me say, we should not question anybody's loyalty to the United States. I think that is out of bounds. It's beyond the pale.  If there are concerns about a specific organization, and as a matter of fact the China Council for the Promotion of Peace Reunification isn't -- is tied directly subordinate to the united front work department of the CCP, then we should work with our colleagues to apprise them that they might be targets for CCP united front work, CCP influences. A former counterintelligence officer, I can tell you, we are a soft target in Congress.  But, absolutely, we shouldn't question anybody's loyalty. And going forward, I think what's critical, and the reason we actually got the committee renamed to focus on the Chinese Communist Party is to constantly make that distinction between the party and the people.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  MIKE GALLAGHER: And the people are often the primary victims of the CCP's aggression and repression.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I read in \"The National Review\" that you are going to require all of those testifying to disclose foreign ties, not just to the Chinese Communist Party, but given how extensive the ties are in the business community, that there is really no difference, according to U.S. intelligence between the state and the Chinese business community. Everyone's going to have to disclose this. I mean how do you reassure people that this doesn't steer into Joseph McCarthy territory?  MIKE GALLAGHER: Well, I -- Joseph McCarthy's from my district. He's buried in my district. We need not exhume his body and reanimate it. And I've written to the extent of, we must constantly be aware of going overboard as we try and win this competition with China. That being said, there are disclosure requirements similar for that for most committees for testifying. Our bar is slightly higher given the nature of our work. I'm confident we can work through the complexity. But, you're right, I think what makes this competition more complex in many ways than the old Cold War is, we never had to contemplate selective economic decoupling with the Soviet Unions because our economies didn't interact. This, in my mind, as sort of a military guy, is the most difficult area of competition, but we have to safeguard our own economy and make sure that we're not unwittingly financing genocide or PLA modernization.  MARGARET BRENNAN: PLA is the Chinese military.  So, is it true, you're calling in the NBA commissioner to testify?  MIKE GALLAGHER: We're hoping to have a conversation first with the NBA, with Disney, other companies that my constituents and others have voiced concern over. We haven't issued any announcement about hearings besides the one we're having on Tuesday night. But I think we can have a productive conversation with companies that have substantial business interests in China and we want to make sure that the power of the Chinese economy is not seducing certain companies into betraying American values.  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Can I just jump in?  MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have subpoena power?  MIKE GALLAGHER: We do.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you use it for corporations?  MIKE GALLAGHER: If we need to. I think -- if we want someone to testify and we believe their presence is essential to the committee function -  MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.  MIKE GALLAGHER: I want to do it in a bipartisan fashion.  MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.  Congressman.  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think at the heart of this committee we do not have a quarrel with the people of China.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: The - the differences that we have are with the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party. And indeed many of our businesses have ties with the Chinese economy where some of the most intertwined economies in the world.  The - the challenge for our committee, indeed our country is, how do we continue to engage the People's Republic of China, but at the same time protect ourselves, our values, our interests -  MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: And our alliances with our partners and friends and others in the Indo-Pacific region.  MARGARET BRENNAN: And I imagine your issues with Disney and the NBA have to do with things like changing messages to censor things that can't be said that are critical? Is that it?  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Sure.  MIKE GALLAGHER: Well, the NBC incident I think caught a lot of attention because here you had an NBA executive who merely tweeted support for Hong Kong protesters.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  MIKE GALLAGHER: And, remember, these people, in many cases, were out in the streets waving American flags. So they look to us for leadership. And then the NBA quickly moved to silence that. So, we just want to make sure that American companies are acting like Americans, and embracing American values like - like free speech and plurality and - and things like that. So that's -- that's the concern.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Krishnamoorthi, I know that when you got back, Congressman Gallagher from Taiwan, you issued a statement that was pretty scathing in terms of a backlog you said of weapons to Taiwan. Do you consider there to be slowness on the part of the administration or is this more of an issue with private industry just having such supply chain constraints right now?  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I think it's a little bit of the latter. I think under the Biden administration, and on a bipartisan basis in Congress, under the National Defense Authorization Act from the last Congress, we did - we took unprecedented steps to provide additional armaments under the Taiwan Relations Act under which we are obligated to provide articles of defense to Taiwan. But we need to do more because what we know is that the CCP, as you said in your last interview with CIA Director Burns, is -- wants to have the capability to successfully invade Taiwan by 2027, if not sooner. So that means we have to arm or help supply Taiwan's defense even more rapidly than we are right now.  For instance, by working with private industry to unwind supply chains, introduce more competition into the - into the mix to allow for smaller businesses and entities to provide more agile and nimble supplies of armaments. But the bottom line is, we've got to hustle because, at the end of the day, we want to discourage and deter aggression on the part of the CCP. MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're saying your intentions here are coming from a genuine place. The concern for policymakers sometimes is that they get boxed in by politics.  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Sure.  MARGARET BRENNAN: You know this.  And everyone running for president in 2024 is going to vow to be tough on China. So, how do you - how do you actually get something done in a space it's going to become really, really hot?  MIKE GALLAGHER: Well, I think we can identify sort of the bipartisan center of gravity on China. Listen, we're not nave. We're not going to agree on 100 percent of everything. And there's going to be meaningful disagreements within all the 2024 contenders.  But I want both sides, in some way, to look to the committee as the area for the most forward leaning, innovative and bipartisan policy in legislation on China. And I think there are things we can do.  When it comes to clearing the backlog, that's a bipartisan issue. It predates the Biden administration to be sure.  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Right.  MIKE GALLAGHER: But I emphatically agree with what Raja said about, if we want to prevent another collapse of deterrence across the Taiwan Strait, then we should be working to give Taiwan the resources and asymmetric weapons they need to defend themselves. So, I think we can be effective in that regard.  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Absolutely.  MARGARET BRENNAN: So, two questions. You want to hold a hearing in Taiwan, I read. Is that going to happen? And can you get TikTok banned, as you both are trying to do?  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Who goes first?  MIKE GALLAGHER: Yes.  Well, it would be -- technically you could do a field hearing in a - in a foreign country. So, you know, I've been to Taiwan. I think it's valuable for members to go there. I'm hoping to bring a bipartisan group at the appropriate time and perhaps we could do a field hearing in Guam on the way back. But again, we have our first hearing on Tuesday. We're going to pass rules the morning of. So, we've got to crawl a little bit, then walk, and then maybe we can run with our - our fan fancy field hearings.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the year TikTok gets banned?  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: I don't think it's going to get banned. I think what we're asking for is, you know, TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company, that's required to provide its user data, including on the 140 million Americans, as well as control of algorithms to the Chinese Communist Party upon request. All we're saying is, if TikTok is going to operate here -  MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Don't have that user data and algorithms controlled by an adversarial regime.  MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. We will be watching your hearing on Tuesday.  Thank you very much, gentlemen.  MIKE GALLAGHER: Thank you.  RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI: Thank you.  MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: The investigation of former President Trump in Fulton County, Georgia, took a strange turn last week. And Mr. Trump's lawyers now argue it could impact a possible trial. At the center of the controversy, Emily Kohrs, the forewoman for the special grand jury that investigated alleged election interference in Georgia by Trump and his allies. Kohrs gave several interviews in which she hinted that more than a dozen key players, perhaps even the former president, might have been recommended for indictments.  Now, special grand juries can't indict, but that recommendation could prompt the district attorney to create a criminal grand jury. The judge overseeing the case told CNN last week that although the deliberations are confidential, quote, what witnesses said, what you put in the report, those are not off limits to those on the jury.  The attorneys for President Trump in the Georgia case had not given an interview to any TV network, but the Kohrs media tour prompted them to talk to our Robert Costa. (BEGIN VT)  EMILY KOHRS, FOREWOMAN FOR THE SPECIAL GRAND JURY: I kind of wanted to subpoena the former president because I got to swear everybody in. And so I thought it would be really cool to get 60 seconds with President Trump.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Did you recommend charges against Donald Trump?  EMILY KOHRS: I really don't want to share something that the judge made a conscious decision not to share.  ROBERT COSTA (voice over): Could Emily Kohrs' public disclosures jeopardize the case that could be brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis? Kohrs is part of a special purpose grand jury that heard months of testimony from more than 75 witnesses about alleged Republican efforts to pressure state officials, like Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn President Biden's victory in Georgia.  DONALD TRUMP (Former U.S. President): Look, Brad, I've got to get -- I have to find 12,000 votes, and I have them.  ROBERT COSTA: Kohrs suggested the special grand jury submitted a report to Willis last month that recommended multiple indictments on a range of charges. But Willis has yet to decide whether or not to convene a criminal grand jury that could issue indictment against some Trump allies and even the former president himself.  Drew Findley and Jennifer Little head up the former president's legal team in the Georgia case. They say that Emily Kohrs' media tour has tainted any attempt by District Attorney Willis to move toward charging Trump.  ROBERT COSTA (on camera): What are your options?  DREW FINDLING (Defense Attorney, Former President Trump): Are the results of that special purpose grand jury to be crumbled up like a piece of paper and thrown into a waste paper basket? Our options are, can this district attorney's office continue to be part of this case? We have to legally research all of those issues.  ROBERT COSTA: Have you lost confidence in the district attorney?  DREW FINDLING: We've lost 100 percent confidence in this process. We feel this process has been compromised.  ROBERT COSTA (voice over): Emily Kohrs, they say, is not to blame. DREW FINDLING: This 30-year-old foreperson to us has actually provided us a lens and made us aware that every suspicion we had as to this questionable process was, in fact, a reality.  ROBERT COSTA (on camera): But she didn't break any rules, though, right? She may have break - broken a norm, but the grand jury was over by the time she went on this media tour, as you put it.  DREW FINDLING: Yes.  ROBERT COSTA: So, what did she do wrong, in your view, legally?  DREW FINDLING: We have no chagrin towards this foreperson. And it looks like they lost perspective over keeping separation between prosecuting attorneys and the members of this grand jury. There cannot be a relationship. When the foreperson uses the word \"we,\" that lets you know there's a relationship there. When she says in interviews certain battles were not worth us battling, it's not the special purpose grand jury that's litigating, it's the district attorney's office.  ROBERT COSTA: She said, it wouldn't be worth the battle they decided to call your client in, former President Trump in as a witness. That's the public statement she made.  DREW FINDLING: And - and - right. And - and who knows what that is based on.  ROBERT COSTA: He wasn't called in the special grand jury part of this investigation. Did that surprise you? And if he was called, would you have fought that subpoena?  JENNIFER LITTLE (Defense Attorney, Former President Trump): I'm not going to speak to what our legal decisions would have been. But it was surprising. And particularly once we heard the reasons why he wasn't called, when we had our foreperson of this grand jury speaking about how excited and cool it would have been to be able to look at Donald Trump, the former president of the United States, for 60 seconds, but that they just determined that given the resources and the other witnesses that they had heard of, that they just didn't need to have any more evidence at that point. It's concerning that that was the level of diligence that was shown in that decision. And it was surprising, frankly.  ROBERT COSTA (voice over): If former President Trump is indicted, Willis can certainly expect a legal battle from Trump's lawyers.  JENNIFER LITTLE: We absolutely do not believe that our client did anything wrong. And if any indictments were to come down, those are faulty indictments, we will absolutely fight anything tooth and nail.  ROBERT COSTA: Willis and the district attorney's office declined to comment. For FACE THE NATION, Robert Costa, Atlanta.  (END VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Friday marked one year of the war in Ukraine, a sobering day around the world. Our Charlie D'Agata was in Ukraine when the war started, and he filed this report from Ukraine for us.  (BEGIN VT)  MAN: It's up to you. I was thinking that this is the front line.  CHARLIE D'AGATA (voice over): We're taken to an unspecified front line position north of Bakhmut. Two things about Ukrainian soldiers, they're really sensitive about sharing locations for obvious reasons, and they really don't want us to get hurt.  MAN: (Speaking in foreign language).  D'AGATA: I'll go (ph).  MAN: This -- friend. Friend.  D'AGATA: Friend. Friendly fire?  MAN: (Speaking in foreign language).  D'AGATA: Some incoming. Some outgoing.  MAN: (Speaking in foreign language).  MAN: What do you want to do? This is the front line.  D'AGATA: I know.  D'AGATA (voice over): Stay those to the building, they tell us. Split up. Russian mortar teams aim for people in clusters. One of the soldiers was a mortar guy himself and said if he was on the other side he would have already launched a volley at us by now. So, we hurried to get on with the job.  D'AGATA (on camera): OK, let's try one.  The sound of explosions has been nonstop both outgoing and incoming. I mean this is the last Ukrainian held village before the Russian front line about three miles in that direction. Commanders tell us the front line has only moved a few hundred yards in the past couple of months. In some cases, the soldiers are holding off the Russians using no more than automatic weapons.  D'AGATA (voice over): This is what a stalemate looks and sounds like.  MAN: We need to wrap soon.  D'AGATA (on camera): Really?  MAN: Yes.  D'AGATA: Is it getting that hot?  MAN: They're really worried.  D'AGATA: The explosions haven't stopped the entire time that we've been here. Is it always like this?  MAN: Always.  D'AGATA: Always.  D'AGATA (voice over): If it feels like the world is growing weary of this senseless war after a year of fighting, imagine how Ukrainians feel.  We were here when the invasion began, when the capital itself was coming under attack. And each time we've returned, we've been shocked by the staggering and growing toll of the war.  Even in virtual ghost towns in Stargisaltiv (ph) in eastern Ukraine, the few residents who remain, still manage a kind of life, sustained largely with the help of volunteers, food, and aid from around the world.  Riesa Fativa (ph) survived the Russian occupation and the months of bombardment that followed when they pulled out and pummeled the neighbors. D'AGATA (on camera): So, this is when it began. This - this is the occupation.  WOMAN: (Speaking in foreign language).  D'AGATA: So, May, June, July, August, September.  WOMAN: (Speaking in foreign language).  D'AGATA (voice over): Getting aid to the other side of the river is more difficult. The Ukrainians blew up the bridge, forcing the Russian retreat.  D'AGATA (on camera): This temporary pedestrian bridge will do for now. They don't want to allow vehicles to cross in case the Russians try to come back.  D'AGATA (voice over): The sheer sadness and unnecessary suffering can be overwhelming. Just over a year ago, most of this country was at peace.  Overnight, the entire country was at war. A brutal war, with no end in sight.  (END VT)  MARGARET BRENNAN: Charlie D'Agata reporting from Ukraine.  We'll be right back.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)  MARGARET BRENNAN: The cleanup continues following that toxic train derailment that happened more than three weeks ago, but the EPA has ordered railroad operator Norfolk Southern to pause shipments of hazardous waste out of East Palestine. They will eventually resume, but under the oversight of the EPA.  Meanwhile, the CDC is on the ground as concerns linger about any long-term health effects from chemical exposure.  That's it for us today. Thank you for watching.  Until next week, for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.  (ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

            "article_content": "Inflation remains a concern, and Americans across the political spectrum want Congress to focus on it, amid the usual calls for bipartisanship from most of the nation. We also see splits within the Republicans' rank and file over how to best use their newly minted House majority, through cooperation or investigation, and on the impact of \"MAGA\" Republicans. For starters, big bipartisan majorities say Congress should address inflation, reduce crime, and protect Social Security and Medicare.\u00a0 But how to get there? Almost half of Republicans want their House delegation to work with Democrats on matters where they can find common ground, at least in principle. The other half want House Republicans to focus on stopping President Biden and Democrats. \"MAGA\" Republicans are especially likely to prioritize opposition, a stance that also puts them apart from Americans' views overall. Democrats, for their part, strongly want Mr. Biden and their Senate majority to work with House Republicans where they can. When we look at it by how voters cast their 2022 vote \u2014   and whether people might get what they voted for \u2014   those who picked Republican House candidates in '22 add U.S. energy production to issues they prioritize, along with securing the border. Those who backed Democrats, now in the minority, want abortion protections and the climate addressed, too. Beyond that, over half of today's Republican identifiers also put a \"high priority\" on the House investigating the president, and also his son, Hunter Biden \u2014   especially those who define themselves as part of the MAGA movement. Most Americans, and most non-MAGA Republicans, do not agree. MAGA Republicans today place an even higher priority on investigating President Biden and Hunter Biden than they do on reducing crime and increasing oil and gas production, issues the 2022 campaign had emphasized. (Just under half of Republicans label themselves as also part of the MAGA movement, as has been the case in surveys over the last year.) In the year ahead, Congress will need to deal with many issues that could be determined by divisions in a majority party. One example is funding for aid to Ukraine, which a large majority of Americans want their congressional representative to support. But on that, self-identified MAGA Republicans are even more opposed than the rest of GOP ranks. As the speaker battle went on, the Republican House was getting mixed marks from the voters who backed Republicans in 2022, in interviews before the voting wrapped up late Friday night. But the party base was more positive \u2014\u00a0 with self-identified MAGA Republicans particularly approving. Most rank-and-file Republicans want to see at least some party loyalty toward Donald Trump. That extends beyond just the former president himself: Republicans overwhelmingly want the party to follow Trump's policies and his views on 2020 \u2014   so there's been little reassessment on that front since a year ago. This hasn't changed since the election, despite many of Trump's endorsed candidates and many election deniers having lost in November, and with views of Trump having proved net-negative for voters overall in the midterms. And regarding views on past elections \u2014   views on the state of democracy were also central to the 2022 contest, and concerns remain for most. But the election appears to have at least moved views in a more positive direction, as the idea that it is secure is up ten points from before the fall campaign. This uptick is driven by more Democrats feeling secure about democracy now. But that doesn't mean election denialism has gone away entirely. It's not nearly the level we see with regard to the 2020 election, but Republicans are four times as likely as Democrats to say 2022 wasn't legitimate, either. The ranks of that smaller group are disproportionately composed of\u00a0 self-identified MAGA Republicans, and Trump 2020 voters, who don't believe Democrats won the Senate. Two years on, rank and file Republicans still don't want to see condemnation of Jan. 6. Most prefer their representative not take a position either way. That, too, stands apart from Americans overall. And little has changed with the deep partisan differences after the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 events recommended the Department of Justice charge the former president. Democrats think the Justice Department should charge Trump with crimes. Republicans don't. The new House speaker, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, remains unknown to many Americans (putting him in company with other leaders in that regard). He has a net-negative view among those who do have an opinion but net positive ratings among those in his own Republican Party who do know him.\u00a0 Over the years, surveys have often shown many Americans either unfamiliar with or not having views on congressional leaders, even those who have served for a long time or who elicit strong views among the partisan. The outgoing speaker, Nancy Pelosi, is very popular with Democrats and unpopular with Republicans, while a quarter of Americans hold neither stance. Four in 10 have no view either way on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Incoming House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is the least known of the political figures asked about, but is favorably viewed by Democrats who do know him.\u00a0 This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,144 U.S. adult residents interviewed between January 4-6, 2,023. The sample was weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as to 2020 presidential vote.

            "article_content": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis laid into the federal government and Democratic-run states, and portrayed Florida as \"a citadel for freedom,\" \"where 'woke' goes to die,\" and as an overall model for the country, in the inauguration speech Tuesday for his second term. Desantis, who is often floated as a potential 2024 GOP presidential contender, ridiculed what he called a \"floundering federal establishment in Washington D.C.,\" highlighting the inflation rate, its response to COVID-19, and the migrant crisis at the southern border \u2013 all frequent criticisms of President Biden's tenure by Republicans nationwide. He said many Americans are \"pessimistic about the country's future.\" \"Florida is proof positive that we the people are not destined for failure. Decline is a choice. Success is attainable, and freedom is worth fighting for,\" he said.\u00a0 The governor contrasted himself with other Democratic-run states, noting Florida has a high net-migration rate, and he disparaged other states \"embraced faddish ideology\" exemplified by criminal justice reform that \"coddled criminals\" and \"medical authoritarianism in the guise of pandemic mandates and restrictions.\" \"The policies pursued by the states have sparked a mass exodus of productive Americans from these jurisdictions, with Florida serving as the most desired destination, a promised land of sanity,\" he said.\u00a0 DeSantis' inauguration speech to over 3,000 attendees was the only public event in a two-day affair to celebrate the beginning of his second term as governor, as well as an opportunity for political donors to get access and face time with the potential 2024 candidate.\u00a0 On Monday night, there was an intimate candlelit dinner with donors and members of the governor's cabinet that was catered by Carbone, an Italian-American restaurant that originated in New York City and opened a location in Miami during the pandemic, according to one event attendee. Before his speech, DeSantis held a \"Florida Faith Leaders Prayer\" event. Tuesday afternoon, Florida first lady Casey DeSantis held a \"Toast to One Million Mamas\" event to thank and recognize a coalition of women voters she worked to turn out during DeSantis' 2022 campaign. On Tuesday evening, there will be a larger inauguration ball with donors and supporters.\u00a0 There were inauguration fundraising packages that ranged from $25,000 to $1 million, with five of the $1-million-dollar packages available. The money raised will go to the Florida Republican Party.\u00a0 One attendee said there's a \"lot of energy and interest\" in this inauguration compared to past ones because of DeSantis' political stature heading into the 2024 election cycle.\u00a0 But Rick Wagner, a Florida Atlantic University political scientist, said DeSantis seemed to keep \"most of his powder dry\" by not making any obvious remarks suggesting a 2024 run.\u00a0 \"I think everyone wanted more clues as to the choices he's going to make about what he's going to do in the future, and I don't think he really gave us any of that,\" he said. \"He focused on the issues that he and his campaign believed were successful in Florida. And it's hard to argue too much with that, he had a very successful run.\" Florida was a bright political spot for the Republican party during an otherwise lackluster midterm performance in 2022. DeSantis' gerrymandered Congressional map helped the Republican party gain four more seats in the U.S. House and helped secure a thin majority. His nearly 20-point-win over Democratic Congressman Charlie Crist was the largest margin of victory for the position since 1982.\u00a0 DeSantis has proven to be an effective fundraiser as well, collecting nearly $200 million for his reelection effort, with $5.5 million of that coming in November 2022 alone.\u00a0 His campaign reported about $60 million cash on hand after his reelection victory, which could be transferred to a committee to support DeSantis if he decides to run for president in 2024.\u00a0 DeSantis batted down any plans for 2024 during his re-election campaign, focusing instead on the legislative session in 2023, where his new Republican supermajority could take action on everything from taxes, to what asset managers invest in, to constitutional carry of a firearm, to further abortion restrictions.\u00a0 Democrats already have their eye on DeSantis. Democratic National Committee spokesperson Ammar Moussa put out a statement before DeSantis' inauguration remarks that criticized the Florida Legislature's potential abortion ban bill and DeSantis' investigation into any \"wrongdoing\" related to the COVID-19 vaccines and its efficacy.\u00a0 \"As the 2024 GOP primary shapes up, it's clear Republicans will race to out-MAGA each other, and DeSantis is no different,\" Moussa said.\u00a0 The Florida Legislature is scheduled to convene in March and adjourn in May, after which DeSantis could potentially jump into the 2024 fray.\u00a0 Trump took aim at his potential primary rival in November 2022 when he called him \"Ron DeSanctimonious.\" DeSantis brushed it aside, and said in November 2022 \"at the end of the day, I would just tell people to go check out the scoreboard.\" Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",

            "article_content": "Lima\u00a0\u2014 Weeks-long protests that have killed dozens across Peru continued on Thursday, with escalating tensions in the Andean city Cusco prompting the government to preemptively close the tourist hub's airport. Supporters of ousted president Pedro Castillo have marched and barricaded streets around the South American country demanding new elections and the removal of current leader Dina Boluarte.  The demonstrations have at times turned violent and almost 50 people have been killed in clashes with security forces, including a police officer who was burned alive in a vehicle, while hundreds more have been injured. Different officials have given different death tolls this week, but most Peruvian outlets were saying at least 47 people had died amid the unrest.  Almost half of the victims died in clashes Monday night in the southern Puno region, where 17 people were buried Thursday. Major flashpoints have occurred near Peru's airports, which are guarded by security forces after protesters stormed runways during an initial wave of uprisings in early December.  In Cusco, the gateway city to Peru's tourism crown jewel Machu Picchu, the main airport was closed suddenly Thursday \"as a preventative measure,\" Peru's transportation ministry announced on Twitter.  The train connection between Cusco and the historical site has been suspended until further notice, the railway company said in a statement, citing safety concerns.  Clashes broke out Wednesday night in Cusco, the former capital of the Inca empire, with protesters attempting to enter the airport, while some torched a bus station, attacked shops and blocked train tracks with large rocks. Peru's rights ombudsman said one person died and more than 50 people, including 19 police officers, were injured in the turmoil, while police said they had arrested 11 people. Seventeen dead protesters were laid to rest Thursday in Juliaca, a city in the southern Puno region close to the Bolivian border. Gathered in a circle around a red coffin, relatives of one of the victims held posters reading: \"Dina corrupt murderer\" and \"we are not terrorists but citizens who demand justice.\" \"It is painful to lose a member of your family for fighting for your rights,\" 48-year-old Fidel Huancollo, whose cousin had died, told AFP.  A 16-year-old protester, hospitalized since Monday, died Thursday in Juliaca, bringing the total number of civilians killed there to 18.  Also on Thursday, trade unions, left-wing parties and social collectives marched through Lima, the capital that has largely been spared violence so far, to denounce a \"racist and classist... dictatorship.\" In addition to demanding Boluarte's resignation, protesters want Congress to be dissolved and a new body set up to rewrite the constitution \u2014 which was adopted in 1993 under the mandate of Alberto Fujimori. That former president is serving a 25-year prison sentence for crimes against humanity committed during his time in power.  The mass demonstrations broke out in early December after Castillo was ousted from office for attempting to dissolve Congress and rule by decree, seeking to prevent an impeachment vote against him.  Roadblocks remain in 10 of Peru's 25 departments, the transport superintendency said.  Boluarte, 60, was Castillo's vice president but took over once he was ousted on December 7.  Castillo, who was being investigated in several fraud cases during his tenure, has been remanded in custody for 18 months, charged with rebellion.",

One page talks about his 2016 campaign launch, highlights agenda items during his term as president such as his border, energy independence and respecting \"the rule of law.\" The other page in big bold letters reads, \"Iowa \u2014 Together, Let's Finish What We Started.\" Pompeo's page highlights his book, including a quote from him, and was paid for by the Champion American Values PAC, an organization chaired by Pompeo.\u00a0 Scott's page, which focuses on education and features pictures of Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and the Iowa congressional delegation, touts his work with Iowa leaders \"to help our students achieve their American Dream.\" The ad was paid for by his Senate campaign.\u00a0 Pompeo and Scott have not declared whether they're running in 2024, but they were active on the campaign trail for Republican candidates during the 2022 midterm elections. Last month, Pompeo told Fox News he is mulling his 2024 decision and said that he'd need to be \"hard at it\" by the end of the first quarter in 2023 if he does decide to run.\u00a0 Hutchinson also hasn't made a White House bid official, but made visits to Iowa and New Hampshire in the last year and was critical of Trump after the Jan 6 attacks on the Capitol.\u00a0 In a statement, Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann said, \"The Republican Party of Iowa welcomes any and all 2024 contenders to come and make their pitch directly to Iowans. Hosting the First-in-the-Nation Caucus is a crucial responsibility, and Iowa Republicans support the open dialogue and debate necessary for Iowans to make the most informed decision possible.\" Aaron Navarro is a digital reporter covering politics.",
