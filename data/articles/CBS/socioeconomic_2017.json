            "article_content": "NEW YORK --\u00a0New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was projected to be the winner of the Democratic primary\u00a0for mayor of New York City\u00a0Tuesday night, CBS New York reports. De Blasio was one of five Democrats running in Tuesday's primary. He was up against former City Councilman Sal Albanese \u2014 who appeared with him in two debates \u2014 as well as Richard Bashner, Robert Gangi and Michael Tolkin. Albanese conceded the race Tuesday night. With 64 percent of the precincts reporting, de Blasio had 162,719 votes or 73 percent, compared with 16 percent for Albanese, 5 percent for Tolkin, 3 percent for Gangi, and 2 percent for Bashner. The mayor will now face Republican Nicole Malliotakis in the general election. Former NYPD police officer and security expert\u00a0Bo Dietl\u00a0is also running as an Independent.\u00a0 De Blasio has significant advantages in the general election. Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than six to one among New York City voters who designated a party affiliation and he has already raised several million dollars. According to the latest campaign finance board figures, de Blasio has over $5 million cash on hand, while Malliotakis has $220,000 and Dietl had $269,000. \u00a0 Not everyone who crossed de Blasio's path was sympathetic earlier Tuesday. A chorus of protesters greeted de Blasio and First Lady Chirlane McCray as they arrived to cast their ballots at a library in Park Slope Tuesday morning. \"Mayor de Blasio is the mayor that made the promise and committed to close Rikers Island,\" protester Alfredo Carrasquillo told CBS New York. \"We're out here just making sure we hold him to his word.\" But there were voters who came out to support the mayor. \"I think he cares about all of us not any one borough or any one socioeconomic slice and I think that's important,\" one Brooklyn voter said. The mayor, seemingly unfazed, emerged from the library after voting. De Blasio said he has a lot of goals for another four years in office and hopes that despite projections of a low turnout that New Yorkers come out in large numbers to support him. \"I think that the election last year is going to start to change behavior in favor of turnout and participation,\" de Blasio told reporters. \"I think there's a lot of interest especially after 2016 in being involved and getting the message out.\" The mayor pointed voters to his record and his signature initiative, universal pre-K. \"The things we have done the last four years in an effort to bring more fairness and equality to New York City, stop-and-frisk down 93-percent, crime down as well,\" he said. Albanese, a lawyer and former city councilman, cast his ballot on Staten Island. He said he's confident despite being overwhelmingly outspent and out-marketed by de Blasio's team in advertising in the lead up to Tuesday. \"I'm not that concerned about it because people already know what Bill de Blasio has done as mayor, so none of the advertising is going to change that,\" he said. Some in de Blasio's home base in Brooklyn still openly supported him. \"He's learning to be mayor of the City of New York,\" said Park Slope resident Evan Bauer. \"Not all the initiatives have succeeded but I think he's doing the right thing.\" But other registered Democrats, like Matt Coogan, thought the mayor was a shoo-in and wishes there were more options on the ballot. \"He's gonna win,\" Coogan said. On the Republican side, Malliotakis, of Staten Island, is running unopposed. Among her attacks on the mayor was bashing his refusal to support public disclosure of donors who seek favors from City Hall. \"It sends a sign that New York City is for sale,\" she said. New York City also was holding primaries Tuesday for other local offices. One City Council race in Queens is attracting attention because of the candidacy of Hiram Monserrate, a former councilman and state lawmaker who was expelled from the state Senate after he was convicted of assaulting his girlfriend. Monserrate later served nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to fraud and corruption charges in a separate case. He faces state Assemblyman Francisco Moya in the Democratic primary.  Several other notable primary races were also being decided across the state.  Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan faced challenges from City Common Councilman Frank Commisso Jr. and Council President Carolyn McLaughlin, fellow Democrats.  In Syracuse, three Democrats were running to succeed Democrat Stephanie Miner, who is term-limited. They are City Auditor Marty Masterpole, city Councilman Joseph Nicoletti and Juanita Perez Williams, a former assistant state attorney general and former associate dean of students at Syracuse University.  To the west, Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren faced former journalist Rachel Barnhart and county lawmaker and former police chief James Sheppard in the Democratic primary.  In Buffalo, Mayor Byron Brown was considered the likely winner in a Democratic contest with City Comptroller Mark Schroeder and county lawmaker Betty Jean Grant.  The winners move on to the November general election.  And on Long Island, Nassau County Democrats were deciding the county executive primary matchup between Laura Curran and George Maragos. Republican Jack Martins, a former state senator, will be on the November ballot. Incumbent Ed Mangano, a Republican under federal indictment in a case in which he's alleged to have taken bribes, is not seeking another term. Mangano has pleaded not guilty.  Most party primaries in New York state are closed contests, meaning a voter must be a registered member of the party in order to cast a ballot.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "SEOUL, South Korea -- In a historic, unanimous ruling Friday, South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court formally removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil and worsened an already-serious national divide. Two men later died during protests against the court\u2019s decision, which capped a stunning fall for Park, the country\u2019s first female leader who rode a wave of lingering conservative nostalgia for her late dictator father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency crumble as millions of furious protesters filled the nation\u2019s streets. Demonstrators for and against the court\u2019s ruling took to the streets after it was handed down. Some of Park\u2019s supporters reacted with anger, shouting and hitting police officers and reporters and climbing on police buses used to create a perimeter to protect the court. Police say protesters also smashed the windows of several buses.  Anti-Park protesters celebrated by marching in the streets near the presidential Blue House, carrying flags, signs and an effigy of Park dressed in prison clothes and tied up with rope. An official from the Seoul National University Hospital said a man in his 70s believed to be a Park backer died from head wounds after falling from the top of a police bus. An official from the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital in Seoul said another man brought from the pro-Park rally died shortly after receiving CPR at the hospital. The hospital official couldn\u2019t immediately confirm the cause of death. Police and hospital officials said about 30 protesters and police officers were hurt in the violent clashes near the court. The nation\u2019s acting head of state pleaded with Park foes and backers to end the fierce demonstrations, which divided Seoul\u2019s streets. The comments from Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn came hours after the two deaths. Hwang has served as the government caretaker since lawmakers voted to impeach Park in December. Friday night, tens of thousands of South Koreans occupied a square in front of an old palace gate in Seoul to celebrate Park\u2019s ouster. Carrying signs and candles, the crowd cheered to speeches and swayed to music Friday night, while angry Park supporters of Park continued to scuffle with police in streets near the court. Park didn\u2019t vacate the Blue House on Friday as her aides prepared for her return to her private home in southern Seoul, according to the Blue House. Park wasn\u2019t planning any statement on Friday, it said. The ruling by the eight-member panel opens Park up to possible criminal proceedings - prosecutors have already named her a criminal suspect - and makes her South Korea\u2019s first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy replaced dictatorship in the late 1980s. It also deepens South Korea\u2019s political and security uncertainty as the country faces existential threats from perennial rival North Korea, reported economic retaliation from a China furious about Seoul\u2019s cooperation with the U.S. on an anti-missile system, and questions in Seoul about the new Trump administration\u2019s commitment to the countries\u2019 decades-long security alliance. South Korea\u2019s defense minister ordered the military to be on alert for possible North Korean provocations attempting to exploit \u201cunstable situations at home and abroad.\u201d In a video conference Friday with military commanders, Defense Minister Han Min Koo said North Korea can make \u201cstrategic or operational\u201d provocations at any time. The North has test-fired ballistic missiles in recent weeks. North Korea\u2019s state-run Korean Central News Agency published a short dispatch on the court ruling in Seoul, anticipating that Park will now come under investigation as a \u201cregular criminal.\u201d Park\u2019s removal from office opens her up to possible prosecution. The Reuters news agency points out that the report \u201cwas published uncharacteristically quickly for North Korean state media, which usually waits days before releasing foreign news.\u201d The United States says Park\u2019s removal is a domestic issue that doesn\u2019t affect its strong alliance with Seoul. State Department spokesman Mark Toner says the U.S. will continue to work with the Acting President Hwang and looks forward to whomever South Koreans elect as their next president. But Seoul worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South. Park\u2019s \u201cacts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\u201d acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \u201cThe benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\u201d Park\u2019s lawyer, Seo Seok-gu, who had previously compared Park\u2019s impeachment to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, called the verdict a \u201ctragic decision\u201d made under popular pressure and questioned the fairness of what he called a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d South Korea must now hold an election within two months to choose Park\u2019s successor. Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys. Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans wanted the court to approve Park\u2019s impeachment. But there have been worries that Park\u2019s ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents. Sensing history, thousands of people - both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone - gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul. A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades. Park\u2019s parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they\u2019ve recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since. People on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with. One of Park\u2019s lawyers told the court last month that there will be \u201ca rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\u201d if Park is booted from office. Many participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \u201crevolution\u201d if the court rejected Park\u2019s impeachment. \u201cIf Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\u201d said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul\u2019s Konkuk University. \u201cBut looking at what she\u2019s done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\u201d Others disagreed, saying violent protests won\u2019t be supported by the general public. Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park\u2019s confidante Choi Soon-sil, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong. But Park has avoided a direct investigation thanks to a law that gives a sitting president immunity from prosecution for most of alleged crimes. Since she\u2019s now no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives ahead of the presidential vote. Even after the election, imprisoning Park could still be a burden for a new government, which must pursue national unity to overcome security, economic and other problems, said Chung Jin-young, a professor at Kyung Hee University. Others say it won\u2019t be difficult. Park rose to power in 2012 largely thanks to the support of voters who believed her father guided the country out of poverty after the 1950-53 Korean War and that his daughter would show the same charismatic leadership to revive the economy. But her father was also a burden, as many here remember him as a ruthless thug. These critics have linked her alleged unclear and high-handed decision-making and attempts to infringe upon freedom of speech to her father\u2019s high-handed style. \u201cThe nostalgia for Park Chung-hee\u2019s developmental dictatorship, which has existed as a sort of myth since the \u201860s, has been shattered along with Park Geun-hye\u2019s impeachment,\u201d said Lim Jie-Hyun, a professor at Sogang University. \u201cWhen people voted for Park Geun-hye, they didn\u2019t do so because of her.\u201d Park Geun-hye has offered a public apology several times and acknowledged she got some help from Choi for editing speeches and on what she called public relations. But Park has denied any legal wrongdoing. The two women became friends in the 1970s, around the time when Park began serving as first lady after her mother was killed during a failed 1974 assassination attempt on her father. Park Geun-hye said Choi helped her \u201cwhen I had difficulties\u201d in the past. Park and Choi had 573 phone calls between April 18, 2016, and Oct. 26, 2016, according to an investigation report by prosecutors. Some media reports said the acting president might run for president as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he would have to resign to run and a deputy prime minister would become interim leader. In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.",

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON, CBS HOST: Today on FACE THE NATION: The 45th president takes office, but events from the last 48 hours show a very divided America.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So help me God.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: Friday\u2019s inaugural festivities followed the traditional pomp and pageantry.  But along with the cheers and change came chaos and confrontation, as the new president delivered a blunt condemnation of politicians of both parties gathered to celebrate his inauguration and gave a bleak assessment of America.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: It is a new tone for a new president, and a new era for Washington.  On day one, President Trump visited the Central Intelligence Agency to mend fences.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  TRUMP: I love you. I respect you. There is nobody I respect more.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  DICKERSON: But outside the White House, and around the country, there was no love lost as hundreds of thousands of women marched to protest the new administration.  We will talk about all of this with counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, and Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders.  Plus, we will have lots of political analysis.  It is all coming up on FACE THE NATION. Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I am John Dickerson.  We begin with a closer look at yesterday\u2019s marches. In the nation\u2019s capital, hundreds of thousands turned out for the Women\u2019s March on Washington. Organizers estimate that over four million rallied against the Trump administration in some 670 sister marches in cities across the country and around the world.  Women marched in American cities, including Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and even Anchorage, Alaska. And people turned out to protest all over the world from Bulgaria to New Zealand, with the biggest crowds obviously in the major capitals.  Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway is outside of her new office building, the White House.  Good morning, Kellyanne.  KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Good morning, John.  DICKERSON: Donald Trump had a strong reception at his inauguration and then yesterday there were those marches. He has credited himself with hearing the people, and that\u2019s why he was elected. So what is he hearing when he sees those protesters marching?  CONWAY: He heard a lot of what we heard on the campaign trail, John. I mean, I think they missed a tremendous opportunity yesterday to really engage America\u2019s women and men on the issues that President Obama has legacy left behind.  Why do we have 16 million women living in poverty? Why do we have millions of women and their children without access to health care, even though we have had the Affordable Care Act for seven years now? Why are so many people struggling to find well-paying jobs in this country? And why do they feel unsafe in their own communities?  And that\u2019s something that this president really wants to help solve. You had profanity-laced, vulgar comments coming from celebrities. Donald Trump in his inaugural address talked about the forgotten man and forgotten woman. And now these forgotten celebrities came to Washington to deliver really negative messages.  DICKERSON: We have been hearing the beeping of a moving van in the background there. Everybody knows this is real.  But here is my question, Kellyanne. He is now the president of the whole country.  CONWAY: That\u2019s right.  DICKERSON: So, I understand his views about the Obama administration, but he is the guy in the big office now. He is the president. Does he look at those opponents the way FDR did, wear their scorn as a badge of honor, or does he do the same way Nixon did, when he went down to the Mall and met with the Vietnam protesters, talked to those young kids?  What does he hear? What does he hear from people who don\u2019t support him?  CONWAY: He hears and sees a country that is divided. He didn\u2019t divide the -- Donald Trump didn\u2019t the country, but as president he has a great opportunity to help heal and unify it.  And, John, President Trump took a country really big steps forward in that regard in his inaugural address. It was uplifting. It was unifying. He did reach across and try to engage people who did not vote for him, who maybe disagreed with him politically and otherwise, to really come together.  And he actually earlier in the week met with Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s son, Martin Luther King III, in New York, where they had an incredibly constructive and honest conversation about unifying and healing the country.  If you listen to President Trump in his inaugural address, he talked about unifying and being aspirational and uplifting, and then the very next day, you have people being very negative to him. But he has reached across. He is going to be a president for all Americans.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you what he has actually done. Obviously, there is some dispute about whether it was an uplifting speech.  But I want to ask you about what he has actually done that affects real Americans. He took an executive action on the Affordable Care Act.  For the 20 million or so who get their insurance that way, what is that going to mean to them?  CONWAY: Well, for the 20 million who rely upon the Affordable Care Act in some form, they will not be without coverage during this transition time.  But, John, let\u2019s talk about the millions who have already lost their health care, lost their insurance plans, lost their doctors. That devastation has been terrible for many Americans and their families.  And what he wants to do in replacing Obamacare with a more patient-centered, free market solution is to make sure these people have coverage. Lots of folks got caught in that trap and that gap. And he wants to make sure that through his plan you can buy insurance across state lines, you have health savings accounts, we block Medicaid grant to states.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you this, Kellyanne, a couple -- first things. One, the number of health insurance, according to Gallup, only 11 percent is uninsured in America. That\u2019s the lowest in the last eight years.  Is the standard for Donald Trump\u2019s health reforms, that anybody anywhere who loses their health insurance, that that will be seen as a failure of his health insurance plan?  And I still don\u2019t know, if I am on the Affordable Care Act, what that executive order, the action he has now taken -- should people be -- what should they think?  CONWAY: Well, they should think that it is a great big step toward replacing Obamacare with a plan that works for more Americans. It truly makes it affordable and accessible.  You know, there are other Americans, based on your statistics there, John, who can\u2019t use their health care because their premiums have skyrocketed so dramatically in places like Arizona by 113 percent, in Pennsylvania 53 percent.  And so people who actually count as having health care actually can\u2019t access it, because they can\u2019t afford the premiums and the deductible.  DICKERSON: OK.  CONWAY: So we want to make it easier for them.  We hear from small business owners and families every single day that this is a crushing burden for them.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you. Yesterday, the White House press secretary went out and gave a press conference.  Why doesn\u2019t -- why didn\u2019t he talk about this, which, as you point out, it is such an important issue, millions of Americans hanging to find out what their health care system is going to be like? Isn\u2019t that more important than the question of crowd size, which is what Sean Spicer was talking about?  CONWAY: Well, our press secretary, Sean Spicer, will be addressing Americans on any number of issues, including the ones I have just said on your show, John.  Yesterday, it is just disappointing to get into this argument about crowd control. Nielsen says 31 million people witnessed Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration on the television. We know many other millions of Americans are watching events like this on different screens and their telephones and their computers.  And we know there was a prediction of rain, a big rain-out that probably deterred many people from coming. But all that said, there were hundred of thousands of people here. We all saw it. I think -- I\u2019m into the things that we can quantify. And that does go to everything from the 2,600 counties he won, 31 of 50 states, and the millions who are in need that he\u2019s going to help.  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: But that is in the past.  I guess what -- he is now doing things that affect real people, their real lives, no more rhetoric. This is real stuff. So, why on a day, when you could talk -- when you can talk about a thing that the new president has done, the White House chooses to spend its political capital and its time on something that is quite petty, relative to the big changes he is going to make in American health care?  CONWAY: I think it is a symbol for how we are covered and treated by many in the press, John. And that is unfortunate.  Look what happened the day before, the very day before. We invited the press in to cover President Obama (sic) sign executive orders in the Oval Office. And what happened immediately?  A false report. I am sorry. This is very important. A false report was issued by the press pooler, and it went out to 3,000 and some outlets, 3,000 stories, and it was false, that there was a removal of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s bust in the Oval Office.  That is just false. It was sitting right there. I was in the room. You can\u2019t have false reports like that and expect us to not wonder why we are covered and treated so differently and unfairly.  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: But it just seems that it is a question of proportion.  The president himself went to the CIA and thanked all the people there, said he was behind them 1000 percent, but then went off and talked about crowd size. Aren\u2019t there more important things to talk about at the CIA for the new president of a nation of 320 million people?  CONWAY: Well, he did talk about important things. And, frankly, he went to the -- him going to the CIA at all shows -- represents how serious he is about having a very productive and constructive relationship with our intelligence community.  We had over 1,000 requests for folks to attend that. We can only accommodate 300 or 400. He really backs -- John, why did President Trump plan on going to the CIA in the first place? He wanted to witness the swearing-in of his new CIA director, Mike Pompeo, top of his class at West Point and Harvard.  He is going to be a great CIA intelligence and CIA director. But why couldn\u2019t he witness his swearing-in yesterday? Oh, because the Democratic Senate won\u2019t confirm him. President Trump has nominated 21 of 21 Cabinet positions. Only two, two were confirmed by a time he took office. We can\u2019t have a government that way. We need bipartisanship up on Capitol Hill and the Democrats allowing him to get his nominees through, so that we can start the peaceful transition of power.  (CROSSTALK)  DICKERSON: All right, Democrats say Mike Pompeo is likely to be confirmed next week.  CONWAY: Let\u2019s get it done.  DICKERSON: Kellyanne Conway, thanks for being with us.  CONWAY: Thank you, John.  DICKERSON: Joining us now is South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham.  Senator, good to have you in the studio.  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: Thank you very much.  (LAUGHTER)  DICKERSON: I want to read you a line from President Trump\u2019s inaugural address.  He said that: \u201cPoliticians have reaped the rewards of government, while the people have borne the cost.\u201d he says: \u201cThe establishment protected itself and not the country.\u201d  That seems like a shot at both Republicans and Democrats who were to applaud his inauguration. Did you all take it that way?  GRAHAM: Well, that is what got him elected president.  Here is the way I see the country in January 2017. We are divided about how to move forward as a nation, but we\u2019re united that the institutions of government and the private sector no longer serve us well.  I am in the Congress. I get that most Americans believe the body I work in doesn\u2019t serve the nation well. A lot of people, from Bernie people to Trump people, believe the private sector is rigged against them.  So, here is my promise to this president and to the country. To the extent that I can restore trust by working with you and to the institutions that most people think are failing, I will do it. I have been trying my best to work with Democrats to solve hard problems.  But if you are in my business and your business, and you don\u2019t get that most people in the country believe institutions don\u2019t serve them, we are all missing the point of Trump\u2019s election.  DICKERSON: Absolutely.  But there is a difference between the institutions don\u2019t serve them and the people. He said the politicians have been basically feathering their nests, at the expense of the country.  I mean, that is corruption. That is venality.  GRAHAM: You want to look at my tax returns, you can. You want to look at my financial disclosures, you can.  I think to realize Donald Trump\u2019s victory, you need to understand that we are united in one area, that the country\u2019s institutions are not serving the public well.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about another line from his speech. Donald Trump said every country has the right to pursue their national interests. What do you think about that?  GRAHAM: With caveats.  Russia\u2019s national interest under Putin is to reconstruct the Russian empire, to gobble up territories formerly under Russian control. The ayatollah\u2019s national interest is to radicalize the Shia populations in the Mideast and undermine Sunni Arab states.  The leader of North Korea\u2019s national interest is to build an ICBM that can hit our homeland to make sure that his regime never falls by, you know, holding us hostage. I think China\u2019s national interests is take land owned by others by force.  So, to the president, Putin\u2019s national interest destabilize Europe. The ayatollah\u2019s national interest will lead us into a war between the Sunnis and Shias like you have never seen. So there is a caveat to that.  And to the president, if America first is a throwback to the \u201820s and \u201830s isolationism, when it was first used as a phrase, the world will deteriorate even quicker. If it is a new way of Ronald Reagan peace through strength, I would like to work with you.  I don\u2019t know what America first means.  DICKERSON: He also talked about cutting foreign aid.  GRAHAM: Yes.  Here is what I would tell him. Talk to General Mattis. General Mattis...  DICKERSON: Secretary of defense.  GRAHAM: Yes.  He is a four-star general, and here is what he said at an event I attended: \u201cIf you cut the State Department\u2019s budget, then you need to buy me more bullets.\u201d  This was a four-star Marine Corps general. You want to destroy radical Islam, Mr. President, you will never do it by taking soft power off the table? You cannot kill enough terrorists, you cannot drop enough bombs.  Our goal at Americans is to provide security by partnering with people in the region. But building a small schoolhouse for a poor young girl in Afghanistan, Syria or Iraq will do more damage to radical Islam than any bomb you could drop. So please don\u2019t take soft power off the table.  DICKERSON: Does Secretary of State Tillerson understand the point you just made, and will you vote for him?  GRAHAM: This is why I am voting for him.  (CROSSTALK)  GRAHAM: In my office visit, he said that, when America doesn\u2019t lead, other people will, and the vacuum is always filled by bad actors.  He said that we have to have a foreign policy that engages the world. We need to lead from the front.  The foreign aid budget is 1 percent of the total federal spending. You could wipe it all out, not move the debt needle. Most of our foreign aid to a single country goes to Israel. I\u2019m begging this president to understand that, if we don\u2019t help others over there, we are always going to be endangered here.  The Marshall Plan worked after World War II.  DICKERSON: I called him Secretary of State Tillerson. Of course, he\u2019s not yet.  GRAHAM: I\u2019m voting for him.  DICKERSON: That\u2019s why you are voting for him and that\u2019s why that is news.  Let me ask you about the Russian sanctions that you would like to impose.  GRAHAM: Right.  DICKERSON: Where is that? And do you think it will get out of the Congress to the president?  GRAHAM: I think, if there were a vote tomorrow on additional sanctions against Russia, it would get over 75 votes in the Senate.  DICKERSON: Seventy-five votes in the Senate. And that, of course, is to punish Russia for meddling in the election.  GRAHAM: I think there is bipartisan belief that the Russians interfered in our election.  I don\u2019t believed they change the outcome, but Putin is trying to break the back of democracies all over the world. My hope is that his team, his national security team, which I like a lot, President Trump\u2019s team, will convince him that, if you forgive Putin and forget about what he did, that screams weakness to Putin.  Beware of the teddy bear, President Trump. Putin will change his tone, he will be cajoling, but he still has the same interests at heart. If we don\u2019t punish Russia for what he did in our election, then Iran and a China could come into the next election. People are watching us. Don\u2019t be weak when it comes to Russia.  It didn\u2019t work on Obama\u2019s watch and it won\u2019t work on your watch.  DICKERSON: And your point is weakness not only sends a signal of weakness to Putin, but everyone else.  How many Republican senators do you think will vote for the sanctions that President Trump doesn\u2019t want?  GRAHAM: I hope most of them will, because I think all of them believe that Russia interfered in our elections.  And the Baltic states, Georgia and the Ukraine, who live in the shadow of Russian expansionism and threats and domination, we need to send a signal to these countries that we are going to stand up to Russia.  So, this idea of forgiving existing -- existing sanctions is an invitation to more aggression by Russia.  DICKERSON: Do you think he will veto the bill that you\u2019re...  (CROSSTALK)  GRAHAM: This will be the biggest conflict potentially between the Congress and the president.  Another conflict is going to be infrastructure. I am for more infrastructure spending. So is Bernie. But I am a conservative Republican. It must be paid for. There will be some Republicans that say, it is not the role of the federal government to rebuild the inner cities.  I am willing to rebuild rural America and the inner cities. I just want it paid for. So President Trump has got to get his party in the game. And the way to do it is pay for any infrastructure increases.  DICKERSON: In 10 seconds, defense spending, too, a conflict there maybe.  GRAHAM: I will build up the military, because we are in danger, but I will not do it at the expense of the CIA, the FBI, and the State Department\u2019s budget. If you take soft power off the table, then you have two options left, use military power exclusively or retreat. I cannot stress to you how important it is that we have more tools in the toolbox than just military power and retreat.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator Graham, thanks so much for being with us.  GRAHAM: Thank you.  DICKERSON: And we want to go now to Burlington, Vermont, and Senator Bernie Sanders.  Welcome, Senator.  The president responded this morning to the protesters who were marching yesterday against him and said basically the election is over, why didn\u2019t you vote in the election? It doesn\u2019t sound like he is listening to those voices.  SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I), VERMONT: Well, I have the feeling the vast majority of the people who protested did vote.  As you know, Mr. Trump lost the popular vote by almost three million votes. But I think the point that yesterday, which was extraordinary, John, not just all over this country -- in Montpelier, Vermont, where I was, we had one of the largest rallies in the history of the state.  All over the world, what people were saying to Mr. Trump, women are not going backward. They are not going to become second-class citizens. Listen to the needs of women. Listen to the needs of the immigrant community. Listen to the needs of workers. Listen to what is going on with regard to climate change. Modify your positions. Let\u2019s work together to try to save this planet and protect the middle class.  DICKERSON: I wonder what you made, Senator, of the president\u2019s inaugural address.  A lot of the people I talked to said there are things in that speech that Bernie Sanders would like, that the president\u2019s message about sort of punching the establishment in the nose was something that should delight a lot of liberals too who are just as fed up with the institutions in Washington. What did you make of it?  SANDERS: Well, I found it somewhat amusing that Mr. Trump, President Trump, was punching the establishment, but right behind him, John, sitting in the VIP sections were billionaire after billionaire after billionaire, some of the most powerful people in this country , who over the last 10, 20 years have become much, much richer, while the middle class has shrunk.  So, I find it somewhat amusing that you are attacking the establishment when the establishment is sitting right behind you and when billionaires of large corporations are funding many of your inaugural events.  Now, if Mr. Trump is serious about standing up for working families, then he is not going to throw 20 million working people off of health insurance. He is not going to cut Medicare and Medicaid.  In fact, to my mind, the best thing that Mr. Trump could do right now today is to send out a tweet and tell the American people that during the campaign, when he said over and over and over again that he would not cut Social Security, cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, tell the American people that he was not lying, that he is going to keep his word, and that they do not have to live in anxiety.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator, I want to follow up on that question on Obamacare and those issues.  But we need to take a short break right now.  We will be back in one minute with more from Senator Bernie Sanders. Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: And we are back with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.  Senator, you were talking about Donald Trump should reiterate that he will not meddle with Social Security and Medicare.  Reince Priebus, his chief of staff, has reiterated that. Tom Price, in your questioning, I believe, said that he wouldn\u2019t, answered your question about that. Do you not believe them or...  SANDERS: Well, John, what does meddle mean?  The truth is that, right now, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Social Security, the Republican chairman of that committee, is working on legislation that would devastate Medicare or devastate Social Security.  Paul Ryan has for years believed in moving, privatizing Medicare and moving it to a voucher program. They\u2019re moving aggressively, Republicans are, to make major cuts in Medicaid.  What Trump -- meddling is not the word. The word we have to hear right now is that he will keep his campaign promise, no cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  I have got to tell you something. I talked to a psychologist last night who told me that some of her patients are already in increased anxiety. What happens if they lose their Medicaid? What is going to happen to them?  So, Mr. Trump, President Trump, can reassure the American people that he will keep by keeping his campaign promises.  DICKERSON: I guess the question of cutting then gets everybody into a big debate about what is a cut and what isn\u2019t a cut. But let me ask you about that -- the Affordable Care Act and the executive action the president has taken. What do you make of it in terms of the health of that bill or that program?  SANDERS: Well, look, it is clear that the Republicans want to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  The American people are very divided on the positives and the negatives of the Affordable Care Act. But very few people, John, think that you simply end the Affordable Care Act, you do away with the protection that people have for preexisting conditions and go back to a time when, if somebody has cancer, they could not get health insurance, where you take young people off of their parents\u2019 health insurance, where you do away with the caps.  People don\u2019t want to see that. And it seems to me and to the American people you just cannot repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. Republicans have had eight years to come up with a replacement. I have not seen that yet.  DICKERSON: Let me ask you about scenarios where you might be able to work with the president, and especially given the speech he gave in his inauguration.  On infrastructure, next week, they are going to do -- spend a couple of days, I have been told, on trade. On drug pricing, he sounds exactly like you in terms of...  SANDERS: Right.  DICKERSON: Can you do anything to reach out and why not grab the moment?  SANDERS: That\u2019s right. You are absolutely right.  We are going to introduce legislation that will substantially lower prescription drug costs in this country because the pharmaceutical industry has been ripping off the American people right and left. Outrageous.  I would hope very much that President Trump will work with us in terms of having Medicare negotiate prices with the drug companies, in terms of allowing Americans and pharmacists to buy lower-cost prescription drugs from abroad.  If he wants to come on board and work with us, that would be great. In terms of infrastructure, clearly, he is right when he says that our infrastructure is crumbling. We can create up to 13 million decent-paying jobs by rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. We\u2019re going to have legislation in that will do just that. I hope that he will work with us.  DICKERSON: All right.  SANDERS: We also understand that our trade policies are a disaster. Let\u2019s see if we can work together on that as well.  DICKERSON: All right, Senator Sanders, thanks for being with us.  The test will be whether Democrats allow Democratic senators to work with him. We will talk about that when you\u2019re on next time. Thanks for being with us.  And we will be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: If you can\u2019t watch us live, FACE THE NATION is now available on CBS All Access, as well as our Web site, FACETHENATION.com. Plus, we are available on video on demand on your cable system.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Some of our CBS stations are leaving us now, but, for most of you, we will be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.  Our panel is up next. And we will also take a look at the events of the last two days.  Stay with us.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. I\u2019m John Dickerson.  Joining us now for some analysis, Lanhee Chen, who was a policy director for the Romney campaign and is now a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, CBS News contributor Frank Luntz, Susan Page is the Washington bureau chief at \u201cUSA Today,\u201d Jeffrey Goldberg is editor in chief at \u201cThe Atlantic.\u201d  Frank, I want to start with you. Were -- what we\u2019ve seen over the last two days, is that the tableau of America, the cheers for Trump and then the marches against him? Is that where we are in politics?  FRANK LUNTZ, CBS NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: There are three attributes that matter more than anything else in American life, respect, civility and tolerance. And we\u2019re not seeing much of that from anyone right now. When Donald Trump delivered his speech, he had some very powerful lines and talked about the people getting their government back. And that\u2019s to be applauded. But there was no respect for the previous president or any of the presidents. There was no respect for people who were up there on the podium. And the next day -- I got attacked the next day, not even at the rally, by someone who called me a fascist and I won\u2019t use the language because I don\u2019t want to get fired. But we now believe that we can say and do anything to anyone at any time. We have lost that sense of decency. And, frankly, I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to get it back.  DICKERSON: I want to talk about the speech in a minute. But, Susan, what was the purpose of the march yesterday? Was it just, we don\u2019t like Donald Trump? Was there more to it?  SUSAN PAGE, \u201cUSA TODAY\u201d: You know, I think something -- we use the word \u201cunprecedented\u201d too much to talk about Donald Trump, but I do think something extraordinary has happened. And on Friday, we saw a new grassroots movement take over the White House and the Republican Party. And on Saturday, we saw an entirely separate grassroots movement rise up against that. And these are two -- millions of Americans on each sides who don\u2019t just disagree on -- on policy, they think the other side is fundamentally attacking what makes their country great. They have clashing visions of what the nation ought to be. And this is going to, I think, play out in a big way over the next four years.  DICKERSON: Jeffrey, what Susan talks about is a populist movement on both sides that we\u2019ve seen all across the world, La Pen in France --  JEFFREY GOLDBERG, \u201cTHE ATLANTIC\u201d: Right.  DICKERSON: In -- in Great Britain with Brexit. What\u2019s your -- do you see a big -- I mean is this now global?  GOLDBERG: Well, it -- it certainly is global. I mean you have -- you have populists rising across Europe. I -- I think you\u2019re also going to see concerted effort by Trump people to help those people rise. And -- and so you\u2019re going to have an echoing effect. And this, obviously, goes into the -- the Trump affection, let\u2019s call it, for Vladimir Putin, this idea of a strong man who will solve your problems. He is attracted to people in the populist movement across the world who affect that kind of posture toward democracy and toward -- toward the idea of, I alone can fix your problems. That\u2019s where we\u2019re heading.  DICKERSON: Lanhee, I want to talk a little bit about the speech and the vision that Donald Trump laid out. One-half or one portion of people, the Trump supporters, say he was, in this speech, which some people have called dark, telling it like it is, diagnosing America with clear eyes. And then the other half has a view that when you are that dark, you make bad policy as a result because you -- you get everybody too scared. What\u2019s your view of the political dynamic right now?  LANHEE CHEN, HOOVER INSTITUTION: The lens through which you see Donald Trump is the lens through which you saw that speech. And I think it is the case that there are some who believe that the country is in a very dark place. And I think those are the people primarily who went out and supported Donald Trump.  The policy part of this is very interesting, though, because, on the other hand in the speech, you have things that a Democrats could have argued for, bigger infrastructure spending, anti-free trade, but then the actual policy the administration has engaged in so far has been deeply conservative. It\u2019s been an executive order to freeze regulation, and an executive order to reinforce that Obamacare real is the policy of the administration. But more than that, policy that may gut the Affordable Care Act at an executive level. So it\u2019s really interesting how we\u2019re being buffeted from one side to the other by the speech and then by the action of the administration.  DICKERSON: Right. Right.  PAGE: But, you know, it was interesting, two words he didn\u2019t use in that speech, \u201cRepublican\u201d and \u201cDemocratic.\u201d And there was not -- there was some -- some thought the policies he outlined that could not have been much comfort to the members -- the Republican members of Congress sitting behind him. And, in fact, he indicted really the political establishment of both parties.  GOLDBERG: The -- you know, the interesting thing about this, I was -- obviously Democrats were made uncomfortable by many aspects of that speech, but the Republican members of Congress sitting up there, those who are ideological Republicans, when you start promising bridges and tunnels and highways and -- and airports and don\u2019t seem to care or articulate at least how you\u2019re going to pay for that, that has a lot of people, I think, very upset and worried as well.  LUNTZ: And no one knows what to expect. The fact is, there isn\u2019t a Republican member of Congress who knows exactly what Donald Trump is going to do on healthcare, what he\u2019s going to do on the budget, what he\u2019s going to do on taxes --  GOLDBERG: But you\u2019re assuming that Donald Trump knows also.  LUNTZ: But -- but there\u2019s -- or the administration. But we\u2019ve never had a situation -- and we don\u2019t even know how the public is going to react to any of this.  DICKERSON: Right.  LUNTZ: I\u2019ve never seen a situation -- I\u2019ve been doing this for 25 years -- where there\u2019s more doubt and more people are wrong on more things. It\u2019s dangerous to do a show like this because within 24 hours each one of us will be proven wrong on something.  DICKERSON: Well, that never stopped us before.  GOLDBERG: Yes, yes, really.  DICKERSON: Let me ask -- well, Lanhee, say what you were going to say, but let me add this to it, which is, was that a conservative speech? Was that a Republican speech? Give us a label that helps us understand it if you can.  CHEN: I think -- I think -- I -- I -- I don\u2019t think we can label it. I think that\u2019s part of what people are having difficulty with is that, you know, it used to be the case that you could expect a Republican president to get up there and give a certain kind of speech. That was not the speech you would expect.  GOLDBERG: I think we can label it. We can label it a dystopian -- the first dystopian inaugural in history.  CHEN: Well -- I --  GOLDBERG: A dark vision of America that very few presidents, very few politicians ever articulate.  LUNTZ: But this is how people feel. We\u2019ve never had as many people --  CHEN: Right.  LUNTZ: Who believe the country is heading in the wrong direction. We\u2019ve never had as many people who don\u2019t trust the media, don\u2019t trust the politicians, don\u2019t trust economics, don\u2019t trust business. There\u2019s a reason why two-thirds of young people now believe that socialism is a better solution for American economics than capitalism. It\u2019s because they\u2019ve lost (INAUDIBLE).  CHEN: But, John, to return to your point, I think it would be interesting to see the first fault line between the Republican majority in the Congress and the president. Is it going to be over the Affordable Care Act? Is it going to be over infrastructure? Is it going to be over tax reform? Because right now it seems the posture that many Republican members of Congress are taking is, we\u2019re going to wait and see, but we\u2019re going to be supportive. (INAUDIBLE) --  GOLDBERG: I think it might be over Russia.  CHEN: Or it could be over Russia the week, absolutely.  PAGE: Right.  (CROSS TALK)  GOLDBERG: Absolutely. Yes, absolutely.  LUNTZ: We\u2019ve gotten some indication on that.  PAGE: Because that\u2019s what they -- Lindsey Graham was -- was suggesting in your interview, that the first big fight that divides Republicans in Congress and in the Senate from the White House is going to be whether to toughen sanctions on Russia or even a debate over if the new president moves to ease sanctions against Russia.  DICKERSON: Jeffrey, what do you -- Lindsey Graham seemed to think he\u2019s got a lot of Republicans on board with him on that -- on the Russian sanctions. It\u2019s -- do you think that\u2019s right?  GOLDBERG: Look, what -- the -- the one thing about Donald Trump that a lot of Republicans in the Senate don\u2019t understand -- simply don\u2019t understand is his affection or however you want to call it for the Kremlin, right? I mean you -- until today, I mean, one of the sort of hallmarks of being a Republican is doubting Russia\u2019s intentions, whether it\u2019s a czar or a communist leader or the current plutocrat, the current autocrat who\u2019s in charge. So I think he\u2019s putting a lot of Republicans in a very unpleasant situation because they are -- every cell in their body says we have to doubt Putin and combat him. And he might very well come in and say, no, no, no, we\u2019re resetting this to the point where we\u2019re going to reduce sanctions and there are a lot of Republicans who want to put sanctions on.  DICKERSON: Let me step back. We\u2019re going to go back to foreign policy and these domestic issues in a second. But, Frank, let me ask you about the -- the -- the speech itself. Why -- why bother -- people are saying there wasn\u2019t an outreach and there wasn\u2019t a -- why -- does -- can you run a presidency with just the people who brung you, which looks like what he\u2019s thinking about doing?  LUNTZ: For the short-term, yes. But when the battles start and you have to get 60 votes in the Senate, then there is no way to run an explicitly and strictly Republican effort. and I\u2019m focused now on healthcare, because that\u2019s the number one issue for a lot of Americans, and there is no way that you can -- you can repeal it with 51 votes, but you can\u2019t replace it under 60.  DICKERSON: Yes.  Susan, you mentioned before the speech that Richard Nixon was a template, perhaps, for President Trump. And I went back and looked at that. There was a dark part of that speech, but he started it with a lot of light and one -- just one line from it. \u201cWe cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another, until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices.\u201d That\u2019s the piece that was missing from Donald Trump\u2019s.  PAGE: That\u2019s right, in previous presidents in their inaugurals have said things are bad. Ronald Reagan said things were bad. You know, presidents have taken over at times of greater national crisis than we face now, but they haven\u2019t been quite so unrelenting about it. I was surprised he didn\u2019t begin by acknowledging what President Obama has achieved as president. He thanked him for the transition effort, but he didn\u2019t say, for instance, you took over at a time of financial crisis and steered (INAUDIBLE). He didn\u2019t acknowledge the presidents on stage, the Democrat he defeated, Hillary Clinton. He acknowledged her later at the congressional --  GOLDBERG: Who came. Who, in an act of unity, came, right.  PAGE: Yes. So he didn\u2019t -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not only that he was dark, that\u2019s happened before. It\u2019s that he didn\u2019t seem gracious to his foes. He didn\u2019t reach out to the people who did not vote for him.  CHEN: But (INAUDIBLE) -- but I think that\u2019s part of the psychology, though, of what the administration is trying do, because for people who supported Donald Trump, you cannot be against Barack Obama enough. And for him to have done more, for him to have acknowledged more I think would have put him in a very difficult position with his supporters. It wasn\u2019t the case that that was a speech for his supporters, but also a speech for people who didn\u2019t support him as well to say, look, if you expected me to change, that\u2019s not going to happen.  DICKERSON: What -- what about this, Frank? Here\u2019s a theory, shoot it down quickly if you will, this was a speech to his supporters and he\u2019s locked in tight with them, with the full well knowledge of knowing that Washington\u2019s going to eat away at things, but in this big public moments he wants to show, I am with you, that is what is in my heart and all the things you may hear down the line about him capitulating and trimming his sails on a thing here and there to get legislation through, that won\u2019t be remembered. What will be remembered is he stood up there, in that moment, and spoke loud and proud about the things they love about him.  LUNTZ: And he did. But that\u2019s not how you govern the country. You\u2019re not presidents of 46 percent of America. You\u2019re president of 100 percent. And in the green room before we came on, we were talking about our expectations for the future. I\u2019m clearly the darkest person on this panel because I think we\u2019re going to remember this weekend for a long time to come as not the end, not the campaign being over, but this is the beginning of the most tempestuous, if that\u2019s the right word, than most, in my mind, awful conflict between left and right, between men and women, between young and old. I think we are --  DICKERSON: (INAUDIBLE).  LUNTZ: We are breaking apart. Since 1968 when we lost some incredibly good people in this country, that\u2019s 50 years. I saw those signs in the parade, and they were so horrific and they are eight, nine, ten year-olds who are being taught to hate the other side. And that\u2019s the problem, when you teach young people to hate, you can\u2019t get it out of their system.  GOLDBERG: You know, John, there\u2019s -- you brought up Richard Nixon and I was -- you\u2019re contrasting Nixon and Trump. Nixon didn\u2019t live in the social media age and -- and -- and imagine Richard Nixon, by the way, with a Twitter account. That would have been something.  DICKERSON: Right. Yes.  GOLDBERG: But I don\u2019t -- I -- I think to add on to what Frank\u2019s saying, I don\u2019t know if the climate, I don\u2019t know if technology is allowing people to see past their own hatred.  LUNTZ: It\u2019s not. That\u2019s encouraging it.  DICKERSON: Let\u2019s -- all right, let\u2019s -- let\u2019s take a pause here. We\u2019re going to take a short break and we\u2019ll be right back with more from our panel.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: And we\u2019re back with our panel.  Susan, I want to ask you, if I\u2019m a Republican and I heard Donald Trump say that the politicians had reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost and that the establishment protected itself but not the citizens of our country, and I\u2019m on that stage, a, how seriously do I take that as a shot as me, and, b, do I worry in this this negotiation back and forth that he might turn his Twitter account against me, a Republican who needs the votes of his coalition?  PAGE: You bet. I mean I think it -- and I think not just Republicans should be nervous about that, Democrats as well. You know, we talked about these two rising populist movements. The fact is, that statement is something that both of them would have agreed with, that the politics as usual is not working for us, the -- we the citizens, and we want some change. Now they have -- they want to go in very different directions, but they would agree that current thing -- that current politics, not working for them. Let\u2019s change it.  DICKERSON: Lanhee, what do you make of the executive action taken on the Affordable Care Act and the kind of way the dismantling is going forward?  CHEN: I think potentially it\u2019s quite broad or potentially it could be only symbolic. It really depends on what they decide to do with it. I think it will be interesting to see if the Trump administration uses executive authority on Obamacare to take it apart in the same way the Obama administration used executive authority to implement the law because that\u2019s really what it\u2019s going to be. The Trump administration, for example, says, we\u2019re not going to enforce the individual mandate. Well, that will -- that will be very, very significant in its impact on the individual marketplace, and that potentially could drive insurers out unless they\u2019re ready to come in behind with another executive action to stabilize the market. So it will be interesting to see how they use it.  DICKERSON: Right, use the measures that Barack Obama used to put in place to undo it.  CHEN: Correct. And -- and the broad interpretation of the law.  DICKERSON: Frank, let me ask you this question. You mentioned doubt. Nobody knows which way the wind is blowing. Talk about that doubt in terms of the public and changing the Affordable Care Act. There are the polls that show people want to see a replacement and not just a repeal. What the political lines as this -- as -- as Donald Trump and Republicans try and take apart the Affordable Care Act?  LUNTZ: Three lines, actually. The Republicans want it repealed and they don\u2019t care what comes next. I mean, yes, they do want something there, but the first thing is, get rid of it and get rid of it within the first 100 days. The independents want repeal and replace, a repeal and repair basically, which is -- and these words matter. And you\u2019re going to see people arguing over it, which is get rid of it but as quickly as you can put something in that continues the preexisting conditions and kids --  DICKERSON: Protects (INAUDIBLE) --  LUNTZ: And the kids being on their parents plan, and then change the mandate and the cost. And democrats want to know that everyone is going to be protected, particularly the affordability of it. So make no mistake, if they can show -- if Republicans can show that the cost of healthcare will come down for most Americans, they will be acting in the way that the American people want. That\u2019s what they have to prove.  DICKERSON: Tough thing to -- tough thing to prove.  LUNTZ: They have to. They don\u2019t have a choice.  DICKERSON: Jeffrey, yesterday President Trump made a visit to the CIA to thank and give his support and what did you make of the visit?  GOLDBERG: I thought it was bizarre and inappropriate and somewhat dangerous. Bizarre because he was having what was essentially a campaign rally, campaign style rally or discourse, right by the CIA\u2019s wall of honor, memorial wall, which is akin for the intelligence committee to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier for the armed forces. So it was just a very -- that was a very strange thing, an inappropriate thing to do.  On substance, what was -- what was disturbing was, he was criticizing or condemning the free press of the United States in front of a group of intelligence officers, in front of this -- in front of the CIA. That is something that is without -- sorry to use the word again -- but somewhat unprecedented and it reminded me, someone who\u2019s covered the Middle East -- it reminded me of a discourse that you hear in places like Turkey or sometimes in -- in Egypt where -- where the strong man is trying to undermine the institutions of civil society, the institutions of democracy.  LUNTZ: But does --  GOLDBERG: I\u2019m not saying that you shouldn\u2019t criticize the press, but -- but in -- in front of government employees, and not only government employees but intelligence service employees. That struck me as -- as a dangerous precedent.  LUNTZ: But do they treat him honestly, do they treat him fairly?  GOLDBERG: Does the press treat him fairly?  LUNTZ: Yes, does the press treat Donald Trump fairly?  GOLDBERG: Look, there\u2019s no one press. I think the so-called mainstream press holds him accountable for his statements and fact checks him and often, as we saw yesterday with Sean Spicer, they don\u2019t like being fact checked, especially when they have their facts wrong and the press has their facts correct.  DICKERSON: What did -- Susan, what did you make of Sean Spicer coming to the podium? There were a lot -- you know, as I pointed out, there was this executive action on the Affordable Care Act. There was real news to talk about, but he, instead, got into a fight with the press about the crowd size and the way it was reported.  PAGE: You know, I think this is -- we\u2019ve talked about some of the tests for President Trump going forward. There\u2019s some tests here for the press as well in coverage of the new president, because we have a role in accountability and providing context and fact checking. And you saw kind of the -- some of the dangers ahead with Sean Spicer attacking the press for accurately reporting on an issue of crowd size. Talk about something we shouldn\u2019t be concerned about is the size of the crowds on The Mall. But saying basically you can\u2019t believe the press. You can\u2019t believe the photos that the press shows that demonstrate that the crowds were smaller than they were for President Obama\u2019s first inauguration. So I thought that was -- I think there are some challenges here for the press and I thought it was a tough start for the press secretary to come out, say things weren\u2019t -- say accurate reporting was untrue and then leave without taking questions.  DICKERSON: Lanhee, let me ask you about overseas and the -- and the inaugural address and what Lindsey Graham was talking about. There seems, again to Frank\u2019s point, doubt, uncertainty about whether the Reagan vision of promoting freedom as a good that is in America\u2019s national security interests is still part of American policy under -- under Donald Trump. What did you -- what do you think?  CHEN: Well, the inaugural address laid out a very different framework for foreign policy. I mean America first has meaning for people that goes back many, many years, and it does suggest a very different orientation. Now, for the rest of the world, I think there\u2019s a little bit of, you know, they\u2019re trying to figure out what\u2019s going on as much as we are as Americans. But -- but I think for them the implications are far more significant. If you go to Korea or you go to Japan or you go to Israel or you go to the United Kingdom or any of our western European allies, or -- or our allies in the rest of the world, there are questions about where America is going to stand. And I think the inaugural address really kind of put people on notice that this is going to be a different framework we\u2019re operating in. So I absolutely think we\u2019re in a different time, in a different place (INAUDIBLE).  GOLDBERG: We -- we have treated relationships with some of the countries you just talk about, which suggests that America is not first in Washington\u2019s view. That -- that Washington, post-World War II, when we became the global leader, that we decided that the defense of other countries was also worth our time, money and even blood. And -- and so this is the revolutionary aspect of what Donald Trump was saying. He was saying, calling into question whether we\u2019re going to rise to the defense of free peoples.  DICKERSON: I was also struck, Frank, that the -- that the president talked about how America had disappeared over the horizon against other countries. And there has been a long debate about American exceptionalism and whether presidents are sufficiently exceptional and praising America. That seems like not a -- you wouldn\u2019t put that in the American exceptionalism hymn that we\u2019re disappearing over the horizon.  LUNTZ: No, I -- I really think the country\u2019s in trouble. If we don\u2019t trust the people who give us our news, if we get our news to affirm us rather than to inform us, then we\u2019re not going to collect any information. If we don\u2019t listen to others and allow our opinions to change over time, then the democracy weakens. And if our electoral process, if we\u2019re telling lies to the people in an effort to get elected, and we don\u2019t hear the accountability, then where are we headed from here both nationally and internationally? We are losing the respect of the global community. We have lost the respect of Americans here. There\u2019s a sense that our democratic system and the institutions have failed us. And I see nothing in the last 48 hours to indicate that any of this is going to be addressed in the coming weeks or months.  DICKERSON: Susan, Secretary Graham -- sorry, Senator Graham, I\u2019ve given him an elevation there. Senator Graham seems to be pushing forward on this Russia sanctions bill which sets up a foreign policy -- not just, you know, debate, but real things. What -- what do you think will happen? Mitch McConnell\u2019s got to put a bill in front of the president the president doesn\u2019t seem to like.  PAGE: Well, we -- we don\u2019t know that that will happen. Senator -- you know, Senator Graham said, if the vote were tomorrow he\u2019d get 75 votes in the Senate because the vote\u2019s not tomorrow and President Trump has some ability to lobby Republicans in the Senate as well. But I do think this could be an early flash point between the Congress, especially in the Senate, and -- and the new White House because there is a consensus, there is a Republican consensus among Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that Russia is not our friend, that Vladimir Putin is not a model that we should be following. So this could be -- this could emerge as -- as something kind of defining in the relationship, especially on foreign policy, between the president and the White House -- between the White House and the Congress.  DICKERSON: And, Jeffrey, what\u2019s your -- what do you make of Mr. Tillerson, Rex Tillerson, and his possible nomination to -- or, sorry, being confirmed as secretary of state?  GOLDBERG: Well, it seems more likely now that Senator Graham told you that he was going to vote for him. That\u2019s one thing.  DICKERSON: And McCain says he will as well.  GOLDBERG: And McCain says he will as well. Rex Tillerson is in that category that people, at least insiders, believe is one of the grownups who\u2019s going to play a responsible role, along with Jim Mattis, in making sure that the United States fills its commitments overseas. There are obvious questions about putting the head of Exxon in the -- the head of the State department, but he seems to have emerged as one of the more credible figures to -- to be nominated by Donald Trump so far.  DICKERSON: All right, we\u2019re going to have to end it there. Of course, Senator Marco Rubio, his vote is still outstanding. That will be a real question since he\u2019s on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  Thanks to all of you for being here. Thanks to all of you for watching and we will be back in a moment.  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  DICKERSON: Finally today, with all of the drama and emotion and division surrounding the events of the last two days, we leave you with the images of American citizens showing their loyalty to their country.

            "article_content": "Senator Mathias, Chief Justice Burger, Vice President Bush, Speaker O\u2019Neill, Senator Dole, reverend clergy, and members of my family and friends and my fellow citizens: This day has been made brighter with the presence here of one who, for a time, has been absent. Senator John Stennis, God bless you and welcome back. There is, however, one who is not with us today. Representative Gillis Long of Louisiana left us last night. And I wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer. Amen. There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that you\u2019ve bestowed on me. I\u2019ll do my utmost to be deserving of your trust. This is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we, the people, have celebrated this historic occasion. When the first President, George Washington, placed his hand upon the Bible, he stood less than a single day\u2019s journey by horseback from raw, untamed wilderness. There were 4 million Americans in a union of 13 States. Today, we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 States. We\u2019ve lighted the world with our inventions, gone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help, journeyed to the Moon and safely returned. So much has changed, and yet we stand together as we did two centuries ago. When I took this oath 4 years ago, I did so in a time of economic stress. Voices were raised saying that we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory. But we, the present-day Americans, are not given to looking backward. In this blessed land, there is always a better tomorrow. Four years ago, I spoke to you of a New Beginning, and we have accomplished that. But in another sense, our New Beginning is a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when, for the first time in history, government, the people said, was not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which we the people allow it to have. That system has never failed us, but for a time we failed the system. We asked things of government that government was not equipped to give. We yielded authority to the National Government that properly belonged to States or to local governments or to the people themselves. We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase. By 1980 we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom, consistent with an orderly society. We believed then and now: There are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams. And we were right to believe that.  Tax rates have been reduced, inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than ever before in our history. We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive. But there are many mountains yet to climb. We will not rest until every American enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity as our birthright. It is our birthright as citizens of this great Republic. And if we meet this challenge, these will be years when Americans have restored their confidence and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work, and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy was finally freed from government\u2019s grip; when we made sincere efforts at meaningful arms reductions and by rebuilding our defenses, our economy, and developing new technologies, helped preserve peace in a troubled world; when America courageously supported the struggle for individual liberty, self-government, and free enterprise throughout the world and turned the tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom. My fellow citizens, our nation is poised for greatness. We must do what we know is right, and do it with all our might. Let history say of us: \u201cThese were golden years-when the American Revolution was reborn, when freedom gained new life, and America reached for her best. Our two-party system has solved us-served us, I should say, well over the years, but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came together not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a common cause. Two of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named Adams and a Virginia planter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable group who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start the world over again, left us an important lesson. They had become, in the years then in government, bitter political rivals in the Presidential election of 1800. Then, years later, when both were retired and age had softened their anger, they began to speak to each other again through letters. A bond was reestablished between those two who had helped create this government of ours. In 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, they both died. They died on the same day, within a few hours of each other, and that day was the Fourth of July. In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives, Jefferson wrote: \u201cIt carries me back to the times when, beset with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right of self-government. Laboring always at the same oar, with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless... we rode through the storm with heart and hand.\u201d Well, with heart and hand let us stand as one today\u2014one people under God, determined that our future shall be worthy of our past. As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our past. We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated Federal Establishment. You elected us in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don\u2019t believe you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course. At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight months of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress. We have begun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment; reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people\u2019s lives. We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair and bring the rates down for all who work and earn. We must think anew and move with a new boldness, so every American who seeks work can find work, so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest things\u2014to be heroes who heal our sick, feed the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world a better place. The time has come for a new American emancipation\u2014a great national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country. My friends, together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me God. From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more productive, fulfilled, and united people, and a stronger America\u2014an America that will lead the technological revolution and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature, music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love. A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes, will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. But an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of reckoning. We\u2019ve come to a turning point, a moment for hard decisions. I have asked the Cabinet and my staff a question and now I put the same question to all of you. If not us, who? And if not now, when? It must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget. We can then begin reducing the national debt. I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing government program spending for the next year. Beyond this, we must take further steps to permanently control government\u2019s power to tax and spend. We must act now to protect future generations from government\u2019s desire to spend its citizens\u2019 money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government takes in. We have already started returning to the people and to State and local governments responsibilities better handled by them. Now, there is a place for the Federal Government in matters of social compassion. But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged. And here, a growing economy and support from family and community offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and, yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and made self-sufficient. Now, there is another area where the Federal Government can play a part. As an older American, I remember a time when people of different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law. There\u2019s no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we\u2019ve made toward the brotherhood of man that God intended for us. Let us resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens. Let us resolve that we, the people, will build an American opportunity society in which all of us\u2014white and black, rich and poor, young and old\u2014will go forward together, arm in arm. Again, let us remember that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of the Earth, we are all Americans, pledged to carry on this last, best hope of man on Earth. I\u2019ve spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations we should put on our National Government. Now let me turn to a task that is the primary responsibility of National Government\u2014the safety and security of our people. Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on Earth. Yet history has shown that peace does not come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone. There are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom. One nation, the Soviet Union, has conducted the greatest military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons. We\u2019ve made progress in restoring our defense capability. But much remains to be done. There must be no wavering by us, nor any doubts by others, that America will meet her responsibilities to remain free, secure, and at peace. There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it. And this we\u2019re trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union. We\u2019re not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons; we seek, instead, to reduce their number. We seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth. Now, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat of mutual assured destruction\u2014if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it. Is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs? I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security shield that will destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target. It wouldn\u2019t kill people; it would destroy weapons. It wouldn\u2019t militarize space; it would help demilitarize the arsenals of Earth. It would render nuclear weapons obsolete. We will meet with the Soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction. We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all around us. Since the turn of the century, the number of democracies in the world has grown fourfold. Human freedom is on the march, and nowhere more so than in our own hemisphere. Freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit. People, worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress. America must remain freedom\u2019s staunchest friend, for freedom is our best ally and it is the world\u2019s only hope to conquer poverty and preserve peace. Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and war. Every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace. So, we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose. With our alliances strengthened, with our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion, we look to a future rich in possibilities. And all of this is because we worked and acted together, not as members of political parties but as Americans. My friends, we live in a world that\u2019s lit by lightning. So much is changing and will change, but so much endures and transcends time. History is a ribbon, always unfurling. History is a journey. And as we continue our journey, we think of those who traveled before us. We stand again at the steps of this symbol of our democracy\u2014well, we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn\u2019t gotten so cold. [Laughter] Now we\u2019re standing inside this symbol of our democracy, and we see and hear again the echoes of our past: a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge; a lonely President paces the darkened halls and ponders his struggle to preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out encouragement to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air. It is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, daring, decent, and fair. That\u2019s our heritage, that\u2019s our song. We sing it still. For all our problems, our differences, we are together as of old. We raise our voices to the God who is the Author of this most tender music. And may He continue to hold us close as we fill the world with our sound\u2014in unity, affection, and love\u2014one people under God, dedicated to the dream of freedom that He has placed in the human heart, called upon now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world.   God bless you, and God bless America.",

            "article_content": "SEOUL, South Korea --\u00a0 In a historic, unanimous ruling Friday, South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court formally removed impeached President Park Geun-hye from office over a corruption scandal that has plunged the country into political turmoil, worsened an already-serious national divide and prompted calls for sweeping reforms. South Korea must now hold an election within 60 days to choose her successor. Being impeached opens her up to criminal prosecution. \u00a0\u00a0 It was a stunning fall for Park, the country\u2019s first female leader and the daughter of a dictator who rode a lingering conservative nostalgia for her father to victory in 2012, only to see her presidency descend into scandal. Park is South Korea\u2019s first democratically elected leader to be removed from office since democracy came in the country in the late 1980s. Park\u2019s \u201cacts of violating the constitution and law are a betrayal of the public trust,\u201d acting Chief Justice Lee Jung-mi said. \u201cThe benefits of protecting the constitution that can be earned by dismissing the defendant are overwhelmingly big. Hereupon, in a unanimous decision by the court panel, we issue a verdict: We dismiss the defendant, President Park Geun-hye.\u201d Liberal Moon Jae-in, who lost to Park in the 2012 election, currently enjoys a comfortable lead in opinion surveys. Whoever becomes the next leader will take over a country facing a hostile North Korea, a stagnant economy and deep social and political divides. Pre-verdict surveys showed that 70 to 80 percent of South Koreans had wanted the court to approve Park\u2019s impeachment. But there have been worries that Park\u2019s ouster would further polarize the country and cause violence between her supporters and opponents. Sensing history, thousands of people - both pro-Park supporters, many of them dressed in army-style fatigues and wearing red berets, and those who wanted Park gone - gathered around the Constitutional Court building and a huge public square in downtown Seoul. A big television screen was set up near the court so people could watch the verdict live. Hundreds of police were on hand for any protests, wearing helmets with visors and black, hard-plastic breastplates and shin guards. The streets near the court were lined with police buses and barricades. Park\u2019s parliamentary impeachment in December came after weeks of Saturday rallies that drew millions who wanted her resignation. Overwhelmed by the biggest rallies in decades, the voices of Park supporters were largely ignored. But they\u2019ve recently regrouped and staged fierce pro-Park rallies since. People on both sides have threatened not to accept a Constitutional Court decision that they disagree with. One of Park\u2019s lawyers told the court last month that there will be \u201ca rebellion and blood will drench the asphalt\u201d if Park is booted from office. Many participants at anti-Park rallies had said they would stage a \u201crevolution\u201d if the court rejected Park\u2019s impeachment. \u201cIf Park accepts the ruling and soothes those who opposed her impeachment, things will be quiet,\u201d said Yoon Tae-Ryong, a political scientist at Seoul\u2019s Konkuk University. \u201cBut looking at what she\u2019s done so far, I think that might be wishful thinking.\u201d Others disagreed, saying violent protests won\u2019t be supported by the general public. Prosecutors have arrested and indicted a slew of high-profile figures over the scandal, including Park\u2019s confidante Choi Soon-sil, top Park administration officials and Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong. But Park has avoided a direct investigation thanks to a law that gives a sitting president immunity from prosecution for most of alleged crimes. Since she\u2019s now no longer in power, prosecutors can summon, question and possibly arrest her. Her critics want to see Park appear on TV while dressed in prison garb, handcuffed and bound like others involved in the scandal. But some analysts worry that could create a backlash by conservatives. Even after the election, imprisoning Park could still be a burden for a new government, which must pursue national unity to overcome security, economic and other problems, said Chung Jin-young, a professor at Kyung Hee University. Others say it won\u2019t be difficult. Among the most serious problems facing South Korea is China\u2019s retaliation against the deployment of a U.S. high-tech missile defense system in the South. Ties with North Korea are terrible, with Pyongyang seeking to expand its nuclear and missile arsenal. Japan hasn\u2019t sent back its ambassador, which it recalled two months ago over history disputes. South Korea also worries about the Trump administration asking for a greater financial contribution for U.S. troop deployment in the South. Park rose to power in 2012 largely thanks to the support of voters who believed her father guided the country out of poverty after the 1950-53 Korean War and that his daughter would show the same charismatic leadership to revive the economy. But her father was also a burden because there are many who remember the senior Park as a ruthless thug. These critics have linked her alleged unclear and high-handed decision-making and attempts to infringe upon freedom of speech to her father\u2019s high-handed style. \u201cThe nostalgia for Park Chung-hee\u2019s developmental dictatorship, which has existed as a sort of myth since the \u201860s, has been shattered along with Park Geun-hye\u2019s impeachment,\u201d said Lim Jie-Hyun, a professor at Sogang University. \u201cWhen people voted for Park Geun-hye, they didn\u2019t do so because of her.\u201d Park Geun-hye has offered a public apology several times and acknowledged she got some help from Choi for editing speeches and on the issue of public relations. But Park has denied any legal wrongdoing. The two women became friends in the 1970s, around the time when Park began serving as first lady after her mother was killed during a failed 1974 assassination attempt on her father. Park Geun-hye said Choi helped her \u201cwhen I had difficulties\u201d in the past. The two women had 573 phone calls between April 18, 2016 and Oct. 26, 2016, according to an investigation report by prosecutors. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has led the government as acting leader since Park\u2019s impeachment and he will continue to do so until South Korea elects new president by May. Some media reports said Hwang might run for presidency as a conservative candidate. If that happens, he should resign to run and a deputy prime minister will serve as another interim leader. In 2004, then President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached by parliament for alleged election law violations and incompetence, but the Constitutional Court later reinstated his power.",

            "article_content": "On the day the House Republican leadership pulled the plug on its plan to replace Obamacare, President Trump initially responded by saying that the best political move might be to just step back and let the law \u201cexplode.\u201d \u201cIt is exploding right now,\u201d he said. The coming weeks will reveal just how much the president is willing to step forward and nudge the law into collapse. While health care experts disagree on how fragile the Affordable Care Act is on its own, they agree that Mr. Trump has the power to hasten its demise. \u201cThere are states where the insurance market is fragile right now and in need of some repair, but if the Trump administration creates uncertainty or takes steps to undermine the law, that could leave large swaths of the country without insurance available,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior adviser at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Or, as health insurance industry expert Bob Laszewski put it: Republicans \u201chave to decide right now if they\u2019re going to stabilize this market or they\u2019re going to contribute to its blowing up -- because they can do both right now.\u201d The Trump administration could cripple the seven-year-old law if it decides to cut off the cost-sharing reduction payments -- subsidies the government gives insurance companies to help them comply with a legal mandate to lower out-of-pocket costs for consumers earning between 100 and 250 percent of the poverty line. The subsidies make insurance more affordable for poorer consumers, and they\u2019re a major part of the insurance industry\u2019s bottom line: the federal government paid insurance companies $7 billion last year. Without those payments, insurance companies could raise rates across the board, making insurance unaffordable for many more people. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that the average premium on a benchmark silver plan would increase 19 percent as insurers struggle to make up for lost revenue from the cost-sharing payments. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal last week, Trump floated the idea that he might end the payments. \u201cIf Congress doesn\u2019t approve [the payments], or if I don\u2019t approve it, that would mean that Obamacare doesn\u2019t have enough money so it dies immediately as opposed to over a period of time.\u00a0 Even if it got that money, it dies, but it dies over a period of time,\u201d the president said, adding that he\u2019s \u201cnot sure\u201d whether lawmakers will appropriate the necessary funds. But Mr. Trump then seemed to indicate that he would ultimately leave the matter up to Congress.\u00a0 \u201cIf they approve it, then I will have to approve it,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise, those payments don\u2019t get made and Obamacare is gone, just gone.\u201d\u00a0 In 2014, the GOP-led Congress sued the Obama administration over the insurer subsidies, arguing they were unconstitutional because the House hadn\u2019t formally appropriated the money. A judge ruled in their favor, but allowed the cost-sharing payments to continue while the Obama administration appealed the decision to a higher court. Mr. Trump\u2019s administration has not yet indicated how they will proceed. If President Trump does leave the future of cost-sharing payments to Congress, he could saddle Republicans with the messy work of precipitating the law\u2019s collapse. \u201cFor people who buy insurance on their own, a collapse of the market could mean that they literally have no insurance options available, no way of getting coverage, and no access to the tax credits that help them pay their premium through the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Levitt said. \u201cWe could easily see millions of people losing insurance and there would no doubt be all kinds of finger pointing about who is to blame. That would be a crisis that the White House would need to deal with.\u201d Levitt believes the law is fundamentally stable across most of the country with a few exceptions \u2013 Tennessee, Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and Nebraska \u2013 where the marketplaces were struggling. \u201cThere are fragile markets around country but by and large the insurance market is stable under the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s really no sign that Obamacare is exploding on its own.\u201d Laszewski takes a more critical view of the law\u2019s success. He said the law has worked well for those who benefitted from the Medicaid expansion, covering low-income people making up to 150 percent of the poverty line -- Americans who likely would not have otherwise had coverage. But those earning more than that struggled with high premiums and deductibles, primarily because there weren\u2019t enough eligible people signing up. \u201cThe biggest reason that Donald Trump can destroy this with a couple of different decisions is because it is already unstable. If this were stable, he wouldn\u2019t be able to destroy it between now and the fall when the rates come out; it would be able to withstand anything he could do to it administratively,\u201d Laszewski said. Insurers will need to decide in the coming months whether they will participate in the exchanges when enrollment opens in the fall. Before they do, however, they will need to know whether the Trump administration will keep the law running smoothly by making the cost-sharing payments, encouraging enrollment, and enforcing the individual mandate that forces people to buy insurance or pay a penalty \u2013 all things Mr. Trump has suggested he would not do. But that power is the reason Republicans must figure out what they\u2019re going to do -- soon, argued Laszewski. \u201cThey won the election; this is in very tough shape. And it\u2019s theirs to fix,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the notion that they\u2019re just going to sit back and let it explode, and millions of people are going to get hurt is not acceptable. They can\u2019t walk away from this.\u201d CBS News\u2019 Chip Reid contributed to this story. Rebecca Kaplan covers Congress for CBS News.",

            "article_content": "Pet theory: Not today, and not tomorrow, but somewhere down the line, Donald Trump might set out on a radical economic reform. In short, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see him try and give Americans, whether they\u2019re employed or not, a monthly infusion of free money in the form of a universal basic income\u00a0(UBI). A UBI\u00a0is an idea that the left loves and conservatives, predictably enough, have mixed feelings about. The central (and very simplified) gist of the idea involves giving people taxpayer dollars, either in lieu of, or more usually in addition to, whatever benefits they might already receive from the federal government. And they can do what they please with that money: save it, spend it, waste it, whatever.  There are various UBI proposals that have been kicked around by wonks, and there are many disagreements about how such a policy should be implemented. The UBI has been getting more attention recently, however, due to a Finnish pilot program that\u2019s giving money to a select group of Finns in order to see how it would work in practice.  The merits of a UBI program can be debated, and indeed have already been debated, at great length. Some on the left see it as a great way to severely reduce poverty. Critics on the right, meanwhile, worry that it would remove more people from the work force, which they argue would produce negative social effects.  Putting all that aside, there\u2019s something about a UBI that seems rather Trumpian. The president is not exactly a policy wonk, but the idea of just giving Americans cash, with little bureaucratic oversight or interference, would mesh well with his populist message. Looking ahead to 2020, it also would allow Trump to visit the downwardly-mobile Americans who voted for him and remind them that he literally put cash in their bank accounts.\u00a0 Or at least will have tried to. There is probably a way to get congressional Republicans to sign onto a UBI proposal assuming a) the White House was all for it and b) it was coupled with a slash in benefits. Then again, those cuts to programs they\u2019d demand in exchange might be unpopular enough to doom the whole effort from getting off the ground.  But let\u2019s take a step back and remember that Trump\u2019s top strategic advisor, Steve Bannon, has made it abundantly clear that he\u2019s a big-government guy. Last week, Mike Flynn described his ideas as \u201cmore left than right.\u201d Bannon himself doesn\u2019t make much effort to hide this: \u201cThe conservatives are going to go crazy. I\u2019m the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan,\u201d he told Michael Wolff just after the election. The UBI would seem to fit snugly in a worldview like that, particularly as we start to see more and more jobs losses due to automation in the coming years. And there\u2019s an easy social conservative argument for UBI, which is that it would allow parents, particularly mothers, to spend more time raising their children. It has the potential to reduce the great atomizing of society, increasingly a fixation of conservative intellectuals. What the proposal would look like is obviously the big issue here \u2013 who would get the money, how much, how do you pay for it, etc. But if Trump\u2019s polling numbers stay low for much longer, or dip even further, some sort of UBI proposal might start looking more and more attractive to the White House, if only as a Hail Mary somewhere down the line.\u00a0 Trump, a natural showman, knows that you need to shake up the plot when the ratings start to sag, and a UBI proposal would do that. It would put the left in a bit of a pickle \u2013 how do you resist a redistribution initiative from the right? \u2013 while at the same time bolstering his populist cred with voters.  It would make some sense, is what I\u2019m saying, even if it sounds bizarrely counterintuitive. Trump\u2019s detractors would no doubt argue that a plutocrat like him would never stick his neck out for what\u2019s really a lefty idea, and they might be right.  But from a purely political standpoint, given what we know of Trump\u2019s lack of any ideological mooring and his sense of theatre, I\u2019d argue there\u2019s at least a chance it happens. And sold the right way by a Republican president, it might even become reality.\u00a0 Will Rahn is a political correspondent and managing director, politics, for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "California's San Joaquin Valley may have some of the country's worst air pollution, but some officials hope the Trump administration can help in their fight against the Clean Air Act.\u00a0 The country's most productive farming region is engulfed by some of the nation's dirtiest skies, forcing the state's largest air district to spend more than $40 billion in the past quarter-century to enforce hundreds of stringent pollution rules. The investment has steadily driven down the number of days with unhealthy air \u2014 but on hot, windless days, a brown haze still hangs overhead, sending wheezing people with tight chests to emergency rooms and hundreds each year to an early grave. The valley's air also still violates federal standards for sooty pollution that comes from industry, businesses and vehicles. In California, where Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown is an outspoken leader in the global fight against climate change, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District now is waging a very public campaign against enforcement of the landmark U.S. Clean Air Act. Officials in the relatively conservative region have seized upon the election of Donald Trump, who won the popular vote in half of the district's eight counties in November \u2014 a far stronger performance than in most of California. The district's website prominently displays a report titled \"Presidential Transition White Paper\" that the director provided to the incoming Trump administration in calling for the elimination of the federal Air Act's \"costly bureaucratic red tape.\" District Executive Director Seyed Sadredin also reached out to Bakersfield Republican Kevin McCarthy, the GOP's U.S. House majority leader. And he testified in Washington for a bill co-authored by McCarthy that would limit new air standards under the Air Act to once every 10 years, instead of five. \"Regulators in Washington have issued blanket regulations that would unfairly impact the Central Valley's unique air challenges,\" McCarthy said in a statement. The San Joaquin Valley, with more than 4 million residents, produces nearly half the nation's fruits, nuts and vegetables, annually generating $47 billion. Its bad air is the byproduct of booming farms, oil production, two major highways, a web of rail lines \u2014 and the valley's bowl-shaped geography. The Sierra Nevada and two other mountain ranges wall in the 250-mile-long (400-kilometer-long) valley. The pollution is aggravated in winter when residents burn wood in fireplaces. In the blistering summer, an atmospheric lid traps haze, sometimes darkened by mountain forest fires. This summer, the San Joaquin Valley must report how it will meet a federal standard for fine particulate matter \u2014 harmful air pollution from dust, soot, smoke or chemical reactions. Sadredin says there's no way the district can meet the deadline. He contends the district could be subject to billions of dollars in annual penalties if it fails to comply within three years. At his request, language was inserted into McCarthy's bill that would protect the district from sanctions for vehicle pollution, which he says is beyond his authority to control. Sadredin said he hopes that with a Republican-dominated Congress and Trump's election, regulators will be more sensitive to his district's plight than during the Obama administration. Already, he said, officials at the Environment Protection Agency, now headed by business-friendly former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, have shown a \"greater willingness to be cooperative.\" EPA officials said they have never exacted strict penalties on a district and that harsh action would kick in only if a district refused to file an air cleanup plan or submitted a grossly insufficient one. Elizabeth Adams, acting director of the EPA's regional air division, said she'll work with the air district to help meet requirements. \"That's the ultimate goal for all our agencies,\" she said. \"It's important for people to breathe clean air.\" On the worst days, Natalie Sua keeps her six children inside their Fresno home, especially two sons with asthma. They'd rather be roughhousing on their backyard trampoline, but the risks are too high. When her 11-year-old, Javier, was a preschooler, she found him lying on the sofa one night, struggling for breath. Sua rushed the boy to the emergency room, where she says a doctor concluded the bad air and a chest cold triggered an asthma attack that nearly shut down his airway. \"Oh, my gosh. If it would have closed up all the way, I don't even know what would have happened,\" Sua said. Roughly 1,200 people each year die prematurely from the valley's polluted air, the California Air Resources Control Board says. The pollution is strongly linked to increased emergency room visits for asthma, especially in children, according to a 2011 California State University, Fresno study funded by the valley air district. Since 2002, the district has helped drive down the number of unhealthy days by 80 percent, an Associated Press review found. In Fresno County, 25 unhealthy air warnings were issued last year, and 15 were issued in Bakersfield and other parts of Kern County. Fresno, with about 500,000 residents, and Bakersfield, with 370,000, were among the three worst cities nationwide in the American Lung Association's annual report on unhealthy air. Environmentalists accuse the San Joaquin Valley district of giving in to business interests and sounding alarms about looming sanctions, rather than making the air healthier. \"If he's unable to clean up the air for the people in the valley with the tools he has, then he ought to be lobbying for more authority to be more strict,\" said Brent Newell, legal director for the nonprofit Center on Race, Poverty & the Environment. \"He's going the other direction.\" While the district resists federal rules, officials in famously hazy Los Angeles are working to meet the standards for particulate matter and don't anticipate penalties, said Sam Atwood, a South Coast Air Quality Management District spokesman. The valley air district's authority mainly is limited to stationary pollution sources such as oil refineries, power plants and food processors, as well as dispersed sources such as fireplaces, commercial barbecues and road paving. But Sadredin says he has no direct control over mobile sources such as trucks and trains hauling produce. He has asked the EPA to crack down on them with stricter rules .

            "article_content": "A few Democratic House members called out their own party for failing to connect politically with working-class Americans during a rally in Des Moines on Saturday, The Des Moines register first reported.  At the annual Iowa Steak Fry, a fundraising event organized by local Polk County Democrats, Reps. Cheri Bustos, D-Illinois; Seth Moulton, D-Massachusetts; and Tim Ryan, D-Ohio criticized their party for its inability to address middle class frustrations, and called on Democrats to refocus party efforts in this area. \"We let those people down. We let 'em down,\" Ryan said to the crowd, according to the Register. \"We didn't see them. We didn't listen to them. We didn't hear them. If we want to be a national party, not a coastal party, a national political party in the United States, we've got to get those workers back from Iowa, Ohio, Wisconsin, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky... Those are our people. We've got to go and get them.\" The group of House Democrats even gave credit to President Trump for his success in rallying a working-class base by addressing working-class related struggles such as job loss, minimized opportunities and wage stagnation. \"Frankly, my fellow Democrats, they don't want resistance; they want results,\" Bustos said of Midwest voters, according to the Register, apparently referencing some Democrats' \"resist\" slogan.  Bustos argued that her party should focus more on economic policy in an attempt to act on these working-class complaints, while Moulton suggested tackling the issue by investing in infrastructure and clean energy as sources of job creation.  Democrats, both in Iowa and on the national level, are working to reconstruct their party's message ahead of the 2018 elections in which they hope to regain a congressional majority. \"That means we've got work to do, Democrats,\" Moulton said. \"That means we've got change to make. That means we can't just keep doing the same old thing and expect to win again. We've got to get back to our party roots. We've got to get back in touch with those voters that we've lost.\" Blair Guild is a politics reporter and video producer for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Like many blue-collar neighborhoods, one barrio outside Caracas once embraced the promises of President Nicolas Maduro, but many here have now turned against him, reports CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez. Hunger has a way of doing that. Voting machine firm: Venezuela vote rigged \"without any doubt\" Fernando Contreras says he's lost 40 pounds since the troubles started. \"If you eat breakfast, you don't have lunch. If you have lunch, you won't have dinner,\" he said. Once a successful carpenter, the father of six says his fridge used to be filled with meat and potatoes. Now, it's \"water, some limes - nothing else,\" Contreras said.\u00a0 Just down the street, Bojorquez saw 200 people waiting hours for a simple loaf of bread.  The economic meltdown is at the heart of the political crisis. More than 120 people have been killed protesting Maduro's power grab. More clashes are expected Thursday as the government's new assembly starts to work that will give Maduro almost unlimited power. Trump hits Venezuelan president with round of sanctions Many wonder how long they can go on like this. An inflation rate of 800 percent has decimated savings. The currency is so devalued that some shopkeepers weigh the money rather than waste time counting it. And if residents are lucky enough to find food on the shelves, prices are out of sight. The price for Alexi Asuaje's groceries went up 1,000 Bolivares when he was in line. Florencia Cordero, a geologist, told Bojorquez that groceries now eat up almost 80 percent of her salary. Cordero said that a plantain cost what her house cost 25 years ago. It's something that's almost impossible to comprehend, she said. For all the condemnation of his regime around the world, Maduro remains unrepentant, and is using U.S. sanctions recently imposed on him as a rallying cry against foreign intervention.",

            "article_content": "CHAMBLEE, Ga. -- Early voting totals indicated 140,000 people had voted by Saturday in Georgia's special House election, which is considered the most expensive House race in U.S. history. \u00a0 Of the 140,000 votes, over 114,000 were cast in person and another 25,000 plus by mail, according to CBS affiliate WGCL. There are still over 8,000 outstanding mail-in ballots. Early voting ended Friday. Polls will open from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m. on Tuesday.\u00a0 With just three days left until the election, Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel are working around the clock to appeal to voters in the final days. Trying to stave off a major upset ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, two of President Trump's Cabinet officers returned to Atlanta's traditionally conservative suburbs and urged Republican voters to maintain the GOP's monopoly control in Washington.  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, a former two-term Georgia governor, took sharp aim at Handel's opponent in Tuesday's congressional runoff election, 30-year-old Ossoff, who has raised more than $23 million from people around the country hoping for a victory that could turn the tide on Trump.  \"This is a race for the heart and soul for America,\" Perdue told Handel supporters, casting Ossoff as a puppet of national Democrats and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.  \"The leftists have gone and typecast and they've picked this young man -- charismatic, articulate -- and they've taught him a few Republican buzzwords,\" Perdue said. \"They think he can fool you. It's not gonna happen.\"  But it very well may, with polls showing a tossup in Georgia's 6th Congressional District, where Republicans usually coast.  Ossoff brought some political celebrity firepower of his own, campaigning Saturday with civil rights icon John Lewis, the Atlanta congressman from the neighboring 5th district.  \"Let's honor him ... and who all who sacrificed with him\" by casting a ballot, Ossoff told his supporters at one stop.  Lewis called Ossoff \"smart\" and \"good,\" before embracing the young candidate who was born barely a month after Lewis was sworn in as a congressman. Lewis, whose criticism of Trump has drawn Twitter jabs from the president, did not mention the administration.  The candidates' choices on the final weekend of campaigning reflect their expectations of a razor-thin margin that will turn as much on core partisans as on persuading moderates and independents.  The results will be seen as a measure of how voters feel about Republican leadership months into the Trump presidency. Trump barely won this well-educated, affluent district in November, despite previous Republican nominees here eclipsing 60 percent. Perdue defended Trump as \"a true populist,\" but acknowledged that even \"some Republicans\" are \"turned off\" by the president.  Health Secretary Tom Price, whose resignation to join Trump's Cabinet prompted this special election, urged voters to have a \"crazy turnout\" on Handel's behalf. He reminded his former constituents of the district's GOP pedigree, electing eventual Speaker Newt Gingrich and future U.S.  Sen. Johnny Isakson before sending Price to Washington for 12 years.  Handel made a similar appeal to honor the district's \"legacy.\" She said voters \"know me\" from stints as secretary of state and commission chairman of Georgia's most populous county.  Ossoff and Handel insist their matchup - recognized as the most expensive House race in U.S. history because of money from outside the district - is not about or the dynamics on Capitol Hill. But Perdue flatly disputed them, calling the election \"a harbinger of national politics\" as Handel looked on.  Democrats and liberal activists nationally hope to show they can flip the 24 GOP-held seats they would need to reclaim a House majority next November. They argue Ossoff's near-win in the first round already bodes well for Democrats running in other suburban districts where Republicans don't start with such a fundamental advantage.  There are 23 GOP-held House districts around the country where Trump actually lost to Hillary Clinton.  Handel has raised more than $5 million, less than a quarter of Ossoff's total, but national political action and campaign committees aligned with both parties have spent big as well: $7 million from a PAC backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan; about $4.5 million from Republicans' House campaign arm, and another $6 million from the Democrats' House campaign committee.  Ossoff's television ads target swing voters and disaffected Republicans, promising an \"independent voice\" and lambasting \"wasteful spending\" by \"both parties in Washington.\" But his day-to-day campaign operation has focused more on the Democrats' main coalition: young voters, nonwhites and women.  Ossoff also has sought to make health care a defining issue, even before Price's return to the district.  The Democrat says House Republicans' health care bill punishes working-class households that gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act, and would \"gut\" consumer protections for individuals with previous maladies in their medical history.  Handel says the Senate can make improvements, but she'd have voted for the House-passed version. She rejects the Congressional Budget Office estimate that 23 million Americans could lose coverage under Republicans' plan, and she insists the bill protects those with pre-existing conditions.  The bill declares that insurers cannot deny coverage based on patient history - a point central to Handel's claims. But the proposal also would allow states to obtain waivers that would jettison existing prohibitions on charging more for patients based on individual history and risk.  Ossoff says removing that cost protection makes any coverage guarantee \"useless,\" because policies would become unaffordable, particularly given the Republicans' proposal to roll back premium subsidies that are a primary feature of the 2010 law.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0-- Former national security adviser Michael Flynn was paid more than $67,000 by Russian companies before the presidential election, according to documents released Thursday by a Democratic congressman. Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland asked the Trump administration to provide a comprehensive record of Flynn\u2019s contacts with foreign governments and interests. Flynn accepted $33,750 from Russia\u2019s government-run television system for appearing at a Moscow event in December 2015 - a few months before Flynn began formally advising President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign - and thousands more in expenses covered by the network and in speech fees from other Russian firms, according to the documents. Flynn\u2019s financial relationship with the RT network may violate a constitutional provision against gifts from foreign governments, said Cummings, who released documents obtained during the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform\u2019s inquiry into Flynn\u2019s activities before Trump appointed him to become national security adviser. In addition to the record of Flynn\u2019s foreign contacts, Cummings, the senior Democrat on the committee, also asked the Defense Department to compel Flynn to pay the money he received to the U.S. government. \u201cI am writing to request information about whether Gen. Flynn fully disclosed- as part of the security clearance and vetting process for his return to government- his communications with Russian agents, Turkish agents and other foreign agents, as well as his payments from foreign sources,\u201d Cummings wrote. Last week, Flynn registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent whose lobbying work may have benefited the Turkish government. The lobbying occurred before Election Day, from August to November, during the period when Flynn was Trump\u2019s campaign adviser. Trump fired Flynn as national security adviser last month, saying the former U.S. Army lieutenant general misled Vice President Mike Pence and other White House officials about his conversations with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. Flynn\u2019s ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are part of House and Senate committee investigations into contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians. The newly-released files show that RT - designated by the U.S. intelligence community as a propaganda arm for Russia\u2019s government - also paid for luxury hotel stays and other expenses incurred by Flynn and his adult son, Michael Flynn Jr., during the Moscow trip. Flynn, who was fired in August 2014 as chief of the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the climax of the televised RT gala. Cummings said Flynn\u2019s acceptance of payments from RT violated the emoluments provision of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits retired military officers from accepting gifts from foreign powers. RT identifies itself as an independent news network, but a report by U.S. intelligence agencies made public in January said RT has long been considered by the U.S. government to be a Russian propaganda arm. In letters sent to Trump, Defense Secretary James Mattis and FBI Director James Comey, Cummings said Flynn \u201cviolated the Constitution by accepting tens of thousands of dollars from an agent of a global adversary that attacked our democracy.\u201d Cummings was referring to the intelligence agencies\u2019 conclusion that Russia instigated cyber-hacking of Democratic party officials and organizations in the months before the presidential election. The Defense Department has said retired military officers are covered by the emoluments clause because they could be recalled to military service. The department has also noted that the prohibition on accepting foreign gifts includes commercial groups controlled by foreign governments or others \u201cconsidered instruments of the foreign government.\u201d A Flynn spokesman said Flynn informed the DIA before he went to Moscow and after his return. Price Floyd, a spokesman for Flynn, said that \u201cas many former government officials and general officers have done, Gen. Flynn signed with a speakers\u2019 bureau and these are examples of that work.\u201d DIA spokesman Jim Kudla said Thursday that Flynn did report to the agency in advance that he was traveling to Moscow \u201cin accordance with standard security clearance procedures.\u201d Separately, the Army is looking into the matter of Flynn\u2019s reporting and compensation, but has found no answers yet, according to spokesman Col. Pat Seiber. Emails indicate Flynn initially asked for a higher fee than the $45,000 paid to his speakers\u2019 group, Leading Authorities Inc., but was asked to reduce his price. Flynn\u2019s take from RT was ultimately $33,750 after Leading Authorities received its commission. \u201cIf Gen. Flynn is coming, we would like him to be front and central at the Moscow conference,\u201d an RT official told Flynn\u2019s representatives in a November 2015 email. During his Moscow stay, Flynn was interviewed by an RT personality on national security affairs before attending the lavish RT gala with Putin. In an addition to the RT payments, Flynn was also paid $11,250 for two speeches in Washington - one in August for Volga-Dnepr Airlines, a Russian charter cargo airline, and a second, in September, for Kaspersky Government Security Solutions Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Kaspersky Lab, a Russian-based cybersecurity firm. Flynn and his son also received an unspecified amount in expenses paid by RT for business-class flights to and from Moscow and for their three-day stay at the Hotel Metropol. RT representatives said the stay offered tours of the Kremlin, RT headquarters, the Bolshoi Theater and art museums. Another attendee who took part in some of the tours told The Associated Press they did not see Flynn at those events. Cummings said he has given the Trump administration, the FBI and the Defense Department until April 7 to produce documents related to Flynn\u2019s contacts with foreign nationals and any documentation of funds he received from foreign sources. Cummings also asked for documents about Flynn\u2019s security clearance over the past 10 years. They include how Flynn answered questions about his contact with foreign nationals, his work for foreign governments and businesses, and any international real estate holdings. The release of the documents comes one week after Flynn and his firm, Flynn Intel Group, registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents whose lobbying work may have benefited the government of Turkey. The registration involved $530,000 worth of lobbying that Flynn\u2019s firm performed for a company owned by a Turkish businessman. In that filing, Flynn acknowledged the lobbying on behalf of the company, Inovo BV, \u201ccould be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\u201d The AP reported last week that while Flynn was under consideration for the top national security post, his attorneys informed the presidential transition team that it was likely he would have to register as a foreign agent. After Flynn was appointed, his attorneys then notified the White House counsel\u2019s office that a filing was imminent. The White House initially said it had no recollection of the second discussion but later acknowledged such a contact had occurred.",

            "article_content": "Marine Le Pen, the embodiment of far-right populist discontent in France who has drawn comparisons to Donald Trump, is trailing her opponent in national opinion polls ahead of Sunday's presidential election by a significant margin.  But as\u00a0Brexit proved in Britain\u00a0and the election of Donald Trump reinforced in the U.S., opinion polls get it wrong sometimes, and a very different of measure of support suggests Le Pen could give her centrist opponent Emmanuel Macron a real run for his money this weekend. Hours before the rivals faced off in a heated, personality-bashing TV debate on Wednesday evening, a social media company released data suggesting the diametrically opposed candidates enjoy near-equal support. SocialFlow co-founder Frank Speiser says data on mentions of both candidates on Facebook and other social media platforms in the week leading up to the election suggest they are running in a \"virtual dead heat,\" and thus, \"any attempts to call an early victor in the election now would be absolute conjecture.\"\u00a0 While SocialFlow's data do not discern between positive and negative mentions on Facebook, Speiser says the company used similar methodology to accurately predict Britain's vote to break away from the European Union (Brexit), \"to the exact percentage,\" and Mr. Trump's landslide win in November -- both of which took most traditional pollsters by surprise. Speiser tells CBS News that SocialFlow's data seem to reveal voter intent that traditional polling effectively misses. It does that, he says, by guaging the attitudes of people \"who tend not to engage in the political process.\" In other words, first time voters and others who are \"not the type of people who would ever respond to a poll.\" Nevertheless, the most recent polling in France gives Macron an advantage of about 20 points heading into the vote, and his performance in the fiery Wednesday night debate -- the only live televised debate to take place before the election -- appeared to bolster his standing.  A snap poll conducted immediately after the debate for France's BFMTV network showed 63 percent of viewers believed Macron had bettered his rival. Le Pen has long-dismissed polls suggesting she cannot win the election, pointing out to Anderson Cooper in an interview for \"60 Minutes\" earlier this year that they \"also said that Brexit wasn't going to happen, and that Donald Trump wasn't going to be elected -- wasn't even going to be his party's nominee. Well, they're saying that less and less now.\"\u00a0 Speiser, of SocialFlow, said data on social media interactions both during and after the debate followed the trend of the pre-debate data, showing near equal engagement with Macron and Le Pen content.\u00a0 The Wednesday night debate turned into an uncivil, no-holds-barred head-on clash of styles, politics and personalities. Macron called his far-right opponent a \"parasite\" who would lead the country into civil war. She painted the former banker as a lackey of big business who is soft on Islamic extremism. Neither landed a knockout blow in the 2\u00bd-hour prime-time slugfest -- but not for lack of trying. The tone was ill-tempered from the get-go, with no common ground or love lost between the two candidates and their polar opposite plans and visions for France. Both sought to destabilize each other and neither really succeeded. For the large cohort of voters who remain undecided, the debate at least had the merit of making abundantly clear the stark choice facing them at the ballot box Sunday. Neither candidate announced major shifts in their policy platforms. They instead spent much of their carefully monitored allotments of time attacking each other -- often personally. Le Pen's choicest barb came as she argued that Macron, if elected, would be in the pocket of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"Either way France will be led by a woman; either me or Madame Merkel,\" she said derisively. Macron gave as good as he got and, at times, got the upper hand with his pithy slights. In the closing minutes, he used a sharp-tongued monologue to target one of Le Pen's biggest vulnerabilities: her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, the extreme-right former presidential candidate repeatedly convicted for hate speech and who founded her party, the National Front. Throughout, Macron portrayed Marine Le Pen as an empty shell, shaky on details and facts, seeking to profit politically by stirring up hatred and the anger of French voters -- a dominant theme of the campaign -- without feasible proposals. He called her \"the high priestess of fear.\" \"Your project consists of telling the French people, 'This person is horrible.' It's to cast dirt. It's to lead a campaign of lies and falsifications. Your project lives off fear and lies. That's what sustains you. That's what sustained your father for decades. That's what nourished the extreme right and that is what created you,\" Macron said. \"You are its parasite.\" \"What class!\" Le Pen retorted. One of the most heated exchanges was on terrorism -- a top concern for Le Pen's voters and many French in the wake of repeated attacks since 2015. Saying that Islamic extremists must be \"eradicated,\" Le Pen said Macron wouldn't be up to the task. \"You won't do that,\" she charged. Saying France's fight against terror would be his priority if elected, Macron countered that Le Pen's anti-terror plans would play into extremists' hands and divide France. \"The trap they're setting for us, the one that you're proposing, is civil war. What the terrorists expect is division among ourselves. What the terrorists expect is heinous speech,\" Macron said. They clashed over France's finances, its future and their respective proposals for tackling its ills. He scoffed at her monetary plans, saying reintroducing a franc for purchases within France but allowing big firms to continue using the shared euro currency that Le Pen wants to abandon made no sense. She dismissed his economic proposals with sweeping critiques and bristled at his suggestions that she didn't understand how finance and business work. \"You're trying to play with me like a professor with a pupil,\" she said. They also clashed over foreign policy. Macron said he wants to work with U.S. President Donald Trump on intelligence-sharing, at the United Nations and on climate change. He spoke less favorably of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying on many subjects \"we don't have the same values and priorities.\" \"We have no reason to be in a cold war with Russia,\" Le Pen said. He said that her election would harm France's image abroad, charging: \"The world won't look favorably on us.\" Trailing in polls, Le Pen needed but failed to land a knockout blow in the debate to erode the seemingly comfortable lead of Macron. For Macron, the priority was to prevent Le Pen from making up ground in the race's final days, and it appears he accomplished that mission -- unless the polls are proven wrong, yet again.",

            "article_content": "SEATTLE -- Seattle Mayor Ed Murray on Tuesday dropped his re-election bid for a second term after four men claimed he sexually abused them when they were teenagers, claims vehemently denied by Murray as an anti-gay political conspiracy aimed at derailing his campaign.\u00a0 Murray said for weeks after the allegations emerged that he would press on in his campaign for a second term, but told reporters that he decided it was best for Seattle to end his campaign and not seek another term. He said he will serve out his term through the end of this year.\u00a0 \"It tears me to pieces to step away but I believe it's in the best interest of this city that I love,\" Murray said.\u00a0 \"The scandal surrounding [me] is hurting this city. It hurts those who have been victims of abuse. It hurts my family,\" he said, according to\u00a0CBS Seattle affiliate KIRO. \"For these reasons, I am announcing I am withdrawing as a candidate for mayor... I must admit that my heart aches.\"\u00a0 The 62-year-old Murray was elected in 2013 and successfully pushed to raise Seattle's hourly minimum wage to $15.\u00a0 \"Serving you as mayor of the city I love has been the honor of a lifetime,\" he tweeted on Tuesday. Serving you as mayor of the city I love has been the honor of a lifetime. Before winning the city's top job, he served for 18 years as a state lawmaker. He was the prime sponsor of Washington's same-sex marriage law, spearheaded an effort to protect LGBTQ youth in public schools and led the state's push to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation.\u00a0 After President Trump was elected last fall, Murray became a frequent, high-profile critic. He recently announced Seattle was suing over Mr. Trump's executive order that threatens to withhold federal funds from communities that refuse to cooperate with efforts to find and deport immigrants in the country illegally. Last month a man filed a lawsuit claiming he was sexually abused by Murray in the 1980s when he was a teenager. Three made similar allegations, and all were denied by Murray.  A judge last week sanctioned the lawyer for the man who sued Murray for \"flagrant\" violations of ethical rules.  The judge fined lawyer Lincoln Beauregard $5,000 for violating the rules of civil procedure. Murray's lawyer had called for sanctions against Beauregard, accusing him of using stunts to try to generate negative publicity against the mayor.\u00a0 Before the lawsuit emerged, Murray was expected to win a second term in a field that included high-profile challenger Nikkita Oliver, a community activist and attorney.  Shortly after the claims were announced, former Mayor Mike McGinn announced he would join the race run against Murray, who defeated McGinn in 2013. Also Monday, state Sen. Bob Hasegawa said he would also run. Both are Democrats.\u00a0 On Tuesday, McGuinn called on Murray to resign. \"In order to focus on the future, for the sake of survivors & the city, I feel @mayoredmurray should resign,\" he tweeted. In order to focus on the future, for the sake of survivors & the city, I feel @mayoredmurray should resign. Murray grew up in working class neighborhoods in and around Seattle and became one of the state's most prominent political figures.

            "article_content": "PHILADELPHIA -- Xavier Totti moved to the mainland United States from his native Puerto Rico 43 years ago. He is still asked routinely if he is \"legal,\" and when he mails packages to relatives back home, he has to fill out an international form. So, the 65-year-old anthropologist was not surprised by a Morning Consult-New York Times poll that showed more than half of Americans don't realize that Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory -- and that its residents are U.S. citizens. \"By now, it's sort of comical, but it makes me feel second-class, like you don't belong,\" said Totti, who lives in New York City. Many Puerto Ricans share that view -- a sentiment reinforced by what critics say has been a slow federal response to the humanitarian crisis that descended on Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria devastated the island. \"The response from Congress ... has been almost as if Puerto Rico did not exist,\" said Jose Cruz, a political scientist at the University at Albany-State University of New York. His mother and sister live on the island. President Trump's response \"has been inadequate,\" Cruz said. \"He should have been there last week. Puerto Rico is not a priority.\" As if to bolster that assessment, Mr. Trump fired an early-morning Twitter barrage Saturday against San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who had accused the administration Friday of \"killing us with the inefficiency\" since the storm. \"Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a series of tweets from his golf club in New Jersey. \"They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.\" ...Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They.... ...want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job. CBS News correspondent David Begnaud was in San Juan on Saturday. He said on CBSN that residents are talking about when they will get food or water and many of the residents don't have the cellphone service to read what the president is tweeting. Critics seized, in particular, on the president's use of the word \"them.\" A photograph of the mayor, chest-deep in fetid water as she used a bullhorn to call out to victims, was all over social media -- as were images of Mr. Trump hitting golf balls. \"She has been working 24/7,\" tweeted \"Hamilton\" star and creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, who is of Puerto Rican descent. \"You have been GOLFING. You're going straight to hell.\" She has been working 24/7. You have been GOLFING.You're going straight to hell. Fastest golf cart you ever took. https://t.co/5hOY23MBvQ For her part, the mayor tweeted back photos of herself talking with rescue workers, wading through floodwaters and comforting an elderly woman. \"The goal is one: saving lives,\" Mayor Cruz wrote. \"This is the time to show our 'true colors.' We cannot be distracted by anything else.\" The goal is one: saving lives. This is the time to show our \"true colors\". We cannot be distracted by anything else. pic.twitter.com/7PAINk19xM The president is slated to visit the island on Tuesday. On Friday, Mr. Trump pledged to help Puerto Ricans in the recovery, saying the island \"is totally unable\" to handle the catastrophe and adding that things are going \"as you know, really well.\" \"We've made tremendous strides,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We have to rebuild. If you look at it, the electric is gone, roads are gone, telecommunications is gone. The real question is what is going to happen later.\" Mr. Trump announced the visit after being criticized for going days without tweeting about the Puerto Rican crisis. When he did mention it on Monday, he referred to the island's \"broken infrastructure & massive debt,\" its old electrical grid being \"in terrible shape\" and \"billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with.\" Rep. Nydia Velazquez, a New York Democrat who was born in Puerto Rico, said earlier this week that she was \"offended and insulted\" by Mr. Trump's tweet. She and other members drew parallels between the federal government's responses to Maria and Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005. \"This is Katrina 2017. Let there be no misunderstanding about that,\" Illinois Democrat Luis Gutierrez said Wednesday. Last week, Mr. Trump cleared the way for more supplies and funds to get into Puerto Rico by lifting for 10 days the federal restrictions on foreign ships delivering cargo -- a period that some Latino members of Congress argued should last at least a year. Puerto Ricans have been recognized as U.S. citizens for a century. A majority of them -- roughly 5 million -- live in the United States, while an estimated 3.4 million live on the island. Puerto Ricans living on the mainland can vote for president in the general election every four years, yet residents of the island cannot, nor do they have voting representation in Congress. Latino members of Congress have been among the most vocal and outraged over what they have called a delayed response. Eight lawmakers, many of them Latino, sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security, linking Puerto Rico's current crisis to larger problems with federal oversight. They urged the agency to relax shipping restrictions for a longer period of time, and asked that Puerto Rico not be held responsible for sharing recovery costs under normal federal rules. \"The people of Puerto Rico have long been denied the same benefits provided to other American citizens,\" the letter read. \"Today, the stakes are just too high.\" Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico on Sept. 20 as a Category 4 storm, the strongest to hit the island in a century. At least 16 people have died. Nearly everyone on the island was left without power and most are without water. Hurricane Katrina made landfall in August 2005, leaving more than 1,800 people dead, and causing damage estimated at more than $175 billion. Then-President George W. Bush was criticized for what some saw as a slow federal response to the humanitarian crisis in New Orleans that followed the natural disaster. Florida Democrat Darren Soto referenced the prior storm in urging Mr. Trump to visit sooner. \"Don't let this be another Katrina,\" the congressman said. \"The people of Puerto Rico are dying,\" Soto said. \"They're out of food. They're out of gas. These are American citizens. They pledge allegiance to our flag. They pay taxes.\" On Friday, Cruz, the San Juan mayor, lashed out over Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke's comment declaring the federal response \"a good news story.\" \"Damn it, this is not a good news story,\" Cruz told CNN. \"This is a people-are-dying story.\" On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Mr. Trump is actively monitoring recovery efforts and that the \"full weight\" of the federal government is engaged to get food, water, health care and other resources to people in need. \"Our message to the incredible people of Puerto Rico is this: The President is behind you,\" Sanders said. \"We all are - the entire country. ... We will not let you down.\" Carmen Febo San Miguel, a doctor in Philadelphia and executive director of Taller Puertorriqueno, said she followed media coverage of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria over the past month, including a telethon for victims of Harvey that raised millions of dollars, and wondered where such efforts were for her home. \"If Puerto Rico was a state in the United States, the response would be very different,\" said Febo San Miguel, whose organization uses art to promote development within the Philadelphia Latino community. \"We are compatriots. This situation has brought to the surface in a very clear way how Puerto Ricans are treated as not American citizens.\"",

            "article_content": "A Republican has represented Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District, located in Atlanta\u2019s well-heeled northern suburbs, since Newt Gingrich won it in 1978. Dr. Tom Price, a staunch conservative, represented it from 2005 to earlier this year, when he became the new secretary of Health and Human Services. But 30-year-old Democrat Jon Ossoff, a former Capitol Hill staffer, now has a rather good chance of winning the seat. Tuesday is the first round of voting in what\u2019s known as a \u201cjungle primary,\u201d in which the top two candidates -- regardless of party -- go on to face each other in a runoff election on June 20 \u2013 unless one candidate can get 50 percent of the vote.  In every poll conducted, Ossoff has far more support than any of the 17 other candidates, and if he gets 50 percent of the vote or more Tuesday night he\u2019ll avoid a runoff and become the district\u2019s next congressman. If he comes in under 50 percent, he\u2019ll face off against whichever one of the Republicans gets second place.\u00a0 For one thing, he\u2019s running against 11 Republicans, meaning that the conservative vote is split while Ossoff has the Democratic vote essentially tied up. For another, the district \u2013 while reliably Republican \u2013 isn\u2019t particularly well suited to Mr. Trump\u2019s populist approach. Price easily won re-election in November with 62 percent of the vote. Mr. Trump, however, just barely held on to the district, beating Democrat Hillary Clinton by less than two percent.  A lot of it comes down to demographics. Georgia\u2019s 6th is one of the best-educated districts in the country, with 58 percent of its residents having a bachelor\u2019s degree or better, according to The Wall Street Journal. And college-educated whites are a group Mr. Trump has had trouble with \u2013 he won their vote by just 3 points in 2016, while Mitt Romney won them by a landslide 14-point margin in 2012.  This is the flip side of Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to win some typically Democratic districts in the Rust Belt; his style of politics works well among some working-class voters, but turns off people in wealthy, well-educated, and otherwise GOP-leaning suburbs. Romney did much better in Georgia\u2019s 6th back in 2012, winning the district by over 23 points against then-President Barack Obama.  There\u2019s a very good chance, assuming Ossoff doesn\u2019t win the 50 percent of the vote needed to avoid a run-off. If he falls short, Republicans are likely to coalesce around whatever Republican comes in second place -- and that might be enough to stop Ossoff in this Democratic-leaning district.\u00a0 That Republican will probably be either former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, state Sen. Judson Hill, businessman Bob Gray, or former state Sen. Dan Moody. But given how few voters tend to show up in these elections, it\u2019s hard to predict which Republican will come out on top. Whoever it is, they\u2019ll likely have a lot of money at their disposal as national Republican groups put money into the race.  A lot. Ossoff raised $8.3 million in the first quarter of the year alone, with most of that money coming from small donors \u2013 and the vast majority of it coming from outside the state. That\u2019s been met by millions in anti-Ossoff spending from outside groups affiliated with the GOP, including the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund, who have together dumped more than $5 million into the race.  Yes, and he wants people to know that he\u2019s no fan of Ossoff. This is what he tweeted Monday morning: The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes! Ossoff, for his part, responded to the tweet by saying he\u2019s \u201cglad\u201d Mr. Trump is interested in the race, but that the president is \u201cmisinformed\u201d about the Democrat\u2019s agenda. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump tweeted about the race again just hours before the polls closed. Just learned that Jon @Ossoff, who is running for Congress in Georgia, doesn't even live in the district. Republicans, get out and vote! Ossoff says he lives some \u201c10 minutes\u201d outside the district in order to live with his girlfriend, a student at medical school, but grew up in the district and will live again in it soon.\u00a0 If Ossoff ends up winning, or even if he loses narrowly, expect Democrats to start sounding very bullish about their chances of taking the House come 2018. That\u2019s because Georgia\u2019s 6th is exactly the kind of suburban red district Democrats need to be able to compete in if they\u2019re going to pull off that feat. Democrats will also be sure to point to the race as a referendum on the first few months of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency.\u00a0 But there\u2019s a danger in reading too deeply into races like this. This is just one seat in one area of the country, and turnout in special elections like this tend to be quite small. Plus, special elections don\u2019t always point to a greater trend on the horizon -- in 2010, for example, Democrats were able to hold onto a conservative district in Pennsylvania vacated by the late Rep. Jack Murtha in a special election. Democrats hoped this was a sign that they could hold onto the House later that year. Instead, they got walloped in a historic wave election that cost them dozens of seats and control of Congress.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lesson here for the Republicans as well. Even if they manage to hold onto the district, the race has arguably been a lot more difficult than it ever should have been. Win or lose, there\u2019s still a real danger that the GOP in the Trump era is alienating too many people in suburban districts Republicans have long dominated.",

Haley, Trump administration zero in on Iran One key thing Iranians are voting on is how their country will relate to the U.S. and the rest of the world, with openess and cooperation led by Rouhani, the reformist, or with suspicion and hostility under the conservative Raisi.\u00a0 Thirty-eight years ago, revolutionary Iranian students held 52 Americans hostage in the U.S. embassy.

            "article_content": "JOHN DICKERSON: Today on FACE THE NATION, despite chaos in the Capitol over sexual harassment scandals, tax cut legislation races through Congress at a blistering pace. While Senate Republicans made it clear they do not want Alabama's Roy Moore to join their club-- MITCH MCCONNELL: He's obviously not fit to be in the United States Senate. And we've looked at all the options to try to prevent that from happening. JOHN DICKERSON: --Democrats confront a problem in their ranks as former funny-man-turned senator Al Franken is accused of inappropriate advances before he was elected. President stayed mum on Moore. WOMAN: Mister President, do you believe Roy Moore's accusers? JOHN DICKERSON: But took to Twitter to criticize Democrat Franken despite Mister Trump's own history of allegations from women citing improper conduct. No double standard here says White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS: Senator Franken has admitted wrongdoing and the President hasn't. I think that's a very clear distinction. JOHN DICKERSON: The spectacle is not slowing progress on the mammoth tax reform bill which passed the House-- PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Thank you. The tax is going really well. Thank you very much. JOHN DICKERSON: --but faces a less certain future in the Senate where tempers are already short. SHERROD BROWN: This tax cut really is not for the middle class, it's for the rich. ORRIN HATCH: And I've been here working my whole stinking career for people who don't have a chance, and I really resent anybody saying that I'm just doing this for the rich. Give me a break. SHERROD BROWN: With all due respect, I get sick and tired of the richest people in the country-- MAN: Regular order, Mister Chairman. SHERROD BROWN: --getting richer and richer. MAN: Regular order. SHERROD BROWN: How many times do we do this before we learn this? ORRIN HATCH: I get a little tired of that crap. If we brought together, we could pull this country out of every-- every mess it's in. JOHN DICKERSON: Will the middle class really benefit from this tax package? We'll talk with budget director Mick Mulvaney. Plus, Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton who's pushing a provision to end the Obamacare mandate in the tax bill. And California Democratic Congresswoman Jackie Speier who is leading the effort to change attitudes in Congress about sexual harassment. We'll also have plenty of political analysis. It's all coming up on FACE THE NATION. Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. I'm John Dickerson. Minnesota Democrat Al Franken has stayed out of sight so far this weekend as senators from both parties and Franken himself have called for an ethics investigation into charges that he made unwanted advances towards model Leeann Tweeden during a 2006 USO trip. As for Roy Moore, with the Alabama special election scheduled three weeks from Tuesday, it will be up to the voters to determine whether or not he'll make it to the Senate. We begin with CBS News correspondent Dean Reynolds who is in Birmingham. Dean, what are the chances that Mister Moore goes to Washington? DEAN REYNOLDS (CBS News Correspondent): Well, they're not very good, John, if the Birmingham News has anything to say about it. There you see their editorial today, \"Reject Roy Moore.\" They found him unfit on many levels beyond just the improprieties that are alleged with younger women in his days as a prosecutor when he was in his thirties. Moreover this editorial endorses Doug Jones, his Democratic opponent. It is just the latest attempt to block Moore's path to Washington. (Begin VT) WOMAN: Good morning, Judge Moore. ROY MOORE: Good morning. DEAN REYNOLDS: Judge Roy Moore self-styled champion of the Ten Commandments has claimed the support of evangelicals in his race for the Senate but some in that community were pushing back this weekend. The Reverend William Barber said Moore's worldview made him unfit even before the allegations of impropriety emerged. WILLIAM BARBER: Moore imagines the struggle for equality in America as a story of loss. MAN #1: Are your accusers lying? DEAN REYNOLDS: No one got to ask Moore about that or much of anything else because he spent much of the week dodging questions. No elaboration on his defiant stands against his women accusers. ROY MOORE: Scurrilous, false charges. Not charges, allegations, which I have emphatically denied time and time again. DEAN REYNOLDS: His lawyers tried to discredit those accusers in one case doubting Moore's inscription on a woman's yearbook around the time she says he attacked her. MAN #2: Release the yearbook so that we can determine is it genuine or is it a fraud. DEAN REYNOLDS: And as his wife said on Friday, he's in for the long haul. KAYLA MOORE: He will not step down. (Crowd cheering) KAYLA MOORE: He will not stop fighting for the people of Alabama. DEAN REYNOLDS: While Moore's core support is estimated at no more than thirty percent of eligible voters here, they are deeply committed as columnist Steve Flowers explained. STEVE FLOWERS: Moore's people will not stay home. The seventy-five to eighty-five-year-old guy who lives in the evangelical church, he's got December 12 circled on his calendar. (End VT) DEAN REYNOLDS: It's a political cliche but it is true here in Alabama, turn out will be everything. Yet few people think the turn out will exceed more than twenty percent of eligible voters which could provide a window of opportunity for Roy Moore and his very, very dedicated followers. John. JOHN DICKERSON: Dean Reynolds for us in Birmingham. Thanks, Dean. If Roy Moore does get elected to the Senate, the next move is up to his Senate colleagues. We're joined now by one potential Republican colleague, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Senator Cotton, I want to talk to you about tax reform in a moment. But let's talk about this Moore situation for a moment. Cory Gardner, one of your Republican colleagues who's in charge of getting Republicans elected said that the Senate should expel Moore if he wins and is sent to Washington, would you support that? SENATOR TOM COTTON (R-Arkansas/@SenTomCotton): Well, John, first let me take a step back from Roy Moore and speak of in general about sexual harassment and sexual assault. It's a very serious matter, it has no place on the job, no place in our society. I think sadly too many women have faced that over the course of their lives. And it's not a partisan issue. There are misbehaving men in both the Democratic and Republican parties and unfortunately there are female victims in both parties as well. It's not even a political matter. I mean, it's happened in your industry, in the media, it's happened in Hollywood, it happens in business. So, I think it's important that women feel once they have been subject to sexual harassment and especially sexual assault that they can come forward now since, you know, the Harvey Weinstein allegation was broke about a month or so ago. And that's a good thing. And that's a good change in the norms and the expectations of our society. As far as Roy Moore goes, I'm not going to speculate about hypotheticals about what may happen should he win. We're only three weeks out from the election. He made it pretty clear this week that he's not going to step aside. So, as you said in your intro, it's going to be up to the people of Alabama to make that decision. JOHN DICKERSON: You said you wouldn't encourage the people of Alabama to vote for him. What's better for Senate Republicans if Roy Moore wins and comes to Washington as a Republican or if a Democrat wins in that race? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, what's better for Senate Republicans is what's better for the American is that we focus on the work ahead of us, which is the tax bill that cuts middle class taxes, cuts taxes on businesses and repeals the hated Obamacare mandate. I'll leave it to the people of Alabama to make the decision about Roy Moore and Doug Jones. JOHN DICKERSON: Before we get to taxes, let me ask you about this norm-- these norms you're talking about that have changed because of this and-- change-- historic change in American culture which as you say is going across corporations, the media, Congress. So, Al Franken faces a moment now, what is the emerging standard in terms of how you assess these accusations that comes forward for somebody? SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think it's hard to generalize about all cases in parti-- or in-- in general, because each case is particular; different kinds of allegations, different kinds of conduct, different kinds of evidence. So I think it's important that we take the issue of sexual harassment and sexual assault seriously and that we take each case on its individual merits and valuate them carefully. JOHN DICKERSON: And finally on this, the new norms, a lot of people said, well, there were a dozen or so accusers for President Trump. Should these new norms cause a reevaluation of those who came forward and-- and said that he had assaulted them or-- or said-- done inappropriate things with him? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, it happened in the middle of the campaign last year, John, and the American people had their say on that as well. And I think what's important is that we take all of these things seriously and that we move forward and each individual case we have people who are charged with weighing the evidence, whether it's a court of law and a sexual harassment case, whether it's a Senate Ethics Committee as Al Franken has said. But it's hard to generalize. JOHN DICKERSON: But if-- so in that case, it seems to be the-- the position is, the voters spoke, that's it for the President. So why wouldn't that be the case with Moore? The voters speak. I mean in Washington, it's done. Let him-- SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, that will-- that will be an important decision that the people of Alabama will make. Again, if he comes to the Senate because the people of Alabama elect him and someone files a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee as they apparently have done with Al Franken, then it will be up to the ethics committee to weigh the evidence and then all of the individual Senators to make a decision based on their findings and recommendations. But I wouldn't want to speculate about hypotheticals in the future. JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. Let's move on to tax reform. Thirteen million people will be without coverage if the individual mandate is removed as you'd like to see in this tax cut plan. What happens to those thirteen million? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, John, remember what the hated Obamacare mandate is. It finds an American family that can't afford their insurance, insurance that Obamacare made unaffordable in the first place. So this bill doesn't cut a single dime from Medicaid, it doesn't cut a single dime from the insurance subsidies, it doesn't change a single regulation in Obamacare. It simply says the IRS cannot fine you if you cannot afford health insurance. So this has no impact on anyone who wants to get health insurance under Obamacares, individual exchanges or under the Medicaid expansion under their employer's plan. It simply says that working families and poor Americans, because four out of five Americans who pay this fine make less than fifty thousand dollars, will no longer be fined for not being able to afford their insurance. JOHN DICKERSON: But the estimate says the people won't get insurance and they will get sick, they will go to-- will go to emergency rooms, prices will increase. Premiums will increase also because insurers will be insuring a sicker pool of people. So you've got premiums going up which-- what's your answer to that? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, my answer to that is that we need to solve all the problems that Obamacare made worse in our health care system. We worked on that over the summer, we failed. I wish that wasn't the case but we have a tax bill now that will repeal the most hated and unpopular part of Obamacare, the individual mandate which is nothing more than a tax on working families and poor Americans. I hope next year that we return to health care, but right now I'm focused on this tax-- tax bill. JOHN DICKERSON: But it's also a tax if their premiums go up, and so there'll be a little bit of a middle class tax cut as part of this tax cut bill but then won't-- if people's premiums go up, doesn't that negate the benefit of the tax cut? SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, John, that's not right. So every income group under the Senate bill will see a tax cut. Now, if you voluntarily choose not to get your insurance through Obamacare premiums then yeah the federal government will not be paying tax subsidy not to you individually but to an insurance company. But that's a result of a voluntary choice that you make based on your own family's needs and finances. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, the-- the joint committee on taxation found that these tax cuts expire and some-- some middle income people will see their tax cut-- cut go away. But also Lisa Murkowski seems to have a different view. She said if the tax cut is offset by higher premiums, you haven't delivered a benefit. So she seems to think that removing individual mandate does have an effect that negates the benefit of any tax cut as a part of this bill. SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, Senator-- Senator Murkowski's been a leader on this bill and part-- part of the bill came out of her committee, the part that deals with exploration for oil and gas in the Arctic Circle. She's also said that she doesn't have any preconditions on this vote and, you know, remember, the vast majority of people on the Obamacare exchanges are getting subsidies. So if their premiums do go up, they're still going to get higher subsidies. And also, let's look at what premiums have happened over the last four years with the mandate in place. They've more than doubled since 2013. They're projected to go up by thirty-seven percent next year. So Obamacare is already failing with the mandate, we shouldn't be fining poor people and working American families because they can't afford the insurance that's going up so much. JOHN DICKERSON: Although Senator Murkowski does seem to say she does have a precondition which is that the-- the insurance needs to be stabilized in order for her to vote on the tax cut. But let me ask you one quick question before we go. The Air Force General John Hyten, the head of the strategic command said Saturday he would push back on an order from President Trump to launch nuclear strikes. You're on the Armed Services Committee, he would-- he would push back on-- on a nuclear strike that he consider to be illegal. What's your take on that? SENATOR TOM COTTON: John, since the dawn of the nuclear age we've recognized the practical reality that the President has to hold in his hands the sole decision to use our nuclear weapons. If there's a first strike against the United States, the President has a matter of minutes. Not hours, not days, but a matter of minutes to make that decision. So it simply doesn't make sense to have the Congress involved in the matter. However, what we hope to do is to be able to deter any country from ever launching that kind of strike against us whether it's North Korea or Russia or China or any other nuclear power. That's one reason why it's so important that President Trump largely succeeded on his trip to Asia last week to try to put more pressure on Kim Jong-un in North Korea not to use those nuclear weapons in the first place. JOHN DICKERSON: But in a non-retaliatory situation you're okay with the way the system works in terms of the-- the President and nuclear code? SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, it's never been the policy of the United States to renounce the first use of nuclear weapons. It wasn't President Obama's policy either. I hope that we never have to employ our nuclear weapons. We have them to deter. But in a non-retaliatory situation, then sure, a President has hours or days to make a considered deliberate decision that's why he has the joint chiefs, that's why he has combatant commanders, that's why he has strategic command and his White House staff to help him develop courses of action. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Senator Cotton, thanks so much for being with us. SENATOR TOM COTTON: Thank you, John. JOHN DICKERSON: The debate over sexual harassment moved into the halls of Congress after California Democratic Congresswoman Jackie Speier went public with her own experience of unwanted sexual advances as a young Capitol Hill staffer. Speier's revelation actually inspired Leeann Tweeden to come forward with her allegations against Senator Franken. This week, Congresswoman Speier introduced legislation in the House aimed at fighting sexual harassment in Congress. And she joins us this morning from Palm Springs, California. Congresswoman, I want to start with something you wrote. You said that it's clear the Good Old Boys Club mentality of Capitol Hill still persists after all these years. It is perhaps the worst I've seen in thirty years of working on these issues. The Old Boys Club was pretty bad, you're saying it's worse now? REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER (D-California/@RepSpeier): Well, I think it's worse in part because we have a system in place that allows for the harasser to go unchecked. Doesn't pay for the settlement himself and is never identified. So the office of compliance to which a victim must apply or complain is a place that has really been an enabler of sexual harassment for these many years because of the way it's constructed. JOHN DICKERSON: As Congress and the larger culture tries to figure out what the standard is for treating accusers who come forward, something better than what has been where they have been blocked, but also something that doesn't allow false accusations. How does that standard get determined in your mind? REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER: Well, first of all, we have to make sure that a complaint is taken seriously. And the person who is the victim is not somehow tortured or-- or intimidated into not filing the complaint. That's what it is right now in Congress. There's a one-month period where you're counseled, there's another month where you go to mandatory mediation and you have to sign a non-disclosure agreement at the front end. And then you have a month of cooling off period, I mean, that is truly ridiculous. It's important for us to remember, too, John, that over ninety percent of those who have been sexually harassed or sexually assaulted are telling the truth. So all these victims who have come forward with Roy Moore or with the President or with Al Franken, all of them I think have to be-- we expect to believe them because for the most part they are telling the truth. There is no gain for them to come forward. JOHN DICKERSON: What's-- REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER: There's-- there's lots of down sides, frankly. JOHN DICKERSON: What's your view about re-evaluating the situation, you mentioned the President, the White House seems to suggest and Senator Cotton also seem to suggest that the voters knew about this, they voted for him, and so it's an issue that's in the past. How do you see it? REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER: I think there is some truth to that. If the President was running today, I bet he would not be elected because I think we have had a huge cultural shift that is forty years in the making. But I think all of us are grateful now that there is a new day for women in the workplace where they do not have to put up with sexual advances that are unwanted that they do not have to live and work in a hostile work environment. And that's going to be good for-- for all of us in the workplace. JOHN DICKERSON: And as that cultural shift takes place, some people have argued, some Democrats and liberals have argued that a re-evaluation of Bill Clinton's presidency is required. What do you think about that in order to-- to be clear about what the new standard is and use, you know, elements from the past that are-- that are well-known? REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER: Well, first of all, let's remember that he did face impeachment. It wasn't as if it was just tossed to the side. He faced impeachment. I think that the victims who came forward were not treated as they should have been. They should have been believed because, as I pointed out, most people who come forward are telling the truth. JOHN DICKERSON: In the case of Al Franken, what's your-- what's your feeling about that there have been some columnist who have written that basically, again liberals have said he must leave the Senate in order to-- for Democrats to retain their credibility on this issue or else they're open to the charge that Democrats apply it when it comes to Republicans, but are-- are more generous when it comes to their own team. REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER: I think it's appropriate for the Ethics Committee to do an investigation. Senator Franken has actually agreed to that, as well. I also think that it has to be determined if there is a pattern of sexual harassment. Incidents have to be severe or they have to be ones that happen over a period of time. So I think we'll wait and see what the investigation determines. JOHN DICKERSON: Is that an instructive distinction then pattern versus specific mistake in terms of what might penalize somebody, but be the difference between penalizing and expulsion? REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER: And that's what the courts have held with sexual harassment cases. If there's a pattern then sexual harassment is found to be in existence. If it's a one-- one event and it's maybe a conversation versus, you know, sexual assault or an unwanted sexual advance, so it really depends on the circumstances in all of these cases. JOHN DICKERSON: Final question on different topic on taxes. Eleven of your Republican colleagues in California voted for the House tax cut bill in which deductibility of state and local taxes is no longer allowed. They were told-- at least one of them was told, well, that will get fixed later. And Californians who have high taxes will be able to deduct them. What's your-- do you believe that? REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER: No, I don't believe it. And I think for all of those members who basically have handed their constituents a ten-thousand-dollar tax increase, that's what we're talking about. When you take the state and local taxes and the property taxes and the mortgage deduction that is reduced to five hundred thousand dollars is a huge hit for every single California family. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Congresswoman, thank so much for being with us. And we'll be back in one minute-- REPRESENTATIVE JACKIE SPEIER: Thank you, John. JOHN DICKERSON: --with White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And we're back with Mick Mulvaney, the director of White House Office of Management and Budget. Mister Director, I want to start with the individual mandate. That's something the President wants. It's in the bill now, in part, in the Senate to just make the numbers add up. If it was taken out, would the President be okay with maybe cutting that corporate rate to twenty-two percent all the way down to twenty to make up that money that they need in the Senate? MICK MULVANEY (White House Budget Director/@MickMulvaneyOMB): No. I don't think so. I-- I don't think anybody doubts where the President is on repeal and replace. The White House would love to see Obamacare taken apart all at once, bit by bit, however we can do it. That being said there's a couple of things that the President has been very clear on from the very beginning. Number one, the middle class, ordinary Americans working folks have to pay less and it has to be simpler. And number two, that corporate tax rate has to be as low as possible. Originally wanted it at fifteen percent. We agreed with the House and Senate leadership to go to twenty percent as part of the early discussions here. And I don't think you'll see its interest going above twenty percent. So I think at the end of the day, John, what we're interested in is the best tax bill that can pass. If a good tax bill can pass with that Obamacare mandate repeals part of it, great. If it needs to come out in order for that good tax bill to pass, we could live with that as well. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me look at those two things, middle-class tax cut and corporate tax. There's no question as you've said the President wants it at twenty. MICK MULVANEY: Mm-Hm. JOHN DICKERSON: No one's has ever doubted whether corporations are going to get that reduction to twenty really in all the conversation I've seen. On the middle-class side, though it's a lot fuzzier. It used to be that proponents would say everybody in the middle class is going to get a tax cut. But now the joints committee on taxation has shown that about fourteen million because of the sunset provisions-- MICK MULVANEY: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: --in the Senate side. They're not going to get a tax cut. Their taxes are going to go up. So it seems when you look at the way this has played out, corporations are so solid nobody's saying they're not going to get what they're going to get. But the middle class is not-- it's not so solid. It's awfully fuzzy. Isn't that the reverse of what elected Donald Trump, the President, said? MICK MULVANEY: I think what you're seeing there is you're sort of scratching the surface and welcome to sort of my world. This is the world the office of management budget deals with. You're now dealing with the world of Senate scoring. Keep in mind, go back to the beginning of this process. And one of the big things that happened was that since the House and the budget-- House and the Senate passed the same budget, they're allowed to use reconciliation to pass this bill in the Senate with only fifty votes. In order to do that, we give a great deal of control to the Congressional Budget Office and they have to say it scores a certain way. The only reason-- the only reason, John, that you're seeing these-- the middle-class tax cuts supposedly expire after five years, a part of it at least, is to score it in a certain fashion. So you sort of take this round peg and try and-- and shove it into a square hole. No one really wants those things to happen. And we think if it's good policy, it becomes permanent just like most of the Bush tax cuts did. JOHN DICKERSON: I want to talk about other side because those rules are in place for a reason, but we've got to take a break. We'll be-- have more with Mick Mulvaney when we come back. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We hope you'll join us next Sunday for our Thanksgiving weekend book broadcast. This year, we'll explore the issue of leadership in tough times, including new books on both President-- on both President Bushes, Union-general-turned President Ulysses S. Grant, and the nation's thirty-second President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Plus, a look at a book about the artist Leonardo da Vinci. That's next week here on FACE THE NATION. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION, including our conversation with Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on taxes. So stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION and more of conversation with White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. Mister Director, I want to just button up on that point about this-- those arcane Senate rules. MICK MULVANEY: Sure. JOHN DICKERSON: Those are in place, though, to force budget discipline and so that people don't say let's get a lot of tax cuts and blow a big hole in the deficit, which is one of the huge knocks against this tax cut. Its size and the debt that it's going to increase. MICK MULVANEY: They are. But they're also written in 1974, haven't been changed, I don't think at all since then. And it's just very difficult to do, John. It's very difficult to model a twenty-trillion-dollar American economy. It's very difficult to even make the argument that if I sold a hundred of these cups last year at five dollars and I'd lower price to four dollars this year that I won't sell any more of them, that's what the CBO scoring does. What is-- it is an arcane system, we think it's broken and doesn't reflect the real world. But we have to play by those rules because they're there. JOHN DICKERSON: Also, people are saying, and I think you suggested this before the break, that essentially if people like the tax cuts they're going to get-- you know, they're going to get continued. MICK MULVANEY: Sure. JOHN DICKERSON: A future Congress will do this. But isn't that slightly dishonest because you're basically hoping, I'm not saying you, I'm saying in this general argument, you're basically saying these are going to continue, just trust us? And also the budget impacts on the deficit, again, which, you know, has an effect on the economy. Those are not being taken into account, but you're assuming that these-- these tax cuts are going to continue. MICK MULVANEY: Listen, if the Senate rules were different, everything of this would be permanent or as permanent as anything is in Washington, DC. Clearly, a new government could come in and change the law. But go back to the example of the Bush tax cuts, which were supposedly temporary when they got passed. They worked, people liked them, and they became permanent law, which is where-- at least most of them did, which is where we are today. So again, I wouldn't confuse things that we do to try and shoehorn into the Senate rules with what we think is the best possible policy. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, of course, there's a lot of debate by the Bush tax cuts. But let's-- let me ask this question, and other-- the-- the tax cuts are built on an idea that corporations that once their tax rates are reduced that they will pass it on essentially to middle-class people. Gary Cohn, the-- the White House economic advisor, was at a CEO meeting The Wall Street Journal hosted. And the-- the audience of CEOs were asked, \"Are you going to take these tax cuts and create more American jobs?\" And so they wanted a show of hands. The hands did not shoot to the ceiling. And-- and Mister Cohn actually noted that more people. This is the central premise of how this thing's going to work, and there's a lot of doubt about that. MICK MULVANEY: Yeah. I asked Gary about that afterwards. And my guess is, if I'm a Fortune 500 CEO, I'm not going to tell my competitors who are sitting in the-- in the aisle next to me what I'm going to do next year. They're going to do what's in their best interest. And what we think is in their best interest is to invest here because not only would tax rates be lower, but they're going to get expense all of their capital expenses. So every new machine that they buy, every new factory that they build, they'll be able to write off immediately against their taxes. This is a tremendous incentive not only folks not to leave the country in the first place, but for folks who have left to come back. And that's what we think is so important in re-establishing the connection between corporate success and the success of the ordinary family. Go back over seventy years before 2008, every time corporation profits went up one percent, average household income went up by one percent. Since then, corporate taxes are up, I think, eleven percent and household incomes are-- are up 0.3. We need to re-establish that connection so that when companies do well, families do well. JOHN DICKERSON: So people who are going to see their taxes maybe go up if this tax cut doesn't last, they've just got to hope the economy turns out and behaves the way you want. But even Senator Johnson from Wisconsin, a Republican, said to-- on CNN, \"Well, I want to-- what I want to see is the information to prove the economic growth we're going to get.\" So even he's sceptical. A Republican who's a big fan of a lot of this bill is skeptical about this central theory that's at the heart of it. MICK MULVANEY: Yeah. I think Senator Johnson is-- is sort of honed in on one thing that we knew was sort of the last big substantive piece of the puzzle, and that's how do you deal with these-- these pass-through entities, S-corporations, LLCs, and partnerships. They're taxed differently than C-corporations. And they're taxed at the individual level. Their tax different than C corporations. And there's tax at the individual level. So when you start to lower the corporate tax rate, it's arguably putting S-- S-corporations at a disadvantage and that needs to be worked out. So we-- Senator Johnson is hit on this. It needs to get fixed, but I'm absolutely comfortable that it will be. JOHN DICKERSON: But it's going to cost money if it is. MICK MULVANEY: It doesn't cost money to let people keep more of their own money. Costs money to spend money you don't have. But that's another issue. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Thanks so much for being with us. And we'll be right back with our political panel. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: We want to go now to our political panel. Ruth Marcus is a columnist and deputy editorial page editor at The Washington Post. David French is a senior writer at the National Review. We're also joined by Susan Page, Washington bureau chief for USA Today and Ed O'Keefe who covers politics on-- in Capitol Hill for The Washington Post and is also a CBS News contributor. Ed, I'll start with you. What's going to happen with Roy Moore? ED O'KEEFE (Washington Post/CBS News Contributor/@edatpost): You know, doesn't look like he's leaving the race and it doesn't look like Republicans outside of Alabama, at least, really can do anything at this point to compel him to do it. It means it will cause probably political headaches for national Republicans throughout the rest of the next year. They'll immediately become a poster boy for what Democrats would think is wrong with Washington and with the Republican Party. And if Mitch McConnell's threats this past week were true, it will lead immediately to an ethics investigation of the new senator, possibly concurrent with the one that would be underway for Al Franken and maybe also one underway for Senator Bob Menendez who's coming back after the Thanksgiving break from a federal corruption trial. So it-- it will be an interesting year, certainly when it comes to-- JOHN DICKERSON: Right. Add-- ED O'KEEFE: --political transgressions. And-- and, you know, at this point Republicans just have to probably hope that there's nothing else out there that would just stir this even more and yet there are-- there's reason to believe that there is. JOHN DICKERSON: Add staffers to the Senate Ethics Committee, the-- Senator Menendez was found to have a mistrial-- ED O'KEEFE: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: --this week which is triggered the move by McConnell. David, welcome. Answer the question I posed to Tom Cotton, what's better for Republicans if Roy Moore wins or if he loses? DAVID FRENCH (National Review/@DavidAFrench): It's clearly better if Roy Moore loses. I mean, for a couple of reasons. One, it's-- it would be very important party hygiene. Steve Bannon needs to lose. Roy Moore needs to lose. And those who are connected right now. If what-- what people are-- many people are forgetting is the blow that this would be not just to the Roy Moore side of the GOP which needs to lose, but also to the Steve Bannon enterprise of trying to destroy the GOP as we know it. He needs to be discredited. And if he helps lose a Senate seat in one of the brightest, reddest states in the nation, why would anyone listen to Steve Bannon ever again? And so that's, I think, an incredibly important potential moment of party hygiene. But we don't know if that's going to happen yet. JOHN DICKERSON: And-- and, Susan, Mitch McConnell would have a senator come-- senator come in who is clearly a-- a improvisational character, Roy Moore. And would-- I mean, could it-- this get managed the way Mitch McConnell thinks it could get managed or is he really hoping he doesn't have to handle this problem? SUSAN PAGE (USA Today/@SusanPage): Oh, I'm sure he-- if he could cast a vote, and I think he was born in Alabama, actually. Mitch McConnell would not be voting for-- for Roy Moore because this is-- for one thing, Roy Moore is not a Mitch McConnell Republican. JOHN DICKERSON: No. That's what you're saying, yeah. SUSAN PAGE: I mean, he's running-- JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah. SUSAN PAGE: --running on a campaign to eject Mitch McConnell from the-- from the leadership. So in no way is this-- is this good for Mitch McConnell even if it costs him one of those crucial Republican Senate seats. I think it's-- I think it's hard to make a call on who's going to win that race. So, I mean, we do have Doug Jones, a Democrat, ahead in some polls. But one of the lessons from last year's presidential campaign is, don't look at the polls, look at who is energized to show up. And I don't think we know yet whether it's diehard Roy Moore supporters or people-- other people in Alabama who are disgusted by what they're seeing. JOHN DICKERSON: And, Ruth, I mean, Democrats are disgusted, but are they going to turn out in-- in Alabama? And in-- in some ways, Democrats are enjoying this moment leaving the morality aside, and many of them are happy too, to see the Republican Party stuck with a Roy Moore problem. RUTH MARCUS (Washington Post/@RuthMarcus): Sure. I think you need to listen to who is-- look at who is energized, but you also need to look at who is disgusted. And I think there are lot of Republicans in Alabama who aren't going to rouse themselves to go out and vote for democratic candidate. But who just would prefer to stay home, hold their noses, and see what happens? JOHN DICKERSON: Ruth, tell us, what-- we-- we've got a historical change happening here across the society and in-- in Washington with respect to Capitol Hill. Name that moment. Tell us what moment we're in. RUTH MARCUS: I think we're in chapter three. Chapter one was Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas, where a lot of people who probably should have known better discovered that there was this problem called sexual harassment in the workplace. And, yes, women didn't always go yelling and screaming about it at the exact moment that it happened. Chapter two was Monica Lewinsky-Bill Clinton. Chapter three is now, and I think this is probably the most significant chapter of them all. Where we are is we understand that there's a lot of behave-- that this behavior is rampant, there's a lot of \"me toos\" that its' intolerable in the workplace and elsewhere, and that we have not been serious enough about dealing with it. Where we have-- what we haven't figured out yet is what is the appropriate punishment for each individual-- for-- for various transgressors. And that's what we're grappling with. JOHN DICKERSON: And, Ed, where-- one of the things we're grappling with is Al Franken-- ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. JOHN DICKERSON: --in-- in the Senate. What's your sense of-- there were-- columnist for (INDISTINCT) The New York Times said he must go, Democrats lose credibility. They felt like real there was a real pressure, where is that pressure now on him? ED O'KEEFE: I think it's if there's something else, either before he was a senator or especially since he became a senator, at that point it's-- it's just a question of when and not if, perhaps. If this is it, if they have the meeting that the accuser says he asked for and she's agreed to have and it goes well and he commits to an ethics investigation and it finds that there's no other reason to believe he's done something inappropriate, you know, a cloud will hang over him for the rest of his Senate tenure as it has for other senators in the past whatever reason. But I think Ruth actually raised an interesting point in her column this week about, you know, to what extent will-- is there the risk that people are potentially over-punished or that there's an overreaction to this, there have to be changes made at the capital in how Congress deals with this. But I think there's-- there's an argument to be made that, you know, there-- there could potentially be an overreaction. And-- and that would add to all the concerns that people have had through the years about, you know, the scrutiny being too hot on people and-- and keeping them from potentially engaging in public service. RUTH MARCUS: It-- I think that the overreaction here, I-- I don't think that Senator Franken should have to resign based on where we are now. But I think there is a reasonable possibility that that will happen, in part, because you use the word \"poster boy\" before. He is a very unfortunate poster boy for Democrats, that's not good for them. To some extent, he is going up-- if he is forced to resign it will be because he's paying for the under-reaction to Bill Clinton's scenes-- JOHN DICKERSON: Right. RUTH MARCUS: --in the past and Democrats failure to pay enough attention to that. SUSAN PAGE: Wait, you know, you talked about-- this being chapter, the fact is we're still living with the re-- reverberations of chapters one and two. And if Joe Biden runs for President in 2020 as he clearly hopes to do, we will revisit the-- the committee's hearings he chaired with Senate judiciary for Clarence Thomas where-- where Anita Hill was not taken seriously. And we have continued to see a reconsideration of whether Democrats in general and feminists in particular took Bill-- the charges against Bill Clinton seriously enough. DAVID FRENCH: Well, you know, one-- one thing is we keep hearing about line drawing, line drawing, I'm seeing line drawing in Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein has paid a price, Kevin Spacey's paid a price, I mean, titles are being yanked down from Netflix. I see line drawing in corporate America. If evidence like that-- that goes out-- that photographical evidence of Al Franken had emerged in any of my private sector workplaces, that person would be gone. You know, where I don't see line drawing? In politics. I don't see it in politics. I'll believe people in politics are taking seriously this moment when someone ends their career, loses their career. It's-- let's put it-- let's-- let's be honest, these careers aren't all that important.  SUSAN PAGE: Well, maybe-- DAVID FRENCH: Al Franken will be gone tomorrow and he's going to be replaced by another Democrat. And-- and you can't even draw a line then? And-- and that's I think American people look at that and say, \"Where are the lines being drawn?\" In my life, they're being drawn. Not in politics. JOHN DICKERSON: And there is also another line that's being drawn, I was interested that Congresswoman Speier and Senator Cotton seem to have the same kind of line for President-- for President Trump, if there's a re-evaluation of President Clinton. Again, towards defining what the norms are in this new situation, isn't the President a part that conversation given that there are dozen accusers and he's the President of the United States? DAVID FRENCH: Look, we have to grapple with the fact that it looks like two of the last four Presidents of the United States have committed some form of sexual assault. And that's dreadful. I'm the last person to say that what Donald Trump has been credibly accused of doing by more than a dozen people should be swept under the rug. The problem we have here on that is only the tiniest percentage of Donald Trump voters believed those allegations are true. It's not that they said, \"Yeah, they're true and I'm voting for him anyway.\" You look at the polling, they just flat-out, don't believe it. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. DAVID FRENCH: And that makes it a very-- it makes it very difficult to hold him accountable in that circumstance. SUSAN PAGE: You know, we also talk about line drawing or about a big culture shift, a shift toward believing the women against celebrity accusers or prominent accusers. I'm not sure we've yet seen a culture shift for women who work at Walmart or work-- clean hotel rooms or work on factory floors who are subject to the same kind of abuses that women who work in law firms and on Capitol Hill are subject to. That would be a real culture shift. JOHN DICKERSON: I was interested-- Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at the White House, essentially the difference between Franken and-- and President Trump is that Al Franken admitted, so is the-- is the line basically-- I mean, what-- what signal does that send if you're a politician? RUTH MARCUS: Um. JOHN DICKERSON: --to respond to these allegations? RUTH MARCUS: Well, the-- if you can-- you know, if you can-- they-- if you're a star, they let you get away with it. The President is in very difficult position here because his first attitude towards Roy Moore was if then-- if he did it then he has to resign. Now his own daughter has said, I believe these women-- his-- leader-- rather leader of this party, Mitch McConnell has said, I believe these women. If he said-- he can't say I believe them because that raises the question if we believe them why shouldn't we believe the women who are accusing you. I think it's a really tough question for him to answer. The amazing thing is instead of kind of trying to duck and cover and avoid this, he went out and characteristically made his life more difficult by tweeting about Al Franken. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, he saw it as a chance to hit Franken and he also hit the Clintons by believing the accuser of Bill Clinton and bringing them to the debate. ED O'KEEFE: As he did last year, yeah. Absolutely. Now it's-- it's a really tricky situation for Republicans who I think understand that this is-- you know, he's talking out of both sides of his mouth. I think-- but to-- to credit Mitch McConnell, he began this week by very clearly saying, I believe the women. He wants Roy Moore to avoid getting a Senate seat, he wants to do everything he can to stop him from coming. But the fact that the most senior member of Congress said that, or a senior member of Congress said it very clearly, allowed everyone else to fall into place, allowed the Franken thing to be dealt with so quickly. I think that is a key part of chapter three as we go forward that we saw such a senior political leader do that. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We're going to close the book on this chapter. But we will be back in a second with another chapter. We'll talk about tax cuts and the rest with our panels. Stay with us. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: And we're back with our panel. David, I want to start on the tax cut question with you which is often in Washington where we have these cultural moments, everybody gets boxed up nothing gets done. The tax cut bill is moving lickety-split through Congress. DAVID FRENCH: Right. You know, moving lickety-split through Congress that a lot of people are-- have been down on for a long time for doing nothing particularly on the right side of the aisle. Look, I-- I'm optimistic something is going to get done here. There's enormous pressure from every wing of the GOP. The GOP civil war is-- is kind of settled on this one point, there's a need for tax reform. So, I do think something's going to happen. I do think what we're going to get-- well, it's not exactly going to be the Senate bill, it's not going to-- exactly going be the House bill, it's going be something better than the status quo. What that's exactly going to be yet, we don't know. JOHN DICKERSON: Ruth, I know you care about budgets. RUTH MARCUS: I do. Better than the status quo for who is one thing I might say. I think that the prognosis for this bill is really interesting. The-- every Republican lawmaker that I know is desperate to see something passed. But there are two problems here. One is that they are not desperate to-- they don't know all agree on what that something is. And so there are reviews the Rubik's cube analogy before. This is like super Rubik's cube. There are so many pieces that you can lose somebody on and that Senate majority is very slim. And that House majority is complicated because of the state and local tax deduction. And then I have the questions, I understand they're desperate to pass it because they have done nothing else legislatively, they're going to just have to run on (INDISTINCT) on the Supreme Court nominee which-- whose vacancy was created before him-- JOHN DICKERSON: (Cross talk) with the congressional review act. RUTH MARCUS: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I don't think that's great-- the greatest messaging. But if they pass it, is that great news for Republicans, maybe better than the alternative. But there's going to be lot of Democratic messaging about hits to the middle class and favoring corporations with permanent tax cuts over the middle class, many of whom will be worse off at the end of this. JOHN DICKERSON: Do you think-- that's right, Susan. There's-- Democrats see an opportunity to rush in and say, wait, the middle class tax cuts expire for fourteen million, this can't-- you know, do they have an opportunity on this? SUSAN PAGE: Well, they do since they could argue for instance that the-- that the Trump family alone could benefit to the tune of more than one billion dollars if this-- if this-- if this particular tax bill passes. The Republicans have another problem and that is the number twelve, that is number of full legislative days left from now until the end of the year when they also need to fund the government which runs out of money on December 8. They need to deal with hurricane relief. So it will in fact be lickety-split as you said if they manage to do something by the-- by the White House deadline of-- of Christmas to get a tax bill through. And if they manage to do that, it will be because they are so interested in passing something that they won't care about exactly what it is they're passing. JOHN DICKERSON: They have to get something out of the Senate at least by Christmas because otherwise if this Roy Moore thing doesn't turn out, the numbers in the Senate will change and they'll lose one Republican Senate-- senator and that-- there are at least two, Ron Johnson and Lisa Murkowski in the Senate side who-- who have real issues with this tax bill. Are they-- is that real opposition or is that the kind of opposition you get so that your thinking get fixed? ED O'KEEFE: I'd actually tweak it and say, Ron Johnson for sure based on some comments he made this morning, Susan Collins actually probably still has some legitimate concerns. Murkowski's point was just that, we-- we need to stabilize the markets. It's not-- JOHN DICKERSON: Health insurance market. ED O'KEEFE: Right. This bipartisan bill by (INDISTINCT) and Patty Murray. Her office clarified later Friday despite some comments she'd made earlier in the day, isn't contingent on her support for the tax bill. But she's expressing a concern-- JOHN DICKERSON: Right. ED O'KEEFE: --that certainly some of her Republican colleagues have. I would watch more the people-- the Republican senators who are concerned about things like the deficit. That is Bob Corker, that is Jeff Flake, that is probably Ron Johnson and then secondarily, whether or not this includes changes to the individual mandate. There you lose Susan Collins, maybe Lisa Murkowski. And if the thing happening too lickety-split, you may lose John McCain who has been arguing that this has to be done methodically and fairly to both sides, he says that last week's deliberations in the Senate went perfectly in that regard. RUTH MARCUS: Can I jump in on the deficit? I can't be contained. JOHN DICKERSON: Quickly, yeah. RUTH MARCUS: The whole agreement here-- JOHN DICKERSON: Neither can the deficit. RUTH MARCUS: Yes. Nice. It's one point-- we're going to pass this but we're going to be fiscally responsible because it's going to be only 1.5 trillion. The budget director made clear to you in his comments that that is not the intention at all. The intention is to eventually make these-- the individual tax cuts permanent to the tune of closer to over 2-- 2.2 trillion dollars. There-- if you think that you're fiscally responsible so that you can only afford a 1.5 trillion dollar tax cut, you should not vote for this because everybody is saying it's going to cost more than that. JOHN DICKERSON: David, give me a sense of two things. One what Ruth says and what happened to the fiscal hawks. But then secondly you mentioned Steve Bannon and the people he supports and the kind of core of the Trump message. DAVID FRENCH: Right. JOHN DICKERSON: How does this tax bill line up with them that corporations are going to go down to twenty percent? Do they care or do they buy the argument from Trump-- DAVID FRENCH: Okay, I'm in the camp that believes that this Trump populism thing is not really a meaningful ideological movement in the-- in the Republican Party. Trumpism is the personal ambition of Donald Trump. That's Trumpism. Okay. This populism has always been a-- a relatively small slice of the GOP pie. We're not looking at a big political sea change here. And the-- the people who make up Trump's base are very-- are far more concerned with the perception that Donald Trump is exceeding than they are with any given line item of the quote, unquote, Trump agenda. So I think that the bottom line analysis here is, does Trump help get tax reform passed. If the answer is, yes, mega. If the answer is, no. Then, well, you know, it's Mitch and Paul Ryan, it's not Donald Trump that will ultimately receive the-- the blame in Trump world. But I think that we've gotten down to sort of a post-ideological age in some ways when it comes to the success of Donald Trump where the most important thing is perceived by his fans as the success of Donald Trump. JOHN DICKERSON: (INDISTINCT) standing of course for Make America Great Again for anyone who doesn't know that Susan Page, sixteen percent in a Quinnipiac Poll thought they were going to get a tax cut here. What David says about the Trump voter rings true from the Trump voters I've talked to. What about the rest of the country? SUSAN PAGE: Well, I-- I think this tax bill is a tough sell for the rest of the country. And especially because some of the arguments that proponents are making are so easily disproved. You know, for instance, the idea that repealing the estate tax is going to help farms and small businesses. This year, eighty farms and small businesses are affected by the estate tax. It's an-- you know, the estate tax benefits the wealthiest Americans, only five thousand or so whom get caught in the estate tax. So I think that the idea that the-- the reality of the tax cut helps the rich at the expense-- raising taxes over the long-term for even families below thirty thousand is something that makes big difficulties for Republicans. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. We're going to go. We'll be back in a moment. (ANNOUNCEMENTS) JOHN DICKERSON: That's it for us today.

            "article_content": "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, a strong supporter of the Trump administration, joined \"Face the Nation\" Sunday and helped us dive into the political dynamics of the GOP amid the push for tax reform and the Roy Moore controversy in the Alabama special election. \u00a0 What are the Republican Party's options if Moore wins the election on December 12? Will he face immediate expulsion? \u00a0 What follows is a transcript of the interview with Cotton, which aired Sunday, Nov. 19, 2017, on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: If Roy Moore does get elected to the Senate, the next move is up to his Senate colleagues. We're joined now by one potential Republican colleague, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Senator Cotton, I want to talk to you about tax reform in a moment. But let's talk about this Moore situation for a moment. Cory Gardner, one of your Republican colleagues who's in charge of getting Republicans elected, said that the Senate should expel Moore if he wins and is sent to Washington. Would you support that? \u00a0 TOM COTTON: Well, John, first, let me take a step back from Roy Moore and speak in general about sexual harassment and sexual assault. It's a very serious matter. It has no place on the job, no place in our society. I think sadly too many women have faced that over the course of their lives. And it's not a partisan issue. There are misbehaving men in both the Democratic and Republican parties. And unfortunately there are female victims in both parties as well. It's not even a political matter. I mean, it's happened in your industry, in the media. It's happened in Hollywood. It happens in business. So I think it's important that women feel, once they've been subject to sexual harassment and especially sexual assault, that they can come forward now since, you know, the Harvey Weinstein allegations broke about a month ago or so. And that's a good thing. And that's a good change in the norms and the expectations of our society. As far as Roy Moore goes, I'm not going to speculate about hypotheticals about what may happen should he win. We're only three weeks out from the election. He made it pretty clear this week that he's not going to step aside. So as you said in your intro, it's going to be up to the people of Alabama to make that decision. JOHN DICKERSON: You said you wouldn't encourage the people of Alabama to vote for him. What's better for Senate Republicans: If Roy Moore wins and comes to Washington as a Republican or if a Democrat wins in that race? TOM COTTON: What's better for Senate Republicans, what's better for the American people is that we focus on the work ahead of us, which is the tax bill that cuts middle class taxes. It cuts taxes on businesses and repeals the hated Obamacare mandate. I'll leave it to the people of Alabama to make the decision about Roy Moore and Doug Jones. JOHN DICKERSON: Before we get to taxes, let me ask about this norm- these norms you're talking about that have changed because of this change- historic change in American culture, which as you say is going across corporations, the media, Congress. So Al Franken faces a moment now. What is the emerging standard in terms of how you assess these accusations that comes forward for somebody? TOM COTTON: I think it's hard to generalize about all cases in general because each case is particular. Different kinds of allegations. Different kinds of conduct. Different kinds of evidence. So I think it's important that we take the issue of sexual harassment and sexual assault seriously and that we take each case on its individual merits and evaluate them carefully. JOHN DICKERSON: And finally on this, the new norms, a lot of people have said, \"Well, there were a dozen or so accusers for President Trump.\" Should these new norms cause a reevaluation of those who came forward and said that he had assaulted them or done inappropriate things with them? TOM COTTON: Well, it happened in the middle of the campaign last year, John. And the American people had their say on that as well. And I think what's important is that we take all these things seriously and that we move forward. In each individual case we have people who are charged with weighing the evidence, whether it's a court of law in a sexual harassment case, whether it's the Senate Ethics Committee, as Al Franken has said. But it's hard to generalize. JOHN DICKERSON: But if, so in that case it seems to be the position is the voters spoke. That's it for the president. So why wouldn't that be the case with Moore? The voters speak, send him to Washington. It's done. Let him serve. TOM COTTON: Well, that will be an important decision that the people of Alabama will make. Again, if he comes to the Senate because the people of Alabama elect him and someone files a complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee, as they apparently have done with Al Franken, then it will be up to the Ethics Committee to weigh the evidence and then all of the individual senators to make a decision based on their findings and recommendations. But I wouldn't want to speculate about hypotheticals in the future. JOHN DICKERSON: Okay. Let's move on to tax reform. 13 million people will be without coverage if the individual mandate is removed, as you'd like to see, in this tax cut plan. What happens to those 13 million? TOM COTTON: John, remember what the hated Obamacare mandate is. It fines an American family. They can't afford their insurance. Insurance that Obamacare made unaffordable in the first place. So this bill doesn't cut a single dime from Medicaid. It doesn't cut a single dime from the insurance subsidies. It doesn't change a single regulation under Obamacare. It simply says the I.R.S. cannot fine you if you cannot afford health insurance. So this has no impact on anyone who wants to get health insurance under Obamacare's individual exchanges, or under the Medicaid expansion, under their employer's plan. It simply says that working families and poor Americans, because four out of five Americans who pay this fine make less than $50,000, will no longer be fined for not being able to afford their insurance. JOHN DICKERSON: But the estimate is that people won't get insurance. Then they'll get sick. They'll go to emergency rooms. Prices will increase. The premiums will increase also because insurers will be insuring a sicker pool of people. So you've got premiums going up. Which-what's your answer to that? TOM COTTON: Well, my answer to that is that we need to solve all the problems that Obamacare made worse in our healthcare system. We worked on that over the summer. We failed. I wish that wasn't the case. But we have a tax bill now that will repeal the most hated and unpopular part of Obamacare, the individual mandate, which is nothing more than a tax on working families and poor Americans. I hope next year that we return to health care. But right now I'm focused on this tax bill. JOHN DICKERSON: But it's also a tax if their premiums go up. And so there will be a little bit of a middle class tax cut as part of this tax cut bill. But then won't, if people's premiums go up, doesn't that negate the benefit of the tax cut? TOM COTTON: No, John, that's not right. So every income group under the Senate bill will see a tax cut. Now, if you'd voluntarily choose not to get your insurance through the Obamacare premiums, then, yeah, the federal government will not be paying a tax subsidy not to you individually but to an insurance company. But that's the result of a voluntary choice that you make based on your own family's needs and finances. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, the Joint Committee on Taxation found that these tax cuts expire and some middle income people will see their tax cut go away. But also Lisa Murkowski seems to have a different view. She said, \"If the tax cut is offset by higher premiums, you haven't delivered a benefit.\" So she seems to think that removing the individual mandate does have an effect that negates the benefit of any tax cut as a part of this bill. TOM COTTON: Well, Senator Murkowski has been a leader on this bill. And part of the bill came out of her committee, the part that deals with exploration for oil and gas in the Arctic Circle. She's also said that she doesn't have any preconditions on this vote. And, you know, remember, the vast majority of people on the Obamacare exchanges are getting subsidies. So if their premiums do go up, they're still going to get higher subsidies. And also, let's look at what premiums have happened over the last four years with the mandate in place. They've more than doubled since 2013. They're projected to go up by 37% next year. So Obamacare is already failing with the mandate. We shouldn't be fining poor people and working American families because they can't afford the insurance that is going up so much. JOHN DICKERSON: Although Senator Murkowski does seem to say she does have a precondition, which is that the insurance needs to be stabilized in order for her to vote on the tax cut. But let me ask you one quick question before we go. The Air Force General John Hyten, head of the U.S. Strategic Command, said Saturday he would push back on an order from President Trump to launch nuclear strikes. You're on the Armed Services Committee. He would push back on a nuclear strike that he considered to be illegal. What's your take on that? TOM COTTON: John, since the dawn of a nuclear age we've recognized the practical reality that the president has to hold in his hands the sole decision to use our nuclear weapons. If there is a first strike against the United States, the president has a matter of minutes. Not hours. Not days. But a matter of minutes to make that decision. So it simply doesn't make sense to have Congress involved in the matter. However, what we hope to do is to be able to deter any country from ever launching that kind of strike against us whether it's North Korea, or Russia, or China, or any other nuclear power. That's one reason why it's so important that President Trump largely succeeded on his trip to Asia last week to try to put more pressure on Kim Jong-un and North Korea not to use those nuclear weapons in the first place. JOHN DICKERSON: But in a non-retaliatory situation, you're okay with the way the system works in terms of the president and nuclear codes? TOM COTTON: Well, it's never been the policy of the United States to renounce the first use of nuclear weapons. It wasn't President Obama's policy either. I hope that we never have to employ our nuclear weapons. We have them to deter. But in a non-retaliatory situation, then, sure, a president has hours or days to make a considered deliberate decision. That's why he has the joint chiefs. That's why he has combatant commanders. That's why he has strategic command and his White House staff to help him develop courses of action. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Senator Cotton, thanks so much for being with us. TOM COTTON: Thank you, John.",

            "article_content": "ERIE, Penn. -- The city of Erie has been hit hard by decades of decline in American manufacturing. Since its peak in the 1950s, Erie has shed nearly 30,000 manufacturing jobs, with the labor force decreasing by 12,000 over just the past decade. Its population now stands at under 100,000 people. With a strong labor presence, Erie had been a reliable Democratic stronghold since the Reagan era. But the city voted for President Trump in 2016, becoming emblematic of Rust Belt communities that turned to Trump to reverse a downward spiral of job loss and outsourcing. In the new documentary \u201cAmerica: Manufacturing Hope,\u201d CBSN travels to Erie to meet the working class voters who have been hit hardest by the loss of manufacturing jobs in their hometown. Many families have lived in Erie for generations, carving out middle-class lives with well-paying jobs in local factories before the plants closed and work dried up. Pat, Justin and Shawn Gallagher have lived in Erie County their entire lives, spanning three generations. They\u2019ve seen their hometown fall into economic turmoil, and all three voted for Trump because they could no longer sit idly by as jobs disappeared.\u00a0 Patrick, the eldest Gallagher, worked at a local plant for over 40 years. He has been a registered Democrat for over 50 years, but said he \u201chad to\u201d vote for Trump in 2016. \u201cThis was the first election that I\u2019ve ever voted a straight ticket, and it was for the Republicans,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cI think people got to get behind Trump and give him a chance, because he has a functional path; no question in my mind about it.\u201d Justin, 21, is still in college, but wants to stay in Erie and potentially run for office. He served as an alternate delegate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. \u201cI think that a lot of the local leaders have not been doing their part,\u201d Justin said. \u201cAt some point, if I have to run for office to see change, then I\u2019ll do that.\u201d Shawn, Justin\u2019s father, said the lack of jobs was the most pressing issue facing Erie. He worked at the GE plant for nearly 30 years, starting after he graduated college. \u201cIt seemed to be just over many, many years, a lot of companies [were] downsizing in Erie, a lot of companies moving out,\u201d Shawn said. \u201cIt just seemed like it would be better to get those jobs back here, or change the type of jobs.\u201d Justin said he had been encouraged by Trump\u2019s early moves in office. \u201cHe made these campaign promises, and one by one, he\u2019s starting to check them off the list,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it is nice to see that elected leader at the national level is acting on his campaign promises, and he\u2019s actually moving forward with action.\u201d Watch more of the Gallagher family\u2019s story and others in a CBSN Original airing Mon., Feb., 27, 2017 at 8 p.m. ET. titled, \u201cAmerica - Manufacturing Hope.\u201d ",

Republicans control the House, the Senate, two thirds of governors\u2019 chairs.\u201d \u201cAnd in the last eight years, they have picked up 900 legislative seats,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cClearly the Democratic Party has got to change. And in my view what it has got to become is a grassroots party. A party which makes decisions from the bottom on up. A party which is more dependent on small donations than large donations. A party... that speaks to the pain of the working class in this country.\u201d Sanders, who ran against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, is on a \u201cunity\u201d tour across the country with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez to reinvigorate the Democratic base.

If that continues, there is no future forward for the Democratic Party.\u201d \u201cSo what we have got to do and what Democrats have got to do is go all over this country, start getting into those red states which have been ignored for decades, start growing the voter turnout,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHaving an agenda which brings people together to say that, \u2018In the richest country in the history of the world, yeah. You know what? We can have health care for all people as a right. We can raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. No, Donald Trump is not right. Climate change is not a hoax.

            "article_content": "Voters have rejected a measure that would have raised taxes on soft drinks in New Mexico's capital city, giving a rare victory to the beverage industry after a string of recent defeats at the ballot box. The ballot initiative failed with 11,533 votes against and only 8,382 votes in favor, the Santa Fe City Clerk's Office announced Tuesday. Opponents warned it would increase the cost of a can of soda by nearly 25 cents. The vote came after similar taxes were adopted last year in cities from Philadelphia to San Francisco. Outside groups and political committees spent more than $3 million on the special election in Santa Fe, with opponents led by the soft-drink industry and supporters by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, a staunch supporter of taxes on sugary beverages. A variety of sugar-sweetened beverages fall under the tax proposal, including sport drinks such as Gatorade, iced teas, caffeinated energy drinks and lemonade, while diet soda and pure juices were exempt. The 2-cents-per-ounce tax ties Boulder, Colorado, as the nation's most expensive. The tax was designed to expand preschool to 1,000 additional children, most of them from poor families. Opponents portrayed the tax as a burden on poor and working-class families who would see prices skyrocket on items like soda, sports drinks and lemonade. Santa Fe's tax measure thrust the city into two far-reaching debates about affordable preschool and sugary drinks. Proponents of the tax, including Santa Fe Mayor Javier Gonzales, said it was needed to expand high-quality preschool to 1,000 children whose families cannot afford or find it \u2014 and improve public health in the process by discouraging the heavy consumption of sugar. Spending by rival political committees pitted the American Beverage Association and allied local businesses against soda-tax backers including Bloomberg, teachers unions, the American Heart Association and the Roman Catholic Church. Opponents warned the tax would increase the cost of a can of soda by nearly 25 cents and place a burden on poor and working-class families, driving home their point in mailbox flyers with images of crestfallen children tending to a high-priced lemonade stand. Opponents also portrayed the Santa Fe city government as flush with cash in mailers decorated with towering bundles of $100 bills, raising the ire of several city councilors who said the city's surplus was far too small expand pre-kindergarten. \"We are not overflowing with cash,\" City Councilor Signe Lindell said. \"It's not right, it's not true.\" Efforts by New Mexico to expand early childhood education have stalled amid a state budget crisis and political resistance to tapping state funds. The state currently allocates about $50 million a year to underwrite full- and part-time preschool for about 9,000 children but has been stymied from spending much more by faltering tax revenues. Early voting started April 12, kicking off weeks of intensive political publicity that blanketed the city with fliers, yard signs and radio ads. The American Beverage Association funneled more than $1.3 million from the soft drink industry into efforts to defeat the tax. Bloomberg, who tried unsuccessfully as New York mayor to ban large sodas, contributed $1.1 million to the pro-tax political action committee Pre-K for Santa Fe. Questions about some untraceable political spending dogged campaigns for and against the tax. On both sides of the debate, targeted video advertisements flooded social media feeds with emotional appeals for and against the tax, featuring restaurant owners, politicians and local parents. Backers of the tax crowded into a union hall Tuesday to make last-minute calls to registered voters, as tax opponents knocked on doors and stood at busy intersections calling for a \"no\" vote. At a polling station, middle school teacher Michelle Chavez, 48, said the tax was appropriate and desperately needed to boost early learning. \"It's basically a sin tax,\" said Chavez, casting a \"yes\" vote. \"If you don't want to pay the tax, don't buy the soda. Fill up a water bottle.\" Paralegal Michelle Romero voted against the initiative, saying the city needed to find money from somewhere else to expand pre-kindergarten. \"The government should learn how to balance their budget in better ways,\" she said.",

            "article_content": "Ben Bernanke served as chairman of the Federal Reserve for eight years beginning in 2006, setting monetary policy through the worst of the Great Recession. He left the Fed three years ago and is now a Distinguished Fellow in Residence at the Brookings Institution.  His memoir \"The Courage to Act,\" which chronicles the economic crisis and its aftermath, is out in paperback Tuesday with an update featuring his reaction to the 2016 election. Bernanke joined \"CBS This Morning\" Tuesday to discuss America's economic growth, what he believes President Trump tapped into during the election, and why it's too early to say whether Trump's economic policy will work. \u00a0 On whether a 3.2 percent annual growth rate projected by the Trump team is achievable and sustainable, Bernanke said, \"Probably not. No, not unless we get kind of lucky, honestly. But certainly we want to do what we can to improve our pace of growth.\"  In his new afterword, Bernanke wrote that Donald Trump \"shocked the world\" by defeating Hillary Clinton with his \"dystopian assessment of the U.S. economy.\"  For Bernanke, that assessment was \"odd.\" He explained, \"In many ways the U.S. economy is doing very well. We created 16 million jobs since 2009. The unemployment rate went from 10 percent down to 4.5 percent. Housing market is coming back. Lots of things are positive. And yet, Mr. Trump won the election by talking about 42 percent unemployment and things like that. So, it wasn't accurate \u2014there's not 42 percent unemployment \u2014 but he was right that there are some people who are being left behind.\" Included in those who were left behind, according to Bernanke, are many young men.  \"You've got a lot of young men between ages 25 and 54 \u2014 in the past they would have been working at a regular job but today about 12 percent of those men are not working or even looking for work. So, those kinds of trends, which are very long-standing, they're not recent, have left behind a lot of people, and that's the kind of concern that Donald Trump tapped into,\" Bernanke said.\u00a0 According to Bernanke, it's too early to judge what he's seen from Mr. Trump's administration so far in terms of economic policy. \"The markets got really excited after the election, expecting rapid changes in fiscal policy, regulation and so on. I wrote in my book that I thought because of these different political influences and the fact that even within the Republican Party there's a lot of disagreement, I argued it would take a long time for this stuff to be put in place.\"  On dealing with income inequality and the plight of the middle class, he feels we're missing upward mobility for the people in the bottom quarter of income distribution.  \"So what we need is a whole raft of things including Pre-K intervention, better schooling, apprenticeships, stronger college programs, a whole variety of things to get people better trained give them a chance to make it up into the upper echelon,\" Bernanke said.  \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Norah O'Donnell asked whether it's realistic to bring back lost manufacturing and mining jobs. Bernanke replied, \"No, it's not realistic.\"\u00a0 \"Instead of going back to the past and trying to reproduce 1960s assembly lines, it'd be much better to go to the industries of the future,\" he said. \"People miss what they had but you have to look forward and look for the opportunities in the future.\"",

            "article_content": "Anthony Scaramucci\u00a0is the incoming White House communications director. He held his first on-camera briefing Friday, and pledged to work on improving relations with the press corps. He also named Sarah Huckabee Sanders press secretary. \u00a0 \u00a0 Before taking the job Friday morning, he worked as chief strategy officer and senior vice president at the Export-Import Bank. On Sunday, Scaramucci made his debut \"Face the Nation\" appearance -- and discussed topics ranging from the health care debate to consequences for leaking information.\u00a0 A transcript of the interview follows. JOHN DICKERSON: And we want to welcome the incoming White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci to the broadcast. Mr. Scaramucci, welcome to \"Face the Nation.\" I want to start with the president's tweet yesterday about pardons. He said he has complete pardon power. Why is he tweeting about pardons? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Well, I think that unfortunately he may have had a conversation in the Oval Office or somewhere about it. And then people rush out to leak that information to people. It's just very unprofessional and very harmful. And I think the gist of that leak basically, I mean or that tweet I should say is that he's not going to pardon anybody. He doesn't need to pardon anybody. And it's just really about the leaking that is actually injurious to the government, felonious to the government. But he's done absolutely nothing wrong. And there's no need for him to pardon anybody. But he just doesn't like the fact that he has a two-minute conversation in the Oval Office or in his study and that people are running out and leaking that. So we're going to work on culturally changing that because it's extremely unprofessional. He's the commander-in-chief, the president of the United States. People that are standing around him that are doing that sort of nonsense are actually un-American. They're doing an injustice to the institution of the American presidency. And we're going to work very hard to change the culture of that. JOHN DICKERSON: What happens to leakers on your watch? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: They're going to get fired. I'm just going to make it very, very clear, okay? Tomorrow I'm going to have a staff meeting. And it's going to be a very binary thing. I'm-I'm not going to make any prejudgments about anybody on that staff. If they want to stay on the staff, they're going to stop leaking. If the leaks continue, we are strong as our weakest link. And I'll say it a little differently in a pun. We're strong as our weakest leak. So if you guys want to keep leaking, why don't you guys all get together and make a decision as a team that you're going to stop leaking. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: But if you're going to keep leaking, I'm going to fire everybody. It's just very binary. JOHN DICKERSON: You talk about the president's success in communicating, getting his message across. Is it helpful when he talks about or tweets about the special counsel's investigation? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: You know, the truth of the matter is that is the president. That's the crystal essence of the president. And so some of you guys in the media think it's not helpful. But if he thinks it's helpful to him, let him do it. At the end of the day, I think when those investigations are over, it'll be another chapter in Washington scandals incorporated, that we had to have a scandal going on and gin up all this sort of nonsense so that we could distract the president from his agenda and his people and run around chasing something that's all about nothing. And so I know we do that a lot in Washington. I certainly don't want to do that. What I want to do is I want to focus on the president's agenda, how he's going to help middle class people, lower middle class people, how we're going to take it to ISIS like we're taking it to them right now. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, let me ask-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Those are the things that I really think are super important for us to focus on. And so let Robert Mueller and that team focus on that. I'm going to focus as little on that as possible. JOHN DICKERSON: Isn't there a conflict between that though? The president's raising issues about the motivations of Mueller's team. Is that helpful? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Like I said, it doesn't matter to me whether it's helpful or not. JOHN DICKERSON: Well, doesn't get it in the way of the message that you were just talking about? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Well, it- it-it may and it may not, right? You guys like talking about that stuff. And I understand that. But I'm not going to. What I'm going to do is we're going to be very proactive, very offensive, and very aggressive on the president's agenda. And so you guys want to talk about that, that's fine. I'm going to talk about the stuff that I think are important to the American people. So JOHN DICKERSON: So it sounds like there's a new bright line. You won't be talking about the special counsel. Kellyanne Conway was on TV this week raising questions about donations some on the counsel's staff had made. Will that stop? There will be talk about the agenda and no talk-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: No, no. JOHN DICKERSON:--about the investigation? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: You know what I'm going to do, John? I'm going to sit down with Don Meehan. And I'm going to sit down with the outside counsel. I'm very close to Jay Sekulow. We know each other very well. Trust Jay. I know John Dowd as well. I'm going to sit down with these guys. I did go to Harvard Law School. And I will understand the lines of communication, what we can say from the White House, what we can't say from the White House. And then we'll operate a strategy that I think will knock the socks off of people. What I don't like about what's going on right now is that we're, we get hit, we're on the heels of our feet, and we want the president to be on the heels of his feet? President doesn't operate like that. The president operates off the balls of his feet. He's an aggressive guy. It's the reason why he won the presidency. And so we're going to come up with a strategy that's going to knock people's socks off. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: It's going to be, \u00a0It's going to be pro-Trump agenda. And when the, when the -- JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you though about-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: When the investigation dies down, I hope you'll invite me back on the show so I can say, \"See? That was another one of those ridiculous investigations.\" JOHN DICKERSON: You're from the business world. You know how these things work. The president was very critical of his attorney general in public in the\u00a0New York Times. How does that help? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Okay. So from the business world, what I would, what I would say about that and from my experience with the president, the president's a pretty wear-his-heart-on-the-sleeve sort of a guy. If people are very, very thin skinned, I think it's going to be super tough to work for this president. The president has said things to me in a tough, and honest, direct way. I think he's a very good athletic coach, if you will. And so what I would recommend to all of my-my colleagues in Washington and know the president very well, if he's saying stuff about you that you don't like, call him up. Go see him. Go get in the Oval Office or the study. JOHN DICKERSON: Why do it in public? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Have a straight-- JOHN DICKERSON: Why not in private? It undermines the man-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Because-- JOHN DICKERSON: --as he's trying to serve the country. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Because that's the president's personality. And it's not really that big of a deal. If you have a thin skin, what I'm learning about Washington, crocodile skin is not even the right metaphor. How about like titanium oxide, okay? JOHN DICKERSON: But the president is known for responding to things that are said about him. So surely he responds to everything that's said about him. Does he have thin skin? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Does the president? Actually, the president doesn't have thin skin. But what the president is is a fighter. The president doesn't like people saying stuff about him, and he wants them to stop it. And so he hits back. You know, what I enjoy about that, if you're saying something about him that he doesn't like, and then he says something about you, all of a sudden you get upset. But then you don't want him to get upset when you're saying stuff about him. It's -it's asymmetrical nonsense. Why don't we focus on the agenda instead of all of this nonsense? JOHN DICKERSON: You said in a tweet, \"My political views don't matter.\" That I assume also carries over to the -the donations you've made. You've supported Democrats in the past. All that doesn't matter for you doing your job? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: I'm - Listen. I'm an American businessman. And I'm a very practical guy. I've supported a lot of different people. I went to law school with President Obama. You know, if you've- if you've noticed, over the last two years that I've been more or less in the public domain, I don't like attacking people personally. I like debating policy. I never once attacked personally Secretary Clinton. I have found that when I have attacked people personally, that's been a stupid mistake on my part. And so whoever I have attacked personally I apologize for. But here's what I was trying to do yesterday with those tweets. I think it is nonsensical and more Washington nonsense that we have to take this political purity ideological test. JOHN DICKERSON: Well- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: So if I said I was for something JOHN DICKERSON: Sure. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: and now I'm against something, that makes me a hypocrite. I don't believe in that. I think it's stupid. And I want to subordinate my political views to the views of the president and his agenda. JOHN DICKERSON: So if you're able to subordinate the people you've supported in the past, the things you've said, and the money you've given, why then does the president raise past donations as disqualifying of the people who are working for Robert Mueller? Shouldn't the principle appear, shouldn't the principle work in both cases? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Okay well, hold on. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not the president, John. That's the president's-- JOHN DICKERSON: No, I'm just talking about the principle though. You said that your past donations don't matter. Shouldn't it-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: I understand. Let me- But you asked me the question. So let me just answer the question. I don't think it really makes a difference for me, but I am the communications director. The president's saying something a little bit different, okay? The president's suggesting that there might be people that are politically motivated to hit him and his family members even though that there's nothing there. Now, I have been the victim of that. It's a nasty thing. It's really not something that you like going through. Someone's accusing you of something that you didn't do. And then you got to go out and hire yourself a lawyer. And you have to prove-- for some reason in these scandals we flip the Constitution around. You're guilty until you go out there and prove yourself innocent. You're not innocent until proven guilty. And so-- JOHN DICKERSON: But aren't, but isn't-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: --the president doesn't like that. He thinks it's dishonest. And it's, it's subverting the agenda that he's trying to-- JOHN DICKERSON: But it seems that the-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: --to project. JOHN DICKERSON: The investigators are just doing the work. I don't think they've accused him of anything yet. At least by the president's admission. He says he's not being accused of anything and he's not under investigation. But they're doing their job and subordinating whatever they may have done with political donations, which seems like the same accommodation you're asking for. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Okay so you're, but, again, I'm not the president. So if the president wants to say that about them, let him say it. It's fine. JOHN DICKERSON: So you, do you think that-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: I just told you-- JOHN DICKERSON: Do you they're compromised by-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: I just told I have different-- JOHN DICKERSON: --by their past donations? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Am I compromised by my past donations? JOHN DICKERSON: No, do you think that the investigators are? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Do I think the investigators are? I don't know. I don't know these guys personally. If you give me a half hour with each of these guys, I'm pretty good at reading people. I could figure out in probably 30 minutes if they're compromised or not, but I don't know the guys personally. They may or may not be, sir. I have no idea. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you finally on the question of mixed messages. This week the president has said three different things about health care. On the 17th he said Republicans should repeal the failing Obamacare bill and then start with a clean state. On the 18th he said, \"Let Obamacare fail.\" On the 19th he said the country needs more than repeal. It needs repeal and replace. That's three different messages over three days. Isn't the President's message muddled? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: No, not at all. Here's the thing we got to- I hope we can do this for the president. I hope we can explain what he's doing and explain what he's thinking. And I hope that what you all start to realize, which is very refreshing to the American people, he's signaling over the top of the, of the mainstream media. So let's go over each of those tweets. He basically wants to repeal and replace Obamacare. He knows that's the best thing for the American people. It turns out that he may not be able to get that done with a recalcitrant Congress. And so then he fires out a tweet. \"Let's just repeal it.\" Then it turns out because he's working super hard. He's probably the most effective legislative liaison person in the world. He may get the chance to repeal and replace it. So then he's sending out that tweet. His point is he's a business person. He's got a Rubik's cube on his desk basically that he has to spin through because there's so many confusing people in Washington. And he's trying to figure out if he can get his objectives done, which are to repeal and replace Obamacare. JOHN DICKERSON: But the members of Congress-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: So what we both know about Washington-- JOHN DICKERSON: --working on this bill right working on this bill right-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: --there's a lot of different, different interests there, sir. JOHN DICKERSON: But the, but the senators working on the bill right now have no idea what his position is. He's beating them up on the one hand. Then he's saying they should do this and that. I guess that's the point, is that his message-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: That's not true. JOHN DICKERSON: --is mixed to them. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: There's not one person in Washington that doesn't know the president's position. And if there is, then hopefully they watch your show because you've got a great show. He would like to repeal and replace Obamacare. That's what he would like to do. If you're going to stop him from doing that, the next best thing would be to repeal Obamacare. If you're not going to repeal and replace Obamacare, then the third best thing is to let it implode. Because if you let it implode, there'll be a big enough crisis. And unfortunately in this town called Washington, these politicians respond better to crises than they do to just practical problem solving, which we could do right now before the implosion. So I think on a gradient that's what the president's saying, John. JOHN DICKERSON: Will the president get what he wants next week? Will it pass? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: I don't know if he's going to get what he wants next week. But he's going to get what he wants eventually because this guy always gets what he wants, okay? What I know about President Trump is that the world- he's got very, very good karma. He's very, very good to the people that are super close to him. Look at how great his kids turned out. You can't fake good kids. And the world turns back to President Trump. And so my prediction is he's going to get exactly what he wants. He's going to get health care reform. He's going to get tax reform. And he's going to start to put the regulatory, \u00a0deregulatory pillars in place so that our businesses and our economies can grow again, community banks can start lending again. And the people that I grew up with, the people in my neighborhood that have been struggling with low income and low wages are going to see a burst in economic activity. And he's going to get reelected. And we're going to work on that feverishly over the next two and a half, three years. JOHN DICKERSON: Final question. The Senate and the House have passed sanctions legislation on Russia or are going to. Will the president sign that? And if not, what more does he need to know-- ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Don't know. JOHN DICKERSON: --about, what more does the president need to know about Russians' interference with the election? ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: That's you know, that's a really good question. So I haven't seen any of that information. So I don't know the answer to that. I also don't know the answer to whether or not he's going to sign it. But- but- but we'll know shortly. And when we do, whether he signs it or he doesn't sign it, if you invite me back on, I'll try to explain to you the rationale and the reasoning that went into that decision. JOHN DICKERSON: All right. Anthony Scaramucci, thanks so much for being with us. ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI: Thank you. JOHN DICKERSON: We'll be back in a minute with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\"",

            "article_content": "Randy Bryce, an Army veteran and ironworker, has announced that he will challenge Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, in 2018.  Bryce, a Democrat who is active on Twitter under the handle @IronStache, has already run for office twice before, losing state House races in 2012 and 2014. But his first campaign ad quickly went viral, and is already turning heads in what could prove to be a major contest in next year's midterms.  Wow\u2014This ad by union ironworker Randy Bryce, who is challenging Paul Ryan is seriously powerful & moving @IronStache https://t.co/Yso8SxIvm6 President Trump won Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, which Ryan represents, by 10 points last November. And it's unusual, although not unprecedented, for sitting House Speaker's to lose reelection. The last time that happened was 1994, when Speaker Tom Foley, D-Washington, lost his seat in the \"Republican Revolution\" that returned the chamber to GOP control after decades in Democratic hands.  Ryan has represented the district since 1999, and became Speaker in 2015. Since then, he has always been reelected with more than 50 percent of the vote. In 2016, he won 65 percent of the vote. Bryce, however, insists that Ryan is vulnerable, and is expected to campaign with a message centered on health care. \"It's not the same Paul Ryan that initially ran,\" Bryce told NPR over the weekend. \"He - I mean, even now he'll come across as a nice guy, but it's been over 600 days since the man has had any kind of public listening session in the district.\"  Bryce supported Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, in last year's contentious Democratic presidential primary. His run could indicate whether Democrats will be successful in adopting a more progressive message, particularly in working class districts that went for Mr. Trump in the last general election.  Despite Mr. Trump's success in the district, and though it does tilt Republican, it only narrowly went for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, and was won by Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama in 2008. And given Ryan's role in leading a deeply unpopular Congress, which has struggled to deliver on its legislative goals since Mr. Trump took office, there is perhaps a chance that Bryce could make history by flipping the district.  \"I'm running being me,\" Bryce told NPR. \"I'm not trying to be anything. I'm not a politician. I'm a working guy that has - you know, lives in a neighborhood of working people. And it's standing up and it's listening. The big thing right now is working people want to be heard.\"\u00a0",

            "article_content": "ATLANTA - Scott Shepherd didn\u2019t fire the shot that killed Martin Luther King Jr., but the former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon says he has always felt remorse toward the family of the slain civil rights leader and all who honor his legacy. He reached for atonement Monday evening, sitting on a dais next to Bernice King, who was 5 years old when James Earl Ray assassinated her father in 1968. \u201cI want to extend an apology to the King family and everyone out there,\u201d Shepherd said, opening a discussion of race relations at the Atlanta center that bears the elder King\u2019s name. \u201cI, in my past, did a lot of terrible things. I said a lot of terrible things about Dr. King. I didn\u2019t know what I was talking about.\u201d Bernice King, who acknowledged \u201chating white people\u201d as a young woman, accepted Shepherd\u2019s apology. It was the pinnacle of a Martin Luther King Jr. Day that laid bare intense social tensions as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office Friday, yet also offered potential avenues to achieve King\u2019s vision of a just society. Trump did not publicly participate in any King observances. The holiday came amid the fallout from a public tiff between Trump and civil rights icon John Lewis, an exchange that incensed many African-Americans already leery of Trump after a racially charged campaign. In New York, King Day observers cast establishment leaders as Klan successors. \u201cWhen men no better than Klansmen dressed in suits are being sworn into office, we cannot be silent,\u201d Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi said at a Brooklyn gathering. Father Michael Plfeger, the man Bernice King invited to serve as keynote speaker at the Monday morning service at her father\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church, sounded similar themes. He delivered a 45-minute indictment of the nation\u2019s social and economic structure and warned it would get worse under Trump. \u201cPlantations still exist,\u201d Pfleger said. \u201cAnd too often, white hoods have been replaced by three-piece suits in this country.\u201d For her part, Bernice King warned of a nation \u201cdangerously polarized\u201d along the lines of race and class. \u201cWe are headed to race riots if we\u2019re not careful,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep this divisiveness going.\u201d She expressed concerns about Trump, who had met earlier in the day with her brother, Martin Luther King III. After that private session at Trump Tower in New York, King III said Trump pledged to be an inclusive president even as he stands firm in his spat with Lewis. The Georgia congressman initially called Trump \u201cillegitimate,\u201d prompting the president-elect to declare on Twitter that Lewis, who was beaten during the civil rights movement, was \u201call talk\u201d and \u201cno action.\u201d Bernice King said Trump has demonstrated \u201cwhat kind of man he is\u201d and said any transformation is up to God. Changing the nation, she said, rests with people like Shepherd and Daryl Davis, a black musician and author who has made a second career out of befriending Klansmen and leading them to renounce their racist views. \u201cWhen two enemies are talking, they aren\u2019t fighting,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt\u2019s when the talking ceases that the ground becomes fertile for violence.\u201d Minutes earlier, he had unfurled a robe and held aloft the hood of a man he said was once an Imperial Wizard of the Klan, supervising multiple states until he met Davis and eventually abandoned his racist views. Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential nomination that Trump won, told the same crowd it\u2019s not productive to focus on national leaders like Trump. \u201cThe problems we have in society today are right here in our own neighborhoods,\u201d he said. Kasich\u2019s approach highlights some differences among those who tout King\u2019s legacy. Pfleger, a self-described radical priest from Chicago, said the United States must dismantle systems of oppression through collective political action. Another failed presidential candidate, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, noted that King, beyond being a racial justice advocate, was an economic radical who angered the political establishment. If there is a shared conclusion among activists, it is perhaps that realizing King\u2019s vision involves both personal conversion and collective action, in neighborhoods and in the halls of power. Kasich noted that national politicians, even with their limitations, control resources and react to grassroots leaders like King. Activist Chris Crass, who is white, explained that he reaches out not to avowed white supremacists, but to whites who don\u2019t see themselves as part of the problem. The idea, he said, isn\u2019t to make them feel guilty, but to convince them that U.S. power brokers for generations have divided working-class whites against poor blacks as a means to maintain power. Understanding those \u201ceconomic and political realities\u201d would enable a new, powerful social and political coalition, he said. As to whether that can occur under Trump, Davis, the man who befriends and converts Klansman, said he\u2019s optimistic. Trump, he said, \u201chas brought all this out,\u201d regardless of whether he intended to do so.\u00a0 Davis said many Americans assumed - or convinced themselves - that bigotry was over with Barack Obama\u2019s election as the first black president. \u201cWe have been in denial about racism in this country,\u201d Davis said, \u201cand you cannot address what you cannot see.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In Erie this winter, Scott Slawson drove CBSN anchor Jamie Yuccas through what used to be the beating, productive heart of the town, an industrial area where rows of red-brick factories once proudly turned out American-made goods and employed tens of thousands of local workers. Now almost entirely derelict, Slawson says many remaining locals avoid driving this depressing route, peppered with the what President Trump referred to as \u201cRusted-out factories, scattered like tombstones,\u201d in his bleak inauguration speech. \u201cIt does look like a graveyard, says Slawson, who\u2019s president of the Local 506 Union. \u201cThat\u2019s the story of a lot of Erie. When you strip better than 30,000 jobs out of an area, this is what happens.\u201d His union represents around 3,000 workers now, but the calls that come into his office are often from people whose jobs have disappeared.\u00a0 Decades of decline in American manufacturing have seen a 1950s powerhouse gradually eroded to a shell of its former self in the present day. But this isn\u2019t merely a story of economics, this is a story of the human impact, the emotional toll that hits a community which has lost the means to provide for its people.\u00a0 Todd Bernat drives his pickup to his daughter\u2019s volleyball practice down West 12th St, jolted by the large potholes that pockmark the tarmac. Bernat lost his job recently, but remembers a boom time in the 90s when if you lost your job just after sunrise, you\u2019d find a new one before sunset. That\u2019s not the case any more, and finding new work has been tough. He has high hopes for his daughter, that she\u2019ll find a career insulated from the shocks he felt, perhaps in nursing or radiology. But they\u2019re both conscious of the stresses that his unemployment creates. Over dinner, she says of her father: \u201cHe always tries his best, he\u2019s come through a lot of tough things. It\u2019s kind of hard to see your parent struggle when they\u2019re just trying to do everything they can for you.\u201d Bernat thinks the result of the election show that there\u2019s a belief, even in rust belt towns like Erie, that the American dream is back within reach. But that requires people to commit themselves to the turnaround, and stay in the towns that many feel compelled to leave in order to enjoy the prosperity they desire. Justin Gallagher is one of those. The youngest in a family that has been part of Erie\u2019s fabric for four generations, he may not be part of Erie\u2019s fabric for much longer. While he knows he may have to leave, he wants to see his hometown recover, which keeps him bound to home. \u201cI really wouldn\u2019t like to leave,\u201d he says. I haven\u2019t crossed that bridge yet.\u201d\u00a0 Justin things that his generation may be the ones who have to effect change, assuming enough of them stay to replenish the political ranks. \u201cI think that a lot of the local leaders have not been doing their part. At some point, if I have to run for office to see change, then I\u2019ll do that.\u201d One man who is packing up to leave is Jim Stewart. A year after losing his job, he has already retrained at the Erie Institute of Technology, in the company of a large group of other middle-aged men, motivated by the need to keep roofs over their families\u2019 heads. While Jim now has prospects, and feels that his course has changed his life, those prospects are not in Erie.\u00a0 \u201cErie is definitely a sinking ship, and you\u2019d be crazy not to get off a ship that\u2019s sinking,\u201d he says. \u201cI landed a job in New Mexico where I\u2019ll be relocating. You could find a job here, but I\u2019d be making less than people who work at Walmart. It\u2019s time to get out of this town.\u201d\u00a0 Even if everything goes Erie\u2019s way during the next four years and beyond, restoring its former glory in full won\u2019t be easy. In areas of America that have managed to win back manufacturing work, automation has meant that while the jobs that return are higher-paid, they are fewer in number. Take, for example, the\u00a0Steel Dynamics plant in Mississippi\u2019s Golden Triangle. It\u2019s one of the most hi-tech steel mills in the country, and since 2007, it has processed more than 3 million tons of steel a year.\u00a0 In the old days, a mill like this would have needed 4,000 workers. Now it takes only 650.\u00a0 President Donald Trump visited Erie during his campaign, and promised Erie residents that he would bring back the jobs that had evaporated over the course of decades. Even through the decline, Erie remained a lock for Democratic candidates, consistently voting blue. That changed in November \u2014 people wanted change, and his message of hope came at a time when people were eager to hear that message.\u00a0 \u201cDonald Trump came here and he promised a lot of people that he would restore jobs in the United States,\u201d said union boss Scott Slawson. \u201cDesperate times call for desperate measures,\u201d he says, \u201cand people will take a desperate position even if it\u2019s not in our best interest sometimes.\u201d The rust belt states helped put President Trump in the White House, and the working class voters of those states, in places like Erie County, Pennsylvania, were a big reason they flipped Republican for the first time in decades. The story of Erie is much like that of other industrial counties throughout the region: places where voters hoped for change, and change often specifically meant the return of the kinds of manufacturing jobs that had supported the area so well in years past. Donald Trump won the county by a few thousand votes, but like many other counties in the region, that marked a notable swing from 2012, when President Obama had won the county by double digits. Pennsylvania, more generally, told the story of how many of these voters made a late break toward Donald Trump in the closing days and weeks of the campaign, hoping he could turn their economic fortunes around. Exit polls showed that late deciders \u2013 those who made up their minds close to Election Day \u2013 broke heavily for Trump. Overall, white men without college degrees backed Trump by a much larger spread than they had Mitt Romney four years prior. And Trump won a 2-to-1 margin statewide among voters who believed that trade was taking away American jobs. This documentary is the first in a series of CBSN Originals examining the shifting sands of America\u2019s economy, and how that has affected the people and communities in the American heartland. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON - Americans with no more than a high school diploma have fallen so far behind college graduates in their economic lives that the earnings gap between college grads and everyone else has reached its widest point on record. The growing disparity has become a source of frustration for millions of Americans worried that they-- and their children -- are losing economic ground. College graduates, on average, earned 56 percent more than high school grads in 2015, according to data compiled by the Economic Policy Institute. That was up from 51 percent in 1999 and is the largest such gap in EPI\u2019s figures dating to 1973. Since the Great Recession ended in 2009, college-educated workers have captured most of the new jobs and enjoyed pay gains. Non-college grads, by contrast, have faced dwindling job opportunities and an overall 3 percent decline in income, EPI\u2019s data shows. \u201cThe post-Great Recession economy has divided the country along a fault line demarcated by college education,\u201d Anthony Carnevale, director of Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce, said in a report last year. College grads have long enjoyed economic advantages over Americans with less education. But as the disparity widens, it is doing so in ways that go beyond income, from homeownership to marriage to retirement. Education has become a dividing line that affects how Americans vote, the likelihood that they will own a home and their geographic mobility. The dominance of college graduates in the economy is, if anything, accelerating. Last year, for the first time, a larger proportion of workers were college grads (36 percent) than high school-only grads (34 percent), Carnevale\u2019s research found. The number of employed college grads has risen 21 percent since the recession began in December 2007, while the number of employed people with only a high school degree has dropped nearly 8 percent. Behind the trend is a greater demand for educated workers, and the retirement of older Americans, who are more likely to be high school-only graduates. The split is especially stark among white men. For middle-age white men with only high school degrees -- the core of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s support -- inflation-adjusted income fell 9 percent from 1996 through 2014, according to Sentier Research, an analytics firm. By contrast, income for white men in the same age bracket who are college graduates jumped 23 percent. Long after the recession ended, many young college graduates struggled to find well-paying jobs in a slowly recovering economy, and stories about graduates working as coffee shop baristas abounded. But data collected by the New York Federal Reserve suggests that trend has faded as the economy has improved. Yet few experts think the solution is simply to send more students to four-year colleges. Many young people either don\u2019t want to spend more years in school or aren\u2019t prepared to do so. Already, four in every 10 college students drop out before graduating -- often with debt loads they will struggle to repay without a degree. Rather, labor economists say, many high school grads would benefit from a more comprehensive approach to obtaining skills, especially involving technology, that are increasingly in demand. \u201cIf the only path you offer them is a traditional college path, they\u2019re not going to be successful,\u201d said Harry Holzer, an economist at Georgetown University. Helping lift high school graduates\u2019 skill levels is critical, given the many ways they\u2019re lagging behind their college-educated peers: All of this contributed to a sharp political split in the presidential election. College graduates favored Hillary Clinton by 9 percentage points. Non-college grads chose Donald Trump by 8 points, according to exit polls. That was the largest disparity between the two groups on record since 1980, according to the Pew Research Center. \u201cThese are some of the largest shifts in recent years,\u201d said Jocelyn Kiley, an associate director at Pew. The gap is most pronounced among whites: Nearly two-thirds of white non-college grads voted for Trump, compared with just 45 percent of whites with college degrees. Some of these trends might eventually reverse themselves if more high school grads acquire the skills needed for higher-paying work. Though many middle-income jobs don\u2019t require college, nearly all require some post-high school education or training. What Holzer calls the \u201cnew middle\u201d includes such health care jobs as X-ray technicians and phlebotomists, as well as computer-controlled manufacturing and some office occupations, like paralegals. A typical X-ray technician, for example, earns nearly $60,000 a year and needs only a two-year degree, according to government data. And these \u201cnew middle\u201d positions are typically the same jobs for which employers have complained they can\u2019t find enough qualified people to fill. Labor experts say the U.S. educational system is failing to help young people acquire such skills. If they know where to look, high school graduates can choose from among numerous options for vocational skills training -- from two-year programs to online courses to for-profit schools. Yet many aren\u2019t likely to get much help from high school guidance counselors. Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School, said counselors increasingly focus on things like substance abuse, discipline and standardized testing, rather than on career advice. Nor do U.S. high schools funnel students into the kind of on-the-job apprenticeships that exist in some countries. Instead, Fuller said, U.S. apprentices are typically older workers upgrading their skills in areas like construction. The average age of an apprentice in Germany is 17, he noted; in the U.S., it\u2019s 27. \u201cWe have a very limited vision of how to get people from their graduation in high school onto a path that\u2019s going to lead them to have a successful, independent life,\u201d Fuller said. Asia Howard, 26, of Jacksonville, Florida, is navigating that path right now. She was stuck in mostly retail and fast-food jobs after graduating high school, unable to get a job in banking, a profession she prized for its steady hours. A friend told her about a nonprofit called Year Up, which teaches such career skills as resume writing, interview techniques and time management. Year Up participants also typically receive internships, which Howard spent at Everbank (EVER). She also took classes to upgrade her computer skills. Early last year, she began a job in mortgage lending at PNC Financial (PNC) that pays nearly twice what she earned in previous jobs. She saw many people lose homes during the financial crisis. Now, she helps people buy them. \u201cIt gives me a chance to see what that side of life is like,\u201d Howard said. And unlike in her previous jobs, \u201cI can see a lot of room to grow.\u201d She is also studying for an associate\u2019s degree in business administration at Florida State College at Jacksonville. The driving force for many of these changes was the recession, which reshaped the job market in ways that left far fewer opportunities for workers like Howard. Many routine jobs were replaced by computers or robots or were outsourced overseas. There are nearly 1.5 million fewer office administrative and clerical jobs now than there were before the recession, according to an analysis by Georgetown\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce. That narrowed a long-time path to the middle class for high school graduates, particularly women. Manufacturing employment is also 1.5 million lower than when the recession began in 2007. The construction industry had offered a lifeline to many high school-educated workers, particularly men, during the housing boom in the 2000s. Yet construction now employs 840,000 fewer people than it did nine years ago. Since the recession, the fastest-growing industry for high school-only grads has been a mostly low-paying sector that includes restaurants, hotels \u00a0and amusement parks, according to Georgetown\u2019s analysis. Those are the types of jobs that Crystal Thompson, 35, of Seattle, has held since she finished high school. She has worked at Domino\u2019s Pizza (DPZ) for seven years. \u201cThe only jobs that are out there are pretty much minimum wage jobs -- coffee shops, restaurants, things like that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty much stuck in fast food for now.\u201d Thompson\u2019s raises have come from minimum wage increases. She went on strike twice during Seattle\u2019s recent \u201cFight for $15\u201d campaign, which led the City Council to approve a citywide $15 minimum wage. Thompson, who has three children, wants to return to school to become a translator. She\u2019s mostly fluent in Spanish. Yet she has found it hard to do so in part because her work schedule can fluctuate and is typically distributed just a day in advance. The closest community college lacks the classes in medical and legal translation she needs. Those classes are offered at another community college a half hour away, so she needs to buy a car to attend them. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of my goals, to get some kind of career going,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be a productive member of society.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The following script is from \u201c60 Minutes Presents: Barack Obama: Eight Years in the White House,\u201d which aired on Jan. 15, 2017. Steve Kroft is the correspondent.\u00a0 Good evening. I\u2019m Steve Kroft. Welcome to \u201c60 Minutes Presents.\u201d Tonight, President Barack Obama looks back at eight years in the White House. His successes. His failures and what he learned from his two terms as the nation\u2019s chief executive and commander-in-chief. We first met him 10 years ago, when he was in his first term as a U.S. senator from Illinois and\u00a0launching an unlikely campaign\u00a0for president. As we said at the time, there had never been another presidential candidate quite like him. His last name rhymed with \u201cOsama.\u201d\u00a0 And his middle name was Hussein. He was half black, half white, and in terms of political experience, very green. President Barack Obama: Steve Kroft.  Steve Kroft: Hey! We sat down with President Obama Monday afternoon in the State Dining Room at the White House. It marked our 12th and final interview with him since he was elected president. We began by showing him a picture.  Steve Kroft: I got something I want to show you. President Barack Obama: What do we got here? Look at that. I got to say that I feel as if I couldn\u2019t take this kind of Chicago winter right now. It was taken Super Bowl Sunday 2007 on a frigid day on the South Side of Chicago -- one of the last times he could walk a street without attracting a big crowd, unencumbered by Secret Service or an entourage.\u00a0 It was a week before he declared his formal candidacy for president. Steve Kroft: That was 10 years ago. President Barack Obama: I think that\u2019s right. That\u2019s my mother-in-law\u2019s house, that block, I think. Steve Kroft: Nobody around, nobody. Nobody cared. President Barack Obama: They didn\u2019t. How about that? He was an audaciously hopeful junior senator from Illinois, splitting his time between his tiny apartment in Washington and the Chicago home where he had two young daughters. Steve Kroft: What else does he make besides tuna fish? Malia Obama: Chili, and that\u2019s it. His wife was a working mom, a hospital executive and major breadwinner in the family. She wasn\u2019t crazy about her husband being in politics. Steve Kroft: Has it put strains on the marriage from time to time? Michelle Obama: Oh, no. Sen. Obama: Absolutely, it has. Steve Kroft: But you\u2019d let him go ahead and do this? Michelle Obama: I think if I weren\u2019t married to him, I\u2019d want him to be in there. So I don\u2019t want to stand in the way of that because we have to work out a few things. We\u2019ve had those arguments and\u2026 Sen. Obama: And I\u2019ve lost them all. It all seems like a long time ago. Steve Kroft: So what\u2019s the difference between this guy and the guy you are now? How much smarter are you than this guy standing on the street corner? President Barack Obama: Well, let\u2019s see. Obviously I\u2019m grayer, a few more wrinkles. You know I\u2019ll be honest with you, Steve. One of the things I\u2019m proud about is that I think my basic character and outlook actually have not changed much. And people who are closest to me will tell you that the guy who came here is the same guy who\u2019s leaving. And the reason I take pride for that is one of the things you worry about when you\u2019re in the bubble, and there\u2019s all this pomp and circumstance and hail to the chief is, do you lose touch with what you thought was important and what brought you here? And I\u2019m proud that I don\u2019t think I have lost touch. Steve Kroft: If you had to write a brief description of this job beginning with wanted-- how would you describe the position? And what are the tasks? And what skills do you think you need? President Barack Obama: Thick skin helps. Steve Kroft: Thick skin, stamina. President Barack Obama: Stamina. There is a greater physical element to this job than you would think, just being able to grind it out. And I think your ability to not just mentally and emotionally, but physically be able to say, \u201cWe got this. We\u2019re going to be OK.\u201d Steve Kroft: Did you learn the executive stuff on the job? Because when we first talked, I must have asked you 100 times. Your only executive experience was running the Harvard Law Review and running your own campaign. Did you have to learn a lot of this on the job? President Barack Obama: The campaign was a more significant training ground than I think people give it credit for. By the time I got here, I think I had a pretty good sense of what was required. But the circumstances in which I came in were different than most executives, right? The enterprise was in the midst of a major crisis. And so, those first six months were a fire drill. Beside the two wars he inherited in Iraq and Afghanistan, and promised to end, a financial crisis at home had pushed the United States to the brink of another Great Depression. When we spoke with the new president in March of 2009, the economy was losing 800,000 jobs a month, the government was throwing hundreds of billions of dollars at failing banks, and the auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Politically pummeled from all sides, Obama did his best to keep a sense of humor.  President Obama: I just want to say that the only thing less popular than putting money into banks is putting money into the auto industry. So-- Steve Kroft: But 18 percent are in favor, 76 percent against. President Obama: It\u2019s not a high number. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re sitting here and you\u2019re-- you are laughing about some of these problems. Are people going to look at this and say, \u201cI mean, he\u2019s sitting there just making jokes about money--\u201d How do you deal with that? President Obama: No, no, no. Steve Kroft: I mean, wha-- explain the-- the-- the-- President Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: The mood in your laughter. President Obama: Yeah, I mean, there\u2019s gotta be-- Steve Kroft: Are you punch-drunk? President Obama: No, no, there\u2019s gotta be a little gallows humor to get you through the day. A political candidacy built around hope and change and compromise would eventually become a presidency of crisis and confrontation.  Steve Kroft: Is there anything that surprised you about this job? President Barack Obama: I was surprised and continue to be surprised by the severity of partisanship in this town. And I think that I\u2019d been warned about it. You\u2019ll remember, in the campaign back in 2007, 2008, people would say, \u201cOh, he\u2019s being na\u00efve. He thinks that there\u2019s no red states and blue states. And wait \u2018til he gets here.\u201d And I will confess that, I didn\u2019t fully appreciate the ways in which individual senators or members of Congress now are pushed to the extremes by their voter bases. I did not expect, particularly in the midst of crisis, just how severe that partisanship would be. Steve Kroft: You came into this office trying to unify the country. You said that many times during the campaign. You wanted to bring people together. You wanted to change Washington. You talked about transformative change. And you became the focal point for some of the division.  President Barack Obama: I became a lightning rod for some partisan battles. I could not be prouder of the track record we\u2019ve put together. By almost every measure, the country is significantly better off than when I came in. If you can look back and say, \u201cThe economy\u2019s better. Our security\u2019s better. The environment\u2019s better. Our kids\u2019 education is better,\u201d if you can say that you\u2019ve made things better, then considering all the challenges out there, you should feel good. But I\u2019m the first to acknowledge that I did not crack the code in terms of reducing this partisan fever. Steve Kroft: You didn\u2019t change Washington. President Barack Obama: You know, I changed those things that were in direct-- my direct control. I mean, I-- look, I\u2019m proud of the fact that, with two weeks to go, we\u2019re probably the first administration in modern history that hasn\u2019t had a major scandal in the White House. In that sense, we changed some things. I would\u2019ve liked to have gotten that one last Supreme Court justice in there. I\u2019d like the Supreme Court to take a look at-- Steve Kroft: You couldn\u2019t even get a hearing. President Barack Obama: But we couldn\u2019t even get a hearing. Trying to get the other side of the aisle to work with us on issues, in some cases, that they professed, originally, an interest in, and saying to them, \u201cHold on a second. You guys used to think this was a good idea. Now, just because I\u2019m supporting it, you can\u2019t change your mind.\u201d But they did. And what that did, I think, made me appreciate. And I\u2019ve said this before. But it\u2019s worth repeating. Because this is on me. Part of the job description is also shaping public opinion. And we were very effective, and I was very effective, in shaping public opinion around my campaigns. But there were big stretches, while governing, where even though we were doing the right thing, we weren\u2019t able to mobilize public opinion firmly enough behind us to weaken the resolve of the Republicans to stop opposing us or to cooperate with us. And there were times during my presidency where I lost the PR battle. And losing the PR battles, particularly about healthcare, translated into losing his Democratic majorities in Congress, beginning with a Republican landslide in the midterm election of 2010.  Steve Kroft: There is this feeling in-- particularly among people who are among your hardened supporters\u2014 President Obama: Right. Steve Kroft: --who feel a little disappointed that they think that you\u2019ve lost your mojo. That you\u2019ve lost your ability, that touch you had during the campaign to inspire\u2014 President Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: -- and lead that-- you know, everybody in Washington writes about the sort of aloofness that you have and I`m sure that drives you crazy. That you\u2019ve let other people define you, that you haven`t sold your successes well enough?  President Obama: I think it`s a fair argument, you know, I think that over the course of two years we were so busy and so focused on getting a bunch of stuff done that we stopped paying attention to the fact that, you know leadership isn\u2019t just legislation, that it\u2019s a matter of persuading people and giving them confidence, and bringing them together and setting a tone. For the next six years, there would be legislative gridlock, and by 2016, the people who had looked to Obama for change were looking somewhere else.  Steve Kroft: Donald Trump, if you take away the particulars, was elected to the office, basically, on the same program that you were, of change. He wants to change Washington. President Barack Obama: Well, I mean that\u2019s a lot of particulars you\u2019re taking away. Fair enough. Steve Kroft: But do you think-- President Barack Obama: He was a change candidate.  Steve Kroft: Do you think anybody can change Washington? President Barack Obama: I think the American people can change Washington. But I think that it is not going to change, because somebody from on high directs that change. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, are motivated by all kinds of issues. They\u2019re sincerely interested in the economy, in terrorism, in social issues. But the one overriding thing they\u2019re interested in is getting reelected. And if they think that it\u2019s harder for them to get reelected by cooperating with each other, then they won\u2019t cooperate.  Steve Kroft: A lot of people think the system is broken, that the system, the political system is broken. That seemed to be the message that you heard throughout this campaign. President Barack Obama: Well --  Steve Kroft: And you seem to be saying, in some ways, maybe it is broken. President Barack Obama: In the first two years, when I had a strong majority in the House and the Senate, we were as productive as any administration has been since the \u201860s. I mean, we got a lot done. And so you can get a lot of stuff done through this system. But to sustain a governing majority, that requires an ability for Republicans and Democrats to find some common ground. And right now, the structure of the system is such where it makes it really hard for people to work together. And we mentioned, an example earlier, the Supreme Court nominations. I mean, the fact that Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans, was able to just stop a nomination almost a year before the next election and really not pay a political price for it, that\u2019s a sign that the incentives for politicians in this town to be so sharply partisan have gotten so outta hand that we\u2019re weakening ourselves. Steve Kroft: How serious do you think this is? I mean, how stable do you think that the political system, the democratic system, is? President Barack Obama: Look, I think it\u2019s stable, because the framers, in their wisdom, designed the system so that power\u2019s pretty disbursed. You know, we have states. And we have cities. And we have counties. And we have the private sector. And-- and so the country still works even when Washington\u2019s dysfunctional. But the problem is that, over time, big pieces of business that have to get done without leadership from Washington, don\u2019t get done. Steve Kroft: I want to go back just briefly on this. But I think, look, this last election, you had a political system. Well, first of all the people elected somebody who went around saying that the system was rigged.  President Barack Obama: Yeah.  Steve Kroft: You had two of the most unpopular presidential candidates selected by the two parties in history. Doesn\u2019t that say something\u2019s wrong, something serious is wrong? President Barack Obama: It indicates that there is a lot of cynicism out there. It indicates that the corrosive nature of everything from talk radio to fake news to negative advertising has made people lack confidence in a lot of our existing institutions. I think it indicates, at least on the Democratic side, that we\u2019ve got more work to do to strengthen our grassroots networks. In some ways, the Democratic Party hadn\u2019t constructed itself to get that message out to the places it needed to get to. The Tea Party I have huge disagreements with, obviously. But I give them credit for having activated themselves. And they made a difference in terms of moving the Republican Party, in terms of moving the country in a particular direction. It\u2019s a direction I disagreed with. But it showed that, in fact, you get involved, if your voice is heard it has an impact. Steve Kroft: Do you feel the same way about Donald Trump? President Barack Obama: Well I think that he clearly was able to tap into a lot of grievances. And he has a talent for making a connection with his supporters that overrode some of the traditional benchmarks of how you\u2019d run a campaign or conduct yourself as a presidential candidate. What will be interesting to see is how that plays out during the course of his presidency. We are moving into an era where a lot of people get their information through tweets and sound bites and some headline that comes over their phone. And I think that there\u2019s a power in that. There\u2019s also a danger, what generates a headline or stirs up a controversy and gets attention isn\u2019t the same as the process required to actually solve the problem. Steve Kroft: You said you don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to do when he governs, but we\u2019re in this transition period and one of the first things that he has done in this transition period is to pick a fight with the intelligence agencies. Do you think that that\u2019s a smart move? President Barack Obama: You\u2019re not going to be able to make good decisions without building some relationship of trust between yourself and that community. Steve Kroft: Do you see that happening? President Barack Obama: Not yet, but, you know, again, he hasn\u2019t gotten sworn into office yet. When we come back, President Obama talks about one of the strangest transitions in White House history -- and he acknowledges some mistakes. At the White House on Monday, crates and boxes lined the hallways and cluttered the East Room. Some carpets had been rolled up. Outside, there are bleachers on Pennsylvania Avenue and moving vans in the driveway \u2013 visual evidence that there\u2019s a transition underway. This ritual of democracy, this peaceful transfer of power can be awkward under the best of circumstances. And these are not the best of circumstances for either the outgoing or incoming president. Steve Kroft: You have to admit that this is one of the strangest transitions in history. President Barack Obama: It\u2019s unusual. I\u2019ll agree with that. Well, I-- Steve Kroft: I mean, he-- President Barack Obama: --and I suspect-- I suspect the president-elect would agree with that. Look-- Steve Kroft: No, I-- President Barack Obama: --he is an unconventional candidate. Steve Kroft: Right. President Barack Obama: I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody who\u2019s run a campaign like his successfully in modern history, not that I can think of. And, as a consequence because he didn\u2019t have the supports of many of the establishment in his own party, because he ran sort of an improvisational campaign-- Steve Kroft: Can you run an improvisational presidency? President Barack Obama: I don\u2019t think so. And so now he\u2019s in the process of building up an organization. And well, we\u2019ll have to see how that works. And it\u2019ll be a test, I think, for him and the people that he\u2019s designated to be able to execute on his vision. Steve Kroft: Look, I think that the country deeply appreciates the fact that you have not spoken clearly, I think, probably what\u2019s on your mind in relation to the president-elect. But as you said earlier it\u2019s unusual. He seems to have spent a good deal of his time sending out tweets that, you know, that the United States must strengthen and expand its nuclear ability. That Meryl Streep is an overrated Hillary flunky. You\u2019re watching this like everybody else. I mean what\u2019s going on? President Barack Obama: You know, you\u2019re going to have to talk to him. But here\u2019s what I-- here\u2019s what I think. First of all, I think everybody has to acknowledge don\u2019t underestimate the guy, because he\u2019s going to be 45th president of the United States. The one thing I\u2019ve said to him directly, and I would advise my Republican friends in Congress and supporters around the country, is just make sure that, as we go forward certain norms, certain institutional traditions don\u2019t get eroded, because there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re in place.  One thing both men have in common is a love of golf and a shared knowledge of the word \u201cmulligan,\u201d which means a do-over to replace a lousy shot.  Steve Kroft: I mean you play golf. President Barack Obama: I do. Steve Kroft: Do you ever wish you had a mulligan? I mean in the eight years that you\u2019ve had, if-- if you had-- if you had three or four mulligans would you use \u2018em? President Barack Obama: Yeah. You know, there\u2019s no doubt that probably at least once a week, maybe once a day, I said, \u201cAh, I should have done that better.\u201d I bet at the end of this interview I\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, that\u2019s-- that would have been a really good answer for that or this.\u201d I think we\u2019ve done the big stuff right. I think that there are some big, obvious fumbles-- Steve Kroft: Like? President Barack Obama: --or shanks if you are using the-- Steve Kroft: Right. President Barack Obama: --golf analogy. Well, Healthcare.gov is a good example. Steve Kroft: \u00a0Right. President Barack Obama: You know, if you know you got a controversial program, and you\u2019re setting up a really big, complicated website, website better work on the first day or first week or first month. The fact that it didn\u2019t obviously lost a little momentum. That was clearly a management failure. Critics of the administration would cite what they see as larger failures in the area of foreign policy particularly in the Middle East, which we grilled him about in an interview15 months ago. Steve Kroft: There is a perception in the Middle East that the United States is in retreat, that we\u2019ve pulled our troops out of Iraq and ISIS has moved in and taken over much of that territory. The situation in Afghanistan is very precarious and the Taliban is on the march again. President Obama: I think it\u2019s fair to say, Steve, that if-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0It\u2019s -- Let me just finish the thought. President Obama: OK. Steve Kroft: \u00a0They say you\u2019re projecting weakness, not strength-- President Obama: You\u2019re-- you\u2019re-- you\u2019re-- you\u2019re saying \u201cthey\u201d-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0I\u2019m talking about-- President Obama: You\u2019re-- you\u2019re not-- you\u2019re not citing too many folks, but-- but-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0No, I\u2019ll cite folks if you want me to. President Obama: But here\u2019s--  Steve Kroft: I\u2019d say the Saudis, I\u2019d say the Israelis, I\u2019d say a lot of our friends in the Middle East. President Obama: I-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0I\u2019d say everybody-- President Obama: Steve-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0Everybody in your-- everybody in the Republican Party. You want me to keep going? President Obama: Yeah, if you are\u2014if you\u2019re citing the Republican Party, I think it\u2019s fair to say that there is nothing I\u2019ve done right over the last seven and half years.  But even former members of his administration criticized the president for talking tough and not following through. In 2012, Obama told the Syrian government that the use of chemical weapons would cross a red line\u2026 Obama: That, that\u2019s a red line for us.  That could provoke us military involvement. When they were used, the president responded not with force, but diplomacy, raising questions about his credibility. Steve Kroft: \u00a0I want to go back to, like, 2012.  President Barack Obama: Yeah.  Steve Kroft: I want to-- to two words. Red line.  President Barack Obama: Yeah.  Steve Kroft: You didn\u2019t have to say that.  President Barack Obama: Yeah.  Steve Kroft: And there have been reports that it wasn\u2019t in your speech. President Barack Obama: No, it wasn\u2019t. Steve Kroft: That you just sort of ad-libbed it. If you could pull \u2013 and it created \u2013 it created problems for you with the military people. Would you take those words back? You didn\u2019t have to say them. President Barack Obama: Yeah, look, if you\u2019re putting all the weight on that particular phrase, then in terms of how it was interpreted in Washington, I think you make a legitimate point. I\u2019ve got to tell you, though, I don\u2019t regret at all saying that if I saw Bashar al-Assad using chemical weapons on his people that that would change my assessments in terms of what we were or were not willing to do in Syria. Steve Kroft: \u00a0But you didn\u2019t say that. President Barack Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0You said you drew the red line. President Barack Obama: I-- look, I-- Steve Kroft: I don\u2019t want to make too big a deal out of it, but-- President Barack Obama: I understand-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0--I think that-- but I-- President Barack Obama: I-- but that-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0--you think that that was-- President Barack Obama: --well-- Steve Kroft: Would you take it back? If you had-- President Barack Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: \u00a0--the opportunity to take it back? President Barack Obama: The reason I\u2019m hesitating is not to be defensive. It-- it\u2019s simply, Steve, that I would have I think made a bigger mistake if I had said, \u201cEh, chemical weapons. That doesn\u2019t really change my calculus.\u201d I think it was important for me as president of the United States to send a message that in fact there is something different about chemical weapons. And, regardless of how it ended up playing, I think-- in the Beltway, what is true is Assad got rid of his chemical weapons. And the reason he got rid of \u2018em is-- Steve Kroft: For a while. President Barack Obama: --because-- well, look-- if 90 percent or 95 percent of those-- chemical stockpiles were eliminated, that\u2019s a lot of chemical weapons that are not right now in the hands of ISIL or Nusra or, for that matter, the regime. Steve Kroft: Israel. President Barack Obama: Yeah. Steve Kroft: \u00a0A few weeks ago you allowed the U.N. Security Council to pass a resolution condemning Israel\u2019s settlements in the West Bank. It caused a major fallout between the United States and Israel. Was it your decision to abstain? President Barack Obama: Yes, ultimately. Steve Kroft: \u00a0Why did you feel like you had to do that? President Barack Obama: Well, first of all, Steve, I don\u2019t think it caused a major rupture in relations between the United States and Israel. If you\u2019re saying that Prime Minister Netanyahu\u00a0got fired up, he\u2019s been fired up repeatedly during the course of my presidency, around the Iran deal and around our consistent objection to settlements. So that part of it wasn\u2019t new. And despite all the noise and hullabaloo-- military cooperation, intelligence cooperation, all of that has continued. We have defended them consistently in every imaginable way. But I also believe that both for our national interests and Israel\u2019s national interests that allowing an ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians that could get worse and worse over time is a problem. And that settlements contribute. They\u2019re not the sole reason for it, but they\u2019re a contributing factor to the inability to solve that problem. And-- Steve Kroft: And you wanted to make that point? President Barack Obama: Not only did I want to make that point. We are reaching a tipping where the pace of settlements, during the course of my presidency has gotten so substantial that it\u2019s getting harder and harder to imagine an effective, contiguous Palestinian state. And I think it would have long-term consequences for peace and security in the region, and the United States, because of our investment in the region, and because we care so deeply about Israel, I think has a legitimate interest in saying to a friend, \u201cThis is a problem.\u201d And we\u2019ve said it-- look, it\u2019s not as if we haven\u2019t been saying it from Day One. We\u2019ve been saying it for eight years now. It\u2019s just that nothing seemed to get a lot of attention. When we return: the president discusses eight years in the Oval Office and life with his family in the White House. After our interview in the State Dining Room, President Obama invited us to the Oval Office where he had some things he wanted to show us, and some thoughts about his family\u2019s eight years in the Executive Mansion.\u00a0  Steve Kroft: What are you going to miss most about this place? President Barack Obama: This walk is one of them. On the way, he told us that his family life had thrived living and working under the White House roof, but that his wife and daughters didn\u2019t feel the same way about life in what Harry Truman called \u201cthe finest prison in the world.\u201d Steve Kroft: How do they feel? President Barack Obama: Ah, they\u2019re ready to go. I mean, the girls, obviously, you know, they are now of an age in which the constraints of Secret Service and bubbles and all that stuff has gotten pretty old. Michelle never fully took to the scrutiny. I mean, she\u2019s thrived as a first lady, but it\u2019s not her preference. And so-- Steve Kroft: She was the hardest sell. President Barack Obama: She was the hardest sell. And she never fully embraced being in the public spotlight, which is ironic, given how good she is. Having said that she would acknowledge, and I certainly feel that we-- we just have a lot of memories here. You know, our kids grew up here. Some of our best friends have been made here in this place. There have been moments that were highlights for us-- that-- you know, are going to be hard to duplicate. So-- Steve Kroft: She\u2019s glad you did it though? President Barack Obama: She is now. Ahhh, I think I\u2019ve said this story before. You know, she used to say to our friends, \u201cBarack\u2019s exactly the kind of guy I want to be president. I just wish he didn\u2019t want to do it when I was married to him.\u201d So-- so now that we\u2019re-- Steve Kroft: But you\u2019re still all right? I mean, everything\u2019s OK? President Barack Obama: So far, as far as I know. I better check later. Yeah. Steve Kroft: You have said you\u2019re going to take a big vacation. You\u2019re going to write your book. You\u2019re going to work on your library. You\u2019re going to set up a foundation. I mean, that sounds very professorial compared to what you\u2019ve been doing, like the ivory tower equivalent of puttering around the garden. Are you going to be happy doing this? President Barack Obama: Well-- Steve Kroft: Are you-- President Barack Obama: --look, I\u2019m going to try to get some sleep. And do a little puttering. Because I haven\u2019t had a lot of chance to reflect and absorb all this. I do not expect to be behind a desk a lot. I look forward to teaching the occasional class, \u2018cause I was a professor. And I had fun doing it. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re not going to go to Wall Street, make a lot of money? President Barack Obama: I\u2019m not going to Wall Street. The amount of time that I\u2019ll be investing in issues is going to be high. But it\u2019ll be necessarily in a different capacity. \u00a0 Steve Kroft: Roosevelt\u2019s remembered for Social Security. Eisenhower is remembered for a speech about the military industrial complex. Ten years from now, what are they going to say about you? What are they going to remember you for? President Barack Obama: You know, I don\u2019t think you know now. I think you\u2019re not going to know until 10 years from now. I do think that, you know, saving the economy was a pretty big deal. We did a lot of stuff early that ended up having an impact. I believe that the work we\u2019ve done in moving our energy future in a cleaner direction is going to stick even if some of the individual steps that we took are reversed by future administrations. I think that it\u2019s embedded itself in the economy. And we\u2019ve been able to organize the international community around it in ways that aren\u2019t going to go back. I think we\u2019ve set the bar with respect to the notion that it is possible to provide health care for people. Now I know that the incoming Congress and administration talks about repealing it. But we\u2019ve set a bar that shows that this can be done. And that core principle is one that the majority of Americans, including supporters of Donald Trump believe in. Steve Kroft: What are your memories of this office? What\u2019s going to stick in your mind? What are you going to remember from here? President Barack Obama: Well I think the number of decisions that you make just with your advisers sitting here-- we\u2019ve had some big powwows around, is the banking system about to collapse and what do we do about it? To questions of war and peace. So you remember the decisions that were made in this room. The objects in this room-- only a few of \u2018em I really attach to. I think that I\u2019ll always remember the bust of Dr. King. I thought having an American here who represented rhat civic spirit that got me into this office was useful. Over there I\u2019ve got the original program for the March on Washington that was framed and given to me by a friend. You know, I\u2019ll remember the view out this window, because this is where we had our-- the playground that we put in when Malia and Sasha came in. \u00a0Being able every once in awhile to look out the window and see your daughters during the summer, swinging on that swing set, that made the presidency a little bit sweeter. When Sasha and Malia Obama arrived at the White House in 2009, they were age 7 and 10.\u00a0 Their parents -- for the most part \u2013 were successful in keeping them out of the limelight, except in the rarest circumstances. In the fall, Malia begins at Harvard after a gap year. Sasha is a sophomore at her private school in Washington. This month, the swing set was dismantled and given away. Steve Kroft: You feel older? President Barack Obama: Yeah. You know, it\u2019s interesting. Physically, I feel probably as good as I\u2019ve ever felt. And I\u2019ve got as much energy as I ever did. But what you feel after eight years -- and I think you\u2019d feel this no matter what, but anytime you have a big transition, it gets magnified \u2013 is time passes. Your kids grow up. I think they more than anything are making me feel as if, you know, you want to squeeze everything you got every single day out of this thing. Because it passes quick. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re having trouble letting go? President Barack Obama: No. I am looking forward to getting out of the bubble. I am glad that I\u2019m leaving this place at a relatively young age, at 55. So I have the opportunity for a second maybe even a third act in a way that I think would be tougher if I were, you know, the age of some presidents when they left. There\u2019s some bittersweet feelings about leaving the people here. \u2018Cause even though all the team you assemble, you know, you\u2019re going to stay in touch with \u2018em, it\u2019s not the same, you know? The band kind of breaks up. And, I think I\u2019m the best president I\u2019ve ever been right now. And I think the team that is operating right now functions as well as any team that I\u2019ve had. And so, you know, there is a part of you that thinks, \u201cMan, we\u2019re pretty good at this stuff right now.\u201d And you hate to see that talent disperse. Steve Kroft: You going to have reunions? President Barack Obama: Well, not I don\u2019t think we\u2019re go have, like, T-shirts and, you know, all that stuff. That sounds kind of sad. And so my-- so many of my staff is young enough that they\u2019re going to do amazing things. And I\u2019m going to be helping them try to do them. So overall though, I have a deep appreciation for the wisdom of this guy right there, George Washington. It\u2019s good to get fresh legs in here. I think that it refreshes our democracy. It-- I think sustaining the pace over more than eight years is pretty tough. Steve Kroft: What are you going to do on the 21st when you wake up? I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going to be when you wake up, but you\u2019re going to wake up someplace where you\u2019re not president. President Barack Obama: Well, here\u2019s one thing is I\u2019m not setting my alarm. That, I\u2019m certain of. That I am absolutely positive of. I\u2019m going to spend time with Michelle. And, you know, we got some catching up to do. We\u2019ve both been busy. Steve Kroft: You\u2019re going to be spending your own money, right? President Barack Obama: Abs-- well, you know, the truth though is that we\u2019ve been-- Steve Kroft: Have you been spending your own-- when was the last time you-- President Barack Obama: I-- Steve Kroft: --spent your own money? President Barack Obama: Well, I will say this. You know, I mentioned how I\u2019ve got a pretty thick skin in this job. You\u2019ve got to have it. One thing that did kind of get under my craw sometimes was people talking as if when we went on vacation or-- Steve Kroft: Right, right, right, right. President Barack Obama: --you know, that people\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, spending taxpayer money.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cNo, no, I actually I\u2019m paying for all of this. The only thing I don\u2019t pay for is Secret Service and an airplane.\u201d Steve Kroft: And communications. President Barack Obama: And communications, \u2018cause I don\u2019t have any choice. But, you know, we buy our own toilet paper even here in the White House. Steve Kroft: Really? President Barack Obama: You know, we-- it\u2019s not free. I\u2019m-- I\u2019ve got a grocery bill at the end of every month. You know, our toothpaste, our, you know, our orange juice, that all gets paid. But I-- it is true that I don\u2019t carry my wallet that often. So I\u2019m going to have some catching up to do in terms of how day-to-day things operate.\u00a0 \u00a0 Steve Kroft: It\u2019s not unusual for a president to issue an observation, \u201cBeware of this. Be wary of that.\u201d What is the thing that concerns you most right now, leaving office, about the country? President Barack Obama: Making sure that our democracy stays healthy. And making sure that we maintain that sense of solidarity. Um, the thing that has disturbed me most about the Russian hacking episode is-- and the thing that surprised me most has not been the fact of Russian hacking, because Chinese, Russians, Iranians-- a lot of-- Steve Kroft: The United States-- President Barack Obama: The United-- well, the cyber world is full of information gathering, you know, propaganda, et cetera. I have been concerned about the degree to which, in some circles, you\u2019ve seen people suggest that Vladimir Putin has more credibility than the U.S. government. I think that\u2019s something new. And I think it\u2019s a measure of how the partisan divide has gotten so severe that people forget we\u2019re on the same team. President Barack Obama: We go into the hallway here\u2026 The president led us through a side door from the Oval Office into a short hallway and into his small private dining room. Here, the mementos were personal, far less formal.  Steve Kroft: All this stuff is coming with you? President Barack Obama: Absolutely. Well, not all of it. It-- I think-- Steve Kroft: Hard packing up? President Barack Obama: I think, this famous--  Steve Kroft: This is going to stay there, right? President Barack Obama: --painting of The Peacemakers, that goes with the territory.  Steve Kroft: How much stuff are you going to take with you? President Barack Obama: Not that much. I mean, you know, we got-- I got books, I got clothes, I got mementos like-- these that, you know, I cherish. We got some furniture that we purchased that, you know, we\u2019ll try to use in the new place.  Steve Kroft: Do you like it, the new house? President Barack Obama: It\u2019s a nice-- it\u2019s a nice home. I mean--  Steve Kroft: You\u2019ve been there--? President Barack Obama: Yeah. It\u2019ll-- it\u2019s temporary. And-- Steve Kroft: Two years? President Barack Obama: Yeah. But it feels like a home. You know, it\u2019s not crazy big but there\u2019s enough room for, you know, a treadmill and some workout equipment in the basement. The next day President Obama was back in Chicago where it all began to deliver his farewell address. Obama in farewell address: My fellow Americans, it has been the honor of my life to serve you. I won\u2019t stop. In fact, I will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my remaining days. Thank you. God bless you. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you. President Obama, in all the times we were with him, seemed to savor the challenge of an interview. For him, it was an intellectual workout, something on par with a pickup basketball game, complete with a little trash talk. There were never any restrictions on questions. No taboo topics. A year and half ago, there was a particularly contentious line of questioning about America\u2019s role in Syria. After it, we took a short break for a few sips of water.\u00a0 And when the cameras rolled again, the president was ready for more. President Obama: What else you got? Tonight, at last, we have no more questions. I\u2019m Steve Kroft. Next Sunday, here on CBS, the AFC Championship game. And we\u2019ll be back in two weeks with a brand new edition of 60 Minutes. Few journalists have achieved the impact and recognition that Steve Kroft's 60 Minutes work has generated for over two decades. Kroft delivered his first report for 60 Minutes in 1989.",

            "article_content": "The election of President Donald Trump, along with the GOP\u2019s success in keeping control of Congress and their big wins at the state level in recent years, have left Democrats without a clear leader. And until one emerges, the role of \u201cmost powerful Democrat\u201d will be a topic of some debate. Still, it\u2019s obvious that some Democrats have attempted to fill the void in various ways, including a couple who have formally retired from politics.\u00a0 Here are seven Democrats who could help\u00a0lead their party through the wilderness.\u00a0 Just 10 days before leaving office, former President Barack Obama returned to Chicago to deliver his farewell address in front of thousands of supporters, staffers and former volunteers. He ended the speech -- a defense of American democracy and a call to action against forces that may challenge it -- with the line that characterized his 2008 campaign, to cheers and tears from the audience: \u201cYes we can. Yes we did. Yes we can.\u201d It was proof of Obama\u2019s staying power both as a symbol for Democrats and as a voice in the party. The fact of the matter is, Obama left office with the highest approval ratings he\u2019d had in years: he remains immensely popular among Democrats, and likely will continue to do so. Combined with the inherent power former presidents have in influencing the political discussion, Obama could be a powerful voice against Mr. Trump. There were hints that he\u2019s willing to speak out when he deems it necessary: his statement in support of the protesters after Mr. Trump signed his travel ban, which said citizens like the protesters are the \u201cguardians of our democracy,\u201d indicated he is unlikely to stay silent when Mr. Trump takes things too far. Obama\u2019s next act is still unclear: it seems unlikely that he\u2019ll go the route of his predecessor, George W. Bush, and step back from public life almost entirely. And at 55, he\u2019s among the country\u2019s youngest ex-presidents, so he has plenty of time for his post-presidency. Kitesurfing is bound to get old.\u00a0 The most popular politician in America is also the leader of the Democrats\u2019 surging left wing. After his surprisingly strong run for the nomination of a party he is not even technically a member of, Sanders is now the most successful socialist politician in American history. He\u2019s also the one best-positioned to talk to the youth of the party, which is increasingly critical of capitalism and disdainful of the wealthy. At 75, it\u2019s unlikely Sanders will ever be the Democrats\u2019 pick for president. But that doesn\u2019t mean other aspirants won\u2019t be lining up to kiss his ring as we get closer to 2020. When New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, for example, recently unveiled his plan to eliminate tuition payments for low-income students at state universities, he asked the Vermont senator to co-headline the announcement. We don\u2019t normally associate septuagenarian socialists with energy and charisma, but if Democratic politics has one rock star right now, it\u2019s almost certainly Sanders. Hillary Clinton\u2019s failure to win the presidency damaged her party, but not Sanders, the man who his supporters would\u2019ve easily beaten Mr. Trump if he had only been given a chance. Sanders and his advocates say that they\u2019re the future of a new and uncompromisingly leftist Democratic Party. And right now, in the age of Trump, it\u2019s looking more and more like they might be right. The de facto leader of the Democratic Party is in an uncomfortable position. On the one hand, the liberal base is demanding he do everything possible to stop Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees. On the other, he has political realities to consider, like the fact that Republicans control both houses of Congress and the White House. But Schumer is nothing if not a strategic thinker, which is why he was the obvious candidate to take over following Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s retirement. Plus, Schumer has the benefit of knowing Mr. Trump better and longer than perhaps any politician in Washington \u2013 the two outer-borough New Yorkers have a longstanding friendship, and Mr. Trump has given Schumer plenty of cash over the years. Perhaps that\u2019s the kind of knowledge that can pay serious dividends at the negotiating table. Or not. Either way, Schumer\u2019s role as the leader of the opposition in the Senate means he\u2019s a force for both Republicans and Democrats to reckon with. The ex-VP still commands a lot of love and loyalty from the Democratic faithful, and his endorsement in intraparty contests will still be sought for years to come. For liberals who will always look back fondly on the halcyon days of the Obama administration, the attraction is even more powerful. \u201cUncle Joe\u201d was the loveable mascot of Democratic politics during some of the best year\u2019s of the party, and will remain beloved among it ranks for as long as he lives. Plus, Biden speaks the language of the demographic considered most responsible for declining Democratic fortunes: the white working class, which abandoned them in droves for Mr. Trump in 2016. That\u2019s because to many, Biden is a throwback to the golden age of liberalism, a time when unions were strong and filled with reliable Democratic voters. He\u2019s also arguably one of the few remaining examples of old-school politicians \u2013 ones who worked their way through state schools and remained middle class and plainspoken even as they ascended to the peak of power. They don\u2019t make \u2018em like Joe anymore, and they never will again. Plus, is there any Democratic politician, with the exception of Obama, who enjoys such broad support and affection within the party\u2019s fractious base? Biden can walk with kings but keep the common touch, gliding throughout the world as a senior statesman while still knowing how to talk to every group in the Democratic coalition. A utility player if there ever was one, expect Biden to be drafted to speak to everyone from African-Americans to Midwestern whites to northeastern millionaires in 2018 and 2020. They all know Joe, and they all like him. The Democratic base is consumed by anger, and one Minnesota senator has given them an acerbic and entertaining voice. Franken has been in Congress for nearly a decade, but he\u2019s eschewed the limelight until only recently. His breakout moment came during the hearings for President Trump\u2019s cabinet nominees, where he was quick to draw blood. Sen. Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, was embarrassed by Franken\u2019s questioning, which showed the Alabaman embellished his resume when it came to prosecuting civil rights cases. Betsy DeVos also came out damaged by Franken\u2019s questioning, which showed her to be somewhat ignorant in matters of education policy. And Tom Price, the nominee for health and human services secretary, was unprepared when Franken brought up his investments in Big Tobacco. All of this has lead to chatter that Franken, having finally shed the image of a comedian who plays at politics, might be a credible contender for the presidency in 2020. Franken says he\u2019s not interested \u2013 but then again, that\u2019s what presidential aspirants often say this far out from Election Day. Bernie Sanders may have finished the 2016 campaign as the newest hero of progressive Democrats, but Warren was the progressive icon who originally rose to prominence on a platform of anti-Wall Street, anti-income inequality frustration.  In addition to maintaining her sway with progressives, Warren has also presented herself as one of the parties most vicious Trump attack dog, delivering some of Democrats\u2019 most scathing comments on Mr. Trump throughout the campaign and making it clear since Election Day that she would oppose him at every turn. At a Women\u2019s March in Boston, she fired up the crowd: \u201cI\u2019m here to fight back.\u201d Still, even Warren has her limits among the party\u2019s progressive base. When she voted in committee for Ben Carson as secretary of housing and urban development -- just days after grilling him during his confirmation hearing -- she got major blowback from the left wing of the Democratic Party and found herself on defense with the progressives who normally adore her. There aren\u2019t many fresh faces on the Democratic scene after 2016, a relatively dismal year for Democrats at the ballot box that quite literally produced few major new Democratic officeholders. But of the newcomers, one stands out as a potential new powerful voice in the party: California\u2019s junior senator, Kamala Harris. Harris, formerly the attorney general of California, has long been considered a rising star in the Democratic Party and cemented that reputation by easily winning her Senate race in November. In the weeks since she\u2019s taken office, Harris has only bolstered her spot on lists of potential Democratic presidential candidates for 2020 and beyond. She has been a vocal and visible part of the opposition to the new president: she grilled Cabinet nominees on issues of LGBT discrimination and climate change, held a prime speaking slot at the Women\u2019s March on Washington and turned up in front of the White House the following weekend to protest Mr. Trump\u2019s travel ban.

            "article_content": "On Friday, Richard Cordray resigned as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) following a November 15 announcement that he would leave by the end of the month. Cordray, who is expected to run for governor of Ohio next year as a Democrat, said that he was entitled to appoint his successor, and picked his deputy Leandra English to lead the agency.  President Trump argues that Cordray doesn't have the authority to select his own successor, and has appointed Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney as the agency's interim chief. But English filed suit in federal court on Sunday, insisting that she is the legitimate director of the agency.  So now we have a situation where an exceptionally powerful federal bureaucracy has two different people claiming that they run it. It all sounds pretty absurd on the surface, but it's a fight with high stakes.  It was created in the wake of the 2008 economic crisis to protect consumers from predatory banks, lenders, and other financial bodies that could defraud people. The brainchild of now-Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was then an Obama White House aide, the CFPB is a product of the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed by Congress in the wake of the crisis.  The bureau overhauled the mortgage practices that were a factor in the financial crisis. It wrote simpler mortgage rules aiming to help consumers navigate the mortgage process, from selecting a loan through paying it back, created mortgage servicing rules geared toward helping protect home buyers, and it put in place more protections for those who get behind in their mortgage payments. Republicans, broadly speaking, have never been fans of the CFPB, which they see as too powerful, largely unaccountable, and perhaps unconstitutional. An independent agency, the CFPB gets its funding from the Federal Reserve, not through Congressional appropriations. And while the president can fire the agency's director, the Dodd-Frank Act stipulates that a dismissal can only be done for cause, meaning that Mr. Trump would have had a fight on his hands if he had just fired Cordray outright. Democrats argue that the agency has done a good job of protecting consumers and note that the agency has paid out some $12 billion in relief to defrauded consumers. They also say that Mulvaney, who once called the CFPB \"a joke\u2026in a sick, sad kind of way\" is not the person who should be running it.  That's what the White House is betting on, and the CFPB's own general counsel says that President Trump is entitled to appoint a vacancy due to powers granted to him by the Vacancies Act of 1988. Democrats like Warren counter that Dodd-Frank Act says that \"the Deputy Director . . . shall serve as acting Director in the absence or unavailability of the Director.\" In theory, that would mean that English is in charge, which is what the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, argued on Monday.\u00a0 The Dodd-Frank Act is clear: if there is a @CFPB Director vacancy, the Deputy Director becomes Acting Director. @realDonaldTrump can\u2019t override that. pic.twitter.com/r949ccaJAb Mulvaney showed up to the agency Monday morning and said he was now acting director of the bureau. English then sent an email to the CFPB staff identifying herself as acting director. \"[I]t has come to my attention that Ms. English has reached out to many of you this morning via email in an attempt to exercise certain duties of the Acting Director,\" Mulvaney wrote to agency officials in response to English's claim. \"This is unfortunate but, in the atmosphere of the day, probably not unexpected. \"Please disregard any instructions you receive from Ms. English in her presumed capacity as Acting Director,\" Mulvaney's memo continues. It then goes on to apologize to the agency's staff for the nature of Mulvaney's introduction, and invites them to come \"grab a donut\" in his office.  @MickMulvaneyOMB sitting in director's office. Already hard at work as acting director at cfpb. pic.twitter.com/I1fwo2SYap Later on Monday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said that Mulvaney had the \"full cooperation\" of the agency's staff. If all this sounds a bit farcical to you, well, that's because it is. Meanwhile, the agency appears to be largely paralyzed due to the leadership dispute and may soon be subjected to legal action from the business it regulates. A court decision on who is rightfully in charge of the agency might take several months, meaning that Democrats and Republicans could be fighting about this all the way up to next year's midterms.  Mulvaney, and for that matter whoever Mr. Trump's final appointee to the position is, will probably take a much narrower and more circumscribed approach to regulating than Cordray or English. Cordray, who was appointed to lead the agency despite a Republican filibuster, has won plaudits from progressives and consumer advocates, while at the same time drawing the ire of business interests.  Since Mr. Trump took office, Cordray has been busy issuing new and sweeping rules, such as one that prevents financial business from using arbitration clauses to sidestep class-action lawsuits. That rule was killed by Congress using a once-obscure law called the Congressional Review Act.  In October, Cordray took aim at payday lenders, which progressive groups have long argued are inherently predatory, with a rule that might drive many of them out of business. This muscular approach to oversight and regulation would likely be continued under English, his handpicked successor.  But if Mr. Trump gets his way, it's safe to expect that the CFPB will have a much smaller regulatory footprint in the future.\u00a0 At a press conference Monday afternoon, Mulvaney announced a hiring freeze at the agency as well as a 30-day pause in any new rules or regulations coming down the pipeline. Saying that \"elections have consequences for every agency,\" he also promised to run the bureau much differently than Cordray did.\u00a0 Mulvaney also called the bureau an \"awful example\" of a \"bureaucracy gone wrong,\" and said that he had not yet met English because she did not show up for work on Monday.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Millions of Americans own guns and may not even realize it. That is, they own stakes in the companies that make guns. That's because dozens of widely owned funds in 401(k) plans and other retirement and investment accounts own stock in publicly traded firearms manufacturers, including the makers of assault-style weapons often used in mass-shooting incidents. The shares appear in both actively managed funds and passive index investments. For instance, large holders of Sturm, Ruger & Co. (RGR) include the Growth Fund of America and Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund, Morningstar data shows. American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), owner of the Smith & Wesson brand, are held by the Vanguard Strategic Equity and Invesco Small-Cap Value funds. And Vista Outdoor (VSTO) appears among the holdings of the Fidelity Value and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index funds. About 35 percent of US stock funds include investments in a maker or retailer of guns and ammunition, which adds up to more than $17 billion spread across more than 2,000 funds, according to a tally by a nonprofit advocacy group called Goodbye Gun Stocks. The group also classifies retailers that sell firearms -- including Walmart (WMT), Cabela's (CAB) and Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) -- as gun stocks. The group's website allows investors to check whether their funds contain firearms-related stocks, then quickly determine how much of their own money is invested in them. (To find out which funds are available in a given company's retirement plan, check BrightScope.) Firearms manufacturers are best suited for private ownership so all of their holders know exactly what they own, said Roger Lee, a senior equity research analyst at investment manager Kirr Marbach & Co. in Columbus, Indiana, who follows firearms stocks, among other sectors. But as long as firearms companies are publicly traded, he said, and even though they often account for only a small portion of funds that invest in them, fund managers should proactively disclose those stakes. And perhaps, managers should avoid them altogether if their investors -- once they know where their money is going -- would be likely to object. \"A lot of individuals probably would be repulsed if they thought they were indirectly accountable or profiting from companies that are producing these weapons,\" said Lee, a hobbyist gun owner who has collected more than 20 firearms and goes shooting a few times a month. He described himself as a responsible gun owner who is \"pro-regulation.\" Firearms companies represent just one category of so-called \"sin\" stocks -- alongside the likes of alcohol and cigarette companies, casinos and sex-related industries -- which some investors have begun to shun. Lee suggests adding another group to those sin stocks: drug companies that get most of their revenue from highly addictive opioids. \"The biggest epidemic in America is in the portfolios of countless retirement funds,\" Lee said. \"It's a drug company, and people don't see it as a prescription pain-pill mill that ultimately creates a lot of drug addicts in America.\" But it's rare to find employer retirement plans that offer investors access to funds that focus on \"socially responsible\" options in part because there's no \"groundswell\" of requests for them, said Divam Mehta, president of Richmond, Virginia-based Mehta Financial Group. And if employees aren't asking, their companies probably aren't pushing the fund giants that administer retirement plans -- think Vanguard, Fidelity and American Funds -- to include portfolio options that filter out sin stocks. \"If you give an investor an option, I think they'll do it,\" Mehta said. \"But I think it has to be marketed in that way, and the awareness has to be there. I think a lot of investors don't realize it's possible to achieve a diversified portfolio and stick to socially responsible investing.\" In the fund industry, this approach to investing is known by the acronym ESG, representing the environmental, social and governance criteria fund managers utilize. Two big players offering socially responsible funds are Pax World and Calvert Funds, noted Mehta, who has built portfolios for clients using these funds' offerings. Another option for investors without access to ESG funds in their retirement accounts is to check individual funds or pick funds by asset class. Gun manufacturers typically fall in the mid-cap to small-cap category, Mehta said, so an index or exchange-traded fund tracking the large-cap S&P 500 is unlikely to contain firearms manufacturers. Even among companies that make guns, investors may want to consider more specific distinctions based on product lines, Lee suggested. For instance, two companies that sell full lines of AR-15-style firearms are the publicly traded Sturm, Ruger and American Outdoor Brands. On the other hand, Vista Outdoor's products are more specifically geared toward recreational hunters, Lee said. The California investment firm where Lee previously worked screened out gun stocks, in part because they made its investor base uneasy. His current firm, in the gun-friendly state of Indiana, owns shares of Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings (SPWH), a sporting-goods store that serves rural areas where hunting is popular. Gun companies and their stocks have struggled since the election of Donald Trump eased gun-owner concerns about the potential for tighter regulations. Sturm, Ruger's stock price is down about 20 percent on the year. The slack demand means better deals for gun owners like Lee, who landed a $75 rebate on a new handgun. He noted that firearms manufacturers view their offerings as \"a very high-end consumer discretionary product.\" The message? No matter where investors stand in America's contentious debate over guns, they should know what they're buying.",

            "article_content": "By Anthony Salvanto, Kabir Khanna, Jen De Pinto, Fred Backus The ranks of President Trump's strongest backers are a bit smaller today than when we last checked in with the Nation Tracker, as the weight of the FBI investigation appears to be taking a toll, and Americans' optimism and confidence in his presidency have slipped. Meanwhile, the ranks of his most ardent detractors have grown, as some who once said they were willing to give him a chance, or supported him conditionally, count themselves as opponents today. Those who do remain firmly behind the president today say it's partly because he is under fire, believing that Mr. Trump needs their support fighting \"the establishment\" now more than ever, and agreeing that he is indeed the subject of a political witch hunt and unfair coverage. The vast majority of these supporters take this recent round of controversy very personally. When people criticize Mr. Trump, they say, critics are also knocking \"people like me\" who support him, too. His opponents -- the staunchest of which have grown from 36 percent of the country to 40 percent -- pick descriptions of the president like \"impulsive\" and, increasingly, \"temperamental.\" They see a president whose missteps are of his own making, not politics. Yet even his most fervent opponents lament, to some degree, having a president tied up in controversy: that isn't their preferred way to halt his agenda. They'd mostly still prefer to have one who would reach out and compromise. Overall, just 37 percent of Americans approve of how Mr. Trump has handled matters involving the FBI investigation thus far, two-thirds do care about the issue at least some, and 60 percent say former FBI Director Comey should not have been fired. And 63 percent say there should be a special prosecutor. These numbers are all highly related to whether Americans support the president or not. On the whole, 85 percent of Americans do believe that the president discussed the FBI investigation in private meetings with Comey in some fashion, though fewer (48 percent) think he actively tried to stop the probe. The rest think he just mentioned it without trying to impede it. In either case, 79 percent of Americans believe that if there are tapes of those conversations, those ought to be turned over, and the feeling is similar about any possible memos, with 75 percent feeling Congress ought to see those if they exist. On those latter topics, supporters and opponents largely agree. If it is revealed that he did try to stop the FBI investigation, most Americans see that as a disqualification from office (58 percent) but unsurprisingly, those views are strongly tied to current support. In all, 79 percent of his backers, and 86 percent of his strongest supporters, say that wouldn't be serious enough to disqualify him. In fact, half of his strongest backers believe the president ought to have power to stop the investigation if he wants to. There are deep divisions over the implications of sharing intelligence with Russia. The president's supporters are more inclined to call this \"smart,\" not because they all see Russia is a friend but because they see Russia as also fighting terrorism, consistent with the president's arguments. If not, they label it harmless. His opponents label this a dangerous breach of security -- and \"dangerous\" is a word 59 percent of the nation also uses to describe Mr. Trump's actions as president, overall. Most Americans describe a president wrestling with problems of his own making -- more than half (51 percent) say his own missteps are the reason for the issues that have arisen, versus 40 percent who say it is driven by politics. But politically motivated actions are certainly what his supporters see. In the Nation Tracker, we've been following Americans in terms of their support for the president and what policies they want. Out of all his backers, we've been labeling the strongest segment the \"believers,\" and today they compose just 19 percent of the country, down from a high of 22 percent in February and 21 percent in March. Panelists for this study were re-interviewed, and we find that nearly one in five who used to be \"believers\" this winter have now become \"conditional\" supporters today (though they are still supporters). That's higher than the rate of conditional supporters who, feeling the president is unfairly under fire, became stronger supporters. They're holding firm for a president that 89 percent of them feel is facing more resistance from \"the establishment\" than his predecessors. More than three-quarters of them see political motivations behind the recent controversies and more than eight in 10 believe the president is subject to unfair coverage. They support him not only because they feel he needs their support now against the \"establishment\" but also because eight in ten feel he speaks for people like them, and that he \"respects the working class\" in ways others do not. (They do demographically tend to be the kinds of voters who helped swing the election for him, non-college graduates with relatively lower incomes.) The believers differ attitudinally from other groups today in important ways. They're the most likely to say Mr. Trump should have more power, in general, and most would prefer congressional Republicans to follow his lead. A majority -- 55 percent -- of them believe government and law enforcement officials should take an oath of loyalty to the Constitution and president, while 34 percent say the Constitution alone. Nine in 10 believe Comey should have been fired. But they do see a role for congressional oversight on matters of national security. Conditional supporters, another 22 percent of the country, have always been more transactional, looking for the president to deliver and largely on economic policy, and they still are; they still see him -- more than many other qualities -- as able to apply business skills to government. But they don't subscribe to the Mr. Trump vs. the establishment narrative at the same rate as believers, and are much more skeptical of the president. In the face of controversy, this is a group that still sides with him but is still looking for an agenda to be enacted, and is much more nervous about the state of things than believers are. Optimism has dropped precipitously for them, to 47 percent today from 66 percent in March. Four in 10 think these controversies could stop the agenda. They're different from believers in how they feel about the source of the controversies: they're less likely than believers to call the investigation into Russia ties a \"witch hunt\" as 56 percent of them do compared to 81 percent of the former; they're less likely to blame the media coverage (though many still do) and relatively more likely to blame what they see as Trump's own mis-steps. And -- this could end up being politically important \u2013 they're far less likely to think the Republicans in Congress should do what Mr. Trump wants. Eight in 10 of them would like to see congressional Republicans push back against Trump at least some of the time when appropriate or even just get tougher on him. Contrast that with 59 percent of believers who would prefer congressional Republicans just do what the president wants. However most of them still don't see a need for a Special Prosecutor and very few of them think the President tried to stop the FBI investigation. While Americans describing themselves as \"nervous\" about the Trump administration has ticked up only slightly overall, an increased feeling of nervousness among people we re-interviewed is associated with a decline in support for the Trump Administration today. And a loss of confidence with the Trump administration from March to now is associated with lesser overall support today. This is a group that doesn't support the president today but would consider doing so. But even the \"curious\" seem to be becoming less so. Their numbers are a bit smaller now, down to 19 percent of the country from 21 percent in March. Notably, we saw the relatively largest transfer of people out of this group than any of the others on re-interviewing, as many are no longer looking for a reason to support the president, shifting away from \"curious\" to now calling themselves strong opponents, period.  Those who remain seem to express some disconnect between a president they think could do well -- they still have relatively higher confidence in his ability to bring business skills to government, compared to resisters -- and what they're observing of late. To them, these controversies look like big obstacles, with two-thirds believing this will thwart his agenda. That's not necessarily what they wanted: one of the defining differences is that they are not motivated to oppose him, and by four-to-one they'd prefer a president making deals instead of caught up in controversy.  But, they report that he does make them feel nervous and they're pessimistic about his presidency -- 89 percent of them say he does not show good judgment, a criticism they share with resisters. They are also far more likely to urge oversight from Congress and to look for constraints on presidential power. They overwhelmingly disapprove of how he is handling the FBI investigation and the Russia allegations but they don't claim to care as much about it as resisters do. They do mainly call the investigation a critical matter, though, and three-quarters of them think it would be serious enough to disqualify him from office if the president is found to have impeded the investigation. Like resisters, they urge the Republican Congress to push back on Trump, not do what he wants. Foreign policy is still a relatively stronger suit for Trump among this group, as they like his approach to ISIS, Syria and North Korea more than they like his domestic policies (though even these don't find strong favor). But they also overwhelmingly call him temperamental and 75 percent of them call him \"dangerous.\" Also, 84 percent of them call him impulsive.  At 40 percent, resisters \u2013 people who are strong against Trump, period \u2013 are the largest segment of the country. Across the board, they express the most negative attitudes toward Mr. Trump and his administration's recent actions. Resisters express nervousness and pessimism, also describing Trump as dangerous, impulsive, and temperamental. Nearly all (99 percent) disapprove of his handling of the Russia investigation, and more than eight in 10 say the investigation is a critical matter of national security. They suspect that Mr. Trump tried to stop the FBI from investigating him, an act that nine in 10 feel would disqualify him from office. And they overwhelming favor congressional oversight and placing more limits on the president's power. There has been an uptick in the number of resisters since March, driven mostly by people who were formerly curious. People who changed from curious to resister are more pessimistic than people who remain curious. These new resisters are also much less confident in Trump's abilities and his telling the truth, and more concerned about alleged ties between Trump and Russia and critical of Trump's handling of the FBI investigation. One place the curious and resisters tend to agree is that they would mostly like to see Mr. Trump make deals with Democrats and compromise with opponents to get things done. Resisters, most of whom are Democrats, are also more likely to say that Democratic control of Congress would provide a needed check on President Trump, rather than gridlock or bad policies. On that political front, if Democrats are looking to run as a check on the president in 2018, that case hasn't been made with a majority yet: among all Americans, as among registered voters, half think it would be better with them in control of Congress, and half just think it would bring gridlock.

            "article_content": "NEW YORK --\u00a0A blustery late-season storm clobbered the Northeast with sleet and heavy snow Tuesday, crippling much of the Washington-to-Boston corridor after a stretch of unusually mild winter weather that had people thinking spring was already here.\u00a0 The National Weather Service downgraded its blizzard warning Tuesday morning for the New York City area, where schools and businesses had been closed. The powerful nor\u2019easter unloaded 1 to 2 feet of snow in places, grounded more than 6,000 flights, knocked out power to nearly a quarter-million customers from Virginia northward and, by the time it reached Massachusetts, had turned into a blizzard, with the wind gusting at nearly hurricane force over 70 mph along the coast and waves crashing over the seawalls. Amtrak canceled or modified service up and down the Northeast Corridor, with train service suspended between New York City and Boston on Tuesday morning. Modified service will resume on Wednesday. Above-ground portions of the New York subway system were shut down, but underground trains continued operating.\u00a0 In the nation\u2019s capital, the federal government announced a three-hour delayed arrival for non-emergency employees, with an option to take the day off or telecommute. While people mostly heeded dire warnings to stay home and off the roads, police said a 16-year-old girl was killed when she lost control of her car on a snowy road and hit a tree in Gilford, New Hampshire. What may turn out to be the biggest snowstorm of the season struck just six days before the official arrival of spring, which for many can\u2019t come soon enough. For the latest developments on the storm, refresh this page throughout the day. CBS News transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave reports that airlines cancelled a total of 6,178 flights today, bringing the week\u2019s total to 8,745 flight cancellations, impacting about 500,000 travelers. Airlines expect to resume operations Wednesday morning and will likely be fully operational by Thursday. Up to 85% of flights to and from New York and Boston were canceled Tuesday, as well as half the flights to and from Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia. Airlines have cancelled 906 flights on Wednesday, mostly in the morning. That number is expected to rise slightly as airlines finalize their recovery efforts. On the CBS \u201cEvening News,\u201d correspondents reported on the storm\u2019s impact across the Northeast. David Begnaud reported that state troopers and the National Guard braved two feet of snow in Pennsylvania to escort a 23-month old child in need of a heart transplant a hospital. In Albany, New York, last week it was nearly 60 degrees. Raymond O\u2019Keefe with the National Weather Service measured more than 12 inches of snow on Tuesday. \u201cOur record is 46 inches in one storm. We\u2019re going to get 15 to 20,\u201d O\u2019Keefe said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy winter: warm, 70 degrees last month. Now we\u2019re looking at 1.5 to 2 feet of snow here in mid-March.\u201d In Boston, CBS News correspondent Don Dahler reported the snow piled up over a foot deep in some areas before shifting to sleet and rain, raising concerns for an icy Wednesday commute after the roads freeze over. Winds of up to 70 mph blew the snow sideways at times, making travel challenging for those on foot and on the road. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said some areas were seeing snowfall of 2 and 4 inches per hour, and waves up to 10 feet high crashed ashore in some parts of the state. Most people heeded the warnings to stay off the roads as more than 800 plows worked to clear the streets. One worker was gearing up for a 36-hour shift. \u201cYou just plowed it, and you see it all covered again,\u201d Jim Manley said. \u201cYou get five feet up the street, and it\u2019s all covered.\u201d The sticky, wet snow weighed heavily on trees and power lines, causing over 62,000 households to lose electricity. In Sea Bright, New Jersey, CBS News correspondent Anna Werner reported the snow quickly turned to freezing rain, with wind gusts of up to 60 mph kicking up the surf. Storm surge from the Shrewsbury River was the region\u2019s biggest concern, and flooding brought water up to residents\u2019 doorsteps. Several rescues were reported in Atlantic City, New Jersey, but the coastline that was battered four and a half years ago by Hurricane Sandy fared far better than expected in this storm. Officials have confirmed at least two fatalities resulting from Tuesday\u2019s storm, CBS News\u2019 Michelle Bar\u00f3n reports. A man in Longmeadow, Massachusetts, died in a collision involving a train and a snow plow, according to the Longmeadow Fire Department. In Gilfrod, New Hampshire, a 16-year-old girl died after losing control of her vehicle, state police said. Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has lifted a statewide travel ban in Connecticut, CBS New York reports. Malloy said state agencies will be open for business Wednesday, crediting the travel ban with helping crews remove snow on state roads.\u00a0 The Democrat says Tuesday\u2019s ban, which ran from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m., also helped keep accidents to a minimum. He says there were only 38 accidents, which he called \u201ca big success.\u201d Malloy thanked most Connecticut residents for adhering to the ban, noting only a few tickets were issued. While the ban has been lifted, Malloy is urging residents to stay off the roads.  Malloy says Metro-North Railroad will resume service from 6 p.m. to 1 p.m. Tuesday night. He says there will be a \u201csomewhat limited schedule\u201d on Wednesday. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says aboveground subway service and some Metro-North commuter rail service shut down by the snowstorm will be restored soon. Cuomo says Metro-North will resume limited hourly service at 6 p.m. Tuesday until 11 p.m. Full service will resume Wednesday.\u00a0 The National Park Service says the snow didn\u2019t appear to do damage to Washington\u2019s cherry blossoms but upcoming cold temperatures are concerning. The National Weather Service says Washington\u2019s low temperature is forecast to be around 22 degrees Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\u00a0 The snowstorm could reduce the nation\u2019s gross domestic product this quarter by as much as 0.2 percent, according to Oxford Economics.\u00a0Read more from CBS News MoneyWatch. Workers at a Maryland zoo say they stayed there all night and through a power outage to keep the animals safe in the storm hitting the East Coast. Nick Lacovara owns the small Plumpton Park Zoo in Rising Sun, Maryland. He said by phone Tuesday zookeepers and maintenance workers shoveled snow and ice to keep paths clear for animals to reach water and food. When the power went out about 6 a.m. staff members set up portable generators to keep water flowing. Power was back shortly after noon. Lacovara says tigers and some other animals aren\u2019t bothered by the cold. The Bactrian camels have two humps and are from the Gobi Desert, a cold desert. A 23-month-old in need of a heart transplant has been escorted by snowplows and state police troopers through a heavy snowstorm from one hospital to another in northeastern Pennsylvania. Gov. Tom Wolf says the Tuesday afternoon trip was made between hospitals in East Stroudsburg and Danville, some 80 miles apart. The governor says the child made the trip safely. The storm dropped more than 20 inches of snow and sleet in parts of eastern Pennsylvania, and snow was continuing to fall Tuesday afternoon. Twitter user Ryan Gothling filmed an overturned plow/salt spreader truck in New York. this is how bad the snow is. That's an overturned Plow/salt truck. pic.twitter.com/UdysBJtifR Boston officials say the city\u2019s public schools will be closed again Wednesday. The Boston Herald\u2019s Jeff Walsh uploaded video of a tractor trailer slide and spin on the Zakim Bridge during the winter storm. Another video angle of the accident was posted to Twitter: An incident involving tractor trailer on Zakim Bridge. Fortunately no injuries. @MassDOT advises everyone to stay off roads if possible. pic.twitter.com/ohTORM0NUr CBS Boston reports that officials declared a blizzard in the city of Worcester on Tuesday afternoon. A blizzard is defined as: Tens of thousands of homes and businesses in Massachusetts lost power by midday as snow and high winds pummeled the state, CBS Boston reports. The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency says at least 62,000 customers were without electricity at its peak. The agency noted a huge jump in the number of outages around noon, mostly in Worcester, where there was a substation breaker problem, and Plymouth, where a transmission line issue was to blame. There are also some outages in Medford and Everett. Police say a 16-year-old girl has been killed in a traffic accident in New Hampshire after losing control of her car on a snowy road and hitting a tree. A late-winter storm featuring snow, ice and high winds has caused dangerous driving conditions from the mid-Atlantic to the Northeast. New Hampshire State police say the accident happened about 7 a.m. Tuesday in Gilford. The girl was transported to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Her identity was being withheld until her family could be notified. Around the region, officials have urged people to stay off the roads. Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy imposed a travel ban on state roads but says he expects to end it later Tuesday as the storm winds down. Strong winds have toppled a wind turbine at a Rhode Island beach. Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo says the wind knocked over the turbine at Salty Brine Beach in Narragansett on Tuesday. It\u2019s owned by the state Department of Environmental Management. A photo of the turbine posted by the town\u2019s emergency management agency showed the turbine\u2019s metal base twisted and bent over the snow-covered beach. The snow might have stopped for the moment but the winds are very dangerous!  They took down this wind turbine in Point Judith.  #RIwx pic.twitter.com/82S4VqU6Bv Raimondo says no one was hurt and the state will fix it once the storm is over. Winds in the area are gusting up to 55 mph. Approximately 215,000 customers were without power Tuesday from Virginia to New England. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio held a briefing on the city\u2019s storm response and says that a state of emergency will stay in effect until midnight, describing the storm as \u201cvery dangerous as we get into the late afternoon and early evening hours.\u201d De Blasio warned that temperatures will be frigid Tuesday evening and that there\u2019s a risk of refreezing, making streets and sidewalks even more hazardous.\u00a0  The mayor said at least 96 percent of city streets have been plowed at least once. He thanked residents for using mass transit as that allowed sanitation officials to do their job.  Schools will be open on Wednesday. \u201cThe situation now is under control and we are certain that we will be in a position to open schools effectively tomorrow,\u201d de Blasio said. The storm that\u2019s pounding parts of the Northeast has dropped almost 2 feet of snow in Pennsylvania\u2019s Pocono Mountains and the northern reaches of New Jersey, yet it didn\u2019t perform to forecast expectations in New York City, the rest of New Jersey and Philadelphia. That\u2019s because the line between a rainy wintry mix and snow ended up farther west than anticipated. The rain-snow line on Tuesday was a 50-mile wide swath where cold Arctic air from the north and west clashed with warm moist air from the Atlantic Ocean. Private meteorologist Ryan Maue of Weather Bell Analytics says it\u2019s tough to forecast the location of the line, because it undulates and computers models only have a few data points over a width of 50 miles. He also says much of the storm is over the Atlantic Ocean, where fewer observations can be made. Maue and other experts say missing where the rain-snow line winds up doesn\u2019t make the blizzard forecast a bust. The winter storm pelting the northeast with snow, sleet and high winds is disrupting some local elections in New Hampshire.  Tuesday is New Hampshire\u2019s traditional Town Meeting Day, when voters in more than 100 communities elect boards of selectman, library trustees and other local positions.  A number of towns rescheduled their elections, but others have stayed open, on schedule.  Republican Gov. Chris Sununu had said those who rescheduled their elections risked lawsuits alleging voter suppression, but also said that given differing opinions, the state isn\u2019t in a position to mandate that the towns stay open.  Sununu\u2019s town, Newfields, postponed its elections until Tuesday, March 21, saying the safety of voters and election workers is \u201cparamount.\u201d  Broadway producers in New York City have decided to keep theaters open Tuesday night for the hardy folks willing to brave snow and sleet from a late-season storm hitting the Northeast.  More than two dozen shows will play as scheduled, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d \u2018\u2019Dear Evan Hansen\u201d and \u201cWaitress.\u201d  Charlotte St. Martin, president of\u00a0The Broadway League\u00a0, says that for visitors who can\u2019t get home, it\u2019s a great time to see a show.  Tuesday\u2019s storm was bringing less snow than forecast to New York City, but had caused more than 5,000 flight cancellations, and was hitting areas of upstate New York and elsewhere hard.  The last time Broadway was shuttered was in January 2016, when New York was hit with a one-day record of 26.6 inches of snow.  Parts of Atlantic City and other towns in southern New Jersey are dealing with tidal flooding from the nor\u2019easter.  A homeowner posted\u00a0video\u00a0on Twitter of water streaming down the block, and one major roadway was closed because of the flooding.  Up to he second step already ! Getting deep #ArizonaAve #AtlanticCity @_Hetrick @Route_40 @JSHurricaneNews @ACPlanningDept @ACPressSkeldon pic.twitter.com/xroagLpjUG The tide reached 7.8 feet in Atlantic City on Tuesday morning, just short of the 8-foot threshold that can lead to major flooding.  More than 35,000 customers are without power in New Jersey because of the storm. More than 100,000 customers in other states stretching down to Virginia also are without electricity.  Southern New Jersey did not get much snow, but a blizzard warning is in effect in the northwest part of the state.  Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy called it a \u201cgood day to make brownies ... or read a book,\u201d and stay off the roads.  The winter storm hitting the Northeast is forecast to dump as much as 2 feet of snow on parts of Connecticut on Tuesday, with possibly more in higher elevations.  Malloy says most people seem to be following a travel ban he imposed in the state. All flights to and from Bradley International Airport north of Hartford have been canceled, and transit bus service has been suspended statewide.  State police and the National Guard were ready to help stranded motorists, and utility companies were prepared to respond to power outages.  More than 120,000 customers had lost power from Virginia to New Jersey. Virginia and Maryland had the largest numbers of outages reported.  Parts of Atlantic City and other towns in southern New Jersey are dealing with tidal flooding from the winter nor\u2019easter. CBS News correspondent Anna Werner reports storm surge is a major concern in coastal communities that were battered by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.  One homeowner posted video on Twitter of water streaming down their block and one major roadway was closed due to the flooding.    \tThe tide reached 7.8 feet in Atlantic City Tuesday morning, just short of the 8-foot threshold that can lead to major flooding.\u00a0  Residents were keeping an eye on high tide between 9:15 a.m. and 10:15 a.m.  Route 322 in West Atlantic City was shut down, as were some smaller streets around the area.    \tThe flooding comes as more than 10,000 customers are without power in New Jersey. Wind gusts of more than 30 mph were reported, whipping rain, sleet and snow.    \tSouthern New Jersey did not get much snow from the storm, but a blizzard warning is in effect in the northwest part of the state.  More than 10,000 customers are without power in New Jersey as a winter nor\u2019easter blasts parts of the state with wind gusts of more than 30 mph and whipping rain, sleet and snow.  Both Atlantic City Electric and PSE&G were reporting more than 5,000 without power Tuesday morning.  The National Weather Service says warm air on Tuesday has brought about a rapid change of the precipitation to sleet and rain south of Interstate 195.  A blizzard warning is in effect in the northwest part of the state, where forecasters say there is still the potential for a foot or more snow.  Driving conditions are slippery, but traffic is lighter than usual.  Nearly 100,000 customers are without power in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, as a late-winter storm brings a mix of snow and sleet with strong winds.  Dominion Power reports more than 50,000 customers in the dark in Virginia on Tuesday morning, with more than 40,000 of those outages in the Richmond area.  Maryland officials report about 30,000 outages. Thousands more were reported in Delaware, New Jersey and around Philadelphia.  Blizzard warnings have been issued for parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont. The blizzard warning was lifted a short time ago for New York City as the forecast shifted there to a mix of snow and sleet with up to 8 inches of accumulation.  The storm is expected to dump 12 to 18 inches of snow along a large swath of the region. Parts of New England could see snow totals of 18 inches to 2 \u00bd feet.  U.S. airlines have scrapped about 5,400 flights Tuesday as some of the nation\u2019s busiest airports were snowed in. Tracking service FlightAware.com says Tuesday\u2019s cancellations bring the total for the week to around 7,740 flights.\u00a0  Southwest Airlines, which carries more domestic passengers than any other airline, doesn\u2019t expect to operate any flights Tuesday at 14 airports stretching from Washington to Portland, Maine. Southwest cancelled about 900 flights, while American Airlines, JetBlue Airways and United Airlines each cancelled more than 500.  An additional 650 flights have been cancelled for Wednesday, a number that FlightAware expects to rise as the airlines scramble to resume operations.\u00a0  Attorney generals in New York and Pennsylvania have issued a warning about price-gouging during the snowstorm.  Eric Schneiderman in New York says consumers should contact his office about \u201cexcessive increases\u201d in the price of goods and services. Examples include food, water, gas, generators, hotels and transportation.  The price-gouging law also could apply to snow removal and equipment, salt and contractor services for storm-related damage.  Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro also alerted consumers and businesses about potential scams, urging people to report any \u201csuspicious activity\u201d about home repairs, snow plowing, government assistance programs and fraudulent disaster-related fundraising to his office\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection.  Hundreds of school districts from Buffalo to New York City have cancelled classes and authorities are advising people to stay off the roads as a nor\u2019easter starts to pummel the Northeast.  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has declared a state of emergency Tuesday for all of New York\u2019s 62 counties, including New York City\u2019s five boroughs. The Democrat also directed non-essential state employees to stay home from work.  The National Weather Service says the storm will drop more than a foot of snow across much of the upstate region, with some areas getting up to 18 inches and higher elevations in the lower Hudson Valley expected to get 2 feet or more.  Blizzard warnings have been issued for much of the region south of Albany, where high winds could produce whiteout conditions  The National Weather Service says the dividing line between snow and a wintry mix from a nor\u2019easter pushing through the southern New Jersey-Pennsylvania region has moved farther inland, cutting down the anticipated snow accumulation, but increasing the chance of icing.  NWS Meteorologist Sarah Johnson, in Mount Holly, New Jersey, says the dividing line between snow and a mix of snow, sleet and rain has pushed west, from the Jersey coast into Philadelphia. She says that lowers anticipated snow totals, but increases the threat of icing from sleet and freezing rain along the Interstate 95 corridor.  While the snow totals might be lower, Johnson warns that New Jersey shore areas can still expect strong winds, with gusts between 50 and 55 mph. The I-95 corridor could get wind gusts of up to 40 mph.  Rain, sleet and snow are sweeping across New Jersey as a late-winter storm slows the morning commute.  State government offices are closed Tuesday and non-essential employees were told to stay home after Republican Gov. Chris Christie declared a state of emergency. Many schools are closed.  Plows are on the highways and the speed limit is restricted to 45 mph on the Garden State Parkway between Cape May and Brick Township.  NJ Transit has suspended bus service and all trains, except for the Atlantic City Rail Line, are operating on a weekend schedule.  A blizzard warning is in effect, basically north of Interstate 195. Forecasters say 18 to 24 inches of snow are possible. A winter storm warning covers other portions of the state, save for coastal south Jersey.  A late-season snowstorm has prompted the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to allow a 3-hour delayed arrival for non-emergency employees at federal offices in and around the nation\u2019s capital.  OPM also announced early Tuesday that non-emergency federal employees also have the option to take unscheduled leave or to conduct unscheduled telework.  For those non-emergency workers headed to offices, the agency told them on its website that they \u201cshould plan to arrive for work no more than three hours later than they would be expected to arrive.\u201d  The agency added that emergency federal employees in the Washington, D.C., area are expected to report on time unless otherwise directed by their agencies. Emergency and telework-ready employees should follow their agency\u2019s policies, the office added.  A winter storm expected to dump several inches of snow on Delaware made an impact even before it arrived: Delaware lawmakers decided to scrap plans to reconvene a key budget committee hearing Tuesday after a weekslong break.  In Newark, Delaware, authorities declared a snow emergency effective early Tuesday, ordering residents and businesses on snow emergency routes to remove all vehicles from the street to avoid being towed. The city also announced a two-hour delayed opening for city offices.  Forecasters expect between 8 and 12 inches of snow in some areas of Delaware, while areas near the Atlantic seaboard faced a threat of coastal flooding.  The snow threat in the Northeast is causing college basketball teams to alter their travel plans.  Teams chasing a college basketball title are contending with an unexpected wrinkle that\u2019s making last-minute travel plans difficult -- a fierce storm bearing down on the Northeast that could dump up to two feet of snow in some places.  \u201cWe are closely tracking the weather and working with our travel partners and teams in the tournament to ensure the safety of our student-athletes, coaches, administrators, officials and fans,\u201d the NCAA said in a statement.  Villanova, top overall seed in the men\u2019s NCAA Tournament, left Philadelphia on Monday afternoon for Buffalo, New York, to get ahead of the storm.  There is less of a chance that the women\u2019s tournament would be affected. UConn is the only Northeast team hosting and they play Saturday, giving teams more time to arrive in Connecticut.  U.S. airlines canceled thousands of flights ahead of the storm. Teams in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s NCAA Tournaments have chartered flights so any backlog on commercial planes shouldn\u2019t be a problem. ",

A day after the GOP unveiled its plan promising middle-class relief, the House's top tax-writer, Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, released a revised version of the bill that would impose a new, lower-inflation \"chained CPI\" adjustment for tax brackets immediately instead of in 2023. That means more income would be taxed at higher rates over time \u2014 and less generous tax cuts for individuals and families. The change, posted on the website of the Ways and Means Committee, reduces the value of the tax cuts for ordinary Americans by $89 billion over 10 years compared with the legislation released with fanfare Thursday. As wages rise, middle-class taxpayers would have more of their income taxed at the 25 percent rate instead of at 12 percent, for instance. \"The bill's like a dead fish: The more it hangs out in the sunlight, the stinkier it gets,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer pronounced after word of Brady's change. \"The more people learn about this bill, the less they're going to like it.\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi blasted the tax bill unveiled by House Republicans as \"a terrible assault on opportunity for the middle class\" and said her GOP colleagues are \"taking American people for suckers.\"\u00a0 The change to the plan frees up money for Brady, the committee's chairman, to use to address concerns by lawmakers when changing the bill further next week. The Ways and Means panel begins work on Monday, a final bill-writing process expected to take four days. Brady on Friday called it \"a challenge of a lifetime legislatively.\" President Trump and the Republicans are driving to push through a major tax-cutting bill this year to secure a legislative accomplishment, following their stinging failure to overturn and replace the Obama health care law. The Republicans, facing increasing pressure to produce a marquee legislative victory before next year's elections, are promoting their tax plan as a spark for economic growth and a boon to the stressed middle class. Brady, in a statement releasing the revised bill, stressed \"pro-growth tax reform that will deliver more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks for people across our country.\" While Mr. Trump and House Republican leaders stand united behind the plan, rank-and-file GOP lawmakers are divided and complaining about its potential blow to homeowners and the loss of a prized deduction that especially hits high-tax states. And Mr. Trump is pressuring Republicans to repeal a health-care law penalty in the tax rewrite, a step that Brady indicated is politically problematic. Some of the GOP lawmakers agree. Brady said Friday the president had spoken to him twice by phone and once in person, imploring him to scrap the so-called individual mandate that requires Americans to obtain health insurance or face a penalty. \"The president feels quite strongly about including this at some step,\" Brady said in an interview with Politico. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that repealing the individual mandate would save $416 billion over a decade. That's because without it, fewer people would enroll in Medicaid or buy federally subsidized coverage on insurance exchanges. The money represents a tempting revenue source for GOP tax writers whose plan for extensive tax cuts would add an estimated $1.5 trillion to the nation's debt over 10 years. An influential conservative lawmaker, Rep. Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, said Friday that repealing the health care mandate needs to be part of the tax bill. He said he believes a majority of Republicans in the House share that view. Trump even tweeted on Wednesday: \"Wouldn't it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts for the Middle Class.\" But Brady pointed out the Senate has been unable to muster enough votes for any health care legislation. \"There are pros and cons to this. Importing health care into a tax reform debate does have consequences,\" he said. And Rep. Tom Cole, R-Oklahoma, said, \"I think the attitude is let's not mix up health care with this.\" Republicans have set an ambitious timetable for the first revamp of the nation's tax code in three decades, one that would touch virtually all Americans and the economy's every corner, mingling sharply lower rates for corporations and reduced personal taxes for many with fewer deductions for home-buyers and families with steep medical bills. Under the plan, the bulk of the tax cuts go to businesses instead of individuals, according to a budget watchdog group. The Washington-based Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says corporations and other businesses get tax cuts of about $1 trillion, with the rest for individuals and people inheriting multimillion-dollar estates. Democrats kept up their rhetorical battle against the plan, which was crafted by White House officials and Republican leaders in Congress in closed-door sessions over much of this year. \"Get real. Don't tell the middle class this is for them,\" House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi admonished Republicans as she spoke in a press conference. \"You've set a banquet for the wealthy and corporate America and thrown a few crumbs\" to the middle class. \"It's really making suckers of the American people.\" The tax plan also would increase the national debt, a problem for some Republicans.",

            "article_content": "President Trump is entering 2018 with his first major legislative victory under his belt, having signed into law his party's massive tax reform bill just before Christmas. But some are warning that Mr. Trump faces steep political consequences if his core voters don't reap the benefits of a growing economy. J.D. Vance, the author the heralded 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" says many Americans in the middle of the country will become \"politically frustrated\" and have their \"hopes dashed\" if Mr. Trump doesn't deliver on his promises to increase wages and spur economic growth.\u00a0 \"One of the things I really worry about is that if you don't see middle class wage growth, if you don't see the economy in certain areas of the country, the middle part of the country, starting to come back in the same way that it's doing especially well, let's say, in California or New York, then people are going to become politically frustrated,\" Vance told CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. The following is a transcript of the interview with Vance airing Sunday, Dec. 31, 2017, on \"Face the Nation.\" MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 We sat down recently with J.D. Vance, author of \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" Vance's book has been credited with identifying the so-called \"forgotten Americans\" who helped carry Donald Trump to his unexpected victory. A year in to the Trump administration, Vance warns those voters might well be disappointed if the president's rhetoric doesn't match reality.\u00a0 JD VANCE:\u00a0 I started writing the book back in 2013. And, of course, no one at that time, certainly not me, knew what we were going to see with the nomination and then, of course, the election of Donald Trump. I definitely thought that when the book was coming out, and this was June of 2016, hard to believe it's been that long, I thought that a lot of folks would be trying to ask questions about who the Trump voter was. And, of course, that's a little bit about what my book is about. I don't mention Donald Trump, but I certainly talk a lot about people-- people living in a certain part of the country, people from a certain demographic segment who did overwhelmingly support the president, both in the nominating contest but also, of course, in the general election. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 For that community that you write about in the book and that you grew up in, what do you think those larger truths are that they heard that he spoke to in ways they hadn't heard before? JD VANCE:\u00a0 Well, I think one-- one the most important larger truths that he spoke to is the importance of jobs in the life of the community. If you think about Republican rhetoric, let's say, during the campaign of Mitt Romney, very focused on the noble entrepreneur. Very focused on the job creator, but not so much on the worker. And if you think of- of the rhetoric of- of modern Democrats, it's often so focused on government that people don't accept-- I think a lot of those-- a lot of folks on the left don't appreciate that-- that people don't want a handout. They don't want government support and they don't, from the right, want people to talk about the noble entrepreneur. What they want is-- is people to recognize the dignity of working people.\u00a0 And I think that what was genius about the politics of Trump's campaign is that he focused on workers and he focused on jobs. It wasn't about the wealthy entrepreneur with a private jet. It wasn't about a government handout. It was about the folks in the middle. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 In the conversation about the tax bill, as an example -- JD VANCE:\u00a0 Sure. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 -- he doesn't talk about supply side economics, he doesn't talk about any theory at all -- JD VANCE:\u00a0 You know, I think it's very effective.\u00a0 When the president talks about tax reform, he talks about the people who will benefit. He talks about American jobs. He talks about the fact that we're going to be taking money that's overseas and bringing it back to the United States so that it will employ American workers. I think that focus again on the American working and middle class is- is-is to me the most thoughtful and, in some ways, the most genius part of Trump's approach to politics. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 And I will tell you, having attended more than 75 Trump rallies, there were times when I would laugh to myself when he would say, \"Every dream you've ever dreamed is going to come true. And America's going to get back winning again.\" I thought, \"Oh, come on, this-- even by political standards, this is sort of cotton candy-- JD VANCE:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 -- taken to the maximum level.\" And yet, having read your book, it occurs to me the concept of putting winning or victory central to it, to people who maybe feel like they've either become losers or forgotten, that was much more powerful than I thought -- JD VANCE:\u00a0 Mm-hm. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 -- or imagined at the time. Do you think that's possible? JD VANCE:\u00a0 Yeah. Well, I think that- that sense of loss is really important.\u00a0 The idea that 30 or 40 years ago, things were really going well and now they've started to disintegrate. Not just our work life, but our family life and a lot of other issues on top of that. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 Do you think there is a danger for Trump going forward, the president going forward, and these voters, that his rhetoric and their expectations may never match? JD VANCE:\u00a0 I think that that's certainly a concern. It's a political concern for the Trump administration. But it's a concern for Americans. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 It's a ground level concern. JD VANCE:\u00a0 Absolutely.\u00a0 It's-- it's a concern for a lot of folks who really do expect things to get a whole lot better.\u00a0 One of the things I really worry about is that if you don't see middle class wage growth, if you don't see the economy in certain areas of the country, the middle part of the country, starting to come back in the same way that it's doing especially well, let's say, in California or New York, then people are going to become politically frustrated. But more importantly, they're going to have a lot of hopes dashed. This sense that maybe this is the moment, this is the electoral moment where a lot of our fortunes turn around, that-- that's going to disappear.\u00a0 And consequently, folks are going to be pretty upset about it. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 And part of your next phase of life is to deal with this. JD VANCE:\u00a0 Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.\u00a0 One-- one of the things that I'm working on with Steve Case is this Rise of the Rest initiative that I'm-- I'm pretty passionate about.\u00a0 If you look at where the net job growth comes, it comes from high growth startup companies. And unfortunately, you don't see a lot of high growth startup companies outside of California and New York and Boston, Massachusetts. And so what we're trying to do is in some ways democratize access to capital, invest in areas that don't get as much-- as much entrepreneurial investing, and hopefully, start to create some of those new twenty-first century jobs in places that don't see that job creation. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 And in my travels, I've seen a little bit of that in Des Moines, Iowa. JD VANCE:\u00a0 Sure. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 I've seen a little bit of that in Omaha, Nebraska.\u00a0 JD VANCE:\u00a0 Yep.\u00a0 MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 It's not as if it doesn't exist in -- JD VANCE:\u00a0 Exactly. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 -- \"flyover country,\" but you want to accelerate? JD VANCE:\u00a0 Yeah, exactly. It certainly exists. It's-it's -- there-- there are certainly really exciting pockets of entrepreneurship all across the country-- MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 Usually linked to a university of some kind. JD VANCE:\u00a0 Exactly. You know, universities provide high quality talent. They provide intellectual property necessary for folks to get their businesses off the ground.\u00a0 But you still don't see nearly as much investment in these areas even though you see pockets of hope, right? So the statistic I throw out is 50% of venture capital goes to California.\u00a0 Most of the rest of it goes to New York and Massachusetts. That means there's 47 states (sic) fighting over a very small amount of the type of investment that creates really high quality, long term, durable jobs. And so if you can rearrange that, if you can create more entrepreneurship and more investment in some of these areas, are you going to fix all the problems I wrote about in Hillbilly Elegy? No. But you will start to create some more high quality job growth. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 And then this brings us back to some of the embedded behavioral problems you write about in Hillbilly Elegy and those are going to have to change even if this capital arrives. JD VANCE:\u00a0 Yes. That's-- that's absolutely right. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 You speak quite candidly -- JD VANCE:\u00a0 Sure.\u00a0 MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 -- about laziness and people who think they work, but don't actually work. And that they're part of this equation. And that reckoning is going to have to occur, number one, and won't be easy to. JD VANCE:\u00a0 Yeah, absolutely. I mean, look. You-- you go to a town like Middletown, Ohio where some people are struggling to find a job, but then there are people who had a good job and lost it not because the economy was bad, but because they made mistakes. You see both types of people. And I think we have to recognize that there are these twin impulses that exist. There is a need for more economic growth, for more job growth. But there is a need in some people for them to recognize that they have a role in making these problems better. And we can't-- we can't ignore that.\u00a0 The issue that's really, really concerning is that you have eight million prime age men who have dropped out of the labor force, folks who aren't even looking for work. You can create job growth all day, but unless you start to do the things that bring those labor force dropouts back into the job market, you're not going to solve the problems I wrote about in the book. MAJOR GARRETT:\u00a0 JD, thanks so much for your time. JD VANCE:\u00a0 Thanks, Major. MAJOR GARRETT: And we'll be right back.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON--House Republicans on Thursday unveiled a tax cut plan that slashes the corporate tax rate, lowers taxes for most Americans but limits a cherished deduction for homeowners as President Trump and the GOP seek to deliver on the first tax revamp in three decades. The proposal would add $1.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade as Republicans largely abandoned fiscal discipline in a desire to secure a legislative achievement for Mr. Trump and score a political win ahead of next year's midterm elections. Mr. Trump promised in a statement that his administration \"will work tirelessly to make good on our promise to the working people who built our nation and deliver historic tax cuts and reforms - the rocket fuel our economy needs to soar higher than ever before.\" Middle-income families would pay less, thanks to doubling of the standard deduction and an increase in the child tax credit. Wealthy Americans, like Mr. Trump, would benefit from the repeal of the alternative minimum tax and phase-out of the estate tax. Republicans calculate that a family of four with a median $60,000 income would receive a tax cut of almost $1,200. However, many two-income, upper middle class families would pay more after being bumped into a higher tax bracket and losing a valuable deduction on state income taxes. \"Today is the day. We are introducing legislation that will cut your taxes & make the entire system more simple. This will be a game-changer,\" Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said on Twitter. Today is the day. We are introducing legislation that will cut your taxes & make the entire system more simple. This will be a game-changer. The proposal would leave intact the existing rules on 401(k) retirement accounts and the ability of Americans to contribute up to $18,000 into the accounts tax-deferred. But the plan would limit the widely used deduction for mortgage interest to new home loans of $500,000 or less, a sharp reduction from the current $1 million cap. The plan also limits the deductibility of local property taxes to $10,000 while eliminating the deduction for state income taxes, which has generated significant opposition from Republicans in high-tax states such as New York and New Jersey. The tax-writing Ways and Means Committee will work on finalizing the proposal next week, and the GOP's ambitious timetable to get a bill to Mr. Trump by Christmas faces numerous roadblocks. The proposal caused anxiety for some House Republicans and drew criticism from a few in the Senate, which is intent on writing its own bill. Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-New York, announced his opposition on Twitter: \"I am a NO to House #TaxReform bill in its current form. A lot of good aspects, but its (sic) not there yet.\" I am a NO to House #TaxReform bill in its current form. A lot of good aspects, but its not there yet https://t.co/Y4iwSkzsPk Rep. Dan Donovan, R-New York, said he still had concerns about the state and local tax deduction, and planned to meet with leadership. \"We're going to look at all of this to see how it all plays out,\" he told reporters as he emerged from the GOP caucus. The plan would shrink the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with respective rates of 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. The tax system would be simplified, and most people would be able to file their returns on a postcard-sized form. The plan sets a 25 percent tax rate starting at $90,000 for married couples, with a 35 percent rate beginning to bite at $260,000 - which means many upper-income families whose top rate is 33 percent would face higher taxes. Individuals making $500,000 and couples earning $1 million would face the current Clinton-era top rate of 39.6 percent. The plan slashes the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, a demand of Mr. Trump. It also repeals the inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates, a big break for the wealthy. \"There are a lot of people still in our conference who are anxious to see exactly how this plays out with growth in the economy, what the long term deficit and debt situation turns out to be,\" said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark. The child tax credit would be increased from $1,000 to $1,600, though the $4,050 per child exemption would be repealed. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, tweeted an objection: \"House #TaxReform plan is only starting point. But $600 #ChildTaxCredit increase doesn't achieve our & potus goal of helping working families.\" House #TaxReform plan is only starting point.But $600 #ChildTaxCredit increase doesn\u2019t achieve our & @potus goal of helping working families The legislation is a longstanding goal for Capitol Hill Republicans who see a once-in-a-generation opportunity to clean up an inefficient, loophole-cluttered tax code. The plan calls for nearly doubling the standard deduction used by most average Americans to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for families, and increasing the per-child tax credit. On net, it could mean tax increases for many upper middle-income families. Republicans and Mr. Trump argue that sharply cutting tax rates for businesses improves U.S. economic competitiveness. For the wealthiest earners, the tax writers raised the minimum level of income to $1 million for couples or families from the current $470,000 - a change that would reduce tax revenue. Democrats have repeatedly complained the plan was too favorable to business and the wealthy, and contradicted Mr. Trump's rhetoric of bringing tax relief and economic benefit to the stressed middle class. \"What we are seeing today is a plan that exacerbates the unfairness and inequality in our tax code,\" said top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York. \"To pay for all the tax giveaways in their bill, the Republicans are likely to make it worse for the middle class - not help them but hurt them.\" While the plan's unveiling will be hailed as a win by the Trump administration,\u00a0according to a new CBS News poll, providing sweeping tax cuts are not a priority for everyone, including many Republicans. Seven in 10 Americans think the president and Congress should address other issues before passing a tax cut and reform bill, and only a slim majority of Republicans see the issue as top priority.",

            "article_content": "Even as the world\u2019s economies have expanded, their riches are increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few -- so much so that the richest 8 billionaires today hold as much wealth as the poorest half of humanity.\u00a0 That statistic comes from the charity Oxfam, which will present its report on widening inequality at the World Economic Forum annual summit, which kicks off on January 17 in Davos, Switzerland. While the event is attended by the world\u2019s top business executives, policy makers and academics, the forum often focuses on issues touching on economic justice, such as income inequality. This year\u2019s forum theme, for instance, is \u201cresponsive and responsible leadership.\u201d Oxfam said it didn\u2019t name the richest 8 billionaires in its report because its goal is to call attention to the political and economic mechanics that are creating widening inequality. Still, the 8 billionaires are those at the top of the Forbes\u2019 billionaire list, many of whom have pledged to spend large portions of their fortunes on charity.\u00a0 Yet the problem goes deeper than that, Oxfam argues, since the rich-get-richer phenomenon is creating a feedback loop, where the richest have more resources to spend on creating favorable outcomes, such as lower taxation for the wealthy or lobbyists who can help sway lawmakers.\u00a0 \u201cIt puts in in stark terms the biblical proportions of the economic health of the world, where 8 people have as much economic power as 3.6 billion people,\u201d said Gawain Kripke, the director of policy and research at Oxfam American. \u201cThere is a moral frame to this: is it right, that so much economic power adhere to those few individuals? Is our economy working right if this is what is happening? Is it moral that so many people struggle when so much wealth is available?\u201d The incomes of the poorest people increased a mere $65 between 1988 to 2011, or about an additional $3 per year, the Oxfam report found. Yet the incomes of the richest 10 percent increased 182 times as much, putting an additional $11,800 in their pockets.\u00a0 The research echoes recent findings from economists Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, who in December published research that examined how Americans experienced the economic expansion since the 1970s.\u00a0 Roughly 117 million American adults are living on income that has stagnated at $16,200 per year before taxes and transfer payments, they found. At the same time, the richest 1 percent have enjoyed growing income levels.\u00a0 Their conclusion: the bottom half of the U.S. population has been \u201cshut off from economic growth for over 40 years.\u201d Along with widening inequality has come a sense of anger and unfairness, which is credited with helping Donald Trump win the presidential election in November. His populist rhetoric, which includes blaming immigrants for the middle class\u2019 economic problems as well as trade competition from China and Mexico, reflects a worldwide phenomenon, Kripke said.\u00a0 The populist rhetoric \u201cincludes a critique that we share: the economy isn\u2019t working well, and it\u2019s not delivering benefits to working and middle class incomes, and incomes are stagnating there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t share the diagnosis of the problem, and the solution set which includes being xenophobic isn\u2019t going to help the economy, as far as we can tell.\u201d Along those lines, Kripke said he believes Mr. Trump\u2019s tax and economic proposals are likely to exacerbate economic inequality rather than reduce it. An analysis of Mr. Trump\u2019s tax plan by the Tax Policy Center found that middle-class families would receive tax cuts of about 2 percent, while the richest 1 percent would see a tax reduction of 13.5 percent Meanwhile, 8 million families including many single-parent households would pay more. Instead, governments should be designed for the bottom 99 percent of income earners, Oxfam argues. In the charity\u2019s view, that means governments should listen equally to its citizens, not just the richest, and create progressive tax systems that increase rates on the very wealthy and puts a stop to tax dodges.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the inequality trend isn\u2019t projected to end anytime soon. During the next two decades, 500 people will leave $2.1 trillion in wealth to their heirs, or more than the GDP of India. Oxfam projects that if inequality continues, the world may see its first trillionaire in 25 years.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0\u2014 Buffeted by seething differences, members of a key House panel are digging into work on the sweeping GOP tax plan that President Donald Trump and Republicans are counting on to protect their majorities in elections a year from now. The Ways and Means Committee started debating the proposed legislation on Monday with nearly eight hours of heated argument and accusations. For majority Republicans, the plan would bring needed tax relief to the middle class, kick-start the lagging economy and create jobs. For the Democrats, it's a tax-cut bounty for big corporations and the wealthy, and a ham-fisted elimination of benefits relied on by middle-class and low-income people. Late in the day, the panel approved late changes to the bill that were proposed by its chairman, Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas. The revision restored the tax exemption for employees receiving child care benefits from their companies, but also put new requirements on a tax credit used by working people of modest means. The vote for Brady's amendment was 24-16 along party lines. That pattern is likely to hold for votes on other possible GOP amendments through the next three days and on the panel's passage of the bill. The changes were the first set of revisions to a nearly-$6 trillion plan for the first major revamp of the U.S. tax system in 30 years. Republicans aim to get the complex GOP tax legislation introduced by Thursday and through Congress and to Trump's desk by Christmas. Trump made overhauling the tax system a campaign pledge and an economic promise. Committee Democrats repeatedly lodged objections to the bill, especially its limits on prized deductions for homeowners and its repeal of the child adoption credit and the deduction for medical expenses Democrats criticized new, tighter requirements in Brady's amendment for access to the earned income tax credit, including stricter documenting of children and their ages. They insisted it's a valued tax break for working people of modest income that provides an incentive to remain employed. \"We're not talking about fraud here,\" insisted Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J. \"We're zeroing in on fraud that doesn't exist.\" Republicans focused on findings by Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that the bill would lower taxes across all income levels over the next several years. \"Clearly this is helping real people. It's helping teachers, it's helping students, it's helping struggling families that are living paycheck to paycheck,\" said GOP Rep. Erik Paulsen of Minnesota. Democrats returned repeatedly to a section of the same analysis showing taxes would actually go up beginning in 2023 for some 38 million taxpayers, or families making $20,000 to $40,000 a year. The committee's top Democrat, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, said the bill \"puts the well-connected first while forcing millions of American families to watch while their taxes go up.\" He and other Democrats complained that Republicans crafted it in private without their input. At stake is whether the GOP will succeed in passing the most sweeping rewrite of the tax code in decades, which would be a major achievement for congressional Republicans and Trump after a year largely devoid of legislative wins. Looking ahead to 2018 midterms, Democrats and Republicans are both trying to win the debate over who best looks out for middle-class Americans. The legislation would add $1.5 trillion to an already ballooning national debt as it delivers a major tax cut to corporations and repeals the estate tax, which would benefit a tiny percentage of the wealthiest families in the country. It would also simplify the loophole-ridden tax code by collapsing today's seven personal income tax brackets into four. And it would nearly double the standard deduction used by people who don't itemize, and increase the child tax credit, an element championed by first daughter Ivanka Trump. \"It's about making America's economy stronger than ever by delivering more jobs, fairer taxes and bigger paychecks across the nation,\" said Brady. After embarrassing failures to make good on years of promises to repeal \"Obamacare,\" the tax bill is enthusiastically backed by Trump, House GOP leaders and many rank-and-file Republicans. They promise a simpler IRS code, a more globally competitive business tax structure, and tax cuts for the middle class and families with children. But there's considerable trepidation as well. In addition to the overall increases in later years for lower-income Americans, many earners in the upper-middle class, especially those from high-tax states, are facing tax increases. That's because the measure would no longer permit taxpayers to deduct state income taxes from their federal taxes. Powerful lobbyists are fighting to protect favored deductions, while a few well-financed interest groups, including the National Association of Homebuilders, have already vowed to oppose the legislation. The homebuilders group has voiced concerns over Republicans' decision to lower the mortgage interest deduction from $1 million to $500,000.",

            "article_content": "President Trump kicked off his holiday weekend at Mar-a-Lago Friday night at a dinner where he told friends, \"You all just got a lot richer,\" referencing the sweeping tax overhaul he signed into law hours earlier. Mr. Trump directed those comments to friends dining nearby at the exclusive club -- including to two friends at a table near the president's who described the remark to CBS News -- as he began his final days of his first year in office in what has become known as the \"Winter White House.\" The president has spent many weekends of his presidency so far at the \"Winter White House,\" where initiation fees cost $200,000, annual dues cost $14,000, and some of the most affluent members of society have the opportunity to interact with the president in a setting while many Americans cannot. This weekend, the president arrived after signing the most consequential legislation, and arguably, the greatest achievement, of his presidency thus far. For months, the White House and congressional Republicans have looked to tackle tax reform, a feat some critics deemed too challenging after Republicans' failure to find a compromise on health care. But on Wednesday, the Senate and House, in that order, passed what Mr. Trump has deemed the \"biggest in history\" tax cut and reform bill. The president and White House have emphasized repeatedly that the tax legislation is targeted as a tax break for the middle class. And, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, 80 percent of Americans will pay less in taxes next year, and less than 5 percent will see their taxes go up less than $10. CBS News had a tax professional assess the taxes of three families, and found they will all go down under the new law. On Saturday when asked for comment, the White House reiterated the benefit of the new law to the middle class. But critics point out that some aspects of the GOP tax overhaul -- such as the doubling of the cap for the estate tax break and lowering of corporate and S-corporation taxes -- disproportionately benefit the most affluent Americans. The president has said the tax bill is \"not good\" for him personally, although that statement is difficult to assess when he has declined to release his tax returns. The president himself on Sept. 13 -- long before the bill was finalized -- said the wealthy would not benefit from the GOP tax overhaul. \"The rich will not be gaining at all with this plan. We are looking for the middle class and we are looking for jobs -- jobs being the economy,\" Mr. Trump said.\u00a0 Still, the tax overhaul is a legislative victory for the president, as he completes his first year in office and ends out the year at Mar-a-Lago.\u00a0 Mr. Trump spent some of Saturday golfing with friends and pro golfers Jim Herman, Daniel Berger, Justin Thomas and his father at Trump International Golf Club.\u00a0 On Saturday, the president also took to Twitter to defend Republicans' performance in congressional races, and to criticize FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who is expected to retire early next year.\u00a0 \"How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin' James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife's campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?\" Mr. Trump tweeted after his return from golfing. How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin\u2019 James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife\u2019s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation? \"FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!\" the president said in another tweet. FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!! Mr. Trump will spend the Christmas holiday at Mar-a-Lago, with family. On Christmas Eve, according to the president's schedule, he will participate in a video teleconference with members of the military, something he also did at Thanksgiving. Upon his return to Washington, the president faces a busy 2018. Mr. Trump has said he hopes to tackle infrastructure\u00a0funding, an issue on which he believes he can garner Democratic support. \"Infrastructure is by far the easiest. People want it -- Republicans and Democrats. We're going to have tremendous Democrat support on infrastructure as you know. I could've started with infrastructure -- I actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road. So we'll be having that done pretty quickly,\" Mr. Trump said at the White House Friday when he signed the tax overhaul. But not everything on the legislative agenda will likely be easy for the president or his party. The short-term spending bill Congress passed before leaving for the holidays expires on Jan. 19, at which point the House and Senate will need to agree on a new, more comprehensive spending package. Congress will also have to decide what to do about those affected by the president's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects some young people who came to the U.S. illegally as children. There is also debate as to whether Congress will attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare again, after more than one failed attempt earlier this year. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, has also said he wants to tackle entitlement reform -- in a midterm election year nonetheless -- while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has dismissed that as a priority.

            "article_content": "Generous tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans would be delivered in a sweeping overhaul of the tax laws, under a new agreement crafted by Republicans in Congress. Middle- and low-income families would receive smaller tax cuts, though President Donald Trump and Republican leaders have billed the package as a huge benefit for the middle class. The agreement reached Wednesday by House and Senate GOP leaders also calls for scrapping a major tax requirement of the \"Obamacare\" health law, a step toward the ultimate GOP goal of unraveling the law. The agreement combines key elements of separate tax bills recently passed by the House and Senate, striking compromises on some of them. The Republicans are pushing to deliver final legislation to Trump before Christmas as the first major legislative accomplishment of his presidency. At the White House, Trump was eager to receive it. \"The cynical voices that opposed tax cuts grow smaller and weaker, and the American people grow stronger, he said. \"This is for people of middle income, this is for companies that are going to create jobs. This is for very, very special people, the great people of America.\" Looking to counter concerns that the Republican tax plan will primarily benefit the rich, U.S. President Donald Trump is delivering closing arguments in favor of the tax overhaul that is working its way through Congress.\u00a0 The business tax cuts would be permanent, but reductions for individuals would expire after a decade \u2014 saving money to comply with Senate budget rules. In all, the bill would cut taxes by about $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, adding billions to the nation's mounting debt. The legislation, still being finalized, would cut the top tax rate for the wealthiest earners \u2014 Trump among them \u2014 from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, slash the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and allow homeowners to deduct interest only on the first $750,000 of a new mortgage. The top tax rate currently applies to income above $470,000 for married couples, though lawmakers are reworking the tax brackets. The standard deduction would be nearly doubled, to $24,000 for married couples. Details of the agreement were described by Republican senators and congressional aides. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss private negotiations. \"It's not my vision of the perfect, but again, this is definitely going to be a strong pro-growth tax package,\" said Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. Republicans view passage of the legislation as a political imperative, proving to voters they can govern as the GOP fights to hold onto its majorities in the House and Senate in next year's elections. Republicans say they expect the package to increase economic growth, generating additional tax revenue and lessening the hit to the $20 trillion budget deficit. Independent economists aren't as optimistic. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Wednesday that she and her Fed colleagues, who set interest rate policy, expect a \"modest lift\" to economic growth from the tax package. Negotiators have removed several controversial provisions from the tax bill, including one that would have eliminated the deduction for interest on student loans and another deduction for medical expenses, said two congressional aides. Also, the bill would no longer start taxing graduate-school tuition waivers, the aides said. The tax bill would scale back the deduction for state and local taxes, allowing families to deduct only up to a total of $10,000 in property and income taxes. The deduction is especially important to residents of high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California. Business owners who report business income on their personal tax returns would be able to deduct 20 percent of that income. The bill would repeal the mandate that most Americans get health insurance, a provision of the 2010 health care law. Republicans suffered a humiliating defeat this past summer when they were unable to dismantle the health care law after seven years of promises. Scrapping the individual mandate would provide them with more than $300 billion for deeper tax cuts while also undermining the Obama law. Senate leaders plan to vote on the package next Tuesday. If it passes, the House would vote next. \"Let's not waver now \u2014 let's not give in to the Washington status quo \u2014 not when tax reform is so close,\" Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, said at the start of the joint House-Senate conference committee's first public meeting. The committee is charged with blending the tax bills passed by the House and Senate, though Republicans have done all their negotiations behind closed doors. Full details will be unveiled by the end of the week, Brady said. Democrats, who haven't been included in any substantive talks on the bill, have assailed it as unfairly tilted in favor of business and the wealthy. \"This is the ultimate betrayal of the middle class,\" Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, one of the Democratic conferees, charged at the meeting. Once the plan is signed into law, workers could start seeing changes in the amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks early next year, lawmakers said \u2014 though taxpayers won't file their 2018 returns until the following year. The IRS said in a statement Wednesday that taxpayers could begin seeing less money withheld from their paychecks \"as early as February.\" The agency said it was taking initial steps to prepare withholding guidance for employers, which it expects to issue in January. Corporate tax cuts would take effect in January, allowing businesses to immediately write off the full cost of capital investments.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON - The congressman who heads the House tax-writing panel isn't ruling out changes to the 401(k) retirement program to raise revenue for tax cuts, despite President Donald Trump's fresh promise that the savings plan used by tens of millions of Americans will be untouched. The president appeared to bolster that pledge Wednesday, saying he moved swiftly to end speculation that the tax-deferred savings program may be changed because it's vital for middle-class retirement security. But he went on to muddy the waters, when asked about Rep. Kevin Brady's statements that a change to 401(k)s could still be considered. \"Maybe it is, and maybe we'll use that as negotiating,\" Mr. Trump said during an impromptu news conference as he left the White House for a trip to Texas. \"But trust me ... there are certain elements of deals you don't want to negotiate with ... and Kevin knows it, and I think Kevin Brady is fantastic, but he knows how important 401(k)s are.\" Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said earlier Wednesday he's discussing the issue with Mr. Trump, who had earlier shot down the possibility of changes. And a senior Republican senator signaled he would vote for a tax bill even if it crimped 401(k) tax benefits. With 55 million U.S. workers holding some $5 trillion in their 401(k) accounts, the plans have become a touchstone of retirement security for the middle class. Republican lawmakers have been considering changes to the 401(k) structure, such as limiting the amount of tax-deferred contributions employees can make, as a way to help finance tax cuts. Asked specifically if the retirement program was no longer a possible target, Brady said, \"We're working very closely with the president.\" \"We think, in tax reform, we can create incentives for Americans to save more and save sooner, which can help them,\" said Brady. \"So we are exploring a number of ideas in those areas. ... We are continuing discussions with the president, all focused on saving more, saving sooner.\" Brady's counterpart in the Senate, Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah, also indicated possible changes to 401(k)s remain on the table. \"I'm open to looking at anything,\" he said. Hatch, who heads the Senate Finance Committee, said he didn't have a personal view on it. Another senior member of the panel, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, went further. He indicated he would vote for a tax bill that reduced 401(k) tax benefits if the overall legislation brought the needed tax overhaul and cuts. \"We've got to have tax reform, and I can't fall on the sword for one issue,\" Grassley told Iowa reporters on a call. Noting disarray among Republicans, Rep. Richard Neal, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said, \"To do tax reform, you need money. And right now, even as we speak, they appear to be going wobbly on some of the issues they've raised with great certainty in previous weeks.\" While retaining the possibility of changing 401(k)s, Brady also said he continues to seek a compromise with rebellious GOP lawmakers from high-tax states over the Republican tax plan's proposed elimination of the federal deduction for state and local taxes. \"I do expect to reach an agreement with our high-tax [state] lawmakers,\" Brady, R-Texas, told reporters at a Christian Science Monitor breakfast. \"It's a work in progress. We're making good progress.\" One compromise being considered, to avoid repealing the state-local deduction altogether, would cap it at a single taxpayer's adjusted gross income of $400,000 and $800,000 for a married couple. Opposition in the House has threatened the enactment of an ambitious overhaul of the U.S. tax system that Republicans hold essential to retaining their majority in next year's elections. Republicans are scrambling to find new revenue sources to pay for anticipated tax cuts exceeding $1 trillion. The deduction for state and local taxes is a widely popular break used by some 44 million Americans, especially in high-tax, Democratic-leaning states like New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California. Trump administration officials and the congressional Republican leaders who crafted the tax overhaul plan eye the estimated $1.3 trillion in lost revenue over 10 years that the state-local tax deduction costs the government. They want to recoup it to help pay for the tax cuts proposed in the far-reaching, nearly $6 trillion plan. The GOP plan calls for steep tax cuts for corporations and promised reductions for middle-income taxpayers, a doubling of the standard deduction used by most Americans, shrinking the number of tax brackets from seven to three or four and the repeal of inheritance taxes on multimillion-dollar estates. The child tax credit would be increased, and the tax system would be simplified. Crucial details of the plan have yet to be worked out. Employees' earnings from defined-contribution retirement plans such as 401(k)s aren't taxed until withdrawn during retirement, and pay-ins by both employers and employees also receive tax-deferred status. That cost the government $82.7 billion in lost revenue in the budget year ending Sept. 30, 2016 -- a potentially juicy target for Republican tax-cutters.",

Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, said Sunday that if bombshell allegations against Republican candidate for Senate, Roy Moore of Alabama, are true, \"there's no doubt that he should step aside, and not for the party, but for the American people.\" \"Certainly, the allegations are very, very strong. The denial was not as strong as the allegations,\" Scott said on \"Face the Nation.\" \"We have to find a way to restore trust and confidence in our elected officials, in our government. And this goes in the wrong direction,\" he said. CBS News' John Dickerson asked Scott what his reaction is to some supporters in Alabama -- Republicans -- who have said that even if the claims are true, they still support Moore. \"The reality of it is that the ripple effect on the Republican Party is yet to be determined,\" Scott said. Scott said that now the voters of Alabama will act as \"judge and the jury.\"\u00a0 \"They will have an opportunity to weigh in very clearly and decisively and very shortly,\" he added.\u00a0 Moore has since called the allegations \"completely false and misleading.\" They were first detailed in The Washington Post, which reported that Moore had initiated sexual contact with Leigh Corfman when she was 14 and he was 32 years old.\u00a0 Three other women told the Post in recent weeks, the report said, that Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s, working at the district attorney's office. He gave some of them alcohol -- at a time when the legal drinking age was 19. Speaking to Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity on his radio show on Friday, Moore specifically denied the detailed allegations by Corfman, who says Moore undressed her, moved his hand over her bra and guided her hand over his underwear. Moore claimed he does not even know her. \"I don't know Miss Corfman from anybody,\" Moore said, calling the accusations \"politically motivated.\" Since the Post's report, a number of top Republicans have called for Moore to step down ahead of next month's special election. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has dropped out\u00a0of its joint fundraising agreement\u00a0with Moore's campaign. Scott said that the Republican Party now needs to solve problems from a policy standpoint like focusing on tax reform.\u00a0 \"The truth of the matter is we ought to be a party focused on principles. And we should govern according to those principles. And when we find ourselves across ways with those principles, it's difficult for the American people to understand what direction we want to take them,\" said Scott.\u00a0 When asked if there was \"total certainty\" about every middle-class American getting a tax cut as a result from the GOP's plan, Scott would only say that the legislations are \"at place where the vast majority of taxpayers will see a tax cut.\" \"Every single bracket will have lower taxes. The reality of it is that, if you define middle income, middle America, as $73,000, because it's the average income per household in the country, that average household will see their taxes go down by $1,500.\" He added, \"The real question is, when we define the middle class around $250,000 or $300,000, which is in the top 5% of income in the country, you do have some times where 80% of the taxpayers see their taxes go down. Single folks, like myself, may see their taxes go up in some instances based on itemization versus doubling the standard deduction and using it.\" Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have pledged to overhaul the nation's complex tax code. To slash taxes, they say they'll curb a web of expensive deductions and credits to allow more revenue to flow to the government. Problem is, they're likely to run into a wall of resistance from people and groups drawn together by a singular warning: Don't touch my deduction. Major cherished tax breaks \u2014 from deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations to incentives for 401(k) contributions \u2014 have deep-pocketed supporters and lobbyists who are sure to fight to preserve those benefits. They add up to hundreds of billions of dollars in lost potential revenue that could otherwise go to rebuilding roads and bridges or social programs or even to help finance broader tax cuts for people and companies. \"On every single item, there's a group out there ready to battle,\" says Thomas Cooke, a professor and tax expert at Georgetown University. This makes the outlook thorny for a tax rewrite effort this fall, a Trump priority that Republicans consider a political imperative looking ahead to next year's midterm elections. The collapse of GOP health care legislation raises the stakes for taxes, with Mr. Trump's team talking about action by year's end. The president and the GOP agree on the broad goals: Simplifying the tax code, lowering the rate for corporations from the current 15-35 percent range, and bringing relief for the middle class. But details have to be filled in. \"First, we need a tax code that is simple, fair and easy to understand,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday at a rally in Missouri. \"That means getting rid of the loopholes and complexity that primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans and special interests.\" Among the seemingly unassailable benefits, the most cherished may well be the deduction of interest paid on mortgages. Touted as a pillar in the promotion of homeownership, the benefit cost the government an estimated $77 billion in the budget year that ended last Sept. 30, according to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. The benefit allows homeowners to deduct up to $1 million in interest payments on a primary (and a secondary) residence. It is fiercely defended by the National Association of Realtors, which spent $64.8 million on lobbying on various issues last year including the mortgage deduction, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Roughly 28 million Americans deduct mortgage interest from their income taxes, with the biggest concentrations in the high housing-cost states of California, New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Maryland, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. House Republicans say they've got a more efficient way to encourage home buying. Under their plan, the standard deduction would be increased from the current $12,600 for married couples filing jointly, for example, to $24,000. They argue that a majority of homeowners would no longer choose to itemize deductions and claim the mortgage-interest benefit. They'd be better off using the bigger standard deduction. Another possibility is halving the mortgage deduction to $500,000. That would surely set up a pitched battle. Other highly popular benefits: \u2014Employees' earnings from defined-contribution retirement plans such as 401(k)s aren't taxed until retirement; pay-ins by both employers and employees also receive tax-preferred status. That cost $82.7 billion in the most recent budget year. Among the ideas circulating among some Republicans is reversing that by taxing investment earnings upfront, not upon retirement; or reducing the limits on pre-tax contributions. With about 55 million U.S. workers holding some $5 trillion in their 401(k) accounts, the plans have become a touchstone of retirement security for the middle class. A coalition of groups representing employers, consumers and the financial industry recently expressed concern to the powerful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. With lawmakers looking for revenue sources to offset prospective tax cuts, \"Any changes to the retirement system made solely for short-term budgetary gains, and not for policy reasons, could hurt Americans' long-term retirement security,\" the Save Our Savings coalition said in a letter to Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. \u2014Deductions for donations to charitable, religious and other nonprofit organizations. Estimated cost: $41.5 billion. Americans are generous, House Republicans note, and charitable giving should be encouraged with a tax incentive. But only 25 percent of taxpayers benefit from the deduction because the rest don't itemize. The solution is to make the charitable deduction more efficient by simplifying taxpayers' compliance and record-keeping, the Republican plan says. Under the plan, all itemized deductions would be eliminated except for two: mortgage interest and charitable donations. \u2014Tax-free employer-paid health insurance premiums and other medical expenses, including long-term care insurance, clocking in at $143.8 billion. Employees aren't taxed on the benefits, while employers can deduct them as a business expense. \u2014Tax credit for children under age 17, $55 billion. An individual can claim a $1,000 credit for each qualifying child. The credit starts phasing out for single filers earning over $75,000 a year and for joint filers earning over $110,000. Some lawmakers have proposed increasing the credit to $2,500, by combining the exemption for dependents and the child care credit. Organizations including the Child Poverty Action Group and the National Association for the Education of Young Children have stressed the importance of using tax policy to help children and families. They express concern that such benefits for children could get caught up in the Republicans' drive to eliminate \"special interest\" loopholes in the tax overhaul. Rep. Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who heads the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, acknowledged in a recent speech, \"The fight will get tough.\"",

            "article_content": "Time now for a round of Questions-and-Answers with Elizabeth Warren, the senior senator of Massachusetts.   Our Chip Reid found her at a favorite spot: \u00a0 When Senator Elizabeth Warren is home in Cambridge, Mass., there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll find her at the Summer Shack. \u201cWe love this place,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is like all the places down on the water but are usually only there in the summer. This one you can come to 365 days a year.\u201d The staff at this local seafood joint have known her for years. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Cheers\u2019 -- everybody knows your name,\u201d said Reid.  \u201cIt is, which is also a Boston place. And there\u2019s Jasper! Look who\u2019s here!\u201d When Reid asked proprietor Jasper White if being a senator had gone to Warren\u2019s head, he said no. \u201cShe\u2019s just a local girl here!\u201d he laughed.  The Elizabeth Warren most of us know is a fierce critic of Wall Street -- a senator with a message you\u2019ve probably heard before: \u201cThe system is rigged.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking about this middle class theme, \u2018the system is rigged,\u2019 for a long time,\u201d Reid said. \u201cDo you sound like a broken record?\u201d \u201cI admit, it truly is my life\u2019s work,\u201d she replied.  And her life story. In 1960s Oklahoma, Warren\u2019s mother supported the family on a minimum wage job at Sear\u2019s. \u201cA higher minimum wage saved my family,\u201d she said. \u201cA low minimum wage today is dragging families who work sometimes three jobs and still can\u2019t support a family. That\u2019s not right. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not on the heads of the families who work; it\u2019s on the heads of politicians in Washington who decide that corporate interests are vastly more important than those of working people.\u201d \u201cThat gets you very emotional,\u201d Reid said.  \u201cYes, it does.\u201d \u201cIs it fair to say it gets you angry?\u201d \u201cYes, it does,\u201d said Warren. \u201cAnd it gets me in the fight. And it\u2019s why I say this fight is our fight.\u201d Which is also the title of her latest book, out Tuesday, on what she calls the disappearing middle class. And make no mistake: For this 67-year-old grandmother of three, it is personal.\u00a0  \u201cThis is the best way I know to fight for their future,\u201d she said.\u00a0 \u201cAre they going to be better off than your generation?\u201d \u201cThe odds are not in their favor,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I grew up in America, the chances that a kid would do better than her parents were better than 90%. Today the chances that a kid is going to do better than her parents are less than a coin toss.\u201d For inspiration you may be surprised to learn Warren looks to our 26th president, a Republican, whose trust-busting policies toward corporate America she thinks reflect her own.  \u201cI\u2019m a huge Teddy Roosevelt fan,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd do you know why? He said, \u2018We gotta get rid of those giant corporations. We gotta break \u2018em up.\u2019 And the reason for doing that is he said, \u2018They exercise too much political power. And we can\u2019t have that in a democracy.\u2019\u201d And she wants to do what Teddy did. Right now (small wonder), her focus is on our 45th president, whom the former Harvard law professor has been studying for some time. \u201cI actually watched \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 for a couple of seasons,\u201d she said. And what did she think of the host? \u201cIt was an interesting show, the first season. By the second season I kind of got tired of it. Sort of the same old shtick.\u201d \u201cTired of him?\u201d Reid asked.  \u201cEh. He was the shtick!\u201d she laughed.  \u201cShtick\u201d may have been what some of her GOP Senate colleagues thought in February, when Republicans voted to silence Warren for impugning the character of Trump\u2019s Attorney General nominee, Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, for which Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell made his now-famous remark: \u00a0 \u201cShe was warned. She was given an explanation.\u00a0 Nevertheless, she persisted.\u201d Warren was reading a 1986 letter from the widow of Martin Luther King Jr. that criticized Sessions. Once silenced, she kept right on reading outside the Senate chamber.  Reid asked, \u201cDo you think there was some sexism involved here?\u201d \u201cI think what was really going on is people knew there\u2019s a problem with having Jeff Sessions as Attorney General of the United States.\u201d \u201cNot sexism? Do you think they treated male senators differently than you?\u201d \u201cAll I can say is the next day four men stood up and read exactly the same letter, and they all got to finish,\u201d Warren replied.  Her persistence in opposing the new administration at almost every turn has made Warren both a polarizing figure and a progressive favorite. She\u2019s been called \u201cThe de facto leader of the Trump resistance.\u201d  Is she comfortable with that? \u201cLook, if it works ... what I want to do is I want to have every person in this country lift their voices and be heard.\u201d \u201cBut if you\u2019re the de facto leader of the Trump resistance, doesn\u2019t it make logical sense for you to be the person who runs against him in 2020?\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the election in four years,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about what happens this week.\u201d \u201cAre you thinking about it?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m running for reelection here in Massachusetts. I want to stay in the Senate.\u201d That could be a challenge; a poll earlier this year shows fewer than half of her constituents say she deserves another term. She told Reid she was confident she would win reelection. He asked, \u201cWill it end your political career if you don\u2019t?\u201d \u201cFor me, this is about the work,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t get into this because I thought, \u2018Wow, I would get to be a senator!\u2019 I got into this because I thought if I\u2019m a senator I can fight harder and better and more effectively for people who are just busting their tails every day. For people who are up against the system that is tilted against them.\u201d Reid then introduced the \u201cJames Lipton/\u2019Inside the Actors Studio\u2019\u201d part of the interview, in which he asked Warren for her favorite curse word. \u201cPoop.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s a goody two-shoes,\u201d Reid said.  But she defended it. \u201cAre you kidding? Have you ever seen a woman like me look you straight in the face after you\u2019ve finished some long explanation of something and then just said, \u2018Poop\u2019? Try it!\u201d \u201cHave you said that on the Senate floor?\u201d he asked.  \u201cNo. Not yet.\u201d But that day may be coming. \u201cWho knows?\u201d she said. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0For more info:",

            "article_content": "The 2018 Illinois governor's race is on pace to be the most expensive in U.S. history, propelled by a wealthy Republican incumbent and a billionaire Democrat who are airing TV ads and hopping private planes to campaign events more than a year before Election Day. J.B. Pritzker, an heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune and one of the world's richest people, is among several Democrats trying to defeat multimillionaire businessman-turned-governor Bruce Rauner. Also running is Democrat Chris Kennedy, nephew of the late President John F. Kennedy, who in a typical race might easily be the candidate with the biggest bank account. But this is not a typical race. All of the candidates combined have raised more than $100 million in the past year. Most of that comes from Pritzker and Rauner's own money. That's almost as much as was spent in the entire 2014 governor's race, which set an Illinois record at $112 million. The candidates spent nearly $30 million in the first nine months of this year \u2014 more than seven times the amount spent in the same period four years ago, according to the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform. If the trend continues the contest \"absolutely\" could surpass the most expensive governor's race to date, a record set in California in 2010, said Colin Williams, the Illinois Campaign for Political Reform's political data director. He said candidates spent about $280 million in that race, in which former Gov. Jerry Brown defeated ex-Hewlett Packard CEO Meg Whitman. The eye-popping cost of the Illinois contest has some people sounding an alarm about politics being a playground only for the rich. Chicago Alderman Ameya Pawar, who started the governor's race with just $50,000, dropped out this month because he couldn't raise enough money to compete. He said he wasn't willing to strap his young family with huge personal debt. \"For democracy's sake, I hope we see this as a troubling trend,\" he said. There's no limit to how much one person could donate to the candidates; under Illinois law, contribution caps are removed if a candidate gives his or her own campaign $250,000 or more in an election cycle. Kennedy triggered that provision \u2014 intended to level the playing field in races with wealthy contenders \u2014 when he deposited $250,100 in his campaign fund in March. Since then, Kennedy has added $250,000 more, while Pritzker has deposited about $28 million into his fund. Pritzker, a venture capitalist who Forbes says is worth $3.4 billion, is completely self-funding his campaign. That will allow labor unions and Democratic county organizations \u2014 many of which have endorsed him \u2014 to focus their money and energies on down-ballot races such as the Legislature. Pritzker says self-funding will make him independent of special interests. He also says deep pockets are necessary to compete with Rauner, who spent more than $60 million of his own money to rebuild a Republican Party operation across the state and win the 2014 election. That same operation helped the GOP pick up seats in the Illinois House in 2016, ending Democrats' supermajority. Late last year, Rauner made a $50 million contribution to his own campaign fund, money that will also help fund the state party. \"Unfortunately he set us on a course that I think is going to mean that we Democrats have got to build the infrastructure that we've lost. It's important that we knock on doors, that we're phone banking,\" said Pritzker, who has opened field offices across Illinois. \"That is the campaign that I'm trying to put together.\" Kennedy said he believes \"all of us are outraged\" by the money in the race but also said Democrats \"need to respond\" to Rauner and the GOP. State Sen. Daniel Biss argues the best way for Democrats to do that isn't with huge personal wealth, but with a campaign like his, which has raised $2.7 million from \"thousands and thousands of people\" making smaller donations \u2014 including $50 from his wife. On the campaign trail, the former math professor talks of his \"middle-class life,\" with kids who share a bedroom. Democrats, he says, have to ask themselves: \"Are we going to have an election or are we going to have an auction?\"",

            "article_content": "As each year comes to an end, news outlets across the globe inevitably look back on the months that have passed and reflect on the stories that most impacted our lives. In 2016, those retrospectives were dominated by the presidential election and political strife that consumed not only the United States, but the world.\u00a0 But in 2017, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint any one defining story -- or even to remember all the high and low points of this whirlwind of a year. We saw the after-effects of last year play out in real time, at almost too fast a pace to keep up. Not only was the bombardment of news relentless, the headlines quite literally multiplied in magnitude and scope. We witnessed not one massively destructive hurricane, but three in a row; two\u00a0horrific massacres back to back; a spate of vehicle attacks in Europe and at home; and endless political infighting at the speed of Twitter. Through it all, we also saw the resiliency of the human spirit. Neighbors and strangers alike stepped in to help someone in need, whether they had lost their home in Houston or a loved one in Las Vegas. And as we head into 2018, we're sure to see more of the same compassion and care. Here are 17 stories that dominated 2017, and whose impact will continue to be felt in the years to come. \"I'm going to be very restrained, if I use [Twitter] at all, I'm going to be very restrained,\" then President-elect Donald Trump told 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl\u00a0in his first TV interview just days after winning the U.S. election. But his activity on the social media site was anything but restrained during his first year in office. Mr. Trump has poked fun at world leaders including the dictator of North Korea, railed against the mainstream media, and sent out dozens of typos like the infamous \"covfefe\" to nearly 45 million followers. He implied there might be tapes of his White House conversations, attacked numerous sitting lawmakers, shocked\u00a0global allies, and announced major policy changes. He's gotten into hot water over retweets from accounts belonging to alt-right activists and anti-Muslim\u00a0extremist groups. #FraudNewsCNN #FNN pic.twitter.com/WYUnHjjUjg Each Trump tweet seemed to spark a frenzied media cycle analyzing their meaning and impact. The president says he likes using Twitter because it allows him to speak directly to the American people, without the involvement of the press. \"The tweet speaks for itself\" became a predictable response from first White House press secretary Sean Spicer and his successor, Sarah Huckabee Sanders. One year in, there are no signs President Trump plans on slowing down. One day after President Trump's inauguration, hundreds of thousands of people descended on Washington, D.C. for the\u00a0Women's March, and many more took to the streets in cities across all 50 states as well as dozens of countries abroad. At the flagship march in D.C., a star-studded line up kicked off the day's events. Many marchers wore pink \"pussy hats,\" designed to reclaim the president's vulgar use of the term on the\u00a02005 Access Hollywood tape. While organizers said the day was not about being anti-Trump, critics felt it excluded conservative women and would lead to little positive change. But for one day at least, the turnout was a massive show of solidarity among women (and men) across the globe. Bombshell reports in October from\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0and\u00a0The New Yorker\u00a0exposed allegations of Harvey Weinstein's sexual misconduct in Hollywood. Although he has denied any nonconsensual encounters, dozens of women have accused the producer of sexual harassment and assault.\u00a0 The revelations revealed a deeply rooted problem in Hollywood and beyond of men using their power and influence to take advantage of women. As more women felt empowered to come forward, more prominent men lost their jobs -- including actor Kevin Spacey; comedian Louis C.K.; journalists Charlie Rose and Matt Lauer; and politicians Al Franken and John Conyers.\u00a0 This\u00a0watershed moment\u00a0sparked an ongoing national conversation about sexual misconduct and power dynamics in the workplace. The hashtag\u00a0#MeToo\u00a0went viral as millions of people took to social media to share their experiences. Hurricane season in 2017 was particularly brutal for the southeastern U.S. and Caribbean.\u00a0Hurricane Harvey\u00a0left a path of destruction in Houston and surrounding areas of Texas as well as Louisiana. Record-breaking downpours left entire towns underwater, including small farm communities like\u00a0Winnie, Texas. The nation barely had time to rally around the victims before\u00a0Hurricane Irma\u00a0made landfall in Florida, also causing severe damage in Puerto Rico on the way.\u00a0 Then when\u00a0Hurricane Maria\u00a0made landfall in\u00a0Puerto Rico\u00a0at the end of September, power was knocked out to the entire U.S. territory and millions of residents -- who are U.S. citizens -- struggled to find clean drinking water and safe shelter. With\u00a0communications down\u00a0and major roadways destroyed,\u00a0aid couldn't reach large portions of the population. People are understandably furious about the power outage at @ATLairport - but know this:Sunday in Puerto Rico88 days after MariaStatus.pr reports:*69% power generation (Thousands of Americans have been without power for nearly 3 months; it may be May before everyone has it) Three months later, 30 percent of the island is still without electricity and nearly 250,000 people have sought refuge in Florida, CBS News' David Begnaud reports. U.S. intelligence agencies determined last year that Russians interfered with the presidential election. But the question lingers, was there any collusion with the Trump campaign? The resulting investigation has been a cloud hovering over the Trump administration since Day 1. Then-FBI Director James Comey was leading a probe into the matter when Trump suddenly fired him. As a result, special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to oversee the investigation. Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former national security advisor Michael Flynn have both been criminally charged (Flynn pleaded guilty), along with two other campaign aides.\u00a0 And let's not forget the time Donald Trump, Jr. tweeted out his email exchanges\u00a0setting up a meeting with a Russian lawyer who claimed to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Trump and his team continue to insist there was no collusion with Russia, but the investigation is likely nowhere near over. The former FBI director was fired in May after months of investigating possible Russia connections. It was a nearly unprecedented political drama that left many government figures questioning the president's motives. The White House's first explanation was a letter from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein saying Comey had poorly handled the probe into Hillary Clinton's emails.\u00a0 Then President Trump undermined that argument by telling NBC's Lester Holt that\u00a0he'd planned to fire Comey all along, and he \"had the Russia thing\" on his mind when he did it.\u00a0 Shortly after he left the FBI, Comey leaked a memo on his conversations with Mr. Trump about the investigation into Flynn -- leading to speculation about whether or not the president's actions amounted to obstruction of justice.\u00a0 All of this built up over a matter of weeks, so when Comey was called to testify on Capitol Hill, anticipation was running high. Bars in Washington, D.C. opened early for testimony watch parties. The major networks all carried special reports.\u00a0 Ultimately, Comey's public testimony didn't reveal any smoking guns, but there were some\u00a0shocking moments. He explained he took notes during his conversations with the president because he was afraid Trump might \"lie about the nature of our meeting.\" He revealed that the Justice Department asked him to use softer language about the probe into Clinton's emails during the campaign. And he left social media with a one-liner that will be immortalized in meme-dom forever: \"Lordy, I hope there are tapes.\" President Trump's administration has seen a considerable amount of high-profile staff turnover during its first year. The first to go was former national security advisor Mike Flynn in February, just 25 days into the term, after it was revealed he lied about his contact with the Russian government. He was also a registered foreign agent for the government of Turkey. He recently plead guilty to lying to the FBI.\u00a0 Next was James Comey's firing in May. Then, a whirlwind series of exits over the course of 10 days in July, when\u00a0Anthony Scaramucci\u00a0was brought in as the new communications director and press secretary Sean Spicer and chief of staff Reince Priebus quickly left the White House. Then Scaramucci himself got the boot after an\u00a0explosive phone call to a high-profile journalist\u00a0reportedly angered the new chief of staff, General John Kelly.\u00a0 Chief strategist \u00a0in August, returning to his post at Breitbart. In September, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price resigned over his use of\u00a0private charter planes. Most recently, reality star Omarosa Manigualt Newman left her White House public liaison job, reportedly in dramatic fashion. In a year that was particularly polarizing, the sun and moon provided a welcome distraction this summer when the\u00a0solar eclipse\u00a0captivated the nation. Millions of Americans traveled and camped out to be within the path of totality, which stretched from Oregon to South Carolina.\u00a0 Although the event itself only lasted for one hour and 33 minutes, the weeks and days of excitement leading up to it gave Americans something positive and uplifting to look forward to. Gone for a moment were the Twitter hot-takes and political bickering. The eclipse was just cool, and that's something we could all agree on -- even if only for a day. In August, groups of neo-Nazis and white supremacists gathered in Charlottesville, Virginia to protest the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee from a park at the University of Virginia. A rally was planned for Saturday, August 12th, but the night before hundreds of men marched through the school's grounds with tiki torches chanting phrases like \"Jews will not replace us\" and the Nazi slogan, \"blood and soil.\" The demonstration only foreshadowed the dark events of the next day, when the supremacist groups clashed violently with anti-fascists and counter-protesters. Police called off the event, and as protesters left the scene a white supremacist drove a car into the crowd, injuring dozens and killing a peaceful protester named Heather Heyer. The events of the weekend left the country shaken and searching for answers. When President Trump finally addressed what happened, his words did little to promote healing. \",\" Trump said in a press conference three days later. He soon added there were \"very fine people on both sides.\" His choice of words ignited a firestorm of criticism, and left the country once again grappling with how to talk about race, bigotry, and the legacy of segregation in America today. Colin Kaepernick's protest on the NFL sidelines had mostly faded from the national spotlight until September, when President Trump spoke about it at a rally in Alabama. \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, \"Get that son of a b---- off the field right now,'\" Trump asked the crowd, which responded with loud cheers. Players, coaches, and team owners across the league denounced the president's statement\u00a0and defended players' rights to express their views. The next weekend, the national anthem at the start of each game was almost more hyped than the games themselves. More than 200 NFL players kneeled in a show of solidarity. The Pittsburgh Steelers voted as a team to sit out the anthem all together, while the entire Dallas Cowboys lineup\u00a0kneeled on the 50-yard line before their game began. In early October, Vice President Mike Pence left an Indianapolis Colts game after some players took a knee. He said it was a matter of patriotism and respect, but critics called it a taxpayer funded publicity stunt. Supporters of the kneeling protests say the gesture is intended to call attention to police brutality and the unequal treatment of black citizens in America, but detractors believe kneeling during the anthem is disrespectful to those who have fought and died for our country. North Korea\u00a0has launched 23 missiles in 16 different tests in the months since Donald Trump took office.\u00a0The most recent test, in late November, was of a ballistic missile that could reach the U.S. mainland. Kim Jong Un appears to be making major strides in his nuclear program, and the uptick in test launches prompted Trump to dub him \"Little Rocket Man.\" The president has a knack for giving nicknames to his opponents -- Little Marco, Crooked Hillary -- but it is unusual for a sitting U.S. president to openly mock another country's leader, especially on Twitter. Kim has taken his own shots in the war of words,\u00a0calling Mr. Trump a \"dotard\"\u00a0and a \"destroyer,\" while also threatening retaliation for the president's insults. Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me \"old,\" when I would NEVER call him \"short and fat?\" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen! While the back-and-forth may seem silly,\u00a0the potential diplomatic consequences are serious. Trump has repeatedly said the U.S. will \"handle\" the situation, and called on countries like China to place stricter sanctions on North Korea. But defense experts now believe that with the latest test, Kim is closing in on the ability to strike anywhere in the world. On October 1st, the country was horrified by the news of 58 people shot dead at an outdoor country music festival in\u00a0Las Vegas, Nevada. The gunman rained\u00a0thousands of bullets\u00a0down on the unsuspecting crowd from his perch on the 32nd floor of the\u00a0Mandalay Bay hotel. He was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, surrounded by an arsenal of weapons. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, exceeding even the\u00a0Pulse nightclub attack\u00a0in Orlando just last year.\u00a0Just 35 days later, another horrific shooting claimed the lives of\u00a026 people in a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. The youngest victim was just 18 months old; the oldest was 77. It was later revealed that the shooter had previously escaped from a mental health facility, and was discharged form the Air Force for bad conduct for assaulting his spouse and child. That information was never reported to the FBI,\u00a0which would have prevented him from buying a gun. The tragic loss of so many lives once again sparked debate on\u00a0gun laws\u00a0in America and what can be done to stem the violence. A terrifying trend in terror attacks that began in 2016 continued into this year with assailants using cars as weapons. Six people were killed in March when a man drove a car into pedestrians on the\u00a0Westminster Bridge in London, then barreled into the gates of the nearby House of Parliament.\u00a0 That was the first of three car attacks in London this year -- in June a terrorist sped into crowds on the\u00a0London Bridge, and days later another attacker\u00a0plowed through a group\u00a0of worshipers leaving a mosque. In August, a similar attack took place on the Las Ramblas promenade in\u00a0Barcelona, Spain, killing 16. And in October, an assailant in New York City killed eight people when he drove a rented Home Depot truck into the crowd on a popular\u00a0bike path in lower Manhattan.\u00a0 This year also saw the horrific bombing at an\u00a0Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. Twenty-two people were killed, many of them young girls and parents picking their children up from the show. One week after he took office, President Trump issued an executive order placing strict travel restrictions on people coming to the U.S. from seven predominantly Muslim countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The resulting chaos at airports around the country caused massive protests and sent lawyers rushing to defend detained travelers. The ban was halted by a federal judge within a week, tying it up in the court system. A second version was released in March that was also partially blocked. However, the Supreme Court later ruled part of the ban could go into effect, and in December allowed the third version to go through while it faces ongoing legal challenges. This third version restricts access from eight countries -- Chad, Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Yemen, North Korea, and certain travelers from Venezuela.\u00a0 Two key Trump campaign promises faced decisive votes this year. First was the Republican Party's pledge to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The House was able to pass their version of a plan to dismantle the ACA, but it was unpopular with the public and the Congressional Budget Office estimated\u00a0upwards of 30 million more people would be uninsured by 2026. Republican leadership, including President Trump, lobbied for weeks to get the votes needed to pass the repeal in the Senate. Ultimately, seven Republicans voted against the Senate's version, with Sen. John McCain -- recently diagnosed with cancer -- delivering a dramatic \"thumbs-down\"\u00a0on its way to defeat. In the final days of the year, Republicans in the Senate and the House passed their massive tax overhaul plan. The plan faced criticism from Democrats who say it's a tax cut for the rich and corporations, but supporters say it will boost the economy and help the middle class. President Trump, who long promised a \"big, beautiful tax cut,\" signed the bill into law before Christmas. It's rare that a special election for a congressional seat in a heavily red (or blue) state dominates national media attention. But the entire country was watching the race between Democrat Doug Jones and Republican Roy Moore in Alabama -- a state that hasn't had a Democratic senator in 25 years. Moore was accused of sexual misconduct by at least seven women, including some who said they were teenagers when the incidents happened. At first, Republican lawmakers distanced themselves from Moore and many\u00a0called for him to drop out of the race. But Moore denied the allegations and refused to step aside. The people of Alabama will do the right thing. Doug Jones is Pro-Abortion, weak on Crime, Military and Illegal Immigration, Bad for Gun Owners and Veterans and against the WALL. Jones is a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet. Roy Moore will always vote with us. VOTE ROY MOORE! The RNC eventually resumed its financial support, and\u00a0President Trump recorded a robocall for Moore in the last days before the election. It was a tight race, but Jones won after historic turnout of the Democratic base -- specifically African-Americans and young voters. Shortly after the election last year, it became clear that false stories from\u00a0bogus \"news\" sites\u00a0had run\u00a0rampant on social media. But in 2017, the term \"fake news\" has taken on a new meaning that seems to apply to any story someone may not like. The president often refers to the mainstream media, specifically CNN, as \"fake\" when unflattering stories are published. So much Fake News being put in dying magazines and newspapers. Only place worse may be @NBCNews, @CBSNews, @ABC and @CNN. Fiction writers! Just one month after he took office, Trump called the news media the \"enemy of the American people.\" And a poll out in December found that 44 percent of Americans believe news outlets make up stories about the president and his administration \"more than once in a while.\" Cydney Adams is a senior manager of social media for CBS News.

            "article_content": "Amid the landscape of red Midwestern states and an aging pool of Democratic politicians, Pete Buttigieg sticks out. The 34-year-old Democratic mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is trying out his appeal to national Democrats, tossing his name into the race for DNC chair last week. It was not something he says he had thought about before the 2016 presidential election. \u201cThe idea of running for this office had literally never crossed my mind,\u201d Buttigieg admitted. The Hoosier also concedes the often-polarizing position of DNC chair may have limited political advantage in Indiana.\u00a0 With gubernatorial and senate races on the horizon in Indiana, the only plans Buttigieg says he\u2019s made for 2020 and 2022 are to root for Democrats lining the ballot. He actively avoids speculating on his own prospects in a state he says is not \u201ccosmically destined to be red.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m doing myself any favors politically back home,\u201d he laughed. \u201cBut I decided whatever the political consequences, there\u2019s a chance to do some good.\u201d If selected to lead the Democratic Party, Buttigieg plans to step down as mayor of South Bend.\u00a0 Democrats convene to elect a new chairman next month, and the youngest contender in a crowded race has caught the attention of many of his party\u2019s leaders, notwithstanding its retiring commander-in-chief. In a post-election interview with the New Yorker, President Obama identified Buttigieg as a fresh face in the party, along with newly elected California Sen. Kamala Harris, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, as well as 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. Buttigieg currently serves as chief executive of the city of South Bend, and won his second mayoral bid in 2015 with 80 percent of the vote. The demographically diverse city of just over 100,000 residents sits adjacent to the University of Notre Dame in St. Joseph\u2019s County. By a margin of less than 250 votes, it\u2019s one of four counties that voted for Hillary Clinton in the Hoosier state, home to Vice President-elect and former Indiana Governor Mike Pence. \u201cSouth Bend is a Democratic city, but it\u2019s not an 80 percent Democratic city,\u201d Buttigieg remarked, citing his ability to work across the aisle during re-election. The politician known as \u201cMayor Pete\u201d by his constituents is leaning on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in the DNC race, though he\u2019s decades younger than some of the competition. \u201cI know it sounds odd,\u201d he told CBS News. \u201cBut in many ways, I want to run on my experience.\u201dIn his first term as mayor, the Navy Reserve lieutenant deployed to Afghanistan for seven months, taking an unpaid leave of absence. Buttigieg noted, \u201cI could be ordered back to war by a reckless president,\u201d in his video announcement to run for chairman.\u00a0 He is also quick to point out that \u201ca little counter-intelligence and cyber training can\u2019t hurt right now,\u201d indirectly alluding to recent hacking of DNC emails. After graduating magnum cum laude from Harvard and picking up a second degree as a Rhodes Scholar, Buttigieg consulted in the private sector for McKinsey and Company. In a party that cherishes firsts, the Indiana native would be the first openly gay chairman of a national party. Just three months before coming out to constituents in a newspaper editorial, Buttigieg gathered local professionals downtown to speak out against then-Gov. Mike Pence\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \u201cWhat this bill has done is send exactly the wrong message about what kind of state we are,\u201d the Mayor told CBS affiliate WSBT at the time, amid criticisms that the legislation allowed businesses to refuse service to gay couples. Yet while Buttigieg is quick to share his credentials, he steers clear of selling himself as a standard bearer in an age of what he calls \u201cidentity politics.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter how famous you are,\u201d Buttigieg states without waver. \u201cNever mind the show. Never mind the characters. Never mind the noise. I want to know what\u2019s happening around the kitchen table.\u201d Buttigieg thinks those conversations were largely absent from party politics in 2016. \u201cWe were talking about the politicians themselves. And that\u2019s where we run the risk of losing touch.\u201d Yet Buttigieg now faces several Democratic household names in the race for chairman, Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez, a finalist for Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate. Support for the leading contenders could rekindle lingering tensions from the Democratic primary race with DNC members divided between familiar lines. After calling around to different state chairs, Buttigieg concluded there is \u201ca real appetite for another voice\u201d and warns against rehashing past party fractures. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d Buttigieg said, \u201cthe solutions from our party are not going to come from Washington.\u201d His vision for a Democratic Party turnaround is largely built on his turnaround record in South Bend. The former manufacturing hub for Studebaker automobiles was hit hard with job losses after the factory closure in 1963--long before Buttigieg was born. Its downfall echoed Donald Trump\u2019s campaign narrative to revive rust belt manufacturing in and vocal criticism of American auto industry factories overseas. In 2010, Newsweek put South Bend on its list of dying American cities. Under Buttigieg\u2019s leadership, though, South Bend has been making a comeback. In 2013, the mayor spearheaded a project converting old Studebaker acreage into a high-tech data center. The same year, Buttigieg announced his mission to demolish or repurpose 1,000 of the city\u2019s vacant and abandoned homes in 1,000 days. The task was completed two months before deadline. Earlier last year, Buttigieg told the New York Times, \u201cThere are a lot of people who think they lost their jobs because of globalization when they actually lost their jobs because of technology.\u201d\u00a0 Buttigieg told CBS News he is still waiting on specifics from President-elect Donald Trump on ways to preserve the silicon prairie. \u201cI think that wise decision-making and foresight can preserve our tradition of being a great manufacturing region even as we continue to create and grow jobs in new industries.\u201d\u00a0 Indiana is also home to Democratic Senator Joe Donnelly who has known Mayor Buttigieg for years, calling him both a good friend and a great leader in a statement to CBS News. \u201cPete knows how critical good-paying jobs and economic opportunity are to middle-class families,\u201d Donnelly writes, \u201cand I think he\u2019d bring that focus and understanding to the DNC.\u201d Despite a fast approaching election set for late February, Buttigieg vows he would not be running if he did not think he could win. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty enough to keep me busy with my day job,\u201d he jokes. \u00a0\u201cIf I keep my head down and do a good job, the future will take care of itself,\u201d Buttigieg says. \u201cIf I don\u2019t do a good job, nothing else matters.\u201d For now, doing a good job means making back-to-back phone calls with the 447 voting members of the DNC and spending hours catching up to competitors by hearing out concerns from across the country. \u201cI think this is about as late as anyone could get in,\u201d he adds, \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want to announce before I was ready.\u201d Ready or not, here he comes.",

            "article_content": "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistani opposition parties have urged the country's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to step down after a Supreme Court probe into corruption allegations against his family members found \"significant disparity\" between their declared wealth and known sources of income. One of the key pieces of evidence to emerge from the court-appointed Judicial Investigation Team's (JIT) work is a collection of documents submitted by Sharif's daughter Maryam.  The documents -- which Maryam Sharif presented to the JIT as having been created in 2006 -- were written in Microsoft's default Calibri font. That font was not made widely available to the public by Microsoft until the following year. The JIT discovered the discrepancy, since touted by many in Pakistan as evidence of fraudulent evidence, after sending the documents abroad for forensic analysis. \u00a0 Sharif has been under pressure since documents leaked in 2016 from a Panama-based law firm disclosed that his family had offshore accounts. He's been accused of hiding his family's wealth by moving around money in those accounts in illegal transactions.  Babar Awan, a leader of cricket-star-turned-politician Imran Khan's party, said on Tuesday that Sharif's only option is to quit. Sirajul Haq, the leader of opposition Jamaat-e-Islami party, also demanded Sharif's resignation. Investigators in the probe suggested on Monday that courts pursue action based on a 1999 accountability law intended to help eliminate corruption.  But the final decision rests with the Supreme Court, which will take up the case next Monday. The JIT is expected to present its findings formally to the court at that time, and the Court could rule on the corruption allegations against Sharif as soon as next week. The family of Sharif, prominent industrialists from Lahore, has owned steel mills, including sites in Saudi Arabia, where he was sent into exile by then-President Gen. Pervez Musharraf in 2000. Sharif entered politics in the 1980s, and won his second term as Prime Minister in a 2013 election, in large part by convincing lower and middle classes that he could revitalize the country's economy.",

            "article_content": "Senate Republicans' slim majority grew slimmer on Tuesday with Democrat Doug Jones' surprising victory over Trump-backed Republican Roy Moore in Alabama's dramatic special election. Moore, accused of sexual misconduct with minors almost 40 years ago, has refused to concede despite President Trump's urging him to do so. Moore's controversial campaign is done, but the Capitol's reckoning with assault and harassment is far from over. Texas congressman Blake Farenthold said this week he won't run for reelection after recently coming under fire for alleged sexual misconduct with staffers. And on Friday, the Ethics Committee launched an another investigation into misconduct allegations against Rep. Ruben Kihuen, D-Nevada. The president, who has more than a dozen accusers of his own, lashed out on Twitter at Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, after she openly called for his resignation.\u00a0  Meanwhile, Republicans moved closer this week to passing a tax bill before Christmas. Senate and House leaders said on Wednesday they reached an agreement in melding their two bills. As the final language is crafted, and amid some last-minute maneuvering for votes, Vice President Mike Pence has postponed his Middle East trip to be available to cast a possible tie-breaking vote.  Trump and Republicans are putting pressure on special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling after reports of anti-Trump bias from an FBI agent who was dismissed from Mueller's team earlier this year. Trump has used the report to levy criticism against the bureau. Other important developments in the investigation this week included reports that Mueller's team and the House Intelligence Committee sought information from Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm the Trump campaign employed. This Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will talk with \"Face the Nation\" anchor John Dickerson about the final version of the GOP's tax bill. He'll identify what has and hasn't changed, and he'll discuss the administration's view on the bill's larger implications for the middle class and the deficit.  Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, will be on this Sunday to give his evaluation of the bill. We'll ask Sanders, an outspoken critic of Republican efforts, to outline his problems with the GOP's plan. We'll also get Sanders' take on Jones' historic win in deep-red Alabama, the looming budget deadlines, and more. Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, will be on the program to talk about what direction his committee's Russia investigation might be headed and whether he feels that the administration is trying to exert influence over it. We'll also get Lankford's take on the GOP's last-minute tax negotiations. Wall Street Journal tax reporter Richard Rubin will join the program to break down the tax bill \u2013 what it does, who it affects, and more. Rubin, who has rigorously covered the GOP's efforts from the start, will help us maneuver through the weeds and clarify what this bill could mean for taxpayers. As always, we'll have our expert political panel to break down this week's round of headlines. This week we'll be joined by Editor-in-Chief of The Atlantic Jeffery Goldberg, Slate Chief Political Correspondent and CBS News Contributor Jamelle Bouie, Publisher of The Federalist and CBS News Contributor Ben Domenech and National Editor of the Cook Political Report Amy Walter.

            "article_content": "SEATTLE \u2013 Former U.S. attorney Jenny Durkan is projected to win the race for Seattle mayor, CBS Seattle affiliate KIRO-TV reports. Some 60 percent of the votes counted were for her as of Tuesday night, the station said.\u00a0 KIRO called the race, saying, \"After crunching the numbers, we determined contender Cary Moon would need to win more than 61 percent of votes outstanding, based on expected turnout.\" The next round of results was to be announced late Wednesday afternoon. Ballot counting was to continue over the next several days. Durkan took a strong early lead in a race mayor that was to give the booming liberal city its first female mayor since the 1920s. Ninety-one years after Seattle elected Bertha Knight Landes mayor, Durkan had grabbed more than a 20-point lead in early returns in the all-mail election. Urban planner Cary Moon had tallied just over 39 percent of the vote. Voters were choosing between Durkan, 59, and Moon, 54, to lead this city dealing with the benefits and problems of an economy booming for some more than others as e-commerce giant Amazon expands. Seattle voters in August narrowed the field of 21 mayoral candidates down to Moon and Durkan. \"We are up against tough odds,\" Moon said in a statement Tuesday night. \"Campaign spending for our opponent broke city election records, outspending us by more than 3:1. The Chamber of Commerce funneled hundreds of thousands on behalf of Comcast, CenturyLink, AT&T, Amazon and others into a no-limit PAC for our opponent. But Seattle late voters may surprise everyone. We believe the ballot counts will swing in our direction over time, and we're not out of the race yet.\" \"Now I know there's a lot of votes left to be counted,\" Durkan told supporters Tuesday night. \"But I have to tell ya we're feeling really really good about where we are.\" She also had a message for the president of the United States, whose policies she vocally opposed during her campaign: \"Can I just say, Donald Trump, keep your hands off Seattle.\" The two-woman matchup came after former Mayor Ed Murray dropped his re-election efforts amid accusations of sexual abuse by multiple men. Murray had been expected to easily win re-election after pushing through increases to the city's minimum wage and emerging as a vocal opponent to President Trump, whom Seattle voters overwhelmingly rejected in 2016. Murray, who has denied the allegations, resigned in September after a fifth accuser came forward. \"I feel like I take into account who the candidate is, regardless of male or female, but this year for me at least, it feels a little special to have a choice between two women and to sort of elevate the visibility of viable female candidates. I have a small tinge of excitement about that, for sure,\" said Seattle voter Michelle Solis. The race between Durkan and Moon centered on how the city will respond to changes largely brought by Amazon, which employs about 40,000 people in Seattle. Housing prices have skyrocketed amid constant complaints about traffic and worries that the poor and middle class are being priced out. Durkan, backed by the city's business and labor establishment, has touted her managerial experience as a prosecutor. Moon, meanwhile, who formerly managed her family's manufacturing business, has stressed that she's not a politician and has focused on her 20 years of activism on transit, waterfront and other city issues. The race has attracted big money. Although it's Durkan's first run for office, the well-connected player in city and state Democratic circles raised nearly $1 million. An independent-expenditure committee working on Durkan's behalf has raised nearly $847,000 to pump into election efforts. Moon's donations topped $355,000 with over $176,000 coming from her private bank account. An independent-expenditure group for Moon raised over $27,000. Because Murray resigned, the winner of the election will take office as soon as the election is certified in late November, instead of in January.",

            "article_content": "BANGKOK -- A Thai court on Wednesday sentenced ousted Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra in absentia to five years in prison for alleged negligence in a money-losing rice subsidy program. Yingluck, who says the charges are politically motivated, is believed to have fled the country last month before the court session at which the verdict initially was to have been delivered. Yingluck's government was overthrown in a military coup in 2014. She and her supporters said she was innocent and was persecuted as part of an effort to dismantle the political machine of her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a telecommunications tycoon. Thaksin was toppled from power by a 2006 military coup after being accused of abuse of power, corruption and disrespect for the country's monarchy. He is living in self-imposed exile to avoid serving a prison term for what he calls a politically motivated 2008 conviction on a conflict of interest charge. Yingluck, who inherited the leadership of Thaksin's political machine and was elected prime minister in 2011, became a proxy target for his enemies as well. The rice subsidy scheme was a flagship policy that helped Yingluck's Pheu Thai Party win the 2011 general election. The government paid farmers about 50 percent above what they would have received on the world market, with the intention of driving up prices by warehousing the grain. Instead, other rice-producing countries captured the market by selling at competitive prices. Vietnam as a result replaced Thailand as the world's leading rice exporter. Prosecutors argued that Yingluck ignored warnings of corruption in the subsidy program and was guilty of dereliction of duty. Her critics describe the overriding motive of the program as political, an effort to buy the loyalty of rural voters with state funds. Thaksin's supporters, who delivered him unprecedented electoral victories, believe his only offense was challenging the power of the country's traditional elite, led by monarchists and the military, and supported by the urban middle class. They believe his popular appeal, earned by populist policies benefiting the less well-off rural majority, threatened the traditional ruling class' privilege.",

            "article_content": "South Africa's parliament voted against a motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma by just over 20 votes Tuesday. Despite the fact that Zuma remains president, the 177-198 vote sends a strong message that there is a crisis within the ruling African National Congress party, or ANC, and signals that his position within the party has been severely weakened. South African politics are, if anything, certainly unpredictable. In the 23 years of its democracy, there have been both surprises and disappointments. In particular of late there has been mounting public concern over Zuma's performance amid a string of serious corruption allegations. But despite the frenzy the nation's urban middle class managed to spin itself into ahead of Tuesday's vote and the dramatic headlines describing the nation as sitting on a knife-edge, there was no knife \u2013 although this time the blade came very close. There have been seven attempts to oust Zuma from office, including three previously unsuccessful opposition party-led votes of no confidence. This latest motion comes after Zuma fired his finance minister, the widely respected and fiscally responsible Pravin Gordhan. Gordhan is a veteran member of the ruling class but was openly critical of Zuma, accusing him of rampant corruption that has enriched both himself and his acolytes. The difference with Tuesday's vote was that it was cast in secret. Members of the ANC were able to vote according to their conscience without fear of reprisal if they rebelled against the party's instruction to support Zuma. Some senior members of the ANC have been openly hostile to Zuma and criticized him publically, saying he should resign over the corruption claims. The decision to allow the secret ballot sat with Speaker of the House Baleka Mbete, a longtime Zuma supporter with presidential ambitions of her own. Mbete did what was\u201a up to now\u201a unthinkable for a top ANC official: She rolled the dice on Zuma's fate. By allowing members of parliament to vote in secret on the no-confidence motion\u201a the ANC did not have complete control of the outcome. The ANC simply had to trust that the instructions hammered into its caucus ahead of the vote would be enough to prevent its members from breaking ranks. Mbete provided a detailed explanation for her decision at a media briefing just 24 hours ahead of the vote\u201a quoting at length from a June Constitutional Court judgment granting her the discretion to decide on the voting method. By delaying the announcement until the 11th hour\u201a it was widely anticipated that she would choose an open ballot and was trying to limit the time available for any urgent court action against her decision by opposition parties. But Mbete stunned the country when she said she had taken \"due and impartial consideration of all the factors\" and decided that voting on the motion would be by secret ballot. She also mentioned that it became necessary to vote in secret when \"circumstances are toxic,\" referring to threats against ANC MPs who had said they would vote according to their conscience. But what this shows even more clearly is that Mbete and others are worried about their own political fate. They want to remain in top positions within the ANC, which has its national elective conference in December, and they may no longer have or even want Zuma's help. He has become tainted goods. Clearly the number of people within the ANC willing to throw themselves under the bus for him is diminishing. Although it's doubtful that Mbete ever believed the no-confidence motion would be successful, she is hedging her bets in showing a willingness to disobey Zuma. However, even with the secret ballot\u201a the numbers always weighed in favor of Zuma. The ANC controls 249 seats in the 400-member parliament. A simple majority was all that was needed to win. On Tuesday, 384 people voted, but the ANC won narrowly given its huge majority, defeating the motion 198-177. What this reveals is that support for Zuma within his own party is waning. Zuma cannot be pleased with this result as it is not the stunning outright victory he had hoped for. A significant number of ANC members crossed the floor and with the security of secrecy rebelled against their leader. South Africa does not have presidential elections \u2013 the ruling party chooses the leader. And the country's constitution dictates that a president can only have two terms in office. Zuma's second term expires in 2019, but at the end of this year his party holds its elective conference. The person chosen as leader of the organization in all likelihood will be the country's next president. As Zuma's support declines, so does his ability to influence the choice of his successor. He wants his former wife, Nkosizana Dhlamini-Zuma, to be the next ANC president. Analysts say this is because he believes she would not allow any criminal charges of corruption to be brought against him. But Dhlamini-Zuma is facing tough opposition from Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, a former-trade-unionist-turned-businessman who was a close associate of former President Nelson Mandela helping steer the country's constitutional negotiations for democracy. Expect more unpredictability in South African politics over the next six months. After years of being the ultimate Teflon man, Zuma can no longer count on unconditional support. He heads into that December ANC elective conference significantly bruised and weakened.",

            "article_content": "While President Trump began the week with a trip to Asia to establish regional consensus on issues such as trade and North Korea, an immediate crisis had transpired back home: a mass shooting in a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, killing 26 and injuring more than 20.\u00a0  Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, tax reform was front-and-center. Pressure is mounting on Senate and House Republicans to score a legislative win for the party before next year's midterm elections. But on their signature issue of tax cuts, Republicans have found themselves with major differences between House and Senate proposals.  Democrats racked-up victories in a number of state-wide elections that have some Republicans worried about 2018.\u00a0  New developments emerged about Trump officials, including White House adviser Stephen Miller, campaign adviser Carter Page and long-time Trump bodyguard Keith Schiller. Page, Schiller and reportedly Miller have all been called in for questioning by investigators.\u00a0 Late in the week, sexual-misconduct allegations were made against Judge Roy Moore, the GOP candidate for the Alabama Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Despite calls from his party for Moore to drop out, the candidate denied the accusations and remains in the race. This Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will talk with \"Face the Nation\" host John Dickerson about the White House strategy to get tax reform passed. Will there be a tax cut for the middle class and how do Republicans respond to charges that its plan gives too many benefits to the very rich? And what are Mnuchin's thoughts on CBO projections that the plan eventually adds to the deficit?\u00a0  Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who labeled tax reform \"the issue of our time,\" will join the program in an exclusive interview to offer his point of view. He'll also weigh-in on the Democratic Party's trajectory heading into 2018.  Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, will also appear exclusively to discuss taxes as well as lessons his party can learn from their defeat in the Virginia governor's contest. \u00a0 To take the country's temperature on the one-year anniversary of Trump's election win, \"Face the Nation\" headed to Manchester, New Hampshire, a politically-complex city for a focus group. There, John Dickerson talked to Trump voters to learn where the President has lived-up to expectations \u2013 and where he has come up short.  As always, our expert political panel will break down the week's endless headlines. The Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, Washington Post Congressional Reporter and CBS Contributor Ed O'Keefe and National Editor of Cook Political Report Amy Walter will round out the program.

            "article_content": "ATLANTA\u00a0\u2014 A Democratic congressional candidate outside Philadelphia calls the Republican tax overhaul a \"cynical bill\" that will redistribute wealth upward. One of her counterparts in California dismisses estimates of tax savings for most U.S. households and says the legislation is \"just putting money in the pocket of the wealthy.\" And in Kansas, a Democratic candidate for governor says it's \"a recipe for disaster\" that signals inevitable cuts to popular programs like Social Security and Medicare. While Republicans celebrate a massive tax overhaul they say will goose the economy and increase workers' take-home pay up and down the income ladder, Democrats are aiming to turn the tax law into a cudgel in next year's fight to retake control of Congress and to dent GOP advantages in statehouses. Democrats hope to use the tax plan, passed without a single Democratic vote, to stake their ground as the party of middle-class and working-class America. They hope Republican efforts to gut the 2010 health care law and President Donald Trump's unpopularity will help that cause. \"It's all a consistent message: This is not what you were promised,\" says Chrissy Houlahan, a Democratic candidate in the suburban Philadelphia district of Republican Rep. Ryan Costello, who voted for the tax plan. He is one of Democrats' top GOP targets as they try to flip the 24 GOP-held seats necessary for a House majority. Republicans acknowledge dismal polling for their approach but count on a turnaround in public opinion as tax cuts for many take effect. A Wall-Street Journal/NBC News poll taken Dec. 13-15 found just 17 percent of respondents expect to pay less in taxes, while a third thought they'd pay more. Two-thirds of those polled said corporations would get breaks; more than half said rich people would get cuts. Indeed, the overhaul slashes the corporate rate from 35 to 21 percent, and adds generous deductions for certain types of businesses. Yet the plan also lowers individual rates and alters various deductions and credits. Results vary widely but the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center calculates that every income bracket will see gains in after-tax income, at least until some of provisions expire after 2025. The initial gains are estimated at about 0.5 percent for the bottom 20 percent of wage earners to about 2 percent for most of the top 20 percent. \"When Americans see they have more in their paycheck, we think they'll be appreciative,\" says Corry Bliss, who runs a political advocacy organization and a separate political action committee backed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. \"I think it sets up a wonderful contrast for the midterms.\" Suburban Democrats like Houlahan particularly object to a new cap on deductions for state and local taxes, along with limits on mortgage interest deductions. One provision limits a household to a maximum deduction of $10,000 in state and local taxes, including property levies. Interest calculated on mortgage debt beyond $750,000 also would not be deductible, down from the current $1 million cap. Those changes fall disproportionately on the nation's largest metro areas, particularly along the coasts, where median incomes are often much higher than the national benchmark but where residents also have considerably higher housing costs and local tax burdens. Such House districts feature prominently on Democrats' target list in 2018. Several are now represented by Republicans who voted against the final tax bill, like House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, who represents New Jersey's 11th congressional district. He cited the deductions cap in explaining his \"no\" vote. Frelinghuysen's potential general election opponent, Democrat Mikie Sherrill, said the congressman's overall support for Ryan and the GOP agenda still makes him \"complicit\" in the tax legislation. In California, Democratic House challenger Gil Cisneros plans to hammer Rep. Ed Royce for backing the bill. Cisneros acknowledges many filers will benefit from expanded standard deductions and a more generous child tax credit, but said the other changes will offset much of that. \"You can't buy votes with a few bucks in a paycheck,\" Cisneros says. Democrats beyond the higher-income, high-tax suburbs are bullish as well, leaning on more populist arguments on values and priorities, like the prospect that the tax cuts will increase the national debt. \"You can't have these kinds of cuts and keep the services that people expect,\" says Democrat Jim Ward, a Kansas state legislative leader who is running for governor. Republican-run Kansas, Ward says, is the perfect example for the potential fallout given the state's experience since Gov. Sam Brownback's sweeping tax cuts after he took office in 2011. Brownback, an acolyte of supply side economics, promised an economic boom once Kansas slashed personal income taxes for business owners and eliminated the top marginal personal income tax rate. What followed was a cratering in state revenues, followed by cuts to education and other services, along with increased debt and a lower state credit rating. Unlike states, the federal government can borrow for operating costs to avoid the steepest immediate cuts even if Republican promises of revenue growth don't materialize. But Ward points to Republicans' long-term proposals to overhaul popular but expensive programs like Social Security and Medicare. \"Day after day, services Kansans had taken for granted were shown not to be available,\" Ward recalls. \"The same thing can happen from Washington over the long term.\" Of course, Democrats won't have the campaign megaphone to themselves. Ten Senate Democrats must run for re-election next year in states Trump won. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, one of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's top recruits, is challenging incumbent Claire McCaskill, who joined 47 other Senate Democrats in unified opposition to the tax bill. In Hawley's campaign, the senator is now known as \"Claire McTaxall,\" complete with a website: clairemctaxall.com.",

And they cannot say it.\" The president offered his remarks just as House and Senate negotiators reached a compromise agreement in principle on the differences between their two versions of legislation.

No Democrats in the House or Senate voted for the GOP's tax bills.

            "article_content": "Top Democrats joined Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, on Thursday to introduce the party's latest economic proposal: raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024 and indexing it over time.\u00a0 \"I think under any definition that is a starvation wage,\" Sanders said. \"We have got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage. And what we are here today to say is that living wage is $15 an hour.\" \u00a0\u00a0 Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi. Others included co-sponsor Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, DNC Chairman Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Michigan, and Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, joined Sanders in introducing the bill. Sanders called for a $15 minimum wage when he ran for president. The last major attempt at federal minimum wage policy came in a 2015 bill sponsored by Murray and Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Virginia, which called for a gradual increase up to $12 by 2020.\u00a0 Timing of Thursday's event coincided with the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which increased the federal minimum wage level from $5.15 to today's $7.25. But that number, Sanders said, is too low and has seen its purchasing power diminish over the years.\u00a0 \"It is a radical concept for our Republican friends, but we believe in the United States of America ... if you work 40 hours a week or 50 hours a week, you should not be living in poverty,\" Sanders said. \u00a0 Scott said the House had 152 co-sponsors for the bill, which is almost 80 percent of Democrats in the chamber. \u00a0 During the event, Schumer issued a direct message to President Trump: \"We're here today to ask President Trump to stick up for working people by supporting our bill.\" He stressed that the bill would give nearly 40 million low-wage workers a raise.\u00a0 Pelosi reminisced at the event about her experience signing the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 into law. She alluded, though, to the political realities moving forward. \"I'll tell you one thing for sure. We win the election, in the first one-hundred hours, we will pass a $15 minimum wage,\" she said. \"We'd rather have it now. We'd rather win on the issue than worry about the election.\" The bill is another indication Democrats are continuing to reject the shrinking moderate arm of the party in favor of a more progressive platform, which picked up steam during the 2016 presidential primary with the rise of Sanders' candidacy.\u00a0 Given that Republicans control the House and Senate and do not favor a $15 minimum wage, this idea is not likely to be enacted. RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens told CBS News in a statement that Democrats are just \"embracing a policy that even liberal economists say will put Americans out of work.\" It shows, Ahrens said, that \"Democrats are more interested in playing politics than actually helping the middle class.\" The president has flip-flopped on the issue of the federal minimum wage, though he has also never supported a $15 minimum wage. In July 2016, Mr. Trump told former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that Sanders had lied about him at the Democratic National Convention, saying he would allow states to take the minimum wage below $7.25. \"I would leave it and raise it somewhat. You need to help people. And I know it's not really Republican to say, but you need to,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I would say 10. I would say 10 [dollars an hour].\"\u00a0",

Critics who tend to oppose media mergers say the Republican-controlled-FCC has paved the way for such TV industry consolidation by\u00a0relaxing ownership\u00a0rules for broadcasters. Late last year, Sinclair had to defend itself against news reports that it made a deal with Donald Trump's presidential campaign for favorable coverage in its newscasts. In a December statement, Sinclair said that it had no such deal with Trump's team and that it had given both him and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton \"the same opportunities to be interviewed by our local anchors on a regular basis.\" Hours after the tax plan was approved, AT&T (T) , Comcast (CMCSA), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Boeing (BA) \u2014 among other major companies \u2014 also announced plans to share a fraction of their bounty with workers. The moves pleased President Donald Trump, who has claimed the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts that largely favor the wealthy and businesses would ultimately help the middle class. But Democratic lawmakers and corporate watchdogs say the move is a public relations stunt that pales in comparison to the profits the companies' shareholders and executives will reap because of the lower tax rates. The stock market, as well, has risen on the belief the savings will largely go to investors, rather than workers. The tax cuts that both houses of Congress approved Wednesday has polled poorly with voters in part because it would appear to help major companies and concentrate much of its tax cuts with the top 5 percent of earners. Trump was quick to celebrate an announcement by Dallas-based AT&T that it would pay a $1,000 bonus to 200,000 workers once the tax legislation is signed into law. His praise came as the proposed $85 billion merger between AT&T and media giant and CNN owner Time Warner (TWX) is in limbo, after\u00a0the Justice Department sued to block the merger\u00a0on Nov. 20, saying it would harm competition, lessen innovation and result in higher costs for consumers.\u00a0 Outside the White House, Republican lawmakers clapped and cheered as Trump highlighted AT&T's planned bonus payments. \"That's because of what we did,\" Trump said. \"So that's pretty good. That's pretty good.\" The president suggested that other companies would be making similar announcements, saying \"We're going to see something that's very special.\" Comcast (CMCSA) said later on Wednesday that it will give $1,000 bonuses to more than 100,000 employees. Wells Fargo (WFC) said it will boost its minimum wage to $15 an hour, as well as donate $400 million to nonprofit and community organizations. Major government contractor Boeing said it will provide an additional $300 million for job-training, facility upgrades and charitable giving. The possibility of money going to workers helps to insulate Republicans against a possible backlash, although the bonuses so far are a far cry from the $4,000 in additional income each year that White House economists claimed would go to an average American family because of the corporate rate cuts. A White House official said the companies did not coordinate these announcements with Trumps' economics team. The official insisted on anonymity to discuss private conversations with the Associated Press. Trump has had an uneven relationship with corporate America since his election. He simultaneously met with CEOs for job announcements that enhanced his reputation as a dealmaker, but he also deployed a populist anger on Twitter to berate companies that crossed him. The business community initially embraced and courted Trump, only to back away after his failure to strongly condemn white nationalists whose August rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, lead to the death of a counter-protester. The tax overhaul permanently reduces the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, while also moving to a system that would exclude many foreign profits from taxation. The savings would generate billions of dollars in profits for companies, with economists generally estimating that roughly 75 percent would go to investors and 25 percent to workers. When it came to the tax overhaul, top White House economics aide Gary Cohn said at a Wednesday event with the media outlet Axios that the president \"cared a lot about the business rate.\" The stock market has soared in anticipation of the cuts with the expectation that they will lead to higher profits, bigger dividend payments and share buybacks. Shortly after the company announcements, the office of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement that the bonuses and higher minimum wages were \"the exception, not the rule, when it comes to the biggest corporations spending their windfall.\" Since the Senate passed their initial tax overhaul, 32 companies have announced share buybacks totaling $83.7 billion, Schumer's office said. Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said companies have been sitting on large cash holdings for years that easily could have gone to workers long before the tax cuts passed Wednesday. Chicago-based Boeing, for example, had $8.8 billion at the end of 2016. \"If these companies had wanted to make these investments in their workforce, they could have done it before now,\" Gardner said. \"They're trying to make an unpopular tax bill a little less unpopular.\" Wells Fargo, the San Francisco-based bank, would be a major beneficiary from the lower rates. Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that the tax cuts would add $3.7 billion to its annual net income. The bank has also been in Trump's sights after employees created fraudulent customer accounts that led to a $100 million fine by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Wells Fargo is facing an additional inquiry for wrongly charging fees to secure low mortgage rates. Trump said on Twitter this month that fines and penalties against the bank \"will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased.\" In addition to these companies, Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp said it will pay a $1,000 bonus to more than 13,500 employees, as well as raise the minimum wage for 3,000 of its workers to $15 an hour.",

            "article_content": "President Trump signed the sweeping $1.5 trillion tax cut bill minutes before he departed the White House for Mar-a-Lago Friday morning.\u00a0 \"We're very proud of it,\" Mr. Trump said of the measure, adding that it contains \"tremendous things\" for businesses, for workers, for the middle class and for job creation. Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office he had planned to wait for a formal signing event in January, but when he saw the news reports pointing out that he had said he'd sign by Christmas, he said he \"immediately\" called and said to get the bill ready to sign. He praised the measure for lowering corporate tax rates, which he said would mean more things would be made in the U.S. And he also singled out the \"one-year\" expensing provision in the bill. Companies, he said, would go \"wild\" about this. Under this provision, known as full expensing, companies can immediately write off the full cost of equipment they buy.\u00a0 The owner of the New England Patriots, Bob Kraft, according to the president, called him to praise the bill, and also said he would buy a factory in North Carolina to open a new paper plant. Mr. Trump also signed the continuing resolution to fund government spending into the new year. He also signed off on $4 billion for missile defense spending and put his signature on a related letter to GOP congressional leaders House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He claimed the measure was bigger than the tax cut legislation passed three decades ago under Ronald Reagan. Mr. Trump also thanked a list of people for passage of the bill, including McConnell, Ryan, Sens. Rob Portman and Tim Scott, House Ways and Means Chairman, and Kevin Brady. Since none of those lawmakers was present for the signing, the president offered the signing pens to members of the press, especially the cameramen. Mr. Trump predicted that Democrats would regret not supporting the GOP tax plan, but he predicted that there would be some bipartisan work possible in the months ahead. In particular, he singled out infrastructure, saying that \"infrastructure is by far the easiest.\" He went on to say, \"I could have started with infrastructure. I wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road.\" CBS News Chief White House correspondent Major Garrett points out that everything the president has achieved so far legislatively involves special rules that allowed the Senate to rely on a simple majority, rather than the higher threshold of 60 votes that is usually the rule. The rollback of Obama-era regulations, this tax bill, the Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch have all been passed with only Republican votes.\u00a0 Everything else the president wants to do -- raising military spending, repairing the nation's infrastructure, extending the children's health insurance program, addressing the plight of DACA recipients -- all of those can only be achieved with Democratic votes in the Senate, Garrett points out. All of them require genuine bipartisan compromise, a path the president has not taken so far. There are some, Garrett also said, who regret that the president didn't choose to push infrastructure spending first, suggesting that if he had started with infrastructure, it would have attracted Democratic votes and paved the way for more bipartisan legislation. Now, in an election year, with legislation passed that is entirely Republican, this could be more challenging. \"Will be signing the biggest ever Tax Cut and Reform Bill in 30 minutes in Oval Office,\" Mr. Trump tweeted earlier Friday. \"Will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.\" Garrett initially reported that the signing would be private, but at the last minute, the White House allowed pool reporters into the Oval Office to cover the signing. The president, having explained why he had originally planned to sign the bill after the new year, said of the impromptu signing event, \"It's not fancy, but it's the Oval Office.\" The White House plans an event to celebrate the signing early in the new year, in about two weeks, the president said.\u00a0 The timing of the president's signing of the bill had been uncertain until Congress passed a short-term spending bill that suspended the \"pay-go\" rule, which demands that measures like the tax cut legislation be paid for with automatic spending cuts to offset the cost. The $1.5 trillion tax measure would have required an average $150 billion in cuts over the next decade if the pay-go rule had not been waived. Earlier this week, Congress passed the tax bill, which permanently slashes corporate tax rates, and also cuts individual tax rates. Most Americans will get a tax cut, but not all. How households will fare varies widely. Families earning the same dollar amounts can pay vastly different income tax rates, depending on the particulars of their family and where their income comes from.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "With just ten days remaining in his presidency, President Obama on Tuesday night outlined his achievements in the White House and told Americans that U.S. democracy is under threat.  In his almost hour-long speech, a visibly emotional Mr. Obama argued that the country is at a pivotal point in its history -- and that forces beyond our control are threatening American democracy. What will keep the country together, he said, is a sense of \u201csolidarity.\u201d The speech seemed at times squarely aimed at his successor, President-elect Donald Trump -- despite the fact that Mr. Obama said Mr. Trump\u2019s name just one time.  \u201cThere have been moments throughout our history that threatened to rupture that solidarity -- the beginning of this century has been one of those times,\u201d he said. \u201cA shrinking world, growing inequality; demographic change and the specter of terrorism \u2013 these forces haven\u2019t just tested our security and prosperity, but they\u2019re testing our democracy as well.\u201d Mr. Obama acknowledged the tradition of a peaceful transition of power, saying he was committed to making it the \u201csmoothest possible.\u201d \u201cIn ten days, the world will witness a hallmark of our democracy: the peaceful transfer of power from one freely-elected president to the next,\u201d he said, to boos from the crowd. \u201cI committed to President-elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.\u201d He said it\u2019s normal and understandable for people to disagree on the best path forward for the country -- but outlined three potent forces working to challenge American democracy that will require unity of purpose going forward. One major threat, he said, is that of rising economic inequality and concern that government \u201conly serves the interests of the powerful.\u201d  \u201cOur economy doesn\u2019t work as well or grow as fast when a few prosper at the expense of a growing middle class and ladders for folks that want to get into the middle class,\u201d he said. \u201cBut stark inequality is also corrosive to our democratic principles.\u201d The second major threat to American democracy, Mr. Obama said, is the growing tension over race and diversity in the country. \u201cAfter my election, there was talk of a post-racial America,\u201d he said. \u201cSuch a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic -- for race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society.\u201d Quoting \u201cTo Kill A Mockingbird\u2019s\u201d Atticus Finch, Mr. Obama said people of all races must consider the positions and lives of others in order to be a truly unified society.  \u201cRegardless of the station we occupy, we all have to try harder,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all have to start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do, that they value hard work and family just like we do, that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own.\u201d And third, he said, American democracy is challenged by the fact that people are retreating further and further into their own respective \u201cbubbles\u201d of experience and opinion. \u201cPolitics is a battle of ideas: in the course of a healthy debate, we\u2019ll prioritize different goals, and the different means of reaching them,\u201d he said. \u201cBut without some common baseline of facts, without a willingness to admit new information, and concede that your opponent is making a fair point, and that science and reason matter -- then we\u2019re going to keep talking past each other, making common ground and compromise impossible.\u201d Mr. Obama spoke about the advances made on issues of national security and the fight against terrorism, noting that under his watch, the country has eliminated torture, worked to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center and killed terrorist Osama bin Laden. In addition, he said, no terrorist group has managed to pull off an attack on U.S. soil since he took office. \u201cNo foreign terrorist organization has successfully planned and executed an attack on our homeland these past eight years,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd although Boston and Orlando remind us of how dangerous radicalization can be, our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant than ever. We\u2019ve taken out tens of thousands of terrorists \u2013 including bin Laden.\u201d Still, he cautioned against the desire to \u201cwithdraw from global fights,\u201d an implicit nod to Mr. Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d tagline. \u201cThat\u2019s part of defending America,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the fight against extremism and intolerance and sectarianism and chauvinism are of a piece with the fight against authoritarianism and nationalist aggression.\u201d Mr. Obama nodded to George Washington\u2019s 1796 farewell address, in which he cautioned against forces that aim to \u201cweaken\u201d the United States\u2019 democratic aims. \u201cIt falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy, to embrace the joyous task we\u2019ve been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause for all our outward differences, we in fact all share the same proud title: the most important office in a democracy, citizen.\u201d And seemingly speaking to those who are disappointed in the results of the 2016 election, Mr. Obama encouraged people to get involved and stay involved when they see something they believe needs to be changed. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired of arguing with strangers on the internet, try to talk with one in real life,\u201d he said. \u201cIf something needs fixing, lace up your shoes and do some organizing. If you\u2019re disappointed by your elected officials, grab a clipboard, get some signatures, and run for office yourself.\u201d \u201cShow up,\u201d he continued. \u201cDive in. Stay at it.\u201d Wiping back tears, Mr. Obama thanked his family and Vice President Joe Biden. First Lady Michelle Obama and daughter Malia Obama both appeared to crying as well. To Michelle Obama, he said his wife has been not just a wife and mother but \u201cmy best friend.\u201d \u201cYou made the White House a place that belongs to everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd a new generation sets its sights higher because it has you as a role model.\u201d As for his daughters, Sasha and Malia, Mr. Obama said they \u201cwore the burden of years in the spotlight so easily.\u201d Sasha was absent from the speech. He also thanked Vice President Joe Biden, saying choosing him as a running mate is the first and \u201cbest\u201d decision he made in 2008 and saying that he considers Biden a \u201cbrother.\u201d At the end of his speech, Mr. Obama came back to the words that became a rallying cry for his 2008 campaign: \u201cYes We Can.\u201d \u201cI am asking you to hold fast to that faith written into our founding documents; that idea whispered by slaves and abolitionists, that spirit sung by immigrants and homesteaders and those who marched for justice, that creed reaffirmed by those who planted flags from foreign battlefields to the surface of the moon, a creed at the core of every American whose story is not yet written,\u201d he said. \u201cYes We Can,\u201d Mr. Obama concluded. \u201cYes We Did. Yes We Can.\u201d Emily Schultheis is a reporter/editor for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "Hours after the House Republicans passed a tax bill Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee approved their tax bill, pushing it closer to a full vote on the Senate floor. The Finance Committee approved the bill along party line 14-12, with not one Democrat voting for it. Like the House measure, it would slash the corporate tax rate and reduce personal income tax rates for many.\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier this week that he plans to bring the bill to the Senate floor after the Thanksgiving recess. The Senate adjourned Thursday night for Thanksgiving and will reconvene on Monday, Nov. 27. But it remains unclear if Republicans have the votes for it to pass.\u00a0 The Senate package adds a key feature not in the House version: repeal of the Affordable Care Act's requirement that everyone in the U.S. have health insurance. Elimination of the so-called individual mandate would add an estimated $338 billion in revenue over 10 years that the Senate tax-writers used for other tax cuts.\u00a0 The Senate panel's vote came at the end of four days of often fierce partisan debate. It turned angrily personal for Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) as he railed against Democrats' accusations that the legislation was crafted to favor big corporations and the wealthy.  \"I come from the poor people. And I've been working my whole stinking career for people who don't have a chance,\" Hatch insisted.  After the panel's approval,\u00a0 McConnell declared, \"For the millions of hard-working Americans who need more money in their pockets and the chance of a better future, help is on the way.\"\u00a0 The analysts' problematic projections for the Senate bill came a day after Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson became the first GOP senator to state opposition to the measure, saying it didn't cut levies enough for millions of partnerships and corporations. With at least five other Republican senators yet to declare support, the bill's fate is far from certain in a chamber the GOP controls by just 52-48.\u00a0 Even so, Republicans are hoping to send a compromise bill for President Trump to sign by Christmas. Mr. Trump took to Twitter early Friday morning to comment: Great numbers on Stocks and the Economy. If we get Tax Cuts and Reform, we'll really see some great results! After the House vote, Vice President Pence remarked\"Now the ball is in the Senate's court.\" Speaking at a conservative Tax Foundation dinner in Washington, Pence said, \"The next few weeks are going to be vitally important and they're going to be a challenge.\" But he added, \"we're going to get it done\" before the end of the year.\u00a0 An earlier White House statement that \"now is the time to deliver\" also underscored the Republican Party's effort to maintain momentum and outrace critics. Those include the AARP lobby for older people, major medical organizations, Realtors - and, in all likelihood, every Senate Democrat.  With this summer's crash of the GOP effort to dismantle President Barack Obama's health care law, Republicans see a successful tax effort as the best way to avert major losses in next year's congressional elections. House Republicans conceded they are watching the Senate warily.  \"Political survival depends on us doing this,\" said Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. \"One of the things that scares me a little bit is that they're going to screw up the bill to the point we can't pass it.\"  The House plan and the Senate Finance bill would deliver the bulk of their tax reductions to businesses.  Each would cut the 35 percent corporate tax rate to 20 percent, while reducing personal rates for many taxpayers and erasing or shrinking deductions. Projected federal deficits would grow by $1.5 trillion over 10 years.  As decades of Republicans have done before them, GOP lawmakers touted their tax cuts as a boon to families across all income lines and a boost for businesses, jobs and the entire country.  \"Passing this bill is the single biggest thing we can do to grow the economy, to restore opportunity and help those middle income families who are struggling,\" said House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin.  Democrats said the measure would disproportionately help the wealthy and mean tax increases for millions. Among other things, the House legislation would reduce and ultimately repeal the tax Americans pay on the largest inheritances, while the Senate would limit that levy to fewer estates.  The bill is \"pillaging the middle class to pad the pockets of the wealthiest and hand tax breaks to corporations shipping jobs out of America,\" declared House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California.  Thirteen House Republicans - all but one from high-tax California, New York and New Jersey - voted \"no\" because the plan would erase tax deductions for state and local income and sales taxes and limit property tax deductions to $10,000. Defectors included House Appropriations Committee Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., who said the measure would \"hurt New Jersey families.\"  Trump traveled to the Capitol before the vote to give House Republicans a pep talk.  Besides Johnson, Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona, Bob Corker of Tennessee and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have yet to commit to backing the tax measure.  Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the Senate plan would mean higher taxes beginning in 2021 for many families earning under $30,000 annually. By 2027, families making less than $75,000 would face tax boosts while those making more would enjoy cuts.  Republicans attributed the new figures to two provisions.  One would end the measure's personal tax cuts starting in 2026. The other would abolish the \"Obamacare\" requirement that people buy health coverage or pay tax penalties.  Eliminating those fines is expected to mean fewer people would obtain federally subsidized policies, and the tax analysts count a reduction in those subsidies as a tax increase. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that would result in 13 million more uninsured people by 2027, making the provision a political risk for some lawmakers.  Ending the personal tax cuts for individuals in 2026, derided as a gimmick by Democrats, is designed to pare the bill's long-term costs to the Treasury. Legislation cannot boost budget deficits after 10 years if it is to qualify for Senate procedures that bar bill-killing filibusters.  Both chambers' bills would nearly double the standard deduction to around $12,000 for individuals and about $24,000 for married couples and dramatically boost the current $1,000 per-child tax credit.  But each plan also would erase the current $4,050 personal exemption and annul or reduce other tax breaks. The House would limit interest deductions to future home mortgages of up to $500,000, down from today's $1 million, while the Senate would end deductions like moving expenses and tax preparation.  Ryan said he'd seek to add tax breaks to help Puerto Rico recover from recent hurricanes to a House-Senate compromise.",

            "article_content": "The Senate is expected to take one step closer this week to crafting tax reform legislation with the passage of a budget resolution.  After a series of votes throughout the week on amendments, the bill is likely to pass the upper chamber. But before lawmakers can roll up their sleeves and begin writing language to fill out the tax framework, House and Senate Republicans must first work out the differences between their two budgets, potentially in a conference committee, congressional aides told CBS News. The Budget Committees in both the House and Senate have passed GOP-sponsored budget resolutions. The House passed its proposal on Oct. 5 in a 219-206 vote. The Senate voted this week to open debate on the House-passed bill and will amend it so that it looks like the version that the Senate panel passed. A final Senate vote on the budget is expected later this week.  If and when the Senate passes its budget blueprint, Republicans in both chambers will have to hash out the differences between their resolutions. After that, the House and Senate would each vote on the agreement. After that, the specified authorizing committees would then start writing up tax reform bills in each chamber.  There are significant differences between the two GOP budget plans. The Senate budget would direct the Senate Finance Committee to find $1.5 trillion in tax cuts over the next decade and relies on a single committee, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to reduce the deficit by $1 billion over that period.\u00a0 The House budget, by contrast, contains reconciliation instructions to 11 different committees and directs them to find at least $203 billion in savings and reforms to mandatory programs.\u00a0 The Senate budget calls for $5.1 trillion in spending cuts over the next 10 years, reducing non-defense discretionary spending by $632 billion during that time.\u00a0 The House blueprint, which aims to cut improper payments across the government by $700 billion, incorporates the House-passed Obamacare repeal bill and all of its savings. It would also make changes to entitlement programs, calling for a partial privatization of Medicare and cuts to Medicaid. The Senate doesn't touch those entitlement programs.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said Tuesday that the Senate GOP's plan calls for doubling the standard deduction, significantly increasing the child tax credit, eliminating loopholes used by the wealthy and providing relief to small businesses.  \"Our current tax code is archaic, it's arduous, and it's often bizarre. It holds our economy back and it can hold workers' wages down. It actually incentivizes companies to ship jobs and profits overseas. And it makes it easier for the wealthy and well-connected to game the system, yet is almost impossible for anyone else to understand,\" McConnell said.\u00a0 Republicans want to lower the corporate tax rate to increase U.S. competitiveness with other countries, as well as provide tax cuts for individual Americans. \"Above all, our goal is this: we want to take more money out of Washington's pockets and put more into the pockets of the middle class \u2014 in Kentucky, and across our country,\" McConnell said. Administration officials and members of Congress were looking to the end of the year as the deadline to enact a tax reform package. But time is running out. The House and Senate are only slated to be in session for roughly 30 more legislative days through the end of the year.  In an interview Tuesday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney emphasized that the Senate must pass its budget by this Friday if Republicans want to check tax reform off of their agenda this year.  \"In order to get that done, we really do need to stay on schedule. It means we need to pass this budget on Friday. If you don't pass the budget on Friday, it doesn't mean tax reform is done forever. It means we are off of schedule,\" Mulvaney said in an interview with Fox News Radio.  Congress has a long to-do list that includes funding the government past Dec. 8, passing a budget deal to raise spending caps and extending the Obamacare cost-sharing subsidy payments. Lawmakers also still have to come up with a legislative fix for the Deferred Action in Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, as well. But the tax plan is critical for Republicans politically. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, warned Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that failing to enact a tax overhaul would hurt the GOP's chances in the 2018 midterm elections next November.  \"If we don't, we're dead,\" Graham said when asked if Republicans will get tax reform done.  Similarly, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, warned last week that Republicans could face a \"Watergate-style blowout\" if they fail to enact any major part of their agenda. \"If we do nothing, if tax reform crashes and burns, if Obamacare nothing happens, we could face a bloodbath. I think we have the potential of seeing a Watergate-style blowout,\" the Texas Republican said at a Koch brothers donors meeting at the St. Regis Hotel in New York.

            "article_content": "A battle over unionizing a Nissan auto assembly plant in Mississippi may reach far beyond one factory.\u00a0 Workers are voting on whether they want the United Auto Workers union to bargain for them. The vote comes at a time when the union has struggled to expand beyond its stronghold at Detroit automakers to foreign-owned plants, especially in the southern United States.\u00a0 Aside from potentially revitalizing organized labor, the vote is taking on a racial element, according to The New York Times. The union has reached out to black leaders, while The Nation notes the union's campaign has linked unionization to the quest for racial justice.\u00a0 Voting among roughly 3,700 production workers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Canton assembly complex concludes at 7 p.m. Friday. The National Labor Relations Board is conducting the secret-ballot election after workers filed for UAW representation in July. Pro-union workers say the UAW would protect them against arbitrary treatment, and bargain for better benefits and pay. Managers say the UAW would make the plant less economically competitive. ALBATROSS OR PROTECTOR? Opponents have focused on claims that the UAW has been an albatross for Detroit automakers, implicitly or explicitly blaming the union for struggles at Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant posted a picture of a bombed-out industrial building Wednesday night on his Facebook page, stating, \"I hope the employees at Nissan Canton understand what the UAW will do to your factory and town. Just ask Detroit. Vote no on the union.\" That's part of a line of reasoning that suggests a unionized Nissan might lay off employees or even close the $3.3 billion plant it opened in 2003. Union supporters, though, say it's unfair to blame them for the Detroit Three's troubles, saying managers made the decisions on what vehicles to produce and were slow to react to increased competition. At least one Michigan congressman, Democratic U.S. Rep. Dale Kildee, has taken offense at Bryant's characterization. He says GM has invested billions in his district, which includes Flint, in the past decade. \"When workers have a voice, middle-class families win,\" Kildee said. ORGANIZING THE TRANSPLANTS The UAW has failed to organize foreign-owned auto assembly plants in the United States, reducing the union's bargaining power in the industry as Detroit automakers lose market share and close plants. This is the first time workers in Canton have voted on a union, but their Nissan counterparts in Smyrna, Tennessee, rejected the UAW in 1989 and 2001. The UAW also lost a 2014 vote among all workers at Volkswagen in 2014 before winning a second vote among 160 maintenance technicians. The UAW has failed in its efforts to represent workers at plants operated by Honda, Toyota, Mercedes and BMW. Since Mitsubishi closed its plant in Normal, Illinois, in 2016, no foreign-owned auto assembly plants employ workers broadly represented by the UAW. POLITICAL OVERTONES Bryant and Kildee are far from the only political actors to weigh in on the Nissan vote. Former Vice President Joe Biden, independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez are among the union backers. In a videoconference Tuesday, Sanders told UAW supporters that the company should: \"Start treating your workers with the respect and the dignity that they deserve. Give your workers a seat at the bargaining table. Give your workers the freedom to join a union, so that as a nation we can stop the race to the bottom.\" Those opposing the union include Americans for Prosperity, the political arm of the conservative Koch brothers' network. The Mississippi chapter sent 25,000 mailers to Jackson-area homes saying \"tell UAW 'No Thanks,'\" and has bought radio, billboard and internet ads. Business groups including Mississippi's chamber of commerce and the National Association Manufacturers have weighed in against the union.",

            "article_content": "In an attempt to garner support for Senate Republicans' health care plan, the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), the Indiana Republican Party issued a call for residents to share their \"Obamacare horror stories\" on its Facebook page.  Did you lose a doctor that you liked? Have your premiums increased? Did your insurer leave the exchange? Are burdensome... The responses, however, were not exactly what they had hoped for. \"Unable to purchase health insurance on the private market due to pre-existing conditions, we have affordable coverage now with great doctors and great care,\" wrote Kim Wheeler. \"Thanks to ACA I was able to find coverage while I was unemployed,\" commented Todd Sanzone. \"ACA enabled my self-employed relatives to get great insurance coverage at affordable rates,\" said Phyllis Kai-Kee. \"Great service, too. No horrors. Just greatness.\" \"My premiums went way down and I didn't need to switch any doctors, Obamacare has been the great thing in my life,\" added Harry Leaf. The post, many of which received an overwhelming majority of comments in support of the Affordable Care Act, was shared over 5,000 times and got over 7,000 responses from commenters.\u00a0 While few posts actually had a \"horror story\" to share, some pressed Republicans to fix the ACA's shortcomings, like Laura Ann Williams who urged the GOP to \"fix it and make it better\" or Shonnessy Gilmore who said the ACA \"needs tweaking.\" Kyle Hupfer, Indiana Republican Party State Chairman, told CBS News in a statement that the responses supporting the ACA were prompted by DNC-affiliated groups sharing the post over social media.\u00a0 \"This is what you would expect when Democratic National Committee affiliated groups begin to share the message across social media and ask their folks to engage,\" said Hupfer. He added, \"What we know is that these responses do not represent the majority of Hoosiers who, when asked, time and time again say they want Obamacare repealed.\" Pete Seat, Executive Director of Strategic Communications for the Indiana Republican Party, echoed Hupfer's statement, telling CBS News that the page had in fact received \"a number of responses via private message and email\" that were not included in the comments.\u00a0 \"There are those who view health care as a deeply personal and private matter and wanted to share their story accordingly,\" added Seat.\u00a0 Meanwhile, John Zody, Indiana Democratic Party Chair told CBS News on Wednesday, \"Hoosiers know the ACA isn't perfect, but we'll tell whoever's asking online that we're thrilled hundreds of thousands of our friends and neighbors can now receive affordable care through HIP 2.0's Medicaid expansion, or that insurers can no longer discriminate against pre-existing conditions.\"\u00a0 He added, \u00a0\"The overwhelming majority of Hoosiers want to protect and improve the ACA, and we'll stand against Republican attempts to take away healthcare from 22 million Americans.\" Sabrina Singh, DNC Deputy Communications Director added in a statement that the Republicans plan \"clearly backfired\" as thousands expressed their support for the ACA. \"Poll after poll shows dwindling support for this Republican bill that is unconscionably cruel and would hurt America's workers, women, children, seniors and middle class families, all while the wealthiest Americans cash in from big tax breaks. Republicans who support this bill will be held accountable by their constituents from now until Election Day.\" According to a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released late last month, a majority of the public currently disapprove of the Senate's replacement for the ACA. The survey found that of 1,205 adults between June 21 and 25 surveyed, 55 percent of people said they disapprove of the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), while 17 percent said that they approve of the measure. About a quarter, meanwhile, said they hadn't heard enough about the plan to have an opinion on it. While lawmakers are back home for the July 4 recess, some Republicans have been facing angry constituents at town halls\u00a0and public events, including Senator Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, who twenty minutes into one event, was called on to \"vote against that hideous bill,\" according to The Hill newspaper.\u00a0 Republicans who have come out against the bill, including Sens. Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia and Rob Portman of Ohio, have been avoiding public events altogether around the July 4 holiday weekend.\u00a0 Just before the recess, Republican leadership delayed a vote on the legislation until after the week-long break, when it was clear the bill lacked enough support to pass.\u00a0 Emily Tillett is the digital producer at \"Face the Nation\"",

            "article_content": "CHICAGO -- Illinois is hours away from entering its third fiscal year without a state budget, territory that could mean some universities won't be able to offer federal financial aid, road construction and Powerball ticket sales will halt, and the state's credit rating will be downgraded to \"junk.\" Lawmakers are meeting Friday to try to end an impasse between Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats who control the legislature that started when the first-term governor took office in 2015 promising change. But a deal appears unlikely before the Saturday start of the next fiscal year. Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who controls the state's checkbook, said: \"Derailment is imminent.\" Rauner has said he'll keep legislators at work in Springfield until they can reach an agreement, continuing a special session that is costing taxpayers up to $48,000 per day. Here's a look at the situation: HOW BAD IS IT? No other state has come close to the mess that Illinois is in. Some states have gone months without a budget -- Pennsylvania had a nine-month impasse that ended last year. But Illinois' stalemate has been unprecedented since it reached a full year. Illinois already has the lowest credit rating of any U.S. state, and it owes more than $15 billion in late payments to vendors, including doctors who provide health care to state employees and social service agencies that care for disabled people. Some homeless and domestic violence shelters have been forced to close or reduce services, and some medical offices are no longer seeing patients on state insurance unless they pay cash up front. Universities have laid off thousands of employees. Illinois also owes school districts millions of dollars for transportation, special education and other expenses. WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES? If there's no budget by Saturday, S&P Global Ratings has said it will likely downgrade Illinois' credit rating to below investment grade. That would make Illinois the first U.S. state to be assigned \"junk\" status, and increase the cost to taxpayers when the state borrows money. The Illinois Department of Transportation has said nearly 700 roadwork projects would stop, putting an estimated 25,000 people out of work, because the state can't spend money collected through the gas tax without the Legislature approving an appropriation. The Higher Learning Commission, which accredits schools in the Midwest, has warned the ongoing lack of funding could cause some universities to lose their accreditation. Southern Illinois University President Randy Dunn said that would mean the colleges wouldn't be able to offer federal loans and grants to students, causing more to choose colleges in other states. \"We're going into very dangerous territory,\" Dunn said. HOW IT HAPPENED Rauner, a former private equity investor, won election in 2014 on an anti-tax, pro-business agenda. He promised to shake things up, once even suggesting it might require a government shutdown. As he was inaugurated, a temporary, four-year Democratic income tax increase that had provided up to $7 billion extra a year was allowed to expire, and the tax rate rolled back. Revenues fell far short of spending and red ink piled up. Rauner has demanded cost-cutting changes to workers' compensation laws, which he says are needed to lure businesses to Illinois. He also wants a freeze on local property taxes, which are among the highest in the nation. Democrats, who have large majorities in the Legislature, argue that Rauner's demands are an attack on the middle class. They say a property tax freeze would hurt school districts, which rely heavily on property tax. HOW HAS ILLINOIS GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT? Even without a budget, Illinois has been spending billions of dollars more than the state is taking in each year because of state laws, court orders and agreements, and because legislators haven't passed a budget that takes into account the rollback of the temporary income tax increase. Schools have stayed open because in 2015, Rauner vetoed everything in the budget Democrats sent him except a K-12 education bill. Last year, lawmakers approved a temporary \"stop-gap\" plan allowing schools to open on time. Courts ruled that roughly 63,000 employees should continue to get state paychecks, and consent decrees and other orders require Medicaid and other payments, though many of those payments have been delayed. But the days of being able to eke by are about to end. Mendoza, the state comptroller, warned this week that without a budget, the state by August will have $185 million more in state-mandated and court-ordered payments than it will have revenue to pay them. She said that would make \"the unthinkable\" - such as delaying pension payments or not paying state workers - very likely. \"Illinoisans must brace for maximum impact,\" she said.",

Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, criticized wealth inequality, political corruption, racism and the criminal justice system.  \"In the last 17 years, while the middle class continues to decline, we have seen a ten-fold increase in the number of billionaires,\" Sanders, a Brooklyn native, said. \"Today in America, CEOs are earning almost 300 times what the average worker makes. And in terms of income, while you and your parents are working in some cases 2 or 3 jobs, 52 percent of all new income generated today goes to the top 1 percent.\"  It was a critique heard often when Sanders ran for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, although Sanders made no mention of President Trump in the commencement speech.  Sanders, who identifies as a democratic socialist but caucuses with the Democratic Party, also took aim at America's massive prison population, which by some measurements is the largest in the world.  \"Because of poverty and racism, today in a broken criminal justice system, we have more people in jail than any other country on earth,\" Sanders said. \"And those people are disproportionately black, Latino, and Native American.\"  Sanders also recalled his own experiences growing up in Brooklyn as the son of immigrants.  \"From those experiences growing up without a lot of money, I have never forgotten that there are millions of people through this country who struggle to put food on the table, pay the electric bill, try to save for the kids' education, or their retirements\u2026people, who against great odds, are fighting to live in dignity,\" Sanders said.  Sanders, who is now perhaps the single most popular politician in the country, spent years as a backbencher in the House of Representatives before his election to the Senate in 2006.

            "article_content": "It\u2019s no secret that automated machines and robots are rapidly replacing human workers.\u00a0 In Europe, concerns about the loss of good-paying jobs to automation is so strong that the idea of a universal basic income is gaining traction. France, for one example, could lose three million jobs by 2025 due to automation, a former education minister campaigning for the French presidency has argued. The topic has been front of mind this week for participants at the World Economic Forum\u2019s annual summit in Davos, Switzerland. There, CBS News asked business leaders to look past the hope and hype of artifical intelligence and reflect on the negatives of automation.\u00a0 Felix Marquardt, president international at Cylance, emphasized that the growth of artifical intelligence makes an education system overhaul more urgent than ever.\u00a0 \u201cThe question truly is: are our educational systems ready for the challenges posed by A.I.?\u201d Marquardt said. \u201cOur schools are still primarily churning out job seekers, when what we need is for them to churn out job creators. Entrepreneurship needs to be much more seriously taught.\u201d Cylance is an antivirus software built on a platform powered by artificial intelligence and machine learning.\u00a0 Ryan Permeh, chief scientist and co-founder of Cylance, put the issue in historical perspective, emphasizing that markets have adapted to widespread automation before.\u00a0 \u201cThe reality is is that it\u2019s also opening up a large number of jobs -- certain areas are going to shrink and certain areas are going to grow. We saw this with every industrial revolution,\u201d Permeh said. The loss of good-paying jobs to rapidly expanding automation has enormous political consequences. It\u2019s a point President Obama has made throughout his presidency, but particularly emphasized in his final weeks in office.\u00a0 In an extensive interview with The New Yorker directly after Donald Trump\u2019s election, the president forecast the dramatic economic disruption ahead. \u201c...At some point, when the problem is not just Uber but driverless Uber, when radiologists are losing their jobs to A.I., then we\u2019re going to have to figure out how do we maintain a cohesive society and a cohesive democracy in which productivity and wealth generation are not automatically linked to how many hours you put in, where the links between production and distribution are broken, in some sense,\u201d Mr. Obama said. Mr. Obama hammered home the same point last week in his\u00a0farewell address, warning that \u201cthe next wave of economic dislocations won\u2019t come from overseas.\u201d \u201cIt will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good, middle-class jobs obsolete,\u201d he said, and repeated his call for a \u201cnew social compact\u201d to protect Americans from sliding into poverty as a result.\u00a0 Bob Moritz, CEO of professional services firm PwC, struck a hopeful note. Based off his conversations with CEOs, companies will always be in the market for what robots cannot provide, Moritz said.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re still looking for creativity, because that can\u2019t be coded,\u201d he said. \u201cRobotics and computers and coding actually gives you a very straight and narrow path to go down a fine course. The world we\u2019re living in today is a lot more zig zag, and people are going to be important to that equation to solve for those problems.\u201d Reporting for CBS News from Davos, Switzerland: Lulu Chiang, Lauren Hoenemeyer and Gilad Thaler \u00a0 Shanika Gunaratna covers science and technology for CBSNews.com",

Since winning the election, Mr. Trump has repeatedly challenged the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other political sites. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear about what took place here about Russia involvement in efforts to hack information and to have an impact on American democracy,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI\u2019m very clear-eyed about what that intelligence report says.\u201d \u201cThis was an aggressive action taken by the senior leaders inside Russia,\u201d Pompeo said. On Wednesday, Trump acknowledged Russia was responsible for the hacking but speculated that intelligence agencies might have leaked to news organizations details about a classified briefing with him that included unsubstantiated allegations that Russia had collected compromising sexual and financial information about him. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, asked Pompeo to comment on what King said were \u201cvery serious allegations\u201d about Mr. Trump\u2019s ties with Russia. \u201cI share your view that these are unsubstantiated media reports,\u201d Pompeo said, adding that he thought the leaks themselves were \u201cintensely serious.\u201d Pompeo pledged to investigate the allegations and \u201cpursue the facts where ever they take us.\u201d Pompeo also said that countering Russian President Vladimir Putin will require a \u201crobust American response.\u201d In his opening remarks, Pompeo talked about Russia\u2019s activities in other places around the world and suggested that the United States needs to remain wary of Moscow\u2019s intentions. \u201cRussia has reasserted itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe and doing nothing to aid in the defeat of ISIS,\u201d Pompeo said, referring to Islamic State militants. And asked whether he considers Wikileaks, which posted thousands of the hacked emails from the DNC and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, to be a credible source of information, Pompeo said he did not. \u201cI have never believed that Wikileaks is credible,\u201d he said. \u201c... I have some deep understanding of Wikileaks and I have never viewed it as a credible source of information for the United States or anyone else.\u201d Pompeo also broke with Mr. Trump on the issue of torture: Mr. Trump indicated at several points during the campaign that he would be interested in bringing back waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques. Asked whether he would comply if Mr. Trump asked him to reintroduce those techniques, Pompeo replied: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that I would be asked that by the President-elect or, then, the President,\u201d he said, adding that there is \u201cno doubt in my mind about the limitations\u201d the law places on torture. \u201cI\u2019ll always comply with the law,\u201d he said. Adding a little drama to the hearing, the lights went out in a Senate hearing room when the top Democrat on the committee mentioned Russia. The committee went into recess. When the lights didn\u2019t go back on, the hearing was moved to a different building. The remarks by Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., were on the committee\u2019s promise to review the intelligence behind an assessment that Russia, and specifically Putin, interfered in the presidential election in an effort to get Mr. Trump elected. On other issues, Pompeo said North Korea has dangerously accelerated its nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. He called the conflict in Syria a tragic humanitarian catastrophe that has led to the rise of extremism and sectarianism and has destabilized the Middle East and Europe. And he said Iran has become an \u201ceven more emboldened and disruptive player in the Middle East.\u201d Pompeo has been critical of the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran, which granted Tehran sanctions relief for rolling back its nuclear weapons program. \u201cWhile I opposed the Iran deal as a member of Congress, if confirmed, my role will change,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cI will lead the agency to aggressively pursue collection operations and ensure analysts have the time, political space and resources to make objective and sound judgments.\u201d Pompeo was a vocal member of the partisan House committee set up to investigate the deadly attack on a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012, which occurred while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. He told the committee that he understands that as CIA director he would have to make the transition from a partisan, policymaking lawmaker to an objective intelligence collector. Pompeo graduated first in the Class of 1986 at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He served in the Army at a time when the Soviet Union was America\u2019s main adversary. As a member of the House intelligence committee, Pompeo traveled widely and met many intelligence professionals. \u201cI have spent the majority of my life outside politics - as a U.S. Army cavalry officer, litigator and head of two manufacturing businesses,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cReturning to duty that requires hard work and unerring candor is something that is in my bones.\u201d",

            "article_content": "If it\u2019s universally acknowledged that a single man with a good fortune needs a wife, the American economy may be now illustrating the inverse of that corollary: Poor men with dwindling job prospects are going to lack marriage prospects.\u00a0 The decline of the institution of marriage has been studied by social scientists and policymakers, but new economic research from MIT economics professor David Autor and his colleagues points to labor issues that helped Donald Trump win the presidential election: The decline of American manufacturing and the rise of Chinese imports. As manufacturing jobs dried up over the last few decades, blue-collar men have suffered from lower income, fewer job opportunities and the increased likelihood of risky behavior, which in turn has hurt their marriage prospects, Autor and his co-authors wrote in a paper published at the National Bureau of Economic research. Trade shocks to the manufacturing sector are \u201cparticularly destabilizing to marriage-markets,\u201d they wrote, although they caution that heightened trade competition from China isn\u2019t the sole or even the main catalyst for the trends.\u00a0 \u201cTrade shocks reduce the availability and desirability of potentially marriageable young men along multiple dimensions,\u201d wrote Autor and his co-authors, David Dorn of University of Zurichand and Gordon Hanson of University of California, San Diego. It\u2019s not only that young working-class men are less marriageable when jobs dry up, but that some of these men are actually disappearing, the paper noted. When Chinese imports take a greater share of trade, the ratio of young men to women declines by 1.7 percentage points, they found. The study examined population shifts in commuting zones, or the 722 regions that cover the continental U.S. and represent a regional economic area.\u00a0 Where are these young men going? Many are turning to risky behaviors such as heavy drinking and drug use. Trade shocks are leading to higher mortality rates for young men, which explains some -- but not all -- of the imbalance. Young men are also disappearing because they\u2019re incarcerated, homeless or migrating to other areas to find better job opportunities.\u00a0 The research doesn\u2019t paint a pretty picture, but it\u2019s one that may be familiar to many Americans in rural areas or in cities that once relied on manufacturing. Rustbelt cities and rural regions are struggling to cope with a rise in opioid addictions, such as the\u00a0record-breaking 52 overdoses\u00a0in Louisville, Kentucky, in 32 hours earlier this month.\u00a0 Drug use is also taking a toll on middle-age Americans. Two years ago, research from Princeton professors Angus Deaton and Anne Case grabbed headlines with their finding that white middle-age Americans are dying at higher rates because of suicide, addiction, liver disease and other afflictions.\u00a0 While the cause isn\u2019t clear, some economists believe it\u2019s tied to fewer economic opportunities for white, blue-collar Americans. One clue that supports a link to dwindling job prospects and lower incomes is that the mortality spike affected white, middle-age Americans with high-school degrees or less, while college-educated workers saw lower death rates.\u00a0 Since the recession, incomes for college grads have recovered, while less-educated Americans have seen their incomes decline 3 percent, according to the Economic Policy Institute. The income gap between college grads and high school grads now stands at 56 percent, the widest since 1973, the EPI found.\u00a0 That meshes with the problems facing younger American men who lack college degrees. In 1990, more than 17 percent of men between 18 to 39 worked in manufacturing, but by 2007 that had declined to about 11 percent, Autor and his co-researchers found. Fewer job opportunities reduce \u201cthe supply of young men who would likely be judged as good marital prospects,\u201d they noted.\u00a0 While more Americans are getting married later or even skipping marriage altogether, another trend has emerged in the last few decades: the so-called marriage gap. This phenomenon dovetails with education as college grads not only enjoy more income but more successful marriages.\u00a0 College-educated Americans are today more likely to be married than their counterparts with less education, at 65 percent to 53 percent, according to the Pew Research Center. Women with college degrees are more likely to have successful marriages, with almost 8 out of 10 in marriages lasting 20 years or more, compared with just 4 out of 10 marriages for women with high school diplomas.\u00a0 Whether President Trump can make good on his promise to revive American manufacturing is debatable. Many economists point to headwinds from automation as reducing the likelihood that factory jobs will return in force.\u00a0 Interestingly, lower-income workers are the most worried that their jobs will disappear because of automation, according to a new survey of 2,000 American adults from tech company LivePerson. It also found that Americans largely believe that factory workers are most at risk to lose their jobs to automation within 20 years, followed by store cashiers. While Mr. Trump pledges he\u2019ll bring back manufacturing, it appears many workers aren\u2019t as convinced his plans will materialize.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "JACKSON, Miss. -- A Mississippi school is shedding the name of the Confederacy's only president and will instead be named for the first African-American president of the United States. Davis International Baccalaureate Elementary School in Jackson was named decades ago for Jefferson Davis. The school, which has a 98 percent African-American enrollment, is set to be renamed for Barack Obama in the next academic year, in a move proposed by parents and approved by a majority of students, parents, faculty and staff members. The PTA president, Janelle Jefferson, announced the planned change at a school board meeting Tuesday. \"The students had overwhelming support for President Obama,\" Jefferson told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \"The school community wanted to rename the campus to reflect a person who fully represents ideals and public stances consistent with what we want our children to believe about themselves,\" CBS Jackson affiliate WJTV quotes her as saying. She said a three-week process led to the vote. People at the school offered suggestions for new names. Students in each class, from kindergarten through fifth grade, conducted research and presented it at a school assembly. Fourth- and fifth-graders oversaw an election with students, teachers and staff casting paper ballots at school. Parents could vote on campus or by absentee ballot. \"We wanted to be very inclusive and transparent in the process to be fair, to make sure everybody felt like they had a voice,\" Jefferson said. The magnet school has an admissions process based on testing, and it offers a rigorous curriculum. State rankings released Tuesday show it was the top academic performer of all elementary and middle schools in Mississippi for 2016-17. About 96 percent of students in Jackson Public Schools are African-American. Jed Oppenheim, a school board member, said people have been asking for years why three schools in a majority African-American district are still named for Confederate figures. In mid-September, the board authorized the PTA at each of the three schools to set new names. The change from Davis to Obama is the only one approved so far. George Elementary is named for James Zachariah George, who signed Mississippi's secession ordinance and drafted the state constitution that denied voting rights to black citizens. Lee Elementary is named for Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Jefferson said the PTA will do \"some very aggressive fundraising campaigns\" to pay for new signs, stationery or other items needed for the name change to Obama. The school is near the state Capitol building, and most of its students were born during the eight years Mr. Obama was president, starting in 2009.",

            "article_content": "Be wary of offers for free tax preparation as April 18\u00a0approaches. They can carry costs that aren\u2019t measured in dollars and cents. Financial services company Credit Karma, known for providing free credit scores and credit monitoring, has been touting its latest giveaway: It\u2019s offering free federal and state tax preparation and electronic filing for the first time. Read the forms carefully, however. Credit Karma will ask permission to use the personal information gleaned from the tax filing to directly market financial products to those signing up for the free service. \u201cWe get to understand our members better,\u201d said Bethy Hardeman, chief consumer advocate at Credit Karma. \u201cWe can offer loans, credit cards, balance transfer that are tailored to a situation with the better information.\u201d Customers who decline to have their financial dossier mined for marketing purposes will still receive free tax preparation services, Hardeman said. Credit Karma\u2019s business model depends on customers\u2019 willingness to share their details. Financial services companies pay a fee to Credit Karma if its marketing brings them customers. Credit Karma must believe that free tax preparation will lure a significant amount of new clients: It purchased tax preparation company AFJC Corp. last year for an undisclosed sum to start the service. Hardeman said the company has established trust with its customers through offering free credit scores and monitoring, so it\u2019s confident the tax product will prove popular. Still, she declined to say how many people had used the service or how many had agreed to share their information. Other companies and organizations also offer free tax prep, though people can still wind up spending money on hidden fees or by purchasing services missing from the gratis package. Some programs are reserved for low- and middle-income people, including one run by the Free File Alliance, a nonprofit funded by major tax-prep firms including H&R Block (HRB) and Intuit (INTU), the maker of TurboTax. The alliance offers free federal preparation services to people who had an adjusted gross income of $64,000 a year or less in 2016 \u2013 which it says covers around 100 million Americans. Sounds like a great deal. But critics charge the tax preparers only agreed to set up the alliance in 2003 to block the IRS from launching a service to calculate citizens\u2019 taxes for them, a move that could save consumers billions of dollars. In some European countries, the government sends citizens a prefilled form telling them how much they owe. People can choose to pay it or opt to prepare their own taxes. Tax preparers\u2019 latest effort to prevent the government from adopting a prefilled form was lobbying for the Free File Act of 2016, which would have barred the IRS from starting such a system. Intuit spent $2.4 million lobbying in the last election, with a chunk spent on this legislation, according to Open Secrets. H&R Block spent part of its $3.2 million lobbying effort on passing the Act. Neither that bill nor one sponsored by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, which would have paved the way for prefilled tax returns ever made it out of committee. \u201cDo you want the IRS to be the tax collector and the tax preparer?\u201d asked Tim Hugo, executive director of the Free File Alliance. \u201cThe IRS\u2019 inherent interest is to get as much tax possible. Are they going to find every deduction?\u201c Hugo said the IRS would require a major investment to begin preparing prefilled returns -- money that would come out individual\u2019s taxes. He believes the alliance is sparing the country from a major expense, adding that it has already saved Americans $1.5 billion in tax-prep fees. The savings could have been far greater. Only 2.6 million people -- a mere 2 percent of those eligible\u2014used the Alliance\u2019s services last year. Hugo said the IRS no longer provides the alliance with a marketing budget, so there are no funds to promote the service. \u201cWe are the protectors of the consumers\u2019 bottom line,\u201d said Hugo. He declined to answer questions about whether companies like H&R Block were protecting their bottom lines by fighting against prefilled forms. In a statement, H & R Block echoed Hugo\u2019s concerns about putting the IRS in charge of calculating taxes: \u201cWe have confidence that our tax pros or our best-in-class DIY software will dig for all deductions and credits our clients are due,\u201d the statement said.\u201d If the government makes a mistake, who will go to bat for the taxpayer against the IRS?\u201d An Intuit spokeswoman said in a statement that it \u201csupports taxpayer independence and empowerment and we have long advocated for real, common sense tax simplification reform.\u201d It added that a prefilled form that \u201cminimizes the taxpayers\u2019 engagement in the process of their own compliance, is not a reform. \u201c Elizabeth Maresca, a tax law professor at Fordham University Law School, said instituting a prefilled form would have mixed results for Americans. She noted that people with simple tax returns who don\u2019t bother to itemize could benefit from such a system as would those who never file taxes but are due refunds. Yet, she acknowledges that the IRS could make mistakes. Another major concern is what would happen to people who make a living filing taxes, especially accountants who are self-employed or work at small firms. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to put 50,000 people out of work,\u201d said Maresca. \u201cThere are a lot of mom-and-pop shops out there that support their families doing taxes.\u201d \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Tuesday will be the first regularly scheduled Election Day since President Trump's victory in November 2016. And while off-year elections typically benefit the party that does not control the White House, Republicans are looking to win a big gubernatorial race in Virginia.  On Tuesday night, all eyes will be on the Old Dominion, where Democratic Lieutenant Gov. Ralph Northam is facing off against Republican Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and adviser to George W. Bush. They're fighting to see who will be the next governor of Virginia, and while the race has always looked like it was Northam's to lose, Gillespie could pull off the upset.  But there are other big races worth watching. In New Jersey, Democrats are poised to reclaim the governor's mansion, with Democratic former U.S. Ambassador to New Jersey Phil Murphy likely to swamp Republican Lieutenant Gov. Kim Guadagno. In New York City, incumbent Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio is poised to win reelection against Republican state legislator Nicole Malliotakis.  And in Washington, a special election for a state senate seat could flip that chamber into Democratic hands, which would make the Evergreen State one of only a handful where Democrats control the governorship and the legislature. Around $6 million has poured in the race, with progressives hoping a Democratic state senate will approve new measures related to gun control and climate change.\u00a0 Also worth watching is Maine, where voters will head to the polls to decide whether the state should expand Medicaid. Maine's Republican governor, Paul LePage, has vetoed Medicaid expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act five times. On Tuesday, Maine voters will have a chance to overrule him, becoming the first state to decide the issue via a referendum. Health care activists from across the country will be watching the outcome of that election closely.\u00a0  From 1968 to 2004, Virginia was rather solidly Republican and always voted for the GOP candidate in GOP years. But the state's changing demographics has since made it much more friendly to Democrats; it voted for President Obama twice, and was the only southern state Hillary Clinton won in 2016. In addition, the state's current governor is a Democrat, as are its two U.S. senators.  Gillespie, who was thought of as a traditional Republican conservative, surprised onlookers when he nearly beat Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in 2014. Now Republicans are bullish on his chances of beating Northam, who has run a lackluster race that has highlighted Democrats' difficulty in reaching rural voters.  Gillespie, meanwhile, has been running not so much as the establishment Republican he has been in the past but as a Trump-style culture warrior. He's come out strongly for keeping the state's memorials to the Confederacy, preventing sanctuary cities, and keeping out immigrant gangs.  It's a message designed to get Trump voters enthusiastic about voting for him, and in recent weeks polls have shown a tightening race. The latest RealClearPolitics polling average gives Northam a tiny 3-point lead, meaning this race could easily go either way on Tuesday.  \"He's closed an enthusiasm gap by rallying around the Trump agenda,\" former White House strategist Steve Bannon told The New York Times. \"And I think the big lesson for Tuesday is that, in Gillespie's case, Trumpism without Trump can show the way forward. If that's the case, Democrats better be very, very worried.\" Interestingly, Gillespie has tried to pull this off while keeping the president at arm's length. Mr. Trump never campaigned for Gillespie in Virginia, but has tweeted his support for Gillespie numerous times.  And while Gillespie's campaign has been criticized for messaging that would seem to play to racial anxieties, Northam has also been knocked for an ad showing a Gillespie supporter trying to run down minority children with a pick-up truck. The ad, which was paid for by a pro-Northam outside group, was not directly authorized by the campaign.  It means you can expect a lot more Republicans to embrace a Trumpian, populist message that's heavy on cultural wedge issues when the 2018 midterm elections come up. It might also signify that the GOP is in decent shape to keep winning elections even as the Republican-controlled Congress has been light on big accomplishments, and provide what The New York Times called a \"template for how to run a state campaign in the Trump era.\" But the more interesting developments might happen on the Democratic side. Since Mr. Trump's victory, Democrats have found themselves in the midst of a low-grade civil war between progressives and more moderate Democrats, which stems in part from their acrimonious 2016 presidential primary between Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.  Sanders backed former congressman Tom Perriello in the Virginia Democratic gubernatorial primary against Northam, who was the more moderate and establishment pick. Should Northam come up short, expect progressive activists to highlight his failure as yet more evidence for why the Democratic Party should move left and embrace a more populist economic message.\u00a0  Not that a Northam victory will necessary prevent such recriminations. If the race is close, Republicans will likely be pleased with how Gillespie did. Democrats, meanwhile, will not appreciate that they ever had to sweat about this race to begin with, particularly given their recent string of defeats in special elections.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "Fresh off a near-win in Georgia, Democrats are hoping to turn their voters' enthusiasm into electoral victories. They need to win 24 seats to win back the House in 2018, and thanks to the redistricting that's happened since the big Republican wins in 2010, they'll need to compete in traditionally red districts like this one, which represents all of Montana.  The seat is open because President Trump appointed its previous representative, Ryan Zinke, to the position of Interior secretary. That means the GOP is fighting on its home turf in an effort to stave off an upset. While national Democrats have largely kept their wallets on the sidelines, Republicans are spending big to keep the seat, and have already dished out more than $2.2 million on ads. Amid criticism that they weren't stepping up, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced a $400,000 investment in the race on Wednesday.\u00a0 Plus, this race is one to watch for sheer entertainment value alone. Both candidates have significant, and rather unusual, strengths and weaknesses. Also, both candidates have released ads in which they shoot screens with guns. His name is Rob Quist, a famous Montana bluegrass musician who ends every rally he holds with a campaign song he wrote himself. A political newcomer, he supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primaries, and is running as a populist who likes both guns and single-payer healthcare. \"Everybody should have a system like Medicare, where you walk in, show your card and you're covered, no questions asked,\" he told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle in January.  For his part, Sanders is returning the favor and campaigning for Quist. \"My impression is [Quist]'s a very strong candidate who stands up for working people, understands that we need a government that represents all of us,\" Sanders told the Huffington Post last month.  Republicans have gone after Quist for his criticism of assault rifle ownership in an attempt to paint him as a liberal gun-grabber. This line of attack prompted Quist to release an ad in which he shoots a television set with a rifle that \"has protected my family's ranch for generations.\" The TV is showing a Republican ad where Quist is depicted as House minority leader Nancy Pelosi in a cowboy hat.  Quist was also the subject of some mockery when the Washington Free Beacon revealed that he has been, along with his musician daughter, a sometime performer at a nudist resort in Montana. However, both Quists remained fully clothed during their sets.  Greg Gianaforte is a software entrepreneur who tried and failed to unseat Montana's incumbent governor last November even as Mr. Trump won the state by 20 points. In that race, Gianforte had tried to distance himself from Mr. Trump, a mistake he's taken pains to avoid making again. He even had Donald Trump Jr. headline a recent rally for him, which drew thousands.  Although he's lived in Montana for 24 years, Gianforte originally hails from New Jersey, which the native-born Quist has tried to turn into an issue. Quist, rarely seen without his signature Stetson, has taken to referring to Gianforte as a \"New Jersey millionaire\" on the trail. Democrats have used repeatedly Gianforte's wealth against him. In this race, they've highlighted his six-figure investment in Russian index funds that include companies sanctioned by the U.S. government. During the gubernatorial campaign, incumbent Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock accused Gianforte of trying to buy the election by spending $5 million of his own money on it.\u00a0 Gianforte has made gun rights central to his pitch, accusing his opponent of wanting a national gun registry that would be kept on a \"big government computer.\" In one ad, Ginaforte shoots said computer with a rifle.  The Republican has also tried to make hay of the fact that Quist, despite his pro-gun message, hasn't had a valid hunting license in 15 years. Gianforte has also repeatedly try to portray Quist as a puppet of Pelosi who wants to \"run up mountains of debt and leave us with the bill.\"  Montana usually goes red in presidential years. However, Montana \u2013 although largely rural and conservative on issues like gun rights \u2013 also has a habit of electing Democrats to statewide office. They've had a Democratic governor for the last 12 years, for example, and a Democratic U.S. senator for 10 years in Sen. Jon Tester.  The at-large congressional seat, on the other hand, has been in Republican hands since 1997. And given the dearth of polling in this election, it's very hard to say which candidate has the upper hand. But what we do know is that Gianforte has significant advantages, and much more money to spend. In order for Quist to win, he's going to need the support of some Republicans and independents in the state, while Gianforte may be able to rely on Trump-supporting Republicans turning out en masse. But Quist is a compelling character running on a message of authenticity against a candidate who's already lost statewide once. And given how few people tend to turn out for special elections, it's impossible to know who will wind up winning this one, especially if national Democrats start throwing more money at the race.  \"[Quist]seems in touch with the tenor of the state these days,\" Democratic strategist Geoff Garin told NPR last month. \"And we're in a moment, not just in Montana but America, where it is a good thing not to be a career politician.\" The election will take place on May 25th.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 As liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders is ready to unveil his bill to starkly reshape the country's current hodge-podge health care system into one in which the government provides medical insurance for everybody, Republican senators are preparing to roll out details of a last-ditch effort to repeal and replace President Obama's health care law. The rival packages have little in common, other than the likelihood that neither is going anywhere. Seven weeks after the GOP drive to uproot Mr. Obama's 2010 health care law crashed in the Senate, Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, Nevada's Dean Heller and Wisconsin's Ron Johnson released their own plan for trying again. \"We refuse to quit, we have been working on a bill that should've been our first approach to repealing Obamacare, not our last,\" said Graham at a Wednesday press conference to unveil the plan. \"If you believe repealing replacing Obamacare is a good idea, this is your best and only option to make that happen, he added. Under the resurrected Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill, the structure and architecture of the Affordable Care Act is replaced with a block grant given annually to states to help individuals pay for coverage. \u00a0 According to a statement released by the senators, grant dollars would \"replace the federal money currently being spent on Medicaid expansion, Obamacare tax credits, cost-sharing reduction subsidies and basic health plan dollars.\" Cassidy told reporters that the plan would give states resources and flexibility to innovate, create lower premiums and expand coverage for enrollees.\u00a0 Graham issued a stern warning to Sanders: \"If you want a single-payer system, this is your worst nightmare. Bernie, this ends your dream of a single-payer health care system for America.\" They've struggled for weeks to round up sufficient support for the package. It would cut and reshape Medicaid, disperse money spent under Mr. Obama's law directly to states and erase \"Obamacare\" penalties on people who don't purchase coverage. No. 3 Senate GOP leader John Thune of South Dakota said Graham and Cassidy would need \"a double-double bank shot\" to prevail, a joking reference to an impossible basketball shot. Like the failed Senate GOP repeal effort in July, the Graham-Cassidy push will get zero Democratic support. That means Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will need 50 of the 52 Republican senators, a margin he couldn't reach in July and is struggling to reach now. Graham said he's had productive meetings with McConnell on the plan, which is estimated to cost $1.2 trillion, but has been charged by the Leader get the necessary votes.\u00a0 The Republican also urged the Leader to get a score of the plan by the Congressional Budget Office, and called on President Trump to \"pick up the phone\" and \"act like this matters.\" Mr. Trump released a statement on the plan sometime after the Wednesday press conference, saying he applauded the Senate for continue its work toward delivering a repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. \"As I have continued to say, inaction is not an option, and I sincerely hope that Senators Graham and Cassidy have found a way to address the Obamacare crisis,\" he added.\u00a0 Despite being badgering by Mr. Trump that he keep trying, McConnell has expressed no interest in staging yet another vote that produces an embarrassing rejection by the GOP-controlled Senate.  Conservatives are wary because the bill falls short in erasing Obamacare's wide-ranging coverage requirements. \"I don't think this bill will go anywhere,\" said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. Meanwhile, Sanders is introducing his bill essentially expanding the Medicare health insurance program from just the elderly to all Americans. The progressive wing of the Democratic Party backs Sanders' bill, which would make health care less expensive and less complicated for many people and businesses. It would cover the 28 million Americans remaining uninsured despite Obamacare. People would simply flash a card and be entitled to coverage, without out-of-pocket expenses like deductibles, according to Sanders aides. They would pay income-adjusted premiums, with the poorest paying nothing but the rich and profitable corporations seeing higher taxes; people and businesses would no longer owe premiums to insurers. Some Democrats fear the Vermont independent is exposing them to a lose-lose choice: Don't support Sanders' plan and risk alienating the party's liberal, activist voters, volunteers and contributors. Back it and be accused by Republicans of backing a huge tax increase and government-run health care, and taking away employer-provided coverage for half the country that many people like. Over the 2016 campaign trail, even former opponent Hillary Clinton stressed to voters in Des Moines just how unfeasible she considered Sanders' plan to pursue the single-payer health care system. \"I want you to understand why I am fighting so hard for the Affordable Care Act,\" she said at Grand View University after hearing from a woman who spoke about her daughter receiving cancer treatment thanks to the health care law. \"I don't want it repealed, I don't want us to be thrown back into a terrible, terrible national debate. I don't want us to end up in gridlock. People can't wait!\" She added, \"People who have health emergencies can't wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass.\" Sanders rejects that. \"Because the people in this country want to move toward a Medicare-for-all system, that is divisive?\" he remarked in an interview Tuesday, citing polls showing growing support. At least 12 other Senate Democrats had signed onto Sanders' bill by late Tuesday, including four potential presidential contenders: Kamala Harris of California, Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren, New York's Kirsten Gillibrand and Cory Booker of New Jersey. \"It may be a good strategy toward getting the nomination\" to be the Democratic presidential nominee, said Ron Pollack, chair emeritus of the liberal Families USA, who backs universal coverage but thinks Sanders' plan is politically unrealistic. \"I don't think it's a good strategy for the general election.\" To cover themselves, several Democrats are introducing their own bills that expand coverage without going as far as Sanders, including possible presidential aspirants Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Ohio's Sherrod Brown. Several Democrats facing tough re-election battles next year in GOP-leaning states say they want to focus on strengthening Mr. Obama's existing law, including Montana's Jon Tester and Missouri's Claire McCaskill. Republicans say they're ready. \"We welcome the Democrats' strategy of moving even further left,\" said Katie Martin, spokeswoman for the Senate GOP's campaign organization. A third effort, a bipartisan attempt to shore up individual insurance markets around the country, is showing early signs that the sides are having problems reaching agreement. Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Patty Murray, D-Wash., hope to reach a deal on continuing for at least a year the federal payments to insurers that Mr. Trump has threatened to halt. Republicans are also insisting on easing the Obama law's coverage requirements, which Democrats don't want to do. Alexander said Tuesday that Republicans want \"real state flexibility\" to let insurers offer \"a larger variety of benefits and payment rules.\" Murray said she worried the GOP wants to \"wind up increasing out-of-pocket costs for patients and families.\" That's something Democrats oppose. McConnell said the Alexander-Murray talks \"are underway and we'll see where they go.\"",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Celebrations aside, President Trump may wait until next year to sign the tax bill into law, delaying $120 billion in automatic cuts to popular programs such as Medicare and sparing Republicans from having to explain them in an election year. Here's why: If Trump signs the tax bill this month, it could trigger steep automatic spending cuts early next year to a raft of programs. But if Trump waits until January to sign the bill, the spending cuts would be delayed until 2019 \u2014 after next year's congressional elections \u2014 giving lawmakers a full year to prevent them. Congress gave final approval to the $1.5 trillion tax package Wednesday, sending it to Trump. The bill-signing delay wouldn't affect taxpayers. The tax cuts would still go into effect in January, and workers would still start to see changes in the amount of taxes withheld from their paychecks in February. The delay, however, is another example of how politicians from both major parties routinely flout a law that was meant to instill fiscal discipline on Washington. The arcane budget law is called Paygo, or pay-as-you-go. Years ago, Congress approved the law imposing steep automatic spending cuts whenever Congress passes legislation that adds to the nation's growing debt. But the automatic spending cuts, which have been around since Ronald Reagan was president, have never been enforced. Republicans want to add a provision to a year-end spending bill that would waive the Paygo law, but they need help from Democrats to do it. \"So, a crude tool designed to prod Congress to face up to its fiscal responsibilities now goes the way of the dinosaur,\" Bill Hoagland, a former Senate Republican aide, wrote in an op-ed in Roll Call. Despite Republican claims otherwise, the tax bill would add billions to the nation's debt \u2014 more than $1 trillion over the next decade, according to official congressional estimates. If the Paygo law is waived, Trump can sign the tax bill as soon as it reaches his desk without worrying about the automatic spending cuts. But if the law isn't waived, and Trump signs the bill this month, he would be required to issue an order to cut about $120 billion in spending in early 2018, said Hoagland, who is now a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The Paygo law was meant to be painful: The cuts would target specific programs, including Medicare, price supports for farmers, a fund for crime victims and subsidies for affordable housing, Hoagland said. If Trump waits until January to sign the tax bill, the automatic spending cuts would be delayed until 2019, giving lawmakers time to waive the Paygo law, said Ed Lorenzen, a former Democratic aide who is now a senior adviser for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \"That means Congress wouldn't have to do anything to prevent it from taking effect until the end of next year,\" Lorenzen said. Trump's top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, said the president would like to sign the tax bill as soon as possible. \"If we can get Paygo waived in the (spending bill), we will sign the tax bill this year,\" Cohn said Wednesday at an event sponsored by Axios. \"The president would like to sign the tax bill.\"",

            "article_content": "\"The priority is spending,\" the energetic and newly minted congressman, sporting an American flag pin on his dark suit jacket, told the C-SPAN host, soon adding, \"the size of the government is really what it comes down to.\" The year was 2010, and the congressman-elect was Mick Mulvaney, then a 43-year-old restaurateur and developer who rode the tea party wave during President Obama's first term to defeat 14-term incumbent Democrat John Spratt and be the first Republican to represent South Carolina's 5th Congressional District since 1883.  The \"GOP Young Gun\" ran a campaign platform focused on fiscal discipline \u2014 harping on the then-$13 trillion national debt, rampant government spending and growth, and the mandates under the Affordable Care Act that conservatives saw as anything but affordable. Mulvaney wasn't so different from many of his freshman contemporaries, who sought to scale back a Washington that was, as they saw it, spending out of control, if not spending itself out of existence, and burdening future generations with impossible promises. Fast forward to 2017. The national debt has surpassed $20 trillion. The country's budget has seen nothing but deficits for the last two decades. Spending has only gone up, even under a GOP-run Congress. And arguably, Republicans \u2014 who control the White House, Senate, and House \u2014 don't seem terribly concerned.  Mulvaney, now the director of the Office of Management and Budget after six years of establishing a reputation as a fiscal hawk in Congress, now says that \"we need new deficits.\" The reason he's saying that is that the tax plan, which is a top priority for the president and Republicans in Congress would likely add about $1.5 trillion to the national debt over a decade. GOP lawmakers aim to pass\u00a0legislation on taxes before Christmas. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" earlier this month that reducing government spending is \"not an issue we're focused on right now.\" Mr. Trump cares about the debt, Mnuchin says, but he's focused now on economic growth through tax cuts. There is talk that entitlement reform may be on the docket in 2018. In October, Mr. Trump said welfare is \"becoming a very, very big subject, and people are taking advantage of the system,\" but nearly a year into the new Congress and Mr. Trump's first term, it has yet to enter the political fray.  So, what happened to the party of limited spending, and limited government?  CBS News spoke with political strategists who say it's fair to trace some of the shift in focus to the 2016 presidential campaign. They agree there wasn't as much of an emphasis on fiscal discipline in that election cycle, compared with previous ones.  As he campaigned, Mr. Trump emphasized jobs and the economy, drawing out voters who felt marginalized by unstable conditions in fields that once bolstered working class America. But that campaign rarely addressed government spending and size. And when he did, candidate Trump sometimes tacked in the opposite direction, as when he\u00a0pledged to not cut Social Security, which now has fewer than three workers paying for every one retiree, and is projected to have just two workers for every one retiree by 2030. (In 1945, there were more than 40 workers per retiree.)\u00a0 Compared with the party's 2012 platform, which made cutting government spending and getting the country's financial house in order a cornerstone, the 2016 GOP platform made few references to the government spending or size. Then came Nov. 8, 2016, and, as fiscal hawk Sen. Bob Corker lamented earlier this month, Washington became \"like a party atmosphere.\" The Tennessee Republican expressed his frustration to a crowd at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. earlier this month when a college student who identified himself as a moderate Democrat from North Carolina asked how he should talk to his friends about the fiscal challenges facing the country. \"There's no question that the Medicare Part D component that was passed under President Bush unpaid for helped begin part of what's happening,\" Corker said, speaking to a crowd a an event on bipartisanship at the Newseum in Washington, D.C. \"And by the way he's a friend that I respect and like very much, more so even as time goes by. And then the Katrina thing happened. And I think he felt himself wrongly accused of being not as open minded, I'll just use that word. And so then even more money began to be spent. And then, and then President Obama came in and all of the sudden Republicans got religion on spending, right? And my friends on the other side of the aisle that had religion while Bush was there lost that religion and liked spending money. And I will say that now \u2014 and that's generally speaking not every person of course \u2014 now what's happened is look, it's like a party atmosphere, as I've said many times publicly to you and to some of your colleagues here, it's like a party began on Election Day this last year. I don't recognize my side of the aisle as it relates to those issues. So it's unfortunate that it kind of ebbs and flows. You get a lot more fiscally conservative when the other side of the aisle is in office. The problem is for you, a young student in North Carolina, the greatest threat to our nation is not ISIS, is not North Korea, it's not Russia getting involved in our elections, the greatest threat to our country is the fiscal issue. And almost no one cares about it. Almost no one cares about it.\" GOP strategist Ford O'Connell agreed with much of Corker's assessment, adding that the \"realities of governing don't always comport with principle.\" \"Especially in Bush's case, and in Trump's case and even in Obama's case, to a great extent, when you have slim majorities in one or both chambers of Congress,\" O'Connell said. \"And you realize that there is principle but you have to show that you can govern, and if you can't govern, well you're going to go back to screaming to the wall and talking about principle. It's a vicious cycle of what happens when you're in and out of power.\" During the most recent Bush administration, Republicans often gave less of a priority to reducing the budget than Democrats, O'Connell pointed out. For instance, in 2007, Pew found Republicans were less likely than Democrats (42 percent to 57 percent) to say reducing the budget deficit should be a top priority for Congress. But shortly after Obama took office and into 2016, Republicans in Pew polls were more likely to say reducing the deficit is a top priority than Democrats or independents. That isn't to say the Trump administration isn't pushing for cuts. The president's proposed 2018 budget slashed funding for the Department of Labor, international aid, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Environmental Protection Agency, for instance. But those cuts were balanced out by an increase in defense spending, and the Congressional Budget Office \u2014 which the Trump administration often criticizes as inaccurate \u2014 said the 2018 budget wouldn't balance, like the administration initially claimed it would. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continues to account for an increasing proportion of spending each year, now at more than half of all federal spending.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment on this story. When Republicans do propose shrinking spending, it doesn't always go over well. Bush \"took really good initiative\" on attempting to reform Social Security, said Bruce Haynes, founder of the politically independent strategic communications firm Purple Strategies. \"And it ended up being wildly unpopular,\" Haynes added. The GOP faced the same obstacle when it tried \u2014 repeatedly and unsuccessfully \u2014 to repeal Obamacare, which expanded Medicaid eligibility to millions more Americans.  \"The problem is once you give someone or a group of people a benefit, it is very very hard if not impossible to take away said benefit,\" O'Connell said. \"That's the reason why we have this issue.\" But the GOP's history of failing to make good on its campaign promise of fiscal discipline is a long and troubled one, well beyond the two most recent Republican administrations, said Barbara Perry, director of Presidential Studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. Former presidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, she said, were likely the last Republicans to make good on conservative spending promises. \"I would say that's about the last time that Republicans did make good on their pledge,\" Perry said.  Even Ronald Reagan, often invoked as the gold standard of modern conservatism, failed to manage the debt or cut spending in real terms, she said.  \"Reagan, who didn't believe in lots of government programs and wanted to cut taxes, runs up the debt 190 percent,\" Perry said, noting that Reagan crippled the Soviet Union, but at a cost. There is no perfect measure of how much each president and corresponding Congress has added to the debt. Each era faces different economic challenges, wars and warring party factions. But in modern history, the debt has generally increased in percentage terms more under Republican presidencies than Democratic ones, Perry noted. Since Franklin D. Roosevelt mushroomed the debt by more than 1,000 percent as he guided the country through the Great Depression and World War II, the presidencies that have seen the greatest percentage increases in the national debt were Ronald Reagan (186 percent, from adding $1.86 trillion to a $998 billion debt), and George W. Bush (101 percent, roughly doubling a $5.8 trillion national debt). President Barack Obama, often assailed as a reckless spender by conservatives, increased the debt by 86 percent \u2014 adding nearly $8 trillion to the formerly $11.7 trillion debt, but still less than some of his Republican predecessors. The last president in modern history to boast a budget surplus instead of a deficit was Bill Clinton. Clinton, dealing with a Republican Congress in his second term, tackled welfare reform in a way Republicans have not since. Perry said Republicans like the idea of small government. But when threats arise, they still want a government large enough to act as a buffer. \"I think Republicans continue with this concept because it taps into a founding-era sensibility of 'we don't like government, we don't like big government,'\" Perry said.  \"But Republicans have to respond to economic downturns, they have to respond to natural disasters, they have to respond to wars, Perry added. \"So even if they believe that in their heart of hearts, it's hard for them to get it through.\" One can argue that deficits specifically have never truly mattered much to the GOP, or at least, that whether deficits matter has been a point of contention. Former Vice President Dick Cheney after the midterm elections of 2002 raised eyebrows when he said Reagan \"proved that deficits don't matter,\" similar to Mulvaney's more recent comments. A core group of Republicans have always pushed for spending cuts, while another core group focuses on economic growth, Haynes said.  \"The Republican Party's not monolithic,\" Haynes said.  The current administration and Congress has focused on fiscal matters \u2014 but more on the growth side thus far than the fiscal discipline side, O'Connell said. The argument is that economic growth fuels the economy, increasing tax revenue and ideally, closing the deficit gap. That does not always work, as in Reagan's case. Still, prudence on spending and debt has real bearing on people's daily lives, O'Connell argued.  \"The buying power of a dollar today is less than the buying power of a dollar in 2000 and it's not because the dollar was stronger or weaker,\" O'Connell said. \"It's also because of the fact your money doesn't go as far purchasing the same items because we've racked up debt against the dollar.\" But government spending and size isn't necessarily something that fuels voters' energy.  \"Voters care about the size of government relative to the size of their own personal freedom, not so much as a number on a page of spending,\" Haynes said.  Cultural and social issues have also consumed the minds of voters and focus of politicians more lately, Haynes and O'Connell agreed.  \"What is more likely to drive people to the voting booth? And unfortunately it is knee-jerk reactions to issues that they (voters) hold dearly, or at least think they hold dearly,\" O'Connell said. \"So you get a lot more bang for the buck with cultural issues, regardless of the party, than you do with theoretical long-term issues that people can't bank into their pocketbook or their mental pocketbook if you will.\" Short of another Democratic administration or Congress, it may require an economic boon of historic proportions to refocus Washington on spending and government size \u2014 and we're not there yet. \"It more typically happens when we're in a healthy, roaring economy, and people aren't clamoring for jobs and growth because there's plenty of it,\" Haynes said.\u00a0 He added, \"That's when people will want to come to grips with the $20 trillion in debt.\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital based in Washington, D.C.",

            "article_content": "The Republican Party and President Trump achieved their first major legislative achievement with the passage of the GOP tax bill. The GOP projected an image of unity Wednesday, with some of Mr. Trump's biggest critics -- and even Republican Sen. Bob Corker, who voted against the bill the first time around -- smiling and applauding behind Mr. Trump. \"When you asked [House Speaker] Paul Ryan about some of the controversies over the last several months, he would say, 'Well, I'm not focused on that, I'm focused on our agenda,' and that's what you saw today,\" CBS News chief Washington correspondent and \"Face the Nation\" anchor John Dickerson   said. \"They were in the Promised Land, all of them together. That locks the party in behind the president.\" \u00a0 The tax bill passed the Senate early Wednesday with every Republican senator voting for it (Sen. John McCain missed the vote after traveling back to Arizona due to health issues). In the House, several Republicans from suburban New York, New Jersey and California defected and voted against the bill in both the votes.\u00a0 \u00a0 Besides confirmation of Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice, this marks the first major achievement of the Trump presidency. President Trump has long said he wants to sign the legislation before Christmas.\u00a0 \u00a0 But Dickerson noted Mr. Trump's achievements have not actually paid off in popularity. Mr. Trump's approval rating averages about 39 percent and the approval rating for the tax bill is 30 percent -- about 10 points lower than the Affordable Care Act when former President Obama signed it. The Republican Party is less popular. \"For somebody who came into the office with his signature skill being marketing, all of those achievements have not paid off in popularity,\" Dickerson said. \"And so he has gotten the achievement, but what has eluded him so far is the approval.\" Recently, the Alabama Senate race appeared to divide the Republican Party -- and the GOP suffered a crushing defeat in a deep red state.\u00a0 Now that the GOP is unified, CBS News chief congressional correspondent Nancy Cordes said that although Mr. Trump has mentioned infastructure, Republicans really want to tackle health care again, either shoring up the individual insurance markets or chipping away at Obamacare. Other priorities include welfare reform and reinstating work requirements for Medicaid and food stamp recipients, Cordes said. \"Paul Ryan and a number of Republicans want to go even further and reform Medicare and Social Security as well, but some of their colleagues think that could be radioactive in a mid-term election year -- especially since President Trump has promised not to touch entitlements,\" Cordes said.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "One week of confirmation hearings is down -- and there are just a few more days to go before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in. With President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration just three days away, another round of his top Cabinet nominees are about to undergo their confirmation hearings in the Senate this week. As a reminder, Congress can\u2019t officially confirm Mr. Trump\u2019s nominees until after he\u2019s sworn in, but senators can hold hearings to help expedite the process and get nominations ready for Inauguration Day -- which is why this coming week has such a packed schedule of hearings. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for example, recently told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Republicans\u2019 goal is to have at least seven Cabinet picks confirmed on \u00a0the day Mr. Trump is sworn in -- the same number that President Obama had in 2009. Each nominee will first have a hearing with the Senate committee that has oversight responsibilities for his or her department. Once the committee holds a vote and approves the nominee, that candidate will be voted on by the full Senate. Here\u2019s a cheat sheet from CBS News for when these confirmation hearings will take place and what to expect: Zinke, currently a congressman from Montana, will appear before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee at 2:15 p.m. ET. The interior secretary nominee is a former Navy SEAL commander and a decorated Iraq veteran; he just won his second term in Congress this November. Zinke is the first Navy SEAL elected to Congress and is the sole Montana congressman in the House. He supported Mr. Trump early on during the campaign, and he met with the president-elect Monday at Trump Tower.  Betsy DeVos, a prominent charter school advocate from Michigan, will appear before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee on Tuesday at 5 p.m. ET. DeVos, currently the chairwoman of the American Federation for Children, a school choice advocacy group. Her critics have said her stated positions pose a threat to the country\u2019s public school system. She and her husband also head up the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation, which has supported projects like the West Michigan Aviation Academy, a public charter school in Grand Rapids and the Compass Film Academy, a Christian film school in Michigan. The billionaire DeVos family also owns the NBA team, the Orlando Magic. Dick DeVos\u2019 father founded Amway. Haley, who\u2019s currently the governor of South Carolina, will appear before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at 10 a.m. ET. At the 193-country United Nations, Haley would serve as the voice of the Trump administration -- a role which, in the age of Mr. Trump\u2019s frequent tweets on foreign policy, could be a challenging one. Haley, a 44-year-old Republican, is serving her second term in the South Carolina statehouse and is seen as a rising star in the Republican Party. She is also the daughter of immigrants, from India.\u00a0 She\u2019s traveled internationally in recent years to negotiate global economic deals pertinent to her state, but the U.N. post would be Haley\u2019s first foray into both the federal government and foreign affairs more broadly. Pruitt, who is the current attorney general of Oklahoma, will appear before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee at 10 a.m. ET. As the top lawyer for the state of Oklahoma, Pruitt has spent considerable time pursuing legal action against the agency he\u2019s now been nominated to lead. He joined with other state attorneys general to sue the Obama administration over its policy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at power plants as well as to contest the EPA\u2019s regulations on methane. A climate skeptic who\u2019s written that the issue of climate change is \u201cfar from settled,\u201d Pruitt will also likely get questions about his stance on that issue -- which will represent a sharp break from the current administration\u2019s view. The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee will question Price, the Georgia congressman, at a 10 a.m. ET hearing. As the prospective head of the federal agency dealing with the Affordable Care Act -- and as Congress debates its options for repealing and replacing the law -- Price\u2019s hearing will likely focus on his views toward President Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law.  Price will also surely be asked about the future of Medicare and Medicaid under a Republican-led Congress and a GOP White House -- House Speaker Paul Ryan has proposed privatizing Medicare, while Mr. Trump said during the campaign that he did not plan to touch the program. Ross, 79, will appear before the Senate Commerce Committee at 10 a.m. ET.  He is the billionaire chairman of WL Ross & Co., an investment firm that specializes in corporate restructurings. He was supportive of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and often appeared on business news shows to explain Mr. Trump\u2019s positions. Ross will certainly get questions about his position on trade deals, since the Trump transition team has indicated that Mr. Trump will put Ross in charge of trade policy. Like Mr. Trump (and unlike most of the Republican Party), Ross favors withdrawing from or renegotiating free trade agreements. He may also face inquiries about whether any of his vast financial holdings could constitute a conflict of interest once he\u2019s officially in the post. Perry, the former governor of Texas and former 2016 hopeful, will appear at a hearing with the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources at 10 a.m. ET. Ironically, Perry\u2019s infamous \u201coops\u201d moment during the 2012 election was because of the Energy Department: it was one of the three departments he was attempting to say he\u2019d like to abolish. (The others were Commerce and Education.) As the former governor of Texas, Mr. Perry ran a state with significant industries in coal, gas and wind energy -- but he has little experience with nuclear energy, which is a big part of the Energy Department\u2019s responsibilities. The Senate Finance Committee will grill Mnuchin at 10 a.m. ET. Mnuchin, who served as the national finance chairman of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, is no stranger to the finance world: he spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs. Given Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-Wall Street stance during the campaign, Mnuchin will likely get questions about how the Trump administration will position itself on financial issues. He\u2019s also gotten criticism from anti-Wall Street Democrats about his role in the 2008 financial crisis -- particularly Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), who called him \u201cthe Forrest Gump of the financial crisis.\u201d After this week, the majority of Mr. Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks will have received committee hearings.  Last week, Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, transportation secretary nominee Elaine Chao, homeland security secretary John Kelly, defense secretary James \u201cMad Dog\u201d Mattis, CIA director nominee Mike Pompeo, housing and urban development secretary nominee Ben Carson all appeared before the respective Senate committees for questioning. But there are still more than a half-dozen top-level nominees that will need to be confirmed by the Senate -- that may not receive hearings until after Inauguration Day. So who\u2019s left? Confirmation hearings have yet to be scheduled for Andy Puzder (labor secretary nominee), Dan Coats (director of national intelligence nominee), Robert Lighthizer (U.S. trade representative nominee), Linda McMahon (Small Business Administration nominee), Mick Mulvaney (OMB director nominee) and David Shulkin (VA secretary nominee).

            "article_content": "The United States is growing older and more ethnically diverse, a trend that could put strains on government programs from Medicare to education, the Census Bureau reported Thursday. Every ethnic and racial group grew between 2015 and 2016, but the number of whites increased at the slowest rate \u2014 less than one hundredth of 1 percent or 5,000 people, the Census estimate shows. That's a fraction of the rates of growth for non-white Hispanics, Asians and people who said they are multi-racial, according to the government's annual estimates of population. President Donald Trump's core support in the racially divisive 2016 election came from white voters, and polls showed that it was especially strong among those who said they felt left behind in an increasingly racially diverse country. In fact, the Census Bureau projects whites will remain in the majority in the U.S. until after 2040. \"Even then, (whites) will still represent the nation's largest plurality of people, and even then they will still inherit the structural advantages and legacies that benefit people on the basis of having white skin,\" said Justin Gest, author of \"The New Minority,\" a book about the 2016 election. AN AGING NATION The Census Bureau reported that the median age of Americans \u2014 the age at which half are older and half are younger \u2014 rose nationally from just over 35 years to nearly 38 years in the years between 2000 and 2016, driven by the aging of the \"baby boom\" generation. The number of residents age 65 and older grew from 35 million to 49.2 million during those 16 years, jumping from 12 percent of the total population to 15 percent. That's a costly leap for taxpayers as those residents move to Medicare, government health care for seniors and younger people with disabilities, which accounted for $1 out of every $7 in federal spending last year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. By 2027, it will cost $1 out of every $6 of federal money spent. Net Medicare spending is expected to nearly double over the next decade, from $592 billion to $1.2 trillion, the KFF reported. Sumter County, Florida, home of The Villages, a large retirement community, had the highest median age increase, rising from 49 years old in 2000 to 67 years old in 2016. Over that time period, 56 U.S. counties showed a median age increase of 10 years or more. BOOM IN YOUNG PEOPLE The Census report also showed that children in the U.S. born from 2001 through 2016 were the nation's fastest-growing age group, with a 6.8 percent jump in the year beginning July 1, 2015. Other age groups either lost or gained population by less than a percentage point, according to the Census Bureau. That means more demand on taxpayers for schools, bilingual education and accommodations for English language learners, as well as recruiting a corps of educators that reflects the nation's students. Robert Hull, executive vice president of the National Association of State Boards of Education, said a majority of students in the U.S. are not white, but 82 percent of teachers are white. \"It's not just the services offered or what we do for the students but who is delivering those services,\" Hull said. The number of English language learners in U.S. public schools was about 4.6 million in the 2014-2015 school year, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. FACE OF A NATION All race and ethnic groups grew in the year before July 1, 2016, the Census reported. The Asian population and those who identified as being of two or more races grew by 3 percent each, to 21 million and 8.5 million, respectively. Hispanics grew by 2 percent to 57.5 million. The black population grew by 1.2 percent to nearly 47 million. The number of non-Hispanic whites grew by only 5,000, leaving that population relatively steady at 198 million of the nation's 325 million people. A Pew Research Center analysis of the Census' current population survey found that white turnout increased in the 2016 election, while black turnout dropped and the non-white share of the U.S. electorate remained flat compared with the 2012 election. \"Any sort of impact on politics may be several decades in the future,\" said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic research for the Pew Research Center. California had both the largest number of whites and non-white Hispanics in 2016, 30 million and 15.3 million, respectively. Texas had the largest numeric increase in both the white and non-white Hispanic populations. As for the share of a state's overall population, New Mexico had the highest percentage of non-white Hispanics at 48.5 percent. Maine had the largest percentage of whites, nearly 97 percent.",

            "article_content": "Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated for part of the national security apparatus he oversaw as DNI, that to his knowledge, there was no FISA court order for Trump\u2019s offices. Clapper, who made the comments on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d added that while he can\u2019t speak for other Title 3 entities or local or state law enforcement, he would know if the FBI ordered some sort of surveillance. \u201cI can deny it,\u201d he said definitively. President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0explosive accusations\u00a0about his White House predecessor\u2019s wiretapping activities during the 2016 election have dominated headlines since he first tweeted them Saturday morning -- and two top members of the Senate Intelligence Committee discussed their implications on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), the committee\u2019s vice chair, said Mr. Trump\u2019s Saturday morning tweets -- in which he accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower for political reasons -- were \u201creckless.\u201d Mr. Trump did not cite any evidence in his tweets, though similar claims had been\u00a0circulating in the conservative media\u00a0in recent days. After another weekend in which\u00a0a tweet from President Donald Trump\u00a0upended the political world, former Defense Secretary and CIA Director Leon Panetta said the the White House is \u201cpaying a price\u201d for its lack of \u201cdiscipline.\u201d \u201cWhen the president goes off and does what he did in the last few days of just going ahead and tweeting without checking on things, there\u2019s something wrong,\u201d he told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong in terms of the discipline within the White House and how you operate.\u201d President Trump is calling on Congress to investigate whether Obama abused his executive power during the presidential election. The White House issued a statement Sunday morning \u201crequesting that as part of their investigation into Russian activity, the congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016.\u201d The statement went on to say, \u201cNeither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is conducted.\u201d On Saturday morning, without citing any evidence, the president issued a series of tweets accusing Obama of tapping the phones in Trump Tower.\u00a0 As President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans debate the future of Medicare, Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Tom Price said Sunday that Republicans \u201cbelieve in the guarantee of Medicare for our seniors.\u201d His comments come after President Donald Trump reiterated\u00a0during his address to a joint session of Congress\u00a0last week that he doesn\u2019t want to change Medicare benefits. Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he still thinks the future of Medicare is an \u201copen question.\u201d Last Sunday, Kellyanne Conway wasn\u2019t defending her boss, President Donald J. Trump, on TV. She was at church, attending mass with her husband, attorney George T. Conway, and their four children, along with some friends. Breakfast at a diner came next, followed by some quality family time at their northern New Jersey home -- a brief return to what life used to be like. But these days, her Sunday routine is far from normal. The new normal includes full Secret Service protection. \u201cWhy? Have there been threats?\u201d asked O\u2019Donnell. \u201cYes,\u201d Conway replied. \u201cI have 24/7 Secret Service protection.\u201d Vice Chairman of the Sen. Select Committee on Intelligence Mark Warner, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, HHS Secretary Tom Price and former Defense Secretary and former CIA Director Leon Panetta are the guests on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d this week. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch has shown a willingness to limit the participation of environmental groups in lawsuits involving public lands, writing in one case that allowing conservationists to intervene could complicate and slow down the judicial process, according to an Associated Press review of his rulings as a federal appeals court judge. Gorsuch has spent a decade on the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears disputes about public lands ranging from energy companies\u2019 drilling rights to the use of off-road vehicles in national forests across six Western states. Republican leaders in Maine and Utah are asking President Donald Trump to step into uncharted territory and rescind national monument designations made by his predecessor. The Antiquities Act of 1906 doesn\u2019t give the president power to undo a designation, and no president has ever taken such a step. But Trump isn\u2019t like other presidents. Former President Barack Obama used his power under the act to permanently preserve more land and water using national monument designations than any other president. The land is generally off limits to timber harvesting, mining and pipelines, and commercial development. President Trump woke up at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Saturday morning firing off a tweetstorm\u00a0claiming that President Obama essentially wiretapped, or bugged, Trump Tower offices before the election. CBS News has been unable to confirm any of this new information. But the president is clearly irritated. Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism! PALM BEACH, Fla. --\u00a0Before most Americans awoke on Saturday, President Trump was on Twitter, posting\u00a0explosive wiretapping accusations\u00a0against President Obama.\u00a0Mr. Trump claims\u00a0he recently learned Mr. Obama ordered what Mr. Trump describes as a \u201cWatergate-style\u201d wiretap on Trump Tower in New York. He says it happened just before the election. Mr. Trump offered no evidence and a\u00a0spokesman for Mr. Obama issued a quick denial. It comes amid growing controversy over the Trump administration\u2019s possible Russian ties, and the president is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. President Obama\u2019s team is\u00a0shooting down President Trump\u2019s suggestion\u00a0that he\u00a0ordered wiretapping on Trump Tower\u00a0during the 2016 election, with an Obama spokesman calling the claim \u201csimply false.\u201d \u201cA cardinal rule of the Obama administration was that no White House official ever interfered with any independent investigation led by the Department of Justice,\u201d Kevin Lewis, an Obama spokesman, said in a Saturday afternoon statement. \u201cAs part of that practice, neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen.\u201d \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is simply false,\u201d he added. President Trump\u2019s string of tweets Saturday morning\u00a0accusing President Obama of wiretapping\u00a0Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign came seemingly out of nowhere: It wasn\u2019t something the president had been discussing recently, nor had it appeared in major mainstream news outlets. But Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets weren\u2019t the first time this allegation has been made: Several conservative media outlets have been pushing wiretapping claims in recent days. Democrats are pushing back\u00a0on President Trump\u2019s\u00a0Saturday morning claims\u00a0that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower offices before the election. While at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida for the weekend, Mr. Trump fired off a series of early morning tweets accusing President Obama, without citing evidence, of wiretapping Trump Tower. He described this as \u201cNixon/Watergate,\u201d calling Mr. Obama a \u201cbad (or sick) guy.\u201d Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser under Mr. Obama, denied Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations and responded by saying presidents can\u2019t order wiretaps. Vice President\u00a0Mike Pence\u00a0criticized the Associated Press for publishing the personal email address of his wife, Karen Pence, in a story on Friday about his efforts to block the release of his emails during his tenure as Indiana governor. On Saturday, Pence said the AP was \u201cviolating her privacy and our security\u201d by publishing the second lady\u2019s AOL email address. He tweeted a letter sent by his counsel, Mark Paoletta, addressed to Gary Pruitt, the president and CEO of the AP, saying Pruitt \u201cshould be ashamed of your reprehensible conduct.\u201d The president is in Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. CBS News\u2019 Mark Knoller notes that by the end of the weekend, Mr. Trump will have spent all or part of 14 days at Mar-a-Lago, amounting to 31 percent of his days in office, so far. \u201cFlorida to me is a very very special state,\u201d said Mr. Trump Friday. \u201cI have had a lot of success in Florida. I love it. It is my second home.\u201d Other states he\u2019s been to: Delaware -1; Pennsylvania - 1; South Carolina - 1; Virginia - 2 (Not counting visits to Pentagon and Andrews AFB).

            "article_content": "\u00a0A federal prosecutor said Wednesday the case against New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez is about a corrupt politician who, \"sold his office for a lifestyle he couldn't afford, and a greedy eye doctor,\" CBS News' Pat Milton and Erica Brown report. Prosecutor Peter Koski methodically and meticulously laid out the U.S. government's corruption case against 63-year-old Menendez, a Democrat, who is charged with accepting bribes including lavish vacations and hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from Salomon Melgen, a wealthy Florida eye doctor, in exchange for political influence and favors to advance his business interests. \"Robert Menendez was Salomon Melgen's personal U.S. senator,\" Koski said in a wood-paneled courtroom packed with attorneys, reporters, and supporters of Menendez including Cory Booker, the junior senator from New Jersey and a fellow Democrat. \"These are two men who met at a political fundraiser at a time when one man had wealth and one man had power,\" Koski told the 12-person jury during his 45-minute statement\u00a0 in Newark's U.S. District Court. Menendez, wearing a dark suit and yellow tie, appeared to listen intently as he sat slightly forward in his chair flanked by his attorneys at the defense table. Among the accusations detailed by the prosecutor was that Menendez pressured government officials to help Melgen seek visas for his girlfriends from the Dominican Republic, where he had a luxurious villa.\u00a0 Koski also accused Menendez of intervening in an alleged $8.9 million billing dispute over Medicare and of pushing Dominican Republic officials to honor Melgen's security screening shipping contract with the country's ports.\u00a0 Both men have denied any criminal wrongdoing. They were indicted in 2015 and face multiple corruption and bribery charges. Melgen's sentencing in a separate Medicare fraud case has been delayed until after his trial with Menendez, CBS New York reports. Jurors will have to wade through complex legal concepts, including whether Menendez's interactions with executive branch officials were \"official acts\" as defined under federal bribery statutes. That will depend on how a 2016 U.S. Supreme Court decision reversing the bribery conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, is interpreted. Before coming into court, Menendez made what his aide said will be his last statement until the trial is over, CBS New York reports.\u00a0 \"I have committed my entire adult life, since I was 19, to fighting for the people of New Jersey. Never, not once, have I dishonored my public office,\" Menendez said with his daughter and son behind him. \"I started my public career fighting corruption and I have always acted in accordance with the law. I believe when all of the facts are known, I will be vindicated.\" \u00a0 The defense in their opening statement said the only relationship these two men had was a friendship for more than two decades and the gifts were out of friendship. \"It's not a crime to give Melgen an ear to a senator he otherwise would not have,\" Abbe Lowell, an attorney for Menendez, said. The outcome of the case could have huge implications. If convicted and subsequently removed from office (barring a possible appeal), Republican Gov. Chris Christie could appoint a Republican. A Democrat has a large polling and financial advantage in November's election to replace Christie. Menendez first came under scrutiny in 2013 after media reports revealed he was flying on Melgen's private jet to Dominican Republic and he did not report any of the free flights, a potential violation of senate rules and federal law. Prior to opening statements, there was a testy exchange between federal judge William Walls, who is presiding over the trial, and Menendez attorney Raymond Brown. Brown criticized what he said was judge Walls \"prejudicial\" language in a recent ruling in the case. During the exchange the judge told Brown to \"shut up.\" The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks. \u00a0",

            "article_content": "Politics have long buffeted health care stocks, but lately it has boosted them. Last week, as the Senate GOP leadership unveiled its new health insurance plan, these shares advanced a robust 3.7 percent. That surge pushed them into the exalted status of the best-performing sector for the year thus far. Health care stocks are now beating the recent champ, technology, 16.7 percent versus 16.4 percent. Of course, health stocks' symbiotic relationship with government policy means they could suffer anew. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, wants to put his Obamacare repeal bill to a vote this week before Congress leaves town for its week-long July 4 holiday recess. But given the opposition McConnell's proposal faces from Democrats and several Republican senators, Washington gridlock could drag down health stocks again. Despite the sector's current strength, a UBS Securities research note said Monday, \"politics has not been kind to health care stocks.\" To see why, let's examine their trajectory over the past two years, using the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) exchange-traded fund as a proxy for this group.\u00a0 This fund's previous peak, around $75 per share, was in July 2015 just as the presidential campaign was getting under way. The candidates' rhetoric was far from soothing for the health care industry.\u00a0 Donald Trump and other Republicans were adamantly against President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and their stance promised major disruption ahead. Hillary Clinton, eventually the Democratic nominee, inveighed against high drug costs.\u00a0 Health stocks plummeted as a result, and the health fund bottomed out at about $61 right before the election, a 19 percent drop.\u00a0 Nowadays, however, the fund has roared back to just above $80. While some on Wall Street at first saw the GOP effort to repeal and replace Obamacare as a threat to health companies, that sentiment appears to have shifted to a more hopeful one. Last week's boost -- the fund was flat on Monday -- was sparked in part by the McConnell plan's call to eliminate taxes on the industry and to stabilize the ACA's insurance exchanges with government subsidies.\u00a0 The Senate proposal \"is more generous and more positive to the industry than expected,\" Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds, told Reuters.\u00a0 Another plus: If the Republican Congress can take care of health care, a necessary first step before moving on to other issues such as a tax code overhaul, health providers stand to benefit: The industry, UBS noted, has the second-largest trove of cash parked overseas, $179 billion, behind technology companies' $630 billion. Republicans want to lower corporate tax rates to entice U.S. businesses to bring their foreign cash hoards home.\u00a0 At the same time, biotech firms got a reprieve from the Senate plan, which failed to mention higher drug costs. These companies largely depend on concocting new pharmaceuticals, which often fetch premium prices. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund (IBB), tracking a key biotech benchmark, jumped 9 percent last week. That allowed it to recover more than half the ground it lost since falling from its mid-2015 high. None of this means that passing some form of ACA replacement would end up as a boon for the industry. If under GOP legislative mandate, Obamacare subsidies end up yanked from patients and providers, health stocks could get whacked once more.\u00a0 A second baleful scenario: If Republican efforts are stymied, and Obamacare endures, only to find itself starved of federal funding by the Trump administration, it won't be good news for health care investors.\u00a0 Capitol Hill opposition to the Senate and House blueprints to replace the ACA mostly rest on the limits they would impose on health coverage. The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0projected on Monday that 22 million Americans would lose health insurance under the Senate bill, almost as many as the CBO estimated for its House-passed\u00a0 counterpart.\u00a0 And long term? Due to the aging U.S. population, as well as increasing innovation in medical technology, the prospects for health companies have long appeared bright. For that reason, health care has been the best stock performer over the past five years, edging out consumer discretionary and third-ranked financials. Nevertheless, regardless of what happens with replacing Obamacare, some argue that health stocks are headed for trouble because industry dynamics will make drugs and medical care cheaper. \"The consolidation [of health companies] means buyers are becoming more powerful than the sellers,\" which would bring cheaper prices, argued Doug Sandler, chief equity officer at RiverFront Investment Group.\u00a0 For instance, UnitedHealth Group (UNH), the managed care titan, is the sixth-largest company on the Fortune 500 by dint of its steady diet of acquisitions through the years. To Sandler, this concentration of power eventually will bend medical prices downward.\u00a0 Beyond that, the federal government, which provides Medicare and Medicaid, has a large say in health policy -- and will continue to. As the gyrations of health stocks have shown, Washington policy always can change.

            "article_content": "As the new Congress is set to convene Tuesday, Democrats are mounting an aggressive messaging campaign against Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare.  Democrats are warning that repealing President Obama\u2019s signature healthcare law would lead to tens of millions of Americans losing their healthcare coverage and affect Medicare and Medicaid. Since Republicans will have the power to dismantle the major pillars of the law, Democrats are trying to protect it by touting all of its benefits.  \u201cThis is not just about the 20 million previously uninsured who now have health security,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said during a call with reporters Monday. \u201cBut this is about the 75 percent of American people who get their health benefits through their workplace -- not through the ACA.\u201d  Mr. Obama is scheduled to to make a rare visit to Capitol Hill Wednesday morning to huddle privately with House and Senate Democrats to strategize how to preserve Obamacare. Vice President-elect Mike Pence is also heading to Capitol Hill that day to meet with Republicans about their plans. Early this year, Republicans are planning to immediately begin work on repealing Obamacare\u2019s major parts through the budget reconciliation process, which only requires a majority for passage in the Senate and not a supermajority. Last year, the GOP-controlled House and Senate sent a bill that would have repealed the law to President Obama, which he quickly vetoed. That effort could now become reality with Donald Trump as president, who promised repeatedly during his campaign that he would scrap the law.  Republicans have argued that Obamacare has led to rising premiums and a lack of choices in the healthcare market. Democrats say the purpose of the law was to lower healthcare costs, increase access and increase benefits for all Americans.  \u201cIf the ACA were to be repealed, tens of millions of Americans lose their coverage,\u201d House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland said Monday during the press call. \u201cAnd tens of millions of others will see their healthcare costs skyrocket.\u201d  Hoyer bashed a plan that was recently floated by Republicans that would involve Congress passing a repeal plan, but delaying its effective date for at least a few years while a replacement plan can be developed.  \u201cRepublicans\u2019 so-called \u2018repeal and delay\u2019 plan is code for \u2018repeal without an alternative,\u2019\u201d Hoyer said.  Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, top Democrat on the powerful tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, defended the law by arguing that it has led to 137 million Americans now having access to preventive services without cost-sharing, it has addressed chronic conditions like obesity and diabetes and it has expanded Medicaid eligibility. The repeal bill Congress passed last year would have repealed the health-care law\u2019s tax hikes, insurance exchange subsidies and the Medicaid expansion. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the plan would lead to 22 million people losing their healthcare insurance. While Mr. Trump has made it clear he\u2019s in favor of repealing\u00a0the law, he suggested after the election that they wouldn\u2019t dismantle the law without a replacement plan ready and would \u201cdo it simultaneously.\u201d  \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have, like, a two-day period and we\u2019re not going to have a two-year period where there\u2019s nothing,\u201d he said on 60 Minutes when asked if people would lose their coverage. Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, told 60 Minutes\u2019 Scott Pelley in an interview in December that they want to repeal the law as soon as possible.\u00a0 \u201cWe have to bring relief as fast as possible to people struggling under Obamacare,\u201d said Ryan, who was then asked what it would be replaced with. \u201cPatient-centered healthcare that gets everybody access to affordable healthcare coverage, so that they can buy whatever they want to buy.\u201d To cap off the first week of the new congressional session, Pelosi is calling on her Democratic colleagues to hold press events in their respective districts Saturday \u201cto highlight the risks of repeal of the ACA and of ending the Medicare guarantee.\u201d House Democrats are also coordinating a \u201cOur First Stand: Save Health Care\u201d day of action on Jan. 15 with their counterparts in the Senate including Chuck Schumer, D-New York, and Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont.  Democratic governors are also voicing their concerns about a repeal. In a recent letter to Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, they argued that reversing the law would \u201cthrow millions of our residents\u201d off their insurance coverage.  \u201cRepealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including its Medicaid expansion, would be a financial and health disaster for states. Repeal would throw millions of our residents off their health coverage, shift enormous costs to state governments \u2013 blowing a hole in state budgets \u2013 and cause economic uncertainty for our states\u2019 businesses, hospitals, and patients,\u201d the letter said.  Without a replacement plan, repealing the law would risk making 30 million people uninsured, according to a study released last month from the nonpartisan Urban Institute. Of that total, it predicted 22.5 million would become uninsured because of the law\u2019s subsidies being repealed and 7.3 million would become uninsured because of \u201cthe near collapse of the nongroup insurance market.\u201d  Mr. Trump, for his part, has chosen a key Obamacare opponent as his nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services: Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, who was part of crafting previous legislation to undo the law.  Price is among eight people Mr. Trump has nominated to his Cabinet who Senate Democrats plan to target as congressional committees hold their confirmation hearings early this year, according to a report Monday by The Washington Post.  Pelosi, meanwhile, admitted Monday that if she could have done one thing differently on Obamacare, she said Democrats could have messaged it \u201cin a much stronger way.\u201d  Rebecca Shabad is a video reporter for CBS News Digital.",

            "article_content": "MILWAUKEE -- State Sen. Mary Lazich was adamant: The bill Republicans were about to push through the Wisconsin state Senate, requiring that voters present identification at the polls, would do no harm. \"Not a single voter in this state will be disenfranchised by the ID law,\" Lazich promised. Five years later, in the first presidential election held under the new law, Gladys Harris proved her wrong. By one estimate, 300,000 eligible voters in the state lacked valid photo IDs heading into the election; it is unknown how many people did not vote because they didn't have proper identification. But it is not hard to find the Navy veteran whose out-of-state driver's license did not suffice, or the dying woman whose license had expired, or the recent graduate whose student ID was deficient -- or Harris, who at 66 made her way to her polling place despite chronic lung disease and a torn ligament in her knee. She had lost her driver's license just before Election Day. Aware of the new law, she brought her Social Security and Medicare cards as well as a county-issued bus pass that displayed her photo. Not good enough. She was turned away. In the end, Wisconsin's 10 Electoral College votes went to Republican Donald Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by roughly 22,000 votes. But the battle over voter ID laws continues. Under the Wisconsin law, voters must present a driver's license, state ID, passport, military ID, naturalization papers or tribal ID to vote. A student ID is acceptable only if it has a signature and a two-year expiration date. Those who do not have their ID can cast a provisional ballot that will be counted only if they return with the proper ID within a few days of the election. Supporters have long argued such restrictions are needed to prevent voter fraud, while critics have decried the laws as undermining democracy and leading to the disenfranchisement of elderly and minority voters such as Harris. Courts have also weighed in, upholding laws that are generally narrow in scope while striking down others considered too broad. A federal appeals court last year struck down a package of laws passed in North Carolina, including voter ID, saying they targeted black voters \"with almost surgical precision.\" The politicians and the lawyers may be at loggerheads, but to Harris, the injustice is beyond dispute. \"They prevented us from voting,\" she said, simply. When Sean Reynolds went to his polling place at a local ice skating rink on Election Day, he showed his valid driver's license. The problem? It wasn't issued in Wisconsin. Reynolds, 30, was taken aback. He had moved to Madison in 2015 to find work after leaving the Navy and receiving his associate's degree from a university in neighboring Illinois. After successfully registering to vote in Wisconsin using an online website, he thought all he needed to show at the polls was a current photo ID. After all, his Illinois ID was good enough to board a plane, open a checking account and purchase cold medicine. \"Coming home and being denied the right to vote because I didn't have a specific driver's license is very frustrating,\" said Reynolds, who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan providing support for special forces. \"I was a little incredulous that they wouldn't accept another state's driver's license. I didn't understand why it was not a valid form of ID.\" Reynolds said he had been working 50-hour weeks, receiving hourly pay, and could not afford to take time off from his job in security management to visit a local DMV and transfer his license from Illinois. A survey conducted by the Brennan Center in 2006 estimated that while as many as roughly 21 million voting-age U.S. citizens did not have a valid government-issued, photo identification, an additional 4.5 million had a valid ID but one that did not have their current name or address. Supporters of voter ID laws say that prohibiting out-of-state driver's licenses reduces the possibility of voter fraud and individuals filling out multiple ballots. Research has shown that such voter fraud can happen, but it's very rare. After casting a provisional ballot, Reynolds was told to return within three days with a Wisconsin driver's license, but he couldn't take the time off from work on such short notice. \"I only had between Tuesday and Friday to get it done, and I just couldn't accomplish it in that time frame,\" he said. When Alvin Mueller retired from his job as a maintenance worker, his wife Margie, 85, quit driving and let her license expire in 2010. The couple never had trouble voting in Plymouth, a small city about an hour's drive north of Milwaukee where they've lived since they married 65 years ago. But they hit a snag during early voting in November because Margie Mueller couldn't cast a ballot with her expired license. The staff at the city clerk's office said if she wanted to vote, she would need to get a new ID at a DMV office about 15 miles away in Sheboygan, the county seat, Alvin Mueller recalls. That's not unusual. The Brennan Center estimated that in the 10 states with voter ID laws in 2012, more than 10 million eligible voters lived more than 10 miles from a state ID-issuing office that is open more than two days a week. Alvin Mueller said his wife was battling cancer in her lymph nodes and lungs. The prospect of making the trip to Sheboygan was overwhelming. Not only did they not make the drive -- Alvin decided if his wife couldn't vote, he wouldn't either. It's not like they were strangers to the poll workers: \"We voted in Plymouth here for years. They know us and everything,\" he said. Margie died on March 19. \"I'm going to be 86 pretty soon,\" he said. \"I don't think I'll be voting anymore, as long as she isn't here. We did everything together.\" Catelin Tindall brought these things with her when she went to her precinct on Election Day: Her Ohio ID. Copies of her lease and utility bill. Her student ID from the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design. Tindall, 24, had graduated in May, but wasn't sure whether she would stay in Wisconsin so she kept her Ohio ID. Her student ID had her name, photo, a barcode, school logo and the most recent academic year she attended. But her student ID didn't have an expiration date or say when it was issued, so she was forced to cast a provisional ballot. She doesn't have a car, so she took an Uber to the DMV to get an ID. She was told the ID would arrive by express mail the next day. By then, she said, her work schedule at a Starbucks prevented her from going to the county clerk's office with the ID so her vote would count. \"At the time I was thinking, 'At least tried, so I can't feel too bad about it,'\" she said. She felt differently when Trump won Wisconsin, her home for now as she looks for freelance work with her degree in communication design and illustration. \"When I would see people saying, 'What's wrong with you Wisconsin, what are you doing?' I would feel like, 'Oh my God, I'm part of the problem,'\" Tindall said. Overall, nearly 3 million people in Wisconsin voted last November, about 91,000 fewer than in 2012. Milwaukee, a power center for Democrats, reported that 41,000 fewer people voted there than in 2012. Backers of the ID law say it was a success. The number of provisional ballots represented a tiny fraction of all ballots cast -- less than one half of 1 percent, according to a report by the Wisconsin Election Commission. Election officials are currently reviewing 86 reports of possible voter fraud, of which 70 involved felons who may have voted before having their rights restored. Gov. Scott Walker was a major supporter of voter ID. He said recently that voter education is important to him and all elected officials. \"In a society where just about everyone has some form of voter identification, we just need to make sure going forward that we provide it for free, (that) we provide easy access to documents and other things in that regard,\" Walker said. \"We can be more than capable of making sure that people all across the state have access to voter identification.\" A former U.S. senator from the state, Democrat Russ Feingold, called voter ID laws \"scams\" from Republicans who know \"the Democratic Party has the numbers to decisively win every presidential election and a majority of Senate seats.\" Feingold was ousted in 2010 by Republican Ron Johnson and was defeated again in a rematch last year. The former senator recently launched LegitAction, a nonprofit advocacy group that advocates for voting rights and abolishing the Electoral College. \"The sole purpose of these laws, including those passed in Wisconsin, is to keep eligible voters from voting, specifically minority and low-income voters who tend to vote Democrat,\" Feingold said in a statement to The Associated Press. Gladys Harris believes the state law did precisely what she thinks it was intended to do -- prevent blacks like her who don't have a car and rely on public transportation from voting. For the last two decades, she has lived and voted in Wisconsin. Retired from her job working at an HIV/AIDS community resource center, she no longer drives and relies on public transit and friends to bring her to doctor's appointments, the grocery store -- and the voting booth. \"Even though they say your vote doesn't count, I feel like it does,\" Harris said. She was distraught when she was told her vote would not be counted unless she went to a local DMV office for a replacement card and then return with it to a county election office. \"There is no understanding this. It was unfair, and I think it was cruel,\" Harris said. A few days after the election, Harris found her driver's license. It had fallen between her mattress and headboard.",

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON -- Members of the 115th Congress will be sworn in at noon Tuesday, setting off an aggressive campaign by Republicans who control the House and Senate to dismantle eight years of President Barack Obama\u2019s Democratic policies. The first and biggest target is Obama\u2019s health care law, which Republicans have long sought to gut and blamed as a primary cause for a lackluster economic recovery. But decades-old programs that millions of Americans rely on every day, such as Social Security and Medicare, also will be in the crosshairs as congressional Republicans seek to shrink both the size of the federal budget and the bureaucracy in Washington. \u201cWe have a lot to do - and a lot to undo,\u201d House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said in a letter to fellow Republicans. Democrats will try to block the far-reaching conservative agenda by swaying public opinion and using the power they have in the Senate to filibuster legislation. But that strategy has its political limitations. Twenty-three Senate Democrats are up for re-election in 2018, including 10 from states won by President-elect Donald Trump, and they could break ranks and side with the GOP. \u201cWhat we will always do is hold the president-elect and his Republican colleagues in Congress accountable,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in prepared remarks Tuesday. \u201cWe will be a caucus that works to make sure the president-elect keeps his commitment to truly make America great, in its finest sense and tradition.\u201d Obama plans a rare trip to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with congressional Democrats and discuss strategy for saving the health care law. Vice President-elect Mike Pence will meet with Republicans. The first week of the new Congress will be a preview of the hectic pace planned by Republicans. The House will vote on Tuesday on a rules package that would gut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics, placing it under the purview of the lawmaker-run House Ethics Committee. Democrats and watchdog groups angrily denounced the notion of Congress\u2019 self-policing. The rules package, which Republicans drafted behind closed doors without public debate Monday, also would give GOP leaders the tools to punish lawmakers if there is a repeat of the Democratic sit-in last summer over gun control. Votes also are expected on resolutions to denounce the United Nations for condemning the construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. Republicans blasted the Obama administration for refusing to veto the decision. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., pledged \u201cto reverse the damage done by this administration, and rebuild our alliance with Israel.\u201d James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, is scheduled to testify Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee on an intelligence community assessment that Russia interfered in the U.S. election by hacking into Democratic email accounts. Allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. political process will be examined by individual congressional committees, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has rejected a bipartisan call for a special, high-profile select panel to investigate. Obama last week slapped Russia with sweeping penalties over the hacking allegations, yet Trump has not publicly accepted the conclusion Moscow was behind the election year intrusions. Incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Monday on Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that \u201cthere doesn\u2019t seem to be conclusive evidence\u201d that the Russians were responsible. The House is slated to vote Friday to certify Trump\u2019s victory in the presidential election over Democrat Hillary Clinton. She is the fifth presidential candidate to win the popular vote and lose the Electoral College. She received nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump, according to an Associated Press analysis, giving her the largest popular vote margin of any losing presidential candidate and bringing renewed calls to abolish the Electoral College. Other must-do items on the GOP\u2019s agenda are an overhaul of the U.S. tax code. Conservatives also want to scuttle rules on the environment and undo financial regulations created in the aftermath of the 2008 economic meltdown, arguing they are too onerous for businesses to thrive. The Senate plans to begin repealing Obama\u2019s health care law on Tuesday, with consideration of a procedural measure that will shield the initiative from Democratic filibusters. Lawmakers will then spend the next few months working on legislation canceling broad swaths of the law. Likely to go are its mandate that people buy health insurance or face IRS fines, and its expansion of Medicaid coverage to more lower-earning Americans. But several elements of the repeal likely wouldn\u2019t go into effect for two to four years. Amid the busy legislative schedule, the Senate will exercise its advice and consent role and consider Trump\u2019s picks for his Cabinet.",

The survey's combined ballot test results show Murphy polling at 48.6 percent, while Guadagno comes in at 33 percent. Twelve percent of respondents remain undecided on their vote.  The state's current Republican governor Chris Christie pulls only a 13.8 percent approval rating while 76 percent disapprove of his time in office, according to the poll.  Respondents also said that if Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, is convicted of fraud and bribery charges, 87 percent want him to resign. Menendez is charged with accepting bribes, including free flights on a private jet, lavish vacations and hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations, from Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor, in exchange for political influence.  One of the charges against Menendez is that he pressured executive branch officials to resolve an $8.9 million Medicare reimbursement dispute involving Melgen.  The poll demonstrates that 46.6 percent of those surveyed have an unfavorable view of Menendez, while 23 percent have a favorable view.  Respondents also show a general discontent with the Trump administration-- 58.8 percent say they disapprove of the job that Mr. Trump is doing as president, and when asked if \"things in the country are generally going in the right direction,\" 64.6 percent say the United States is on the \"wrong track.\" Still, 81.29 percent of the Trump voters surveyed say they feel good about voting for Mr. Trump while 7.6 percent regret their vote.

            "article_content": "WASHINGTON\u00a0-- Democratic leaders believe they lost to President Donald Trump partly because voters don't know what the party stands for. So they're trying to rebrand themselves with a new slogan and a populist new agenda\u00a0as they look ahead to the 2018 midterms. It's called \"A Better Deal\" and House and Senate Democratic leaders are rolling it out Monday afternoon in Berryville, Virginia. They're intentionally traveling outside the Beltway, and into the district of one of the GOP House members they hope to defeat next year, Barbara Comstock. House Republicans' agenda is called \"A Better Way.\"\u00a0 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California, along with other top House and Senate Democrats, are making the presentation after months of internal debate and analysis of polling and focus groups. \"Americans are clamoring for bold changes to our politics and our economy,\" Schumer wrote in a New York Times op-ed. \"They feel, rightfully, that both systems are rigged against them, and they made that clear in last year's election. American families deserve a better deal so that this country works for everyone again, not just the elites and special interests. Today, Democrats will start presenting that better deal to the American people.\" Democrats think of themselves as the party of working people and were surprised when Trump was able to steal working-class voters from them. They subsequently figured out that voters don't know what the party stands for, and the new effort is aimed at changing that. Schumer acknowledged on Sunday that Democrats were partially to blame for the American people not knowing what the party stands for. \"When you lose an election with someone who has, say, 40 percent popularity, you look in the mirror and say what did we do wrong? And the number one thing that we did wrong is we didn't have -- we didn't tell people what we stood for,\" Schumer said on ABC's \"This Week.\" The full title of the agenda is \"A Better Deal: Better Jobs, Better Wages, Better Future.\" (After an earlier and incomplete version leaked on Thursday, Twitter users mocked the similarity to the slogan for Papa John's pizza, \"Better Ingredients, Better Pizza.\") \"The Democratic Party's mission is to help build an America in which working people know that somebody has their back,\" say documents accompanying the roll-out. There are three overarching goals: raising wages, lowering costs for families, and giving working Americans better skills for the 21st century economy. Detailed planks will be rolled out over time. On Monday, three are being unveiled: -Lowering prescription drug prices. Suggestions include a new agency that could investigate drug manufacturer price hikes, and they would allow Medicare to negotiate directly for the best drug prices. -Cracking down on corporate monopolies. Democrats would enact new standards to limit large mergers, and create a new consumer competition advocate. -Creating millions more jobs. The agenda includes proposals for expanding apprenticeships and providing a tax credit to employers to train and hire new workers. Democrats hope to\u00a0make gains in next year's midterm elections, and perhaps even flip the 24 GOP-held seats necessary to regain the majority in the House. Yet they are mostly playing defense in the Senate where 10 Democrats are trying to retain seats in states won by Trump, including Republican strongholds like West Virginia, Missouri and North Dakota. Party strategists say that for most Senate candidates, in particular, a national party message has little value and instead each candidate must fight on their own terms and issues.",

Throughout the day Tuesday, conservative members from the House and the Senate, as well as conservative advocacy groups voiced their opposition to the bill, deriding it with nicknames like \u201cRyancare\u201d and \u201cObamacare 2.0.\u201d Here\u2019s the calculation for Republican leadership: If it remains the case that no Democrats come forward to support the bill, in the House, Speaker Paul Ryan can\u2019t afford to lose more than 21 votes. In the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has only two votes votes to spare -- and if two Republicans defect, he\u2019ll need Mike Pence to break the tie. Leon Panetta was President Clinton\u2019s chief of staff, the CIA director when Osama bin Laden was killed, and defense secretary under President Obama. That is why Scott Pelley asked Panetta for his perspective on President Trump\u2019s various outbursts in recent weeks, including the unproven charge that Mr. Obama ordered surveillance on Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential election. AARP announced its opposition to the Republican proposal that would repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), arguing that it would \u201cweaken Medicare\u201d and give special interests a \u201csweetheart deal.\u201d But the group\u2019s primary concern is for people who haven\u2019t yet reached retirement age, highlighting one of the biggest problems with the GOP\u2019s plan to use tax credits in lieu of Obamacare subsidies. As proposed, the plan does not offer enough to help older people pay for what would become much more expensive coverage if the subsidies are scrapped and the GOP\u2019s proposals to relax current age-based caps on premiums go through.\u00a0 President Donald Trump\u00a0appears to becoming more popular, although one new poll still has his deep under water. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll released Tuesday has 47 percent of Americans saying they approve of Mr. Trump\u2019s performance, versus 44 percent who do not. The survey, which was conducted last week in the days\u00a0around his well-received address to Congress, gives Mr. Trump particularly good reviews when it comes to his leadership abilities. And today, a majority of voters say Attorney General Jeff Sessions should resign, according to a new poll. The poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University, indicated that 51 percent of voters think Sessions should step down, versus 42 percent who say he should stay on. The survey came on the heels of news that\u00a0Sessions did not disclose a fall meeting with the Russian ambassador\u00a0during his confirmation hearings. The top Republican on the House intelligence committee said he has not seen any evidence to back President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0claim that the Obama administration wiretapped him during the 2016 campaign\u00a0and suggested the news media were\u00a0taking the president\u2019s weekend tweets too literally. \u201cThe president is a neophyte to politics \u2014 he\u2019s been doing this a little over a year,\u201d Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., told reporters Tuesday. \u201cI think a lot of the things he says, I think you guys sometimes take literally.\u201d Civil rights leaders asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday to urge President Trump not to move forward with\u00a0an investigation into his unverified claim that several million people voted illegally in the election, Politico reports. The president had been planning for a blue-ribbon panel to launch a probe into the claim. \u201cI asked him to counsel the president against the creation of such a task force and a commission because that commission will be seen to intimidate our communities,\u201d Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, said, according to Politico. The Justice Department moved Tuesday to dismiss the 9th Circuit appeal on President Trump\u2019s original travel ban from late January. On Monday, senior administration officials said that\u00a0the new travel ban\u00a0rolled out that day makes all previous litigation over the original travel ban \u201cmoot.\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer previously suggested that the two bans would be litigated on parallel tracks but that isn\u2019t a legally viable option. President Trump meets with Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings about lower prescription drug prices, 2:30 p.m. Mr. Trump has a busy schedule, but at this point, his meetings are closed. He\u2019ll meet with Laurene Powell Jobs at 11 a.m., host a lunch on infrastructure at 12:30, meet with Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings at 2:30. He\u2019ll see Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Dan Sullivan 4 p.m.; meets with conservative leaders on health care, 5:05 p.m.; has dinner with Ted and Heidi Cruz\u00a0 Two House committees -- Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce -- mark up the Obamacare replacement plan, 10:30 a.m. Ranking Judiciary Committee member Sen. Dianne Feinstein told Rosenstein in the hearing that she wanted to see a special prosecutor appointed, arguing that it would be in the public interest. \u00a0When she asked him whether he would appoint a special prosecutor, he responded that Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch had been faced with a question on appointing a special prosecutor, and she rejected the request. She had confidence in the career attorneys at the Justice Department to look into the matter, he noted. Rosenstein also pointed out that the acting attorney general in the matter, Dana Boente. \u201cHe currently has full authority to appoint one,\u201d and he has not.\u00a0 Asked whether that could be taken as a \u201cno,\u201d Rosenstein said that he\u2019s \u201csimply not in a position to make that decision.\u201d He also said, however, that he doesn\u2019t presume that Lynch and Boente are correct in not appointing a special counsel. If he were to determine they\u2019re wrong, \u201cI would overrule them,\u201d he told the panel. Hawaii is planning a challenge to President Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0revised travel ban.\u00a0 A motion filed in federal court on Tuesday in Honolulu says the state wants to amend its existing lawsuit challenging Mr. Trump\u2019s previous order. \u00a0 After Attorney General Jeff Sessions came under fire\u00a0for not disclosing two election-season meetings\u00a0with the Russian Ambassador -- a move that resulted in his\u00a0recusal from investigations involving the Trump campaign\u00a0and Russian contacts -- Sessions on Monday sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee to update his testimony. Rod Rosenstein says he\u2019s \u201cnot in position\u201d to make decision on special prosecutor yet As he said during a press conference last week, Sessions defended the answers he gave during his Senate confirmation hearing in January, saying he answered the question correctly, as he\u2019d interpreted it. Congressional Democrats,\u00a0mostly. And they want one because they don\u2019t think the Trump administration is capable of investigating itself when it comes to\u00a0President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. \u201cWe need a special prosecutor totally independent of [Attorney General Jeff Sessions],\u201d Elizabeth Warren tweeted last week, after it was revealed that Sessions had an undisclosed meeting with the Russian ambassador before the election. \u201cWe need a real, bipartisan, transparent investigation into Russia.\u201d President Trump\u00a0incorrectly claimed Tuesday\u00a0that 122 Guantanamo Bay detainees who were released under the Obama administration have returned to the battlefield. \u00a0 In defending the\u00a0new Republican plan\u00a0to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz suggested in an interview with CNN on Tuesday that lower-income Americans could face a\u00a0choice between a new iPhone and their health-care insurance.\u00a0 Citing the Kaiser Foundation, host Alisyn Camerota had asked Chaffetz whether it worried him that fewer people would be covered under the Republican bill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday blasted\u00a0House Republicans\u2019 plan to replace Obamacare\u00a0that they rolled out Monday evening. \u201cJust when you\u2019ve seen it all, the Republicans go to a more extreme place. This will make millions of people -- it\u2019s a question of 10, 15, 20 million people off of having health insurance. It will be the biggest transfer of wealth from low-middle income people to wealthy people in our country,\u201d the California Democrat said in an interview on \u201cCBS This Morning.\u201d The measure would still include coverage for preexisting conditions and allow children to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26. Pelosi said that in order to cover preexisting conditions, you have to have a pool of people. President Donald Trump is\u00a0again citing corporate investments planned before he took office\u00a0as evidence that his policies are growing jobs and business. \u201cWe are already winning again, America!\u201d he tweeted Monday after Exxon Mobil announced the latest details of an expansion initiative that actually began in 2013. \u201cBuy American & hire American are the principals at the core of my agenda, which is: JOBS, JOBS, JOBS,\u201d he said in another tweet thanking Exxon Mobil for the announcement. It\u2019s the latest in a string of corporate announcements about jobs and investments that date back to plans companies largely made when Barack Obama was president.",

            "article_content": "Eager for more legislative achievements before Washington's focus shifts to the midterm elections, President Donald Trump plans to open the new year by meeting with Republican congressional leaders to map out the 2018 legislative agenda, the White House told the Associated Press. After returning to Washington from Florida, where he is spending the holidays, Trump will quickly host Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin at the rustic Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains during the weekend of Jan. 6-7, the White House said. A spokesperson for Speaker Ryan confirmed to CBS News that he plans to meet with the President and Majority Leader McConnell early in January to discuss 2018 legislative priorities but defered to the White House for scheduling details.\u00a0 McConnell's office meanwhile deferred to the White House for confirmation.\u00a0 The powwow will follow the recent enactment of legislation to cut taxes, beginning next year, for corporations and individuals at an estimated cost of $1.5 trillion added to the national debt over 10 years. The bill marked the first major legislative achievement of 2017 for Trump and congressional Republicans, who made cutting taxes a must-do this year after the Senate failed to close the deal on another top GOP promise: to repeal and replace the Obama health care law. The tax bill ends the requirement that all Americans buy health insurance or pay a fine, which is a key component of the Affordable Care Act, but leaves intact other features of the health care law. No Democrats voted for the tax bill, which Trump signed at the White House before he flew to Florida on Friday. The agenda for next year is already lengthy, and 2018 is still a few days away. Trump predicted in a tweet earlier this week that Democrats and Republicans will \"eventually come together\" to develop a new health care plan. The president is also forecasting unity between the parties on spending to upgrade aging roads, bridges and other transportation. The White House has said Trump will unveil his long-awaited infrastructure plan in January. Ryan, meanwhile, has talked about overhauling Medicaid and Medicare and other welfare programs, but McConnell has signaled an unwillingness to go that route unless there's Democratic support for any changes. Trump has also said he wants to pursue \"welfare reform\" next year because \"people are taking advantage of the system.\" Congress, meanwhile, will open the year needing to clear a backlog from 2017. The list includes agreeing on a spending bill by Jan. 19 to avert a partial government shutdown and to boost Pentagon spending. Lawmakers also need to agree on billions in additional aid to help hurricane victims, lifting the debt ceiling, extending a children's health insurance program and extending protections for immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children. Trump tweeted earlier in the year that he was ending the program for the immigrants. He gave lawmakers until Jan. 5 to come up with a legislative solution. Much of the work will need to be done before Republicans shift their focus to the midterm elections that take place November 2018 and retaining their House and Senate majorities.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,\u00a0sat down with \"Face the Nation\" Sunday. We got her take on -- among other things -- the status of her party's tax bill, and the Alabama Senate race and the broader conversation about sexual misconduct. \u00a0 What follows is a transcript of the interview, which aired Sunday, December 10, 2017, on \"Face the Nation.\" JOHN DICKERSON: And we want to turn now to Maine's Republican Senator Susan Collins. Welcome, Senator. We have some important tax business to get to. But I want to stay with this question of the revolution that's going on in the way that sexual assault is being dealt with. This week, the Republican National Committee supported Roy Moore. You do not support him. You say you believe his accusers. Your colleague, Republican Ben Sasse, wrote this: \"I believe the women. And the RNC previously did, too. What's changed? Or is the party just indifferent?\" You're a Republican. What do you think about the RNC supporting Roy Moore? SUSAN COLLINS: I'm disappointed that the RNC has resumed its support of Roy Moore. I think that's a mistake. I would point out that I did not support Mr. Moore even prior to these allegations of sexual misconduct because I was concerned about his anti-Muslim comments, his anti-LGBT comments, and also, most important of all, he'd been removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for failure to follow lawful judicial orders. JOHN DICKERSON: You also, with the news about Al Franken this week, you called for him to resign. Are you closer to the Democratic Party on these issues than you are the Republican Party? SUSAN COLLINS: I think Republicans care just as much as Democrats about sexual misconduct and sexual harassment. There's a new awakening in our country that this is pervasive, whether we're talking about Hollywood or Wall Street or the media, or Capitol Hill. And that's why I'm joining a bipartisan group of senators who are trying to look at our own procedures on Capitol Hill to assure that allegations of sexual misconduct involving members or staff are dealt with seriously. JOHN DICKERSON: Last question on this before taxes, on the question of procedures, the Senate might have a decision to make with Roy Moore if he's elected. Here's something I'm trying to work through. With the president, there were these accusations. They were adjudicated in the election, the White House says. So the voters knew about them and they voted for him, and now he's president. Why wouldn't that same standard apply to Roy Moore? The voters of Alabama know exactly what has been alleged. If he gets elected, what business does the Senate have telling the voters they're wrong? SUSAN COLLINS: Well, I think that's the tough question. If the allegations are known prior to the election, which they weren't in the case of Al Franken, for example, then we have a very tough decision to make about whether it's our role as senators to overturn the will of the people. Now, I think it's a different situation if the allegations are not known, or if they occur while the person is sitting in the Senate. JOHN DICKERSON: Right. Let me go on to taxes. You voted for the Senate tax cut bill. But you seem to be having qualms, questions about this conference report. Where are you on things now? SUSAN COLLINS: I always wait until the final version of the bill is brought before us, before I make a final decision on whether or not to support it. There are major differences between the House and Senate bills. And I don't know where the bill is going to come out. I also obviously care very much about amendments that I was successful in getting in the bill that particularly help middle income families. And I'm also concerned about agreements that I have. JOHN DICKERSON: Let me ask you about two of those agreements. One is on Medicare. You've got an agreement from Leader McConnell and Paul Ryan that there would not be these automatic Medicare cuts afterwards. Paul Ryan seemed to suggest maybe he wasn't a party to that agreement. What's the- Where do things stand on that agreement? SUSAN COLLINS: I have written correspondence that memorializes the agreement that the 4% cut in Medicare that could go into effect will not go into effect. I would point out that that law has been waived 16 times. It has never been implemented. But I don't want seniors to have the anxiety of wondering whether the tax bill somehow is going to trigger a cut in Medicare. I'm absolutely confident. I have it in writing, a statement by both Mitch McConnell and Speaker Ryan. JOHN DICKERSON: The waiving of the so-called PAYGO Rules. Let me ask you about seniors and seniors in Maine. The other thing you got a commitment on, as I understand it, is that there would be legislation that would come up before the end of the year dealing with these cost-sharing payments. There's a piece of legislation sponsored by Alexander and Murray. What's happening with that? Because in the House, Republicans are being told, \"Nah, that's not going to be a part of anything before the end of the year,\" which means, without those cost-sharing payments, premiums are going up for Maine seniors. SUSAN COLLINS: I've had a lot of conversations not only with my colleagues in the Senate, but with my colleagues on the House side, and with the White House. I've talked to the president three times about this issue. And once again, I have no reason to believe that that commitment will not be kept. After all, who wants to see health insurance premiums become more unaffordable than they already are for individuals who are buying insurance in the individual market? And our two bills, this one that I have with Bill Nelson, and the Alexander Murray bill, will exert downward pressure on premiums and make it more affordable. JOHN DICKERSON: There is one critique of that, though, that your legislation helped the condition before this tax bill, which has the removal of that individual mandate. And that, basically, these fixes won't be enough for those people who will see higher premium increases. SUSAN COLLINS: We have brand new study that just came out last week by Avalere, a respected consulting firm, that says it will more than offset the repeal of the individual mandate. And keep in mind that the individual mandate fines fall disproportionately on low and middle income families. 80% of those fines are paid by families who make less than $50,000 a year. JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Senator, I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there. Thank you so much for being with us. SUSAN COLLINS: Thank you, John.",

            "article_content": "The GOP House proposal for the biggest overhaul in the US tax code in some 30 years has been out for barely a day, but already it's being dissected to find the winners and losers. One of the winners most analyses have pointed to are people who earn their money via so-called pass-through businesses, such as sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies (LLC) and S-corporations.\u00a0 Most business in the US are organized as one of these entities. According to the Brookings Institution, about 95 percent of businesses fall into that category.\u00a0 The Republicans' pro-business tax legislation includes a potentially valuable break for these business' and their owners. Here's what you need to know. Income earned by a business organized as a pass-through entity must be distributed as taxable income to its owner, members or partners. The pass-through entity itself doesn't pay income taxes, but it also can't defer tax on profits to be used later to reinvest in the business. Instead, all of its income is distributed each year to the individuals who own the pass-through entity, and they must pay tax on the profits.\u00a0 Their tax rate is based on their personal income tax rates (currently ranging from 10 percent to 39.6 percent), Social Security and Medicare taxes (as high as 15.3 percent), the net investment income tax (3.8 percent on income over $200,000 as part of the Affordable Care Act) and unemployment taxes.  Without accounting for state income taxes, the combined top marginal rate for income earned by a pass-through business owner can be as high as 46.2 percent. According to an Overview of Pass-Through Business in the U.S. by the Tax Foundation, the majority of pass-through business income is taxed at the top individual tax rates.  C-corporations, which differ from pass-throughs, are allowed several tax advantages, which include the ability to pay a lower tax rate on profits and even defer taxes on profits, which can then be used to reinvest into the business. When distributed to shareholders, C-corp profits are subject to a corporate tax rate, ranging from 15 percent to 35 percent. The House tax plan\u00a0includes cutting this maximum tax rate to 20 percent. \u00a0 To address the disparity between the taxation of income earned by pass-throughs and C-corps, the tax plan includes a new tax rate of 25 percent for \"pass-through business income.\" This provision would allow pass-through businesses to characterize a portion of their income as \"profit\" and not \"salary.\"  The 25 percent tax rate would apply only to the \"profit income\" that's distributed to the pass-through business owners. The \"salary income\" that's distributed would still be subject to personal income tax rates. To prevent people from abusing this lower tax rate (by declaring all their business income as profit and none as salary), the provision includes a few limits. First, the income earned by professional services providers, such as doctors, lawyers, accountants and others wouldn't qualify for the lower tax rate.  Other business owners could choose one of two options to take advantage of the new lower rate on some of their income:  Another tax benefit of characterizing some of the income distributed by a pass-through business as profit income is the additional savings of the self-employment tax on that portion of income. A tax savings would be created because you pay self-employment tax only on your salary income and not on business profit income.  Most small-business owners use the popular LLC entity. To take advantage of this new lower pass-through rate, the LLC owner must make an S-corp tax election by notifying the IRS. Then the LLC owner can distribute a portion of the business income as a reasonable salary and a portion can be retained and distributed at year-end as business income.\u00a0 Certain timelines govern when an S-corp tax election can be made. Also, when paying yourself a salary, you're required to file additional returns for payroll on a quarterly basis.  You should know that setting up an LLC entails additional costs and filings to maintain it each year. Those costs should be compared to the possible tax savings. Also know that this strategy can increase the risk getting audited by the IRS. As you might guess, you should consult a professional tax adviser to determine if an LLC is right for you.

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi warned Monday that the Senate GOP health care bill that could be voted on later this week would be extremely harmful to Americans who rely on their health insurance.  In an interview on \"CBS This Morning,\" the California Democrat said while the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has not yet released its cost estimate of the measure, she can already predict one major effect.  \"We do know that many more people, hundreds of thousands of people, will die if this bill passes,\" Pelosi said.  Pelosi, 77, said there's no room to fix the legislation and instead Democrats and Republicans should focus on improving Obamacare, \"instead of sabotaging it,\" she said.  \"These bills, systemically, structurally, they are very, very harmful to the American people,\" she said. \"They will raise costs, with fewer benefits, have an age tax...they will undermine Medicare, they will throw millions of people, tens of millions of people, off.\"  Democrats, she said, have to \"fight for our lives and the lives of many people\" in the U.S. this week to defeat the Senate bill.\u00a0 Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has been aiming to hold a vote on it before lawmakers leave Washington later this week for their week-long July 4 recess, but as of Monday, leadership appears to be falling short in securing enough support.  Meanwhile, Pelosi dismissed calls by a select few House Democrats who said last week that she should step aside from her leadership position in the wake of two more special election losses last week.  \"I've always had a challenge in the caucus right from the start,\" she said.  Pelosi said that there are 70 House races that are \"easier for us\" than any of the special election races they've lost since November's election. She explained why she should stay.  \"I'm a master legislator,\" she said. \"I'm experienced in terms of knowing the institutional memory of the Congress.

            "article_content": "Is Steven Mnuchin,\u00a0 the Treasury secretary-designate, a heretic? In his Senate confirmation hearing last week, he laid out positions that don\u2019t quite jibe with Republican orthodoxy. And when it comes to the strength of the dollar, he differed from his boss, Donald Trump. President Trump won the election by refusing to follow the budgetary constraints at the core of GOP principles. For instance, he wants to launch a costly infrastructure building campaign and resists whittling down even more expensive old-age entitlement programs, namely Social Security and Medicare. By the same token, Mnuchin showed the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday that he split from fellow Republicans on a host of issues in the economic and financial realm. These ranged from the Volcker Rule -- prohibiting banks\u2019 from using their own accounts for risky investments, a ban many in the GOP believe is too stringent -- to supporting the housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\u00a0 While the odds favor Mnuchin\u2019s bid to become the nation\u2019s economic suzerain, in light of the Republicans\u2019 Senate majority, he does face staunch Democratic resistance. He ran into controversy when it emerged he hadn\u2019t disclosed to Congress some $100 million in real estate holdings he owned in an offshore account. Senate Democrats have also set up a website soliciting stories from homeowners who were foreclosed upon by the bank Mnuchin took over in the wake of the financial crisis, Indy Mac, now known as OneWest.  No one expects Republican senators to break ranks and vote against Mnuchin. As investment bank FBR wrote in a research note, \u201cOverall, given his performance, we believe Mnuchin is likely to be confirmed.\u201d And where the former Goldman Sachs (GS) partner disagrees with Mr. Trump, it\u2019s wise to remember that some of the new president\u2019s ideas are far from chiseled in granite. Mnuchin\u2019s remarks may be an effort, whether deliberate or not, to temper the president\u2019s off-the-cuff expressions.  Of course, Mnuchin is far from alone in setting out a differing viewpoint from the president. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, the Trump appointee as attorney general, took issue at his confirmation hearing with the president\u2019s desires to ban Muslims from entering the country.  Here are four key areas where Mnuchin strikes out into his own territory: 1. The dollar. Treasury secretaries traditionally promote a strong dollar, which is wonderful for Americans buying abroad but not for U.S. exporters. That\u2019s because foreign competitors can underprice them. Mr. Trump has termed the dollar as \u201ctoo strong.\u201d The greenback has risen 9.3 percent against a basket of other currencies since June, and 3.5 percent since Election Day. \u201cThe long-term strength -- over long periods of time -- is important,\u201d Mnuchin said, noting that this owes to the relative robustness of the U.S. economy, compared to much of the rest of the world. Plus, inflation has ticked up a bit in America, also helping prop up the buck. \u201cAs long as Trump\u2019s policies remain on track and the U.S. economy continues to perform well, reflationary impulses should push the dollar higher despite rhetoric from the administration,\u201d Morgan Stanley analysts pointed out in a research note. Mnuchin, who has a long background as a financier, surely knows that the U.S. these days refrains from intervening in foreign exchange markets -- unlike the Chinese, who regularly buy and sell dollars to control the value of their currency, the yuan.  And besides, his voice won\u2019t be the loudest on the currency front: Wilbur Ross at the Commerce Department, Robert Lighthizer as the U.S. Trade Representative and Peter Navarro at the new White House National Trade Council will be prominent on the dollar question. Nevertheless, Wall Street and financial centers around the world take a Treasury secretary\u2019s pronouncements very seriously. And this cabinet post has long been regarded as the chief defender of the dollar. In 1985, Secretary James Baker was the leader in crafting the Plaza Accord: He put together a consortium of other major powers to push down the surging dollar, which was harming the U.S.\u2019s export effort and stirring protectionist sentiment.  2. Volcker Rule. Reining in banks\u2019 desires to magnify their earnings using derivatives, exotic mortgage-based vehicles and other non-vanilla investments is supposed to safeguard the nation from another financial crisis. The last one was sparked when the housing market collapse toppled a row of dominos that almost crushed many major financial institutions.  \u201cI do support the Volcker Rule,\u201d Mnuchin told senators, saying there had to be clear lines between what was and was not proprietary trading -- banks\u2019 using their own funds.  Republicans in Congress, led by House Financial Services committee head Jeb Hensarling of Texas, have largely opposed the rule. It\u2019s named after its originator, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, and was enacted in 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank law. They believe it thwarts banks\u2019 legitimate need to hedge day-to-day activities and maintain liquidity, meaning their ability to turn investments into cash quickly to meet current requirements. 3. Glass-Steagall resumption.\u00a0This Depression-era law was axed in 1999. It prohibited commercial banks from also acting as investment bankers, such as underwriting stocks. To Republicans, who hate the Volcker Rule and the rest of Dodd-Frank, it seemed to be a good substitute, one that Democrats don\u2019t own.\u00a0 The trouble is that it would mandate the dismemberment of large entities like Citicorp (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). For that reason, Mnuchin said, \u201cI don\u2019t support going back to Glass-Steagall as is.\u201d He contended that Glass-Steagall is a \u201cvery old law\u201d and resurrecting it today would \u201chave very big implications to liquidity and capital markets.\u201d Instead, Mnuchin called for a \u201c21st Century Glass-Steagall,\u201d but didn\u2019t sketch out details.  4. Keeping Fannie and Freddie. The two government-run housing giants are anathema to many Capitol Hill Republicans. They used to be privately run, but Washington took them over during the financial crisis. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac package mortgages into bonds, which eases the flow of housing credit. The House GOP especially wants abolish them or at least severely cut them back.  Mnuchin said he wanted to keep them because they serve a vital function. At the same time, he doesn\u2019t want to restore them to their status as independent bodies.  All in all, \u00a0and ironically given Mr. Trump\u2019s anti-Washington bent, the Treasury secretary-designate has shown he has what Beltway insiders prize -- flexibility and nimbleness in his views.

When he does, he will be eligible for his pension.\u00a0 The only way a member of Congress can lose his or her pension is if he or she committed a felony while in office, meaning Franken \u2014 along with other members departing Congress like Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan \u2014 can still collect those retirement benefits, as CBS Minnesota noted earlier this month.\u00a0 CBS Minnesota pointed to a new Congressional Research Service report that says members are eligible for that pension at age 62, if they have served for five or more years. Franken is 66 and joined the Senate in 2009 after his 2008 election, meaning he will have spent nine years in the Senate by the time he departs. That may not be long by Senate standards, but it's long enough to qualify for a pension. Franken came to the Senate under the newer of two pension plans \u2014 the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), offered to House and Senate members elected after 1984. FERS, unlike the earlier Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), is intended to supplement Social Security retirement benefits.\u00a0 How much Franken or any other member receives depends on length of service and a percentage of the average of the three highest years of pay. The average federal pension for members under the CSRS plan is more than $74,000 a year and under the FERS plan is $41,000 per year, according to the CRS report.\u00a0 Senators who aren't in leadership, like Franken, currently earn $174,000. Considering Franken's relatively short Senate tenure, he should only receive $26,622 per year, according to the equation provided by CRS \u2014 average of the top three years of pay, multiplied by years of service, multiplied by .017. Had Franken retired in December, he would have only technically served eight years, and thus, received about $3,000 less per year \u2014 $23,664. It's not likely he was sticking around for the money, however. The former SNL star and comedian had an estimated net worth of $8.7 million in 2015, according to Senate financial disclosure documents on OpenSecrets.org Franken's office told CBS Minnesota his health care is covered under Medicare.\u00a0",

            "article_content": "ATLANTA \u2013 Making her first high-profile foray into the Southern black church, California Sen. Kamala Harris told a Georgia congregation founded by former freed slaves that the United States remains wracked by racism, sexism and other forms of discrimination that flout the nation's core values. But the rising Democratic Party star added that Americans aren't as split as \"forces of hate and division\" suggest. \"I believe it is time we replace the divide-and-conquer,\" she said from the pulpit of First Congregational Church in downtown Atlanta. \"I've come up with an equation: diversity plus commonality equals unity.\" A 52-year-old, first-term senator widely mentioned as a potential national candidate, Harris did not mention President Donald Trump in her remarks. Yet her approach highlights a complex political task for Democrats as they try to counter Trump's economic appeals to working-class whites, while honoring their core supporters among nonwhites, to rebuild the electoral coalitions that twice elected President Barack Obama. And the choice of venue \u2014 a congregation that includes business, civic and political players in Atlanta's black community \u2014 also nods to a Democratic constituency that helped sway the party's last two presidential nominating battles. Harris's future prospects dominated her appearance as the invited keynote for the 150th anniversary of First Congregational Church's founding. Introducing Harris, church member and personal friend of the senator Eugene Duffy called the occasion \"a day of projection and reflection.\" At the word \"projection,\" Duffy pointed at the senator. Duffy also dispensed with Harris's avoidance of lambasting the Trump administration, praising her for her aggressive questioning of \"that white supremacist Jeff Sessions,\" the nation's attorney general. He said Harris \"pulled (Sessions') sheet off\" at hearings on Capitol Hill. Harris smiled but did not clap as did many congregants as Duffy blasted Sessions. From the pulpit, Harris criticized \"the attorney general,\" without naming Sessions, for renewing the push for harsher sentences in nonviolent drug crimes and for rolling back some of policing overhauls from the Obama administration. A former local prosecutor and California attorney general who opposes the death penalty, Harris says she advocates a criminal justice system that honors \"the concept of redemption.\" Separately, Harris called for a more effective U.S. response to hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico. She did not mention health care. She's recently signed on as a co-sponsor of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare-for-all\" bill. Harris does not publicly embrace speculation about 2020 intentions. Her calendar is noticeably devoid of visits to the early nominating states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. But she's also met in recent months with key Democratic donors and hired aides who worked for 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. And her path to the Democratic nomination would certainly run through voters like those she addressed Sunday in Atlanta. Obama in 2008 and Clinton in 2016 each lost the cumulative white vote in Democratic primary states, according to exit polls, but both of the eventual nominees won black voters overwhelmingly, propelling them to key victories in Southern states that gave them early delegate leads they never relinquished.",

            "article_content": "Don't make things worse. That's the advice of former U.S. health secretaries of both parties to President Donald Trump and the GOP-led Congress, now that \"Obamacare\" seems here for the foreseeable future. The 2018 sign-up season for subsidized private health plans starts Nov. 1, with about 10 million people currently served through HealthCare.gov and its state counterparts. Stability should be the immediate goal, said former Health and Human Services secretaries Kathleen Sebelius, Mike Leavitt and Tommy Thompson. At minimum: Dispel the political and legal uncertainty \u2014 fueled by presidential tweets \u2014 around billions in subsidies for consumers' insurance copays and deductibles. The three former officials shared their views with The Associated Press. Beyond the urgent need to calm markets by providing clarity on subsidies, Democrat Sebelius and Republicans Leavitt and Thompson differ on the direction Mr. Trump and Congress should take. They agree that Republicans still have an opportunity to put their stamp on the Affordable Care Act, even if the drive to \"repeal and replace\" former President Barack Obama's legacy program appears to have hit a dead end. \"They can make changes that signal a new ideological direction without generating a logistical and political mess,\" said Leavitt, who led HHS during former President George W. Bush's second term. \"They won the right to make changes. However, they should do it in a skillful way.\" Leavitt shepherded the Medicare prescription drug benefit through its rocky rollout in 2006. \"Stabilizing the current situation can only \u2014 I think \u2014 be to their benefit,\" Sebelius said of the Trump administration. \"In an environment in which (insurance) companies are enrolling customers, they've got a lot of time to actually go back to the drawing board and figure this out. The worst of all worlds for them would be to have the current situation unravel because of decisions by this administration.\" Sebelius helped steer Obama's law through Congress and later oversaw the troubled launch of HealthCare.gov, when the computer system locked up on the first day of sign-up season, frustrating millions of consumers and embarrassing the White House. She took the heat, but Sebelius stayed on task and ultimately helped deliver a successful open enrollment. \"It would be a mistake to further destabilize the (insurance) market,\" said Thompson, who served during Bush's first term and led HHS preparations to meet the bioterrorism threat after the deadly anthrax mailings that followed closely the Sept. 11 attacks. Thompson urged a health care summit between Mr. Trump and congressional leaders of both parties, followed by a period of intensive legislative work under a deadline to reach a truce in the political battle over health care. Mr. Trump and top lieutenants like HHS Secretary Tom Price have sent mixed signals. Leading congressional Republicans want to try to move limited legislation after lawmakers return next month, worried they'll suffer consequences in next year's midterm elections. At the very least such legislation would provide clear legal authority for the ACA's cost-sharing subsidies, which reduce copays and deductibles for people with modest incomes. Stopping the payments would lead to a spike in premiums, more insurers leaving the markets and increased federal deficits, the Congressional Budget Office warned last week. The markets already saw steep premium increases this year, and more insurers have since bailed out, citing financial losses. The administration has continued to make monthly subsidy payments to insurers, as recently as last week. But Mr. Trump on Twitter and in interviews has repeatedly threatened to pull the plug. Sebelius has been sharply critical of the Trump administration's stewardship of the ACA. Two of the former health secretaries \u2014 Leavitt and Sebelius \u2014 said states are now likely to assume a bigger role in shaping the future of Obama's law. A waiver pathway for states was built into the law, and Republicans want to make it less restrictive. That's a key focus for Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Chairman Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., as he plans bipartisan hearings this fall with Democratic counterpart Patty Murray of Washington. Leavitt sees waivers as a way to provide states more flexibility to tailor their insurance market rules to local needs and preferences. Sebelius says that should not be done in a way that undermines federal consumer protections like standard benefits. She'd like to see states use waivers to help offset the cost of care for the sickest patients. Thompson says he believes a bigger deal, at the federal level, is still possible if Mr. Trump plays his cards right with Congress. Former HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell, who served during most of Obama's second term, declined interview requests.",

            "article_content": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico --\u00a0Puerto Ricans got the chance Sunday to tell the U.S. Congress which political status they want for a U.S. territory mired in an economic crisis that has triggered an exodus of islanders to the mainland.\u00a0 Congress has final say over whether to approve the outcome of the referendum that offers voters three choices: statehood, free association/independence or the current territorial status.  Statehood supporters were expected to dominate the vote because three parties that favor other options were boycotting, including the island's main opposition party.  Among those hoping Puerto Rico will become the 51st state is Ana Maria Garcia, a 52-year-old business administrator who arrived with her family on bicycle to vote early Sunday.  \"Puerto Rico would benefit greatly from being a state right now given the crisis,\" she said. \"It would offer stability.\"\u00a0 Many believe the island's territorial status has contributed to its 10-year economic recession, which was largely sparked by decades of heavy borrowing and the elimination of federal tax incentives. \u00a0\u00a0 Puerto Rico is exempt from the U.S. federal income tax, but it still pays Social Security and Medicare and local taxes and receives less federal funding than U.S. states.\u00a0 The referendum coincides with the 100th anniversary of the United States granting U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans, though they are barred from voting in presidential elections and have only one congressional representative with limited voting powers.  \"I believe in the principle of equality,\" said Moraima Mendez, an attorney who studied in Indiana and voted for statehood. \"I want to stand eye-to-eye with the U.S. .... I want everyone here to have everything I had over there.\"  Nearly half a million Puerto Ricans have moved to the U.S. mainland in the past decade to find a more affordable cost of living or jobs as the island of 3.4 million people struggles with a 12 percent unemployment rate.  Those who remain behind have been hit with new taxes and higher utility bills on an island where food is 22 percent more expensive than the U.S. mainland and public services are 64 percent more expensive.  Those who oppose statehood worry the island will lose its cultural identity and warn that Puerto Rico will struggle even more financially because it will be forced to pay millions of dollars in federal taxes.  \"The cost of statehood on the pocketbook of every citizen, every business, every industry will be devastating,\" Carlos Delegado, secretary of the opposition Popular Democratic Party, told The Associated Press. \"Whatever we might receive in additional federal funds will be cancelled by the amount of taxes the island will have to pay.\"  His party also has noted that the U.S. Justice Department has not backed the referendum.\u00a0 A department spokesman told the AP that the agency has not reviewed or approved the ballot's language. Federal officials in April rejected an original version, in part because it did not offer the territory's current status as an option. The administration of Gov. Ricardo Rossello added it and sent the ballot back for review, but the department said it needed more time and asked that the vote be postponed, which it wasn't.  Sunday's referendum is the fifth for Puerto Rico.  No clear majority emerged in the first three referendums, with voters almost evenly divided between statehood and the status quo. During the last referendum in 2012, 54 percent said they wanted a status change. Sixty-one percent who answered a second question said they favored statehood, but nearly half a million voters left that question blank, leading many to claim the results weren't legitimate.  Some statehood supporters on Sunday expressed dismay that certain voting centers appeared empty.  \"We are worse off than I thought, in the sense that we don't give a damn what happens to this island,\" said Jose Miranda, a retired TV and radio producer who lived 30 years in the U.S. mainland and is returning because he believes life is better over there.  He also criticized austerity measures including imposing new taxes to help turn around the island's economy.  \"That's a pipe dream,\" he said. \"What we need here is a radical change.\"\u00a0",

Three quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (74 percent) prefer small government while 65 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents prefer bigger government. The ideological gap has not been this large since October 2008, just prior to the election of former President Barack Obama.  The survey also shows increased public support for government spending within 14 programs, which is up from 2013 when more people were concerned about a federal budget deficit. A few of these programs include education, infrastructure spending, Medicare and health care, scientific research and military defense. The majority of Americans now say they would rather maintain or increase spending across the 14 program areas included in the survey. Support for increased or maintained funding was most popular with veteran benefits, with only 3 percent of respondents saying they would decrease funding in this area. Support for increased spending was least popular with regard to unemployment benefits and international assistance to those in need.

            "article_content": "On Tuesday night, President Donald Trump will address a joint session of Congress for the first time. For a country still suffering from bitter political divisions after a contentious election, it\u2019s doubtful his speech will heal still-raw emotions. Especially since Mr. Trump has hinted that he\u2019ll discuss his budget plan, including a big statement on infrastructure spending and sharp cuts to federal agencies.  No matter what you think of President Trump -- whether you see him as a buffoon, a wannabe despot or the savior who\u2019ll finally Make America Great Again -- here\u2019s one big reason you should have some sympathy for him: He faces the worst fiscal outlook of any recent president. He has taken office with the national debt nearing $20 trillion and debt held by the public above $14 trillion. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB), debt is at a higher levels as a share of the economy than for any incoming president since Harry Truman in 1945 (chart below). Yet unlike Truman, who was handed an economy demobilizing from the fight against the Japan and Nazi Germany, the national debt is expected to continue to rise during Trump\u2019s presidency and beyond. Moreover, federal spending on entitlements and interest payments represents a larger share of the budget than under any other president, leaving Mr. Trump with far less room on the \u201cdiscretionary\u201d side of the budget. Adding a sense of urgency to all of this, three federal trust funds -- covering highways, Social Security Disability and Medicare Hospital Insurance -- are headed for insolvency over the next eight years, with a fourth set for depletion in 2030 (Social Security Old-Age Trust). That complicates the tax reform effort the president championed on the campaign trail and touted again recently, saying his tax plan would be something \u201cphenomenal,\u201d with details to come within weeks. What we already know: Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress want a simplification of the tax code and a cut in overall tax rates for households and corporations. A tax cut will surely worsen the deficit over the near term. Yet it could also be necessary for invigorating the economy and quickening the growth needed to fix the long-term fiscal outlook. However, the efficacy of a tax cut providing fiscal stimulus is a matter of intense debate, to put it lightly, with economists evenly split on the subject according to a recent survey.  For Mr. Trump, perhaps the only way out of this fiscal bind is by worsening it temporarily, mixing a well-designed tax reduction and reform plan with targeted spending cuts and entitlement reform. No easy task. But a survey of the literature, including this 2014 paper from the Brookings Institution, suggests benefits can result from simplifying the tax code, lowering rates, and cutting \u201cunproductive\u201d federal spending.  According to Deutsche Bank economist Joseph LaVorgna, although the current economic expansion has been feeble and is now in its eighth year, there \u201cremains considerable room for cyclical gains in consumption.\u201d\u00a0 With the unemployment rate below 5 percent, LaVorgna doesn\u2019t believe job growth alone can do the trick. But a combination of personal tax cuts and wage inflation -- driven by corporate tax reforms like full expensing that encourages capital spending and labor productivity gains -- could do it. LaVorgna is more optimistic than others, including the CRFB, which warns that the economy can\u2019t sustain the 3.5 percent annual GDP growth Mr. Trump needs to pay for his tax plan and bring the deficit down. The debate will surely flare up anew on Wednesday morning following the president\u2019s speech. And with the statutory federal debt limit approaching sometime in March, the need to do something about the fiscal mess will grow increasingly acute very quickly.

The latter looks like the more attractive option by the day: The bill, as crafted, is bad politics and, more importantly, bad policy. Republican opposition in Congress could sink it. The critiques from right-leaning policy mandarins like Phillip Klein and Avik Roy have been devastating. Over at Bloomberg, Megan McArdle makes a compelling conservative case for why Ryan\u2019s plan is worse than Obamacare. \u201cThe incentives intended to keep the individual market sustainable were already failing, and the Republican plan weakens them still further,\u201d she writes.  The Kochs don\u2019t want it; Heritage and Cato and all the Big Conservative think-tanks and action groups don\u2019t want it. Ditto the AARP and the American Medical Association, not to mention every left-leaning policy shop. It seems that just about everyone who knows anything about health care policy in America, with the exception of Dr. Price, thinks this plan is nothing short of awful.  There\u2019s a scenario where the Ryan bill triumphs anyway, one in which tea-party conservatives, deciding they fear the White House more than the Kochs, decide to drop their opposition and let the plan pass the House. That still leaves the Senate, but if Trump should somehow strong-arm this turkey through all of Congress, he\u2019ll get some applause from pundits for his ability to do so.  But what then? Say Trump passes this thing, this dud, larded-up with Ryan\u2019s tax cuts for the wealthy \u2013 what does he get then? Another unloved insurance regime, that\u2019s what, which will need its own painful rescuing soon enough.  So why doesn\u2019t Trump just ditch the Ryan plan? Yes, it will cause some embarrassment now that he has sent his surrogates out to say he supports it. And Ryan, of course, will be apoplectic. But if Trump is going to be a successful president, he\u2019s going to need to relearn why he was elected in the first place. Hint: It wasn\u2019t to make Paul Ryan happy.  The sweet spot for Trump politically is embracing an economic agenda that\u2019s a bit left-of-center while governing as a cultural conservative. That is, in so many words, the disruptive message that carried him through the Republican primaries and the general election.  And this is where Trump will still have to part ways with the conservative orthodoxy surrounding health care and its fetish for \u201cfree market\u201d solutions. Trump was, after all, the fist major Republican politician to figure out that GOP voters like big government, and that there is no constituency for Medicare reform. His political instincts are shrewd, which makes it hard to believe he\u2019ll keep pushing a bill that hurts voters in the counties that voted for him disproportionately.  From a purely political standpoint, the biggest problem with Ryan\u2019s plan is not that it\u2019s too left, as the conservative wonks insist, but that it\u2019s not left enough. Why should a health care plan, as Ryan\u2019s does, include tax cuts for the wealthy anyway?  On an instinctual level, it\u2019s hard not to have the feeling that Trump intuits all this. In the Republican debates, he often spoke approvingly of the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, a view no doubt informed by conversations on his Scotland golf course. #NeverTrump conservatives may have hated it when he would insist he would not let Americans \u201cdie on the streets,\u201d but Republican voters sure didn\u2019t seem to mind.  Steve Bannon almost certainly understands all this as well, what with his big government dreams of a new New Deal and reindustrialization. According to reports this week, Bannon is very upset with Breitbart News, which he used to run, for coming out swinging against the Ryan plan. But you don\u2019t really need to know all that much about Bannon or Breitbart to suspect that Bannon isn\u2019t all that upset with the blowback. There is simply no way that this administration, with its competing fiefdoms, is fully on board with the Ryan plan.  In reality, it would not be that hard for Trump to quietly pull back support for the bill, either in private or in public, and watch it die. He could go out tomorrow and say that, on second thought, given the complexity of this process, it would be better to start from scratch. He could tell his voters that while he may not always be right, he\u2019s always looking out for them, and any bill that hurts them won\u2019t get his signature.  But then there\u2019d be chaos! Well, sure, but chaos is where we are already, and voters will forgive it in the early days. We\u2019re a long way from the 2018 midterms; a reversal by the president at this stage would be forgiven, if not forgotten entirely, by then. However, if Trump and the GOP push through the Ryan plan, which neglects the real problems of Obamacare in order to ensure a new round of tax cuts for the rich, they will be rightly punished by voters. \u00a0 So ditch the bill, Mr. President. Cobble together a new one. Pull together the voices that were shut out from the creation of this one and find something that respects public opinion in a country that may not love its government, but is awfully dependent on public services.  Perhaps that will require stalling on health care for a bit and moving on to other priorities, such as infrastructure or combatting the opioid crisis. Fine. It\u2019s far better, politically and morally, for the White House to buy itself some time rather than to rush another bad health care bill through.\u00a0 Will Rahn is a political correspondent and managing director, politics, for CBS News Digital.",

Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearings to be the next Supreme Court justice begin today with opening statements by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as by Gorsuch. As the hearings kick off, we\u2019ve got a refresher on what you need to know about Gorsuch. Concern is growing over a bill that would let companies request genetic testing and effectively charge employees more for health insurance if they refuse. The bill aims to clarify rules for workplace wellness programs but, as we hear, some say it would effectively amount to a penalty for privacy. As a Republican bill to repeal and replace Obamacare hits the House floor, older Americans may want to brace themselves. Experts say health care consumers aged 50 to 64 -- old enough to have serious health care needs but too young for Medicare -- may well see a significant increase in costs.  Although the U.S. economy is on the mend, millions of American families remain financially vulnerable to sudden swings in income that can make it hard to deal with an emergency expense. But how much money should people have stashed away to ensure they can cope with the unexpected? \u00a0 The Clintons, America\u2019s foremost would-be presidential dynasty, are apparently sticking around. Chelsea Clinton has new children\u2019s book in the works, called \u201cShe Persisted.\u201d Hillary persists as well, saying last week that she wants to \u201ccome out of the woods\u201d and rejoin public life.

            "article_content": "The Senate on Thursday confirmed Rep. Mick Mulvaney to serve as President Trump\u2019s director of the Office of Management and Budget.  The South Carolina Republican was narrowly confirmed in a 51-49 vote.  This comes a few weeks after he testified at his confirmation hearing where he argued that significant changes needed to be made to entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, putting him at odds with the president who campaigned on preserving those programs. During the hearing, Mulvaney also said that tax increases would be an option under the Trump administration despite Mr. Trump vowing during his election race to cut taxes. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, was the sole Republican who opposed Mulvaney\u2019s nomination because of his advocacy for budget cuts to the military. McCain serves as the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  \u201cIn 2013, Congressman Mulvaney succeeded in passing an amendment to cut $3.5 billion from the defense appropriations bill. His website featured an article touting the achievement. But when asked about that vote during his confirmation hearing, Congressman Mulvaney said he didn\u2019t remember that amendment. I think anyone who treats our national defense with the seriousness it deserves would remember a vote like that,\u201d McCain said on the Senate floor Wednesday.  No Democrat or independent senator voted in favor of his nomination Thursday.  As OMB director, Mulvaney will be charged with overseeing government spending, which Mr. Trump has said he\u2019d like to increase for at least defense programs.

            "article_content": "NEW YORK --\u00a0President Donald Trump and Republicans have vowed to repeal\u00a0the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. But Obamacare is still available, and the deadline for enrolling for coverage or changing an existing health care plan -- Jan. 31 -- is fast approaching.\u00a0 More than 20 million people have gained coverage since the health care law passed in 2010, bringing the nation\u2019s uninsured rate to a historic low of around 9 percent. In addition to subsidized private insurance, the law offers an option to expand Medicaid for low-income people. About\u00a0half of the U.S. population is covered through employer-based insurance, while another 35 percent receive coverage through Medicaid and Medicare. The rest need to sign up before the deadline -- or risk facing fees for not being covered. The deadline to sign up for 2017 coverage is Tuesday, Jan. 31. After that, enrollment is only allowed under special circumstances, such as a loss of insurance coverage during the year due to losing your job.\u00a0 Coverage for those who sign up by the Jan. 31 deadline starts on March 1, 2017. There are four ways to apply for coverage. One option is to apply online by visiting\u00a0www.healthcare.gov and following instructions from there. You can also start by creating an account at https://www.healthcare.gov/create-account, or by logging in to healthcare.gov at https://www.healthcare.gov/login if you already have an account and are looking renew or change plans. A second option is to apply by phone by calling the Marketplace Call Center at 1-800-318-2596 (TTY: 1-855-889-4325). The call center is available 24 hours a day every day of the week, except for Memorial Day, July 4th, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. A third way to apply is with in-person help -- people in your area can assist you in filling out an application and enrolling. For this option, visit https://localhelp.healthcare.gov/#intro and enter your zip code to find out the next steps. If you enter a New York State zip code, for example, the healthcare.gov website will redirect you to the New York State of Health website, where you can find information about speaking with someone locally. A fourth option is to mail a paper application. Applications can be downloaded\u00a0here, and instructions are available\u00a0here. When you apply for coverage, you will need to provide information such as your income, current health coverage, address and birth date. Healthcare.gov offers a checklist of the information you will need when applying. Those who need help with applications should visit healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596 (TTY: 1-855-889-4325).\u00a0 If you haven\u2019t yet signed up for insurance, you may soon be getting a note from the taxman -- or may have already gotten one,\u00a0according to the Associated Press. About 800,000 letters from the IRS to taxpayers went out after Thanksgiving, and another 6.7 million were going out in mid-January, congressional aides said. \u00a0 The letters had reminders for taxpayers: They could face fines if they don\u2019t have health insurance in 2017. \u201cMost people who don\u2019t have qualifying health coverage must either pay a\u00a0fee\u00a0or qualify for an \u2018exemption,\u2019\u201d healthcare.gov says. \u201cHealth coverage exemptions are available for a variety of reasons: certain life events, health coverage or financial status, group membership, and more. If you qualify, you don\u2019t have to pay the penalty for the months you were uncovered and the exemption applies.\u201d You can visit healthcare.gov to find out if you qualify for an exemption. If you don\u2019t quality, you may have to pay fees for any month that you or your spouse, or tax dependents, don\u2019t have coverage. Details on fees are available at \u00a0https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/. You can select different levels of coverage with different premiums and deductibles to suit your health care needs and your budget. Options are explained on the healthcare.gov website.   Costs are rising this year. Premiums for middle-of-the-pack plans were expected to\u00a0increase an average of 25 percent\u00a0across the 39 states using the Affordable Care Act\u2019s federal insurance marketplace for 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services said in October. For those who are due to renew their coverage plans, one way to protect from premium increases could be to shop around and switch plans.\u00a0 Others may qualify for subsidies. Subsidies are available only for individuals and families who make less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level. For a family of four, that threshold is $97,200, while for an individual the cutoff is $47,520.\u00a0 Signups for 2017 skyrocketed after Donald Trump was elected president. More than 100,000 people signed up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act on Nov. 9, which was the day after Election Day and nine days after Open Enrollment for 2017 started on Nov. 1.\u00a0 Through Dec. 24,\u00a0some 11.5 million people had signed up nationwide. That amounted to 290,000 more than at the same time during the 2016 enrollment season. The Obama administration\u2019s goal was to have 13.8 million enrolled for 2017. It is not yet clear if that goal will be met, the Associated Press reports. This week,\u00a0the Trump administration said it was pulling back advertising to promote HealthCare.gov as open enrollment draws to a close.\u00a0 The Health and Human Services Department said in a statement Thursday that the government has withdrawn about $5 million in ads as part of an effort to cut costs. The statement said HHS has already spent more than $60 million to promote sign-ups this year under former President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law.\u00a0 Former Obama officials immediately accused the new administration of \u201csabotage.\u201d  Some methods of outreach regarding coverage, however, were continuing. On Friday, for example, Healthcare.gov tweeted about the looming enrollment deadline. \u00a0 Open enrollment ends in a couple days. #GetCovered for 2017! https://t.co/gy7nWbLSe4 pic.twitter.com/KKhe5K4dmu",
